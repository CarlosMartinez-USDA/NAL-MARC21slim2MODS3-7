Improving salt tolerance in rice is a key to expanding the available area for its growth and thus improving global food security. Seed priming with salt (halopriming) can enhance plant growth and decrease saline intolerance under salt stress conditions during the subsequent seedling stage. However, there is little known about rice defense mechanisms against salinity at seedling stages after seed halopriming treatment. This study focused on the effect of seed halopriming treatment on salinity tolerance in a susceptible cultivar, IR 64, a resistant cultivar, Pokkali, and two pigmented rice cultivars, Merah Kalimantan Selatan (Merah Kalsel) and Cempo Ireng Pendek (CI Pendek). We grew these cultivars in hydroponic culture, with and without halopriming at the seed stage, under either non-salt or salt stress conditions during the seedling stage. RESULTS: The SES scoring assessment showed that the level of salinity tolerance in susceptible cultivar, IR 64, and moderate cultivar, Merah Kalsel, improved after seed halopriming treatment. Furthermore, seed halopriming improved the growth performance of IR 64 and Merah Kalsel rice seedlings. Quantitative PCR revealed that seed halopriming induced expression of the OsNHX1 and OsHKT1 genes in susceptible rice cultivar, IR 64 and Merah Kalsel thereby increasing the level of resistance to salinity. The expression levels of OsSOS1 and OsHKT1 genes in resistant cultivar, Pokkali, also increased but there was no affect on the level of salinity tolerance. On the contrary, seed halopriming decreased the expression level of OsSOS1 genes in pigmented rice cultivar, CI Pendek, but did not affect the level of salinity tolerance. The transporter gene expression induction significantly improved salinity tolerance in salinity-susceptible rice, IR 64, and moderately tolerant rice cultivar, Merah Kalsel. Induction of expression of the OsNHX1 and OsHKT1 genes in susceptible rice, IR 64, after halopriming seed treatment balances the osmotic pressure and prevents the accumulation of toxic concentrations of Na⁺, resulting in tolerance to salinity stress. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that seed halopriming can improve salinity tolerance of salinity-susceptible and moderately tolerant rice cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data  a140/UN1/DITLIT/DIT-LIT/LT/2018cKementerian Riset, Teknologi dan Pendidikan Tinggi  a2127/UN1/DITLIT/DIT-LIT/LT/2019cUniversitas Gadjah Mada  a407/Kpts/KP.320/H.1/5/2019cBalai Besar Penelitian dan Pengembangan Bioteknologi dan Sumber Daya Genetik Pertanian 3aBorneo 3acultivars 3afood security 3agene expression 3agrowth performance 3ahydroponics 3aosmotic pressure 3aplant growth 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arice 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseedlings 3atoxicity1 aNisak, Rizka Rohmatin1 aSusanto, Febri Adi1 aNuringtyas, Tri Rini1 aYamaguchi, Nobutoshi1 aPurwestri, Yekti Asih1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7032-92530 tBotanical studies.g2022 Dec., v. 63, no. 1 p.24-24dSpringer Nature SingaporewJournal:22891x1999-31107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40529-022-00354-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02148naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245006000161300001600221500001900237520102400256592002801280650001701308650001101325650003201336650001601368650001701384650002001401650001101421650001601432650001101448650001701459650003301476700005901509773011401568856008301682852000901765655001201774IND60708324320221119055031.0201221e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070832432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cois.2020.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Sali10aFates of dietary sterols in the insect alimentary canal  ap. 106-111.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSterols serve structural and physiological roles in insects. However, insects and other arthropods have lost many genes in the sterol biosynthesis pathway, so they must acquire sterols from their food. Sterols occur naturally as free (unconjugated) molecules, and as conjugated ones (mostly steryl esters). Once sterols are ingested and make their way into the gut, steryl esters can be converted into free sterols by Magro protein, a lipase excreted by enterocytes. Sterols in the free form enter midgut enterocytes through NPC1b and are then transported to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum membrane for possible metabolism. For most insect herbivores, phytosterol dealkylation converts plant sterols into cholesterol. Some ingested sterols may also be consumed by microbiota dwelling inside the insect gut lumen; bacteria use sterols as a source of carbon and energy. Further studies will reveal interesting and exciting discoveries regarding the pathways for the dietary sterols entering the insect alimentary canal.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acholesterol 3adealkylation 3adigestive tract 3aenergy 3aenterocytes 3amidgut 3aphytosterols 3asmooth endoplasmic reticulum1 aJing, Xiangfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1680-98460 tCurrent opinion in insect science.g2020 Oct., v. 41 p.106-111dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23301x2214-57457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cois.2020.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010000166300001500266520107900281592002801360650001801388650001801406650001501424650001301439651001601452653002201468653003101490653003001521653001401551653001601565653002201581653001401603700002801617700001501645773011101660856008101771852000901852655001201861IND60601321020221119123406.0180706e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060132102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2013.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbáñez, J.J.10aDiscriminating wild vs domestic cereal harvesting micropolish through laser confocal microscopy  ap. 96-103.  aThough it is well established that cereal domestication took place in the Near East, between 10,000 and 7000 cal BC., there are still many open questions about when, where and how this process took place. As one way to advance these questions, we propose focusing on the use-wear analysis of sickle elements. Wild cereals must be harvested before the complete maturation of the plant, while domestic cereals are harvested ripe. This difference in the degree in humidity when harvesting provokes differences in the characteristics of the use-wear polish. In this paper we measure both types of use-wear polish in experimental tools through laser confocal microscopy. Later, the discriminant function which distinguishes both types of use-wear polishes is used to classify four archaeological sickle elements from Late PPNB, Middle PPNB, PPNA and Natufian archaeological levels. Preliminary results show that the classification of the archaeological sickle elements according to the wild/semi-green vs domestic/ripe experimental tools is coherent with archaeobotanical data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeobotany 3adomestication 3aharvesting 3ahumidity 3aMiddle East 0aUse wear analysis 0aMicropolish quantification 0aLaser confocal microscopy 0aNeolithic 0aAgriculture 0aCereal harvesting 0aNear East1 aGonzález-Urquijo, J.E.1 aGibaja, J.0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2014 Aug., v. 48 p.96-103dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2013.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02079naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245007200167300001400239500002900253520109100282592002801373650002701401650001601428650001401444650001301458650001201471650001201483700002601495700002801521773011201549856008301661852000901744655001201753IND60708324420221119055023.0210121e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070832442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cois.2020.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSane, Sanjay P10aInsect architecture: structural diversity and behavioral principles  ap. 39-46.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aInsects build myriad structures out of diverse materials. These structures serve purposes that range from facilitating prey capture to housing their entire colony. Whereas some insects operate solitarily, others collectively build large and complex structures. The architecture of these structures vis-à-vis their ultimate function poses fascinating questions that require multidisciplinary investigations. Importantly, because the underlying design and architectural principles have evolved over millions of years to withstand multitude of environmental perturbations, they offer important lessons for human-made structures. The vast variety of insect-built structures reflects how diverse insects have adapted to resolve the ecological challenges in their specific habitats. Here, we survey insect-built structures from a comparative perspective to ask what design and architectural principles can be gleaned from them. We discuss the key hypotheses about building-behaviours, their neural underpinnings, the functional role of insect-built structures and their biomimetic potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3abiomimetics 3abuildings 3ahabitats 3ainsects 3asurveys1 aRamaswamy, Sree Subha1 aRaja, Sreekrishna Varma0 tCurrent opinion in insect science.g2020 Dec., v. 42 p.39-46dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23301x2214-57457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cois.2020.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245006500173300001600238520199900254592002802253650001402281650002002295650001602315650002002331650001802351650001502369650001702384650001902401650001402420650001902434650002002453650000902473650002202482651001002504653002302514653001902537653001802556700002002574700002202594700001702616700002502633700002202658773008802680856008702768852000902855655001202864IND60625854120221119190252.0181218e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062585412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anaerobe.2018.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsumoto, Asami10aCharacterization of the vaginal microbiota of Japanese women  ap. 172-177.  aThe composition of vaginal microbiota changes throughout life in response to health status, sexual activity, and pregnancy. Here the constitution of the vaginal microbiota among non-pregnant women, pregnant woman, and commercial sex workers (CSWs) in Japan were compared. Vaginal samples were obtained from 54 women between January 2014 and February 2015 and the microbiota of each was analyzed by 16S metagenomics as well as cluster and diversity analyses to identify differences. In addition, vaginal Lactobacillus spp. were isolated for comparison. Furthermore, data regarding the use of ritodrine hydrochloride by pregnant women was collected from medical charts. The vaginal microbiota were clustered into three groups. Group 1 was most often dominated by Lactobacillus spp., whereas groups 2 and 3 included not only Lactobacillus spp. but also Bifidobacterium, Atopobium, Prevotella, and Gardnerella spp., in addition to a few other taxa. In non-pregnant women, the proportions of microbes in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 31.8%, 36.4%, and 31.8%, respectively. In pregnant women, the abundance of group 1 microbes was notably greater than that of groups 2 and 3 (66.7% vs. 12.5% and 20.8%, respectively). In CSWs, the prevalence of group 3 microbes was far greater than that of group 1 (87.5% vs. 12.5%, respectively). The alpha diversity of non-pregnant women was significantly greater than that of pregnant women. The detection rate of live Lactobacillus spp. in CSWs was lower than in pregnant and non-pregnant women (25% vs. 50% and 68.2%, respectively). The vaginal microbiota of most pregnant women (60%) who received ritodrine hydrochloride was not dominated by Lactobacillus spp. These results suggest that there were clear differences in the colonization rate of Lactobacillus spp. among non-pregnant, pregnant, and CSW women groups. In addition, the dominance of Lactobacillus may influence the risk of preterm birth among women who received ritodrine hydrochloride during pregnancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAtopobium 3aBifidobacterium 3aGardnerella 3aJapanese people 3aLactobacillus 3aPrevotella 3ametagenomics 3amicroorganisms 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3apremature birth 3arisk 3aspecies diversity 3aJapan 0aVaginal microbiota 0a16S metagenome 0aLactobacillus1 aYamagishi, Yuka1 aMiyamoto, Kentaro1 aOka, Kentaro1 aTakahashi, Motomichi1 aMikamo, Hiroshige0 tAnaerobe.g2018 Dec., v. 54 p.172-177dElsevier LtdwJournal:12008x1075-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2018.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012900164300001100293520215400304592002802458650001602486650001702502650002402519650002002543650001702563650001102580650002302591650001902614650002202633650001602655650001802671651001002689700001602699700001302715700001302728700001502741773015602756856008302912852000902995655001203004IND60784477120221119111817.0221004e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078447712DNAL7 a10.1186/s40538-022-00313-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wende10aSpatial heterogeneity analysis and source identification of heavy metals in soil: a case study of Chongqing, Southwest China  ap. 50.  aBACKGROUND: Heavy metal pollution in urban soil is an important indicator of environmental pollution. Selecting the best interpolation method can accurately reflect the distribution characteristics of heavy metals in soil. In addition, source analysis can reveal heavy metal pollution of soil and help manage and protect the soil environment. This study used a uniform sampling method and obtained a total of 342 sampling points. After acid reduction, the concentration of As, Cu, and Mn in each sample was determined by ICP-MS (Agilent VISTA, USA). The accuracy and results of different spatial interpolation methods were compared and the CATREG model was used to identify the sources of heavy metal pollution. RESULTS: The average concentration of As, Cu, and Mn were 5.802 mg kg ⁻¹, 23.992 mg kg⁻¹, and 573.316 mg kg⁻¹, respectively, lower than the soil background value of Chongqing. Compared to other Chinese cities and countries in the world, the concentration of As and Cu was lower in Chongqing, while the concentration of only Mn was higher. The interpolation results of inverse distance weighting (IDW) and radial basis function (RBF) largely retained the maximum information of element concentration. Soil source identification found that population density mainly affected Cu (0.539), slope Mn (0.206), and water quality As (0.453). The highest hotspot value (99% confidence interval), high hotspot value (95% confidence interval), and high hotspot value (90% confidence interval) of As were adjacent to the secondary water environment. Furthermore, the highest hotspot value of Cu was mainly located in the surrounding areas with population density > 3000/km² and 1000–3000/km². Mn was distributed along the slope direction and diffused from center to periphery. CONCLUSIONS: Different spatial interpolation methods are significant for the analysis of soil properties. Heavy metals have a high degree of coincidence with environmental factors such as slope and population. The results of this research provide a reference for formulating effective control and management strategies for heavy metal pollution of soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3acase studies 3aconfidence interval 3aedaphic factors 3aheavy metals 3amodels 3apopulation density 3asoil pollution 3aspatial variation 3aurban soils 3awater quality 3aChina1 aCai, Yankun1 aZhu, Kun1 aWei, Jun1 aLu, Yutian0 tChemical and biological technologies in agriculture.g2022 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.50-50dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:27327x2196-56417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40538-022-00313-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03777naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245016400157500002000321520233900341592002802680650003402708650002202742650002502764650001202789650002702801650001102828650000902839650001102848650002002859650001602879650001502895650002402910650003502934650002102969650001502990650001203005651001003017700001603027700001703043700001803060773015403078856007803232852000903310655001203319IND60611744020221123032512.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061174402DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2018001512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Pan10aComparison of Different Processing Methods of Iron Walnut Oils (Juglans sigillata): Lipid Yield, Lipid Compositions, Minor Components, and Antioxidant Capacity  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA comparison study is performed on different processing methods of iron walnut oils (Juglans sigillata). Processing methods here include cold‐pressing (CP), roasting‐pressing (RP), n‐hexane extraction (HE), subcritical butane extraction (SBE), and supercritical carbon dioxide extraction. The lipid yield, physicochemical properties, lipid compositions, minor components, and antioxidant capacity of iron walnut oils are analyzed. Different processing methods do not affect the fatty acid compositions and triacylglycerol compositions of iron walnut oil. The lipid yields of pressing process (42.63–44.12%) is lower than that of the extraction process (48.13–63.44%). By multiple linear regression analysis, the results about the correlation between minor components and antioxidant capacity show that the RP process with high number of polyphenols (52.91 mg kg⁻¹) indicates the highest antioxidant activity (DPPH: 574.73, FRAP: 111.80, ABTS: 498.53, ORAC: 523.34 µmol TE kg⁻¹, respectively). Considering health and nutritional value of oil, RP can be a promising method for future iron walnut oil processing. Practical Applications: Iron walnut (Juglans sigillata) is a special walnut variety in China. In this study, five different processing methods of iron walnut oil are evaluated. The new iron walnut oil processing method is beneficial to the development of iron walnut oil. The authors show that lipid composition of tested oils is relatively stable, while their minor components contents are significantly different. Oil antioxidant capacity is mainly related to polyphenols. Roasting‐pressing can obviously improve the antioxidant activity of the iron walnut oil. This information has important directive to the nutritional value and industrial production of iron walnut oil. Iron walnut oil is obtained from Juglans sigillata by different processing methods, including cold‐pressing, roasting‐pressing, n‐hexane extraction, subcritical butane extraction, and supercritical carbon dioxide extraction. The lipid yield, physicochemical properties, lipid compositions, minor components, and antioxidant capacity (DPPH, FRAP, ABTS, and ORAC) are analyzed. Models deduced by multiple linear regression are recognized as acceptable for predicting the antioxidant capacity of the iron walnut oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aJuglans sigillata 3aantioxidant activity 3abutanes 3afatty acid composition 3ahexane 3airon 3amodels 3anutritive value 3apolyphenols 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3atriacylglycerols 3awalnut oil 3awalnuts 3aChina1 aLiu, Ruijie1 aJin, Qingzhe1 aWang, Xingguo0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2018 Sept., v. 120, no. 9 p.e1800151-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3921629x1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.2018001513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245010700205300001100312520207400323592002802397650001602425650002802441650001202469650002302481650004302504650002202547650002402569650000902593650001602602650001402618700002102632773009902653856008302752852000902835655001202844IND60784477320221119111930.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078447732DNAL7 a10.1186/s40795-022-00568-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMustafa, Akif1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7917-892210aAssociation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D and Triglycerides-Glucose index among Indian adolescents  ap. 69.  aBACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency has been found to associated with numerous skeletal and non-skeletal diseases including Diabetes Mellitus. Insulin Resistance (IR) is considered as one of the primary reasons of Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The association between vitamin D deficiency and IR has been extensively explore in previous studies, but none of them focused on Indian adolescents, and none of them used the TyG index as IR marker. Hence, this population-based cross-sectional study investigates the relationship between insulin resistance (IR) assessed using the Triglycerides Glucose Index (TyG index) and vitamin D measured by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D (25(OH)D). METHODS: For this study, we utilized data from the Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS, 2016–18). The study is based on a sample size of 10,167 adolescents aged 10–19 years. The TyG index cut-off value of 4.65 was used to classify IR. We examined associations between the TyG index and serum 25(OH)D using multiple linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders. Odds of Insulin Resistance among vitamin D deficient/insufficient adolescents were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: A significant negative association was found between serum 25(OH)D and the TyG index, where a 10% increase in serum 25(OH)D was associated with 0.56 (95% CI = -0.67, -0.45) unit decrement in the TyG index. The odds of having IR were 90% higher among vitamin D deficient adolescents (OR: 1.90; 95% CI = 1.62—2.23) compared to adolescents with adequate levels of vitamin D. The association between vitamin D deficiency and IR was independent of sex; in other words, the association between vitamin D and IR was significant in both the sexes. CONCLUSION: Independent of sex, this study found a significant inverse association between vitamin D and insulin resistance in Indian adolescents. The findings of this study highlight the utility of TyG index and the importance of vitamin D in lowering the risk of T2DM in future generations of the country.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3across-sectional studies 3aglucose 3ainsulin resistance 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutrition surveys 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asample size 3avitamin D1 aShekhar, Chander0 tBMC nutrition.g2022 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.69-69dBioMed CentralwJournal:27315x2055-09287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40795-022-00568-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013400173300001600307520198100323592002802304650002402332650002502356650000902381650001302390650001102403650001802414650001302432650001202445650001302457650002002470650001602490650001302506650001202519650001302531651001802544651001802562653001802580653002902598653002402627653001202651653001402663653002402677700002102701773010302722856008602825852000902911655001202920IND60541063620221123025216.0190318e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054106362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2014.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBradburn, Mark J.10aImpact of light on catch rate of four demersal fish species during the 2009–2010 U.S. west coast groundfish bottom trawl survey  ap. 193-200.  aTo determine the influence of light on catch of demersal fish, we examined the relationship between near-bottom light levels, catch rates, and catch probability for four abundant groundfish species well represented in annual bottom trawl surveys on the U.S. west coast: arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), greenstriped rockfish (Sebastes elongatus), longnose skate (Raja rhina), and Pacific hake (Merluccius productus). Relative downward irradiance was measured with MK-9 archival tags during annual trawl surveys along the U.S. west coast in 2009 and 2010. Near-bottom light levels were recorded for 818 hauls at depths less than 400m. Significant linear relationships were observed between catch per unit effort (CPUE, kgha−1) and near-bottom light (P<0.05). CPUE of arrowtooth flounder, longnose skate, and Pacific hake was negatively related to near-bottom light. For these species, CPUE decreased 16–22% per unit increase in log10 light (μEm−2s−1). CPUE of greenstriped rockfish increased 39% per unit increase in log10 light. Light, depth, and latitude explained 15–47% of the variance in CPUE for the four species. Catch probability was significantly related to light, depth, latitude, and relative time of day (P<0.05). For all species, catch probability varied inversely with light when depth was less than 200m. At depths of 200–300m, catch probability increased with light for arrowtooth flounder and greenstriped rockfish. Catch probability for Pacific hake decreased slightly at depths greater than 200m while longnose skate was relatively unaffected by light at these depths. We used these relationships to explain the variability in catch rates for individual species within bottom trawl surveys. By influencing the density and distribution of these groundfish species, light can alter catch rates. Furthermore, we found possible herding of greenstriped rockfish, and trawl avoidance by arrowtooth flounder, Pacific hake, and longnose skate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAtheresthes stomias 3aMerluccius productus 3aRaja 3aSebastes 3acoasts 3ademersal fish 3aflounder 3aherding 3alatitude 3alight intensity 3aprobability 3arockfish 3asurveys 3avariance 3aPacific Ocean 3aUnited States 0aDemersal fish 0aNear-bottom light-levels 0aCapture probability 0aHerding 0aAvoidance 0aBottom trawl survey1 aKeller, Aimee A.0 tFisheries research.g2015 Apr., v. 164 p.193-200dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2014.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245019200166520111200358592002801470650002101498650002001519650002001539650002101559650002101580650002801601650001701629650002201646650002601668650001501694650001401709650001601723653003301739653002101772653004701793653001601840653003101856700001801887700001801905700001701923700001701940700001701957700001301974700001501987700005502002773012502057856008302182852000902265655001202274IND60762361120221121200852.0220205e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076236112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2022.1043862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Peihong10aPolyethylenimine-carbon nanotubes composite as an electrochemical sensing platform for sensitive and selective detection of toxic rhodamine B in soft drinks and chilli-containing products  aRhodamine B (RhB) is a toxic and carcinogenic additive that was once overused in foodstuffs. Its quick detection and monitoring are vital to human health and various food chains. Hereby for the first time, the polyethylenimine and multi-walled carbon nanotubes composite modified glassy carbon electrode (MWCNTs-PEI/GCE) was employed to determine RhB. The MWCNTs-PEI was prepared by sonicating the mixture of MWCNTs and PEI solution and characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Compared with single material modified electrodes, the electrochemical response of RhB was enhanced at the MWCNTs-PEI/GCE because of the synergistic effect of the composite. To improve the sensitivity of the determination, the experimental conditions were optimized, and the calibration curve of quantitative determination was obtained by second-order derivative linear scan voltammetry (SDLSV). Under the optimum conditions, the proposed method showed a good linear range (0.01−10 μM) and a low detection limit (6.0 nM), and the method can be employed to determine RhB in food samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3acarcinogenicity 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3afood composition 3aglassy carbon electrode 3ahuman health 3apolyethyleneimine 3aquantitative analysis 3arhodamines 3asynergism 3avoltammetry 0aMulti-walled carbon nanotube 0aPolyethylenimine 0aSecond derivative linear sweep voltammetry 0aRhodamine B 0aVoltammetric determination1 aXiao, Jingyun1 aChen, Jiaxing1 aFeng, Jinxia1 aWei, Yanping1 aZuo, Jinsong1 aLiu, Jun1 aLi, Junhua1 aHe, Quanguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9849-79530 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2022 Apr., v. 107 p.104386-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2022.1043863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014300164500001900307520155400326592002801880650001701908650001401925650001401939650001901953650001301972650002301985650002102008650002302029651001002052653001302062653002302075653002102098653001002119653001202129700001502141700001402156700001602170700001602186700001602202700001702218700001402235700001702249700001602266700001602282773010102298856008302399852000902482655001202491IND60708324820221119055144.0201104e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070832482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejrh.2020.1007242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrishan, G.10aIdentifying the seasonal variability in source of groundwater salinization using deuterium excess- a case study from Mewat, Haryana, India  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMewat (renamed as Nuh) district of Haryana, India having geographical area of 1507 km², comes under semi arid climatic conditions and Aravali hill ranges separates it from Rajasthan state.Groundwater salinization is an emerging threat to water management. Understanding the sources of salinization, and their relative contributions by different sources and seasonal variability has become priority for planning best practices in water management and suggesting remedial measures. For identifying the sources of salinization, the direct application of the relationship between δ¹⁸O and δD is limited as it depends upon initial isotopic composition showing no isotopic variation in the mineral dissolution process. The present study advocates the use of deuterium excess which is independent of initial isotopic composition and extends this concept for identifying the relative contribution of different sources towards seasonal variability in salinization.The district showed an average salinity of 6.7 g/L in pre-monsoon; 7.3 g/L in monsoon and 7.4 g/L in post-monsoon season thus a variability of 0.7 g/L observed. The area affected by the salinization (>2 g/L) also registers an increase from 86 % (pre-monsoon) to 99 % (post-monsoon) period. Mineral dissolution is found to be responsible for overall groundwater salinization with contribution of 97 %, declined to 86 % in post monsoon. In post monsoon season, contributions from initial salinity and evapoconcentration towards salinization increased by 8% and 3%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adeuterium 3ahydrology 3amonsoon season 3asalinity 3aseasonal variation 3awater management 3awater salinization 3aIndia 0ad-Excess 0aSalinity mechanism 0aSeasonal changes 0aMewat 0aHaryana1 aPrasad, G.1 aAñjalī,1 aKumar, C.P.1 aPatidar, N.1 aYadav, B.K.1 aKansal, M.L.1 aSingh, S.1 aSharma, L.M.1 aBradley, A.1 aVerma, S.K.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 Oct., v. 31 p.100724-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23229x2214-58187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2020.1007243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01913naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245009200177300001400269520099200283592002801275650001101303650001301314650001201327650001001339700002001349700001901369700001701388773007301405856008901478990002301567852000901590655001201599IND60096011820221121022901.0141104e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009601182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2012.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAktaş, Alaattin,10aInvestigation of knitting architecture on the impact behavior of glass/epoxy composites  ap. 81-90.  aIn this study, the effect of impact and post-impact behavior of E-glass/epoxy composite plates having different knitted fabrics were investigated by considering energy profile diagram and the related load–deflection curves.

Plasma HFABP, N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) and serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels were measured in 21 control dogs, 23 dogs with MVD and 13 dogs with DCM, with repeated sampling at 1 and 3 months after initial presentation. All dogs were followed up after 6 and 12 months to verify survival.Heart-fatty acid binding protein concentrations were significantly higher in dogs with MVD and DCM than controls at initial presentation, and after 1 month in dogs with MVD. For dogs with DCM, a significant reduction in HFABP levels over time was observed. Comparing ACVIM stages, highest HFABP concentrations were detected in ACVIM stage C dogs compared to stage B, with the lowest levels seen in controls, and a reduction over time in stage C dogs was present. Similarly, cTnI concentrations were higher in DCM and stage C in comparison to control dogs and reduced over time, while NTproBNP concentrations were only higher in diseased dogs at 1 month. Heart-fatty acid binding protein and cTnI levels at initial presentation and ACVIM disease stage were independent predictors of survival in a univariate analysis. The elevation of HFABP in dogs with MVD and DCM in comparison to controls, its association with disease severity, and its potential in predicting reduced survival, suggest that HFABP might be useful as marker for canine MVD and DCM.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding proteins 3ablood serum 3abrain 3acardiomyopathy 3adisease severity 3adogs 3anatriuretic peptides 3aprediction 3atroponin I 0aAcquired canine cardiac disease 0aCardiac biomarker 0aDog 0aHeart failure 0aTroponin I1 aCasamian-Sorrosal, D.1 aMonteith, G.1 aFonfara, S.0 tveterinary journal.g2019 Feb., v. 244 p.16-22dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2018.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012900170300001600299520168200315592002801997650001302025650002602038650001202064650001202076650001602088650001002104650001502114650001002129650001902139650000902158651001602167651001302183700002002196700002002216700001802236700001902254700002402273773008802297856008602385852000902471655001202480IND60089104420221118050046.0141102e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008910442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.01.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJugder, Dulam10aDust, biomass burning smoke, and anthropogenic aerosol detected by polarization-sensitive Mie lidar measurements in Mongolia  ap. 231-241.  aPolarization-sensitive Mie-scattering lidars were installed for dust storm monitoring at Sainshand and Zamyn-Uud in the Gobi Desert and at the Mongolian capital city of Ulaanbaatar in 2007. We studied the temporal and spatial distributions and transportation of dust, elevated dust, biomass burning smoke, and anthropogenic aerosol by using lidar measurements from the end of 2007 to the first half of 2010. The study results show that the maximum height of dust layers over the Gobi Desert of Mongolia during dust event periods varied from 0.5 to 5.5 km above the ground level (AGL). The 95th percentile level of dust vertical distribution was found at 4 and 4.5 km for Zamyn-Uud and Sainshand, respectively. The averaged maximum height of dust layers during dust events was 2.0–2.2 km AGL at those Gobi sites. The lidar measurements also revealed transport of dust layers elevated in the atmosphere. Base heights of elevated dust layers varied from 0.5 to 2.5 km AGL, while maximum heights from 2.5 to 4.5 km AGL. Backward air trajectory analyses suggested source areas of the elevated dust that transported from other source regions to southeastern Mongolia. A detail study was conducted of the dust event in 19–20 May 2008. Hourly maximum dust concentrations of PM₁₀ (PM₂.₅) reached 1139–1409 (384–404) μg m⁻³ during the dust event episode. Dust concentration of PM₁₀ had high correlations with visibilities. Threshold winds for dust emission were determined at Sainshand and Zamyn-Uud. The lidar measurements at the three sites detected vertical profiles of biomass burning smoke and anthropogenic aerosol with top heights of 3–4 km AGL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abiomass 3aburning 3adust storms 3alidar 3amonitoring 3asmoke 3atransportation 3awind 3aGobi Desert 3aMongolia1 aSugimoto, Nobuo1 aShinoda, Masato1 aKimura, Reiji1 aMatsui, Ichiro1 aNishikawa, Masataka0 tAtmospheric environment.g2012 July, v. 54 p.231-241dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.01.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245016000210520135700370592002801727650003501755650002101790650002101811650001701832650002401849650002101873650001401894650000901908650001501917650002701932650001301959653001801972653001901990653002902009653001802038653003302056653003102089700002102120700002502141773012502166856008302291852000902374655001202383IND60762361320221121200917.0220205e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076236132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2022.1043882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLondonio, Agustín1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6552-681010aSimultaneous on-line preconcentration and determination of toxic elements in rice and rice-based products by SPE–ICP–MS: Multiple response optimization  aSimultaneous preconcentration of five toxic elements (Cd, Hg, Mn, Pb, and Sb) was carried out using a hyphenated system by on-line coupling of flow injection (FI), solid phase extraction (SPE) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP–MS). The analytes were simultaneously preconcentrated on a microcolumn filled with oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (ox-MWCNTs). During the method development, SPE conditions were optimized using a chemometric approach with experimental design and desirability function by multi-response surface methodology. An enrichment factor of 104 was obtained when 50 mL of sample were passed through the microcolumn. After optimizing the FI–SPE–ICP–MS system, detection limits were calculated varying from 0.8 ng L⁻¹ for Mn to 0.09 μg L⁻¹ for Hg. The relative standard deviations (RSD) for all elements were < 5%. For checking accuracy two standard reference materials NIST1568b (Rice Flour) and NIST 1643f (Trace Elements in Water) were analyzed and results were in good agreement with certified values. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of Cd, Hg, Mn, Pb and Sb in real samples of rice and rice-based products. The concentration of the analytes spanned in the range (ng g⁻¹): Cd, 0.18–23.5; Hg, <4.6-6.0; Mn, <0.04–744; Pb, <0.16–462 and Sb, 5.9–47.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acarbon nanotubes 3achemical species 3achemometrics 3aexperimental design 3afood composition 3aoxidation 3arice 3arice flour 3asolid phase extraction 3atoxicity 0aFood analysis 0aToxic elements 0aOn-line preconcentration 0aFI-SPE-ICP-MS 0aMultiwalled carbon nanotubes 0aMultiresponse optimization1 aMorzan, Ezequiel1 aSmichowski, Patricia0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2022 Apr., v. 107 p.104388-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2022.1043883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04102naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015400170506010400324506007600428520230000504592002802804506003702832650001102869650002202880650001302902650001202915650001502927650002102942650002602963650001302989650001803002650001803020650001403038650002503052650000903077650001503086651002203101653001903123653001503142653002603157653002403183653002203207700001203229700001703241700001603258700001703274700001903291700001303310700001403323773010403337856008603441852000903527655001203536IND60787469720221207065739.0220830e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078746972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2022.1067652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLa Marca, E.C.10aImplementation of artificial substrates for Dendropoma cristatum (Biondi 1859) reef restoration: Testing different materials and topographic designs.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVermetid reefs are intertidal key habitats that strongly increase the biological and ecological value of the coastal ecosystems, providing ecological goods and services. In some parts of the Mediterranean Sea, this habitat is experiencing an increasing decline, due to environmental and anthropogenic pressures and the lack of officially coordinated strategies promoting its conservation at the basin scale. Moreover, experimental data testing for vermetid reef restoration is presently scant. Here we tested the potential to achieve new vermetid colonies on engineered substrates, aiming for their further transplantation to depleted reefs for restoration purposes. We investigated in the field the settlement rate of the central-Mediterranean vermetid species Dendropoma cristatum on artificial tiles made of different concrete mixtures (geopolymer concrete, pozzolanic concrete mixed with fine sand, magnesian concrete, pozzolanic concrete mixed with magnesium and coarse sand) and one plastic material (expanded polyvinyl chloride), engineered with a range of interstice shapes and sizes (i.e., holes and crevices of 1 and 2 mm), obtaining on each tile four different topographic designs. Also, the benthic fauna colonization on these engineered tiles has been monitored. While the material typology had a relative effect on the settlement of D. cristatum, the presence of specific topographic designs played an important role, not only for the reef-builder species but also for the benthic fauna. A significantly higher vermetid density and invertebrate taxonomic richness and individual abundance were associated with the hole presence on the tiles, confirming to be the preferred interstice type among those texted. Furthermore, geopolymer concrete was the material that showed higher resistance to the intertidal conditions and durability after the experiment. The production of geopolymer tiles engineered with hole interstices may be a valid option for future studies aiming at the restoration of this intertidal key habitat. However, while our achievements correspond to a higher vermetid and benthic invertebrate settlement within a few weeks of field experiment, post-settlement processes need to be considered in the perspective to restore the functionality of a degraded reef.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abasins 3abenthic organisms 3aconcrete 3adecline 3adurability 3aecological value 3afield experimentation 3ahabitats 3ainvertebrates 3alittoral zone 3amagnesium 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3asand 3atopography 3aMediterranean Sea 0aBiogenic reefs 0aSettlement 0aArtificial substrates 0aRestoration ecology 0aMediterranean Sea1 aApe, F.1 aMartinez, M.1 aRinaldi, A.1 aMontalto, V.1 aScicchigno, E.1 aDini, E.1 aMirto, S.0 tEcological engineering.g2022 Oct., v. 183 p.106765-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2022.1067653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245013600162520103500298592002801333650002301361650000901384650002601393650002101419650001001440650002001450650001401470650001101484650001201495650002201507650002801529650001801557653002401575653001801599653001101617653000801628653001101636653000801647700005401655700001601709700001701725700001501742700001401757700001701771700005801788773012401846856008301970852000902053655001202062IND60762361520221121105550.0220307e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076236152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2022.1043962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xijun10aIdentification of olive oil in vegetable blend oil by one-dimensional convolutional neural network combined with Raman spectroscopy  aVegetable blend oil is popular because it has more balanced nutrients, which also provides a target for fraud. In this paper, One-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN), support vector machine (SVM) and improved partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) combined with Raman spectroscopy were used to identify corn olive blend oil, peanut olive blend oil and corn peanut olive blend oil. The overall performance of 1D CNN model based on 500 Raman spectral data of three types of vegetable blend oil is significantly higher than that of SVM and PLS-DA. By comparing the changing trend of loss curve before and after data preprocessing, it is proved that the data preprocessing process can accelerate the convergence speed of 1D CNN model. Finally, partial least squares regression (PLSR) model was established to identify the content of olive oil in vegetable blend oil. The results show that 1D CNN combined with Raman spectroscopy has great application potential in the field of vegetable oil identification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acorn 3adiscriminant analysis 3afood composition 3afraud 3aneural networks 3aolive oil 3aolives 3apeanuts 3aspectral analysis 3asupport vector machines 3avegetable oil 0aVegetable blend oil 0aRaman spectra 0a1D CNN 0aSVM 0aPLS-DA 0aPLS1 aGao, Shibo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8618-46961 aNiu, Yudong1 aZhao, Zhilei1 aXu, Baoran1 aMa, Renqi1 aLiu, Hailong1 aZhang, Yungang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8467-55200 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2022 May, v. 108 p.104396-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2022.1043963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03309naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245019800168500002200366520158400388592002801972650002002000650001202020650001302032650000902045650001502054650001102069650002302080650001702103650000902120650001202129650001402141650001002155650000902165650001802174650001902192650001202211650001602223650000902239651001302248653002102261653001802282653001602300653001102316653001602327700002402343700001902367700001902386700002502405700002302430700002802453700002402481700002502505773008402530856008402614852000902698655001202707IND60572986820221119062027.0170720s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057298682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.06.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiller, Edgar10aOccurrence of selected trace metals and their oral bioaccessibility in urban soils of kindergartens and parks in Bratislava (Slovak Republic) as evaluated by simple in vitro digestion procedure  aPre-press version  aA total of eighty surface soil samples were collected from public kindergartens and urban parks in the city of Bratislava, and the <150 μm soil fraction was evaluated for total concentrations of five metals, Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn, their oral bioaccessibilities, non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks to children, and lead isotopic composition. The mean metal concentrations in urban soils (0.29, 36.1, 0.13, 30.9 and 113mg/kg for Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn, respectively) were about two times higher compared with background soil concentrations. The order of bioaccessible metal fractions determined by Simple Bioaccessibility Extraction Test was: Pb (59.9%) > Cu (43.8%) > Cd (40.8%) > Zn (33.6%) > Hg (12.8%). Variations in the bioaccessible metal fractions were mainly related to the total metal concentrations in urban soils. A relatively wide range of lead isotopic ratios in urban soils (1.1598–1.2088 for 206Pb/207Pb isotopic ratio) indicated a combination of anthropogenic and geogenic sources of metals in the soils. Lower values of 206Pb/207Pb isotopic ratio in the city centre and similar spatial distribution of total metal concentrations, together with their increasing total concentrations in soils towards the city centre, showed that traffic and coal combustion in former times were likely the major sources of soil contamination. The non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks to children due to exposure to metals in kindergarten and urban park soils were low, with hazard index and cancer risk values below the threshold values at all studied sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3achildren 3acoal 3acombustion 3acopper 3ain vitro digestion 3akindergarten 3alead 3amercury 3aneoplasms 3aparks 3arisk 3asoil sampling 3asoil separates 3atraffic 3aurban soils 3azinc 3aSlovakia 0aBioaccessibility 0aContamination 0aHealth risk 0aMetals 0aUrban soils1 aMihaljevič, Martin1 aFilová, Lenka1 aLachká, Lucia1 aJurkovič, Ľubomír1 aKulikova, Tatsiana1 aFajčíková, Katarína1 aŠimurková, Mária1 aTatarková, Veronika0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.06.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245017600167300001400343520166100357592002802018650001602046650002602062650001702088650001102105650001602116650001002132650001502142650001502157650001602172650003102188650001002219651001002229700002102239700001302260773008602273856008602359852000902445655001202454IND60089104720221118050016.0141102e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008910472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.02.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jingyi10aComparison of the SAPRC07 and SAPRC99 photochemical mechanisms during a high ozone episode in Texas: Differences in concentrations, OH budget and relative response factors  ap. 25-35.  aThe latest SAPRC photochemical mechanism SAPRC07 (S07), an update from SAPRC99 (S99), is implemented into the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model and applied to simulate a high ozone episode during the Texas Air Quality Study 2000 (TexAQS 2000). The results from the S07 mechanism are compared with those from the S99 mechanism. In general, the predicted O₃ concentrations by S07 are lower than those of S99 with maximum difference as high as 20%. The two mechanisms also show significant differences in the predicted OH, HNO₃, PAN and HCHO concentrations. S99 predicts higher OH concentration by 7–20%, higher PAN by approximately 20–25% and higher HCHO by approximately 15% than S07. OH budget analysis suggests that OH propagation factor (POH) is higher in urban and industrial areas but lower in rural areas. Although S07 generally predicts similar or higher POH, S99 predicts higher new OH formation rate from H₂O + O(¹D) and leads to higher OH and thus higher O₃ in most part of the domain. OH reactions with VOCs and CO accounts for a majority part of reacted OH. Secondary VOCs photolysis is not a main path of regenerated OH. New OH mainly comes from H₂O + O(¹D) reaction. Although the two mechanisms predict different ozone concentrations, the relative response factor (RRF) of ozone at rural, urban and industrial sites under emission controls of anthropogenic NOₓ and VOC controls by factors 0.6–1.4 predicted by the two mechanisms are very similar. This suggests that although the absolute predictions are different, both models will provide nearly identical attainment assessment in regulatory applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aformaldehyde 3amodels 3anitric acid 3aozone 3aphotolysis 3aprediction 3arural areas 3avolatile organic compounds 3awater 3aTexas1 aZhang, Hongliang1 aYing, Qi0 tAtmospheric environment.g2012 July, v. 54 p.25-35dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.02.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245021200165300001400377520153400391592002801925650002701953650002501980650001202005650001102017650001502028650000902043650002202052650002302074650001602097650001302113650004102126650001402167650002702181650001002208650002002218700002102238700002202259700002002281700002102301700001702322700002002339773009702359856008102456852000902537655001202546IND60085699820221118060015.0141101e20110505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008569982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2011.03.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalizs, Gabor10aDetermination of osteocalcin in meat and bone meal of bovine and porcine origin using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry and high-resolution hybrid mass spectrometry  ap. 89-99.  aA method has been developed for determining the origin of meat and bone meal (MBM) by detecting species-specific osteocalcin (OC) using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight (MALDI/TOF) and high-resolution hybrid mass spectrometry (HR-Q/TOF MS). The analysis is based on the detection of typical species-specific OC and its tryptic peptide fragments which differ in mass due to differences in the amino-acid sequences between species. After dissolving the MBM samples in EDTA buffer, purification after ultrafiltration was performed using two methods: solid-phase extraction using Zip-Tip C₁₈ or size exclusion coupled with reverse-phase chromatography. Fractions containing partially purified intact OC were analyzed using LC-Q/TOF and MALDI/TOF mass spectrometry. Species-specific OC was detected at the typical protonated and doubly protonated molecular ions. Furthermore, typical porcine- and bovine-derived tryptic fragments from MBM were detected after enzymatic digestion. In order to determine the underlying amino-acid sequences and to confirm the assignment to OC-derived peptides, MS/MS analysis was carried out. In conclusion, we were able to detect OC in bovine and porcine MBM with high sensitivity and the MS-based method described here by which total OC mass and marker peptides of digested OC are recorded can be used as an alternative approach to detect genus-specific differences in MBM and can be applied as a confirmatory method to mainly immunological osteocalcin screening methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aamino acid sequences 3abuffers 3acattle 3adesorption 3aions 3amass spectrometry 3ameat and bone meal 3aosteocalcin 3apeptides 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3ascreening 3asolid phase extraction 3aswine 3aultrafiltration1 aWeise, Christoph1 aRozycki, Christel1 aOpialla, Tobias1 aSawada, Stefanie1 aZagon, Jutta1 aLampen, Alfonso0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2011 May 5, v. 693, no. 1-2 p.89-99dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2011.03.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03836naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245017800165300001600343520228200359592002802641650002802669650001702697650001402714650001602728650001802744650001102762650001202773650001302785650001102798650002402809650001602833650001102849650001402860650002202874650001202896650001002908650001502918653001902933653003002952653001002982653001502992653002203007653001903029700001903048700001803067700001903085773011203104856008103216852000903297655001203306IND60601322020221118233805.0180706e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060132202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2013.10.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeetah, Krish12aA geometric morphometric re-evaluation of the use of dental form to explore differences in horse (Equus caballus) populations and its potential zooarchaeological application  ap. 904-910.  aThe domestication of the horse – specifically its use as a transport animal – had a unique impact on the evolution of human societies. Along with its influence on warfare, the horse transformed land transportation, radically altering the distance that humans could travel in a day, week, month or lifetime. Over the last century horse domestication has been investigated by zooarchaeologists using morphometric, morphological and (more recently) biomolecular approaches in attempts to identify distinct ‘domestic’ phenotypes in the fossil record. However, identification of domestic morphotypes have been complicated by the low variation in equid cranial morphology and apparent limited changes brought about through the domestication process compared with other domestic taxa. Furthermore, cranial morphology is too prone to ecophenotypic plasticity to provide relevant taxonomic markers. Even dental morphology (of primary importance for taxonomic investigation in the fossil record) has been dismissed as a useful marker for horse domestication, since variations in tooth size and enamel patterns are considered to be too greatly influenced by age and continuous tooth wear. The proof-of-concept study presented here re-evaluates the potential of cheek teeth shape to capture significant differences between horse populations. Using geometric morphometrics (GMM), we study the enamel-folding pattern of the upper P² and M³, selected for their distinctive morphology amongst the cheek teeth. Curated specimens of known age and sex from two horse (Equus caballus) breeds – Icelandic and Thoroughbred – were used to investigate whether the effects of age (through occlusal wear), sexual dimorphism and allometry (size-related change in shape) should be regarded as confounding factors preventing any accurate discrimination between these two populations. The results show that a landmark based approach applied to the occlusal enamel folding of the P² and M³ captures significant differences in size (centroïd) and shape between the horses breeds studied. Age-related factors, allometric scaling and sexual dimorphism are not confounding factors in their discrimination, encouraging the use of dental form in population-based research on ancient horse remains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIcelandic (horse breed) 3aThoroughbred 3aallometry 3aarchaeology 3adomestication 3aenamel 3afossils 3ageometry 3ahorses 3aland transportation 3amorphometry 3amorphs 3aphenotype 3asexual dimorphism 3asociety 3ateeth 3atooth wear 0aEquus caballus 0aPopulation discrimination 0aTeeth 0aAge effect 0aSexual dimorphism 0aZooarchaeology1 aCucchi, Thomas1 aDobney, Keith1 aBarker, Graeme0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2014 Jan., v. 41 p.904-910dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2013.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01832naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245013100172300001600303520072400319592002801043650002001071650002001091650001901111650003301130650001601163650001601179700001501195700001501210700001701225700001901242700001301261773007501274856008901349990002301438852000901461655001201470IND60096012520221121031836.0141104e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009601252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2012.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Feifei14aThe effects of thermally induced diffusion of dye on the broadband reflection performance of cholesteric liquid crystals films  ap. 145-150.  aA method to prepare wide-band reflection cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) films by thermally induced diffusion of dye was proposed. Due to the greatly enhanced UV intensity gradient formed by thermal diffusion of dye, the pitch gradient was formed and fixed after the process of photoinduced polymerization and diffusion of CLC monomers. Using this method, the prepared CLCs film can reflect circularly polarized light over a broad wavelength range of 750–2400nm. The pitch gradient of the CLC film was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, the influence of dye concentration, thermal diffusion time and thermal diffusion temperature on the consequent pitch gradient was systemically studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aliquid crystals 3apolarized light 3apolymerization 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3awavelengths1 aLi, Kexuan1 aSong, Ping1 aWu, Xiaojuan1 aChen, Hangping1 aCao, Hui0 tComposites.g2013 Mar., v. 46 p.145-150dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2012.10.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002500136245014000161300001600301520153200317592002801849650002201877650001101899650001801910650001301928651001901941651001801960700002501978700002402003773011402027856003902141852000902180655001202189IND4485913920221122031926.0120907e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448591392DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.14822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoirier, Jennifer M.10aChum salmon spawning activity in tributaries below bonneville dam: the relationship with tailwater elevation and seasonal precipitation  ap. 882-892.  aChum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) below Bonneville Dam migrate through as well as hold and spawn in both tributaries and mainstem areas of the Columbia River, USA. Whether fluctuations in tailwater elevation influence spawning in tributaries is unclear. We examined the relationship between Bonneville Dam tailwater elevation, seasonal precipitation and chum salmon spawning activities in three tributary spawning areas. In these tributaries, we assessed initial date of entry, time required to enter and length of spawning season, as well as the proportion of the total population that spawned in tributaries and the distribution of spawners among tributaries. Using linear regression, these variables were compared to cumulative hours of tailwater elevation ≥ 3.5 m and cumulative precipitation. Increased Bonneville Dam tailwater elevation was associated with later and longer lasting chum salmon spawning activities, but was not associated with the distribution of chum salmon spawners in tributaries. Increased seasonal precipitation was associated with a more prolonged spawning season and relatively even distribution of adult chum salmon, but was unrelated to the timing of chum salmon spawning in tributaries. The regulation of tailwater elevation downstream from Bonneville Dam can influence the spawning process for chum salmon in tributaries that enter the regulated area. How important this influence is to the decline of chum salmon in the Columbia River is unclear.

Here, we genetically dissected the distinct roles of two acetyl‐CoA synthetase genes, ChAcs1 and ChAcs2, in the regulation of fermentation, lipid metabolism and virulence of the hemibiotrophic fungus Colletotrichum higginsianum. ChAcs1 and ChAcs2 are both highly expressed during appressorial development and the formation of primary hyphae, and are constitutively expressed in the cytoplasm throughout development. We found that C. higginsianum strains without ChAcs1 were non‐viable in the presence of most non‐fermentable carbon sources, including acetate, ethanol and acetaldehyde. Deletion of ChAcs1 also led to a decrease in lipid content of mycelia and delayed lipid mobilization in conidia to developing appressoria, which suggested that ChAcs1 contributes to lipid metabolism in C. higginsianum. Furthermore, a ChAcs1 deletion mutant was defective in the switch to invasive growth, which may have been directly responsible for its reduced virulence. Transcriptomic analysis and quantitative reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (qRT‐PCR) revealed that ChAcs1 can affect the expression of genes involved in virulence and carbon metabolism, and that plant defence genes are up‐regulated, all demonstrated during infection by a ChAcs1 deletion mutant. In contrast, deletion of ChAcs2 only conferred a slight delay in lipid mobilization, although it was highly expressed in infection stages. Our studies provide evidence for ChAcs1 as a key regulator governing lipid metabolism, carbon source utilization and virulence of this hemibiotrophic fungus.  aPublisher supplied data  a20110146120033cSpecialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China  a31101399cNational Natural Science Foundation of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aColletotrichum higginsianum 3aacetaldehyde 3aacetate-CoA ligase 3aacetates 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3aamino acids 3aappressoria 3acarbohydrates 3acarbon 3acarbon metabolism 3achemical reactions 3aconidia 3acytoplasm 3aethanol 3afermentation 3afungi 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahyphae 3alipid content 3alipid metabolism 3alipids 3amutants 3amycelium 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atranscriptomics 3avirulence1 aYuan, Qinfeng1 aZhao, Dian1 aHuang, Junbin1 aHsiang, Tom1 aWei, Yangdou1 aZheng, Lu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2414-16710 tMolecular plant pathology.g2019 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.107-123dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl60298x1464-67227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mpp.127433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006400142245015900206520132100365592002801686596004901714596003201763596006801795596005601863650002401919650001901943650002501962650001701987650001402004650001302018650001602031650001802047650001602065650001102081650003202092650002002124650000902144700006802153700007002221700007002291700006202361700007202423700007402495773009802569856007702667852000902744655001202753IND60776967020221118032551.0220511e20220426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077696702DNAL7 a10.1155/2022/76643212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza, Euzélia Lima1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7203-772410aDevelopment and Characterization of Powdered Antioxidant Compounds Made from Shiraz (Vitis vinifera L.) Grape Peels and Arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea L.)  aGrapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is a plant containing many phenolic compounds, mostly distributed in the peel, pulp, and seeds. This study evaluates the centesimal composition and bioactive compounds in Shiraz grape (Vitis vinifera) peels using spectrophotometric and UHPLC techniques and develops different formulations of compound powders from the peels and arrowroot using conventional drying technology. The results demonstrate that Shiraz grape skin contains significant amounts of insoluble fiber (15.3%), phenolics (157.09 ± 6.96–149.11 ± 9.27 mg GAE g⁻¹), and flavonoids (0.75 ± 0.50–2.00 ± 0.50 mg QE g⁻¹), with excellent antioxidant capacity observed in the alcoholic extracts. The phenolic content in the developed powdered compounds ranged from 128.32 to 139.70 mg GAE g⁻¹. In general, the compounds showed good antioxidant capacity (IC50 = 0.17 to 0.19 μg mL⁻¹). According to the chromatographic evaluation, it was possible to quantify gallic acid, catechin, and epicatechin, the latter of which was found in the largest quantities in the six formulations. The EV5 formulation was the most efficient in terms of phenolic compounds and protein amounts. This formulation’s composition and low cost could make it viable for use in the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data  cServiço Nacional de Aprendizagem Industrial  cFederal University of Bahia  cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado da Bahia 3aMaranta arundinacea 3aVitis vinifera 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aarrowroot 3acatechin 3aepicatechin 3afood industry 3agallic acid 3agrapes 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainsoluble fiber 3apulp1 aNascimento, Talita Sousa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8106-74981 aMagalhães, Camila Miranda1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5313-32001 aBarreto, Gabriele de Abreu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0180-281X1 aLeal, Ingrid Lessa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9273-98781 aAnjos, Jeancarlo Pereira dos1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8353-10661 aMachado, Bruna Aparecida Souza1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1655-03250 tThe scientific world journal.g2022 Apr. 26, v. 2022dHindawiwJournal:27586x1537-744X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/76643213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03872naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092024001900149040001800168072000900186100001700195245015700212300001800369500002400387500001500411520205600426650001302482650001402495650001102509650001002520650001502530650001302545650002702558650001902585650002302604650001402627650002202641650001702663650002002680650002202700650002002722653001602742653001502758653001002773653001402783653001902797653002702816700001602843773012102859852000902980856011102989856011003100930003303210945002503243946001303268961001303281655001203294IND4375503620221119130212.0051025e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437550362DNAL7 a10.1603/0046-225X(2005)034[1161:FATDCO]2.0.CO;22doi7 a10113/8562hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aKnight, A.L.10aFactors affecting the differential capture of male and female codling moth (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in traps baited with ethyl (E,Z) -2,4-decadienoate  ap. 1161-1169.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aStudies were conducted in apple to evaluate factors that differentially affect the catch of male and female codling moth, Cydia pomonella L., in traps baited with ethyl (E, Z)-2,4-decadienoate (pear ester). We examined the time of moth capture in the diel cycle and the recapture rates of marked moths in sex pheromone mating disruption (MD) and untreated orchards. The attractiveness of pear ester-baited traps was compared among five apple cultivars. Experiments also assessed the influence of trap height, the distance of the trap from sex pheromone dispensers, proximity of foliage surrounding the trap, trap size, and proximity of adjacent clean and codling moth-injured fruit on moth captures. The responses of male and female moths significantly differed in response to many of these factors. For example, the time of peak female capture occurred earlier than for males. A higher proportion of recaptured, marked moths were females in MD versus untreated orchard plots. Significantly more male but not female moths were caught in traps placed high versus low in the tree canopy. Traps placed on the perimeter of the canopy caught significantly more female moths than traps placed within the canopy and surrounded by foliage. Smaller trap surfaces caught significantly more males than females. Traps placed adjacent to uninjured fruit caught significantly more females than traps placed away from fruit. No differences occurred between sexes in response to other factors: significantly higher counts of both sexes occurred in blocks of 'Granny Smith' versus four other apple cultivars; recapture rates of marked moths were not different at release points ranging from 10 to 50 m for either sex; and trap placement relative to MD dispensers or injured versus uninjured fruits was not a significant factor affecting moth catches or their sex ratio. Effective monitoring for either or both sexes of codling moth should consider standardizing these factors. Lure and kill strategies should include factors that optimize the captures of female moths. 3aorchards 3acultivars 3aapples 3abaits 3akairomones 3atrapping 3amark-recapture studies 3asex pheromones 3agender differences 3asex ratio 3adiurnal variation 3ainsect traps 3aMalus domestica 3amating disruption 3aCydia pomonella 0atrap height 0apear ester 0aMalus 0atrap size 0atrap proximity 0afruits (plant anatomy)1 aLight, D.M.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2005 Oct., v.  34, no.  5 p.1161-1169dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X(2005)034%5B1161:FATDCO%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/8563Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070705b20070802c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/01/19  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03887naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010400171300001600275520255000291592002802841650002502869650002202894650003102916650001802947650001002965650001102975650001202986650001002998650001103008650002103019650001503040653001603055653002103071653002603092653001903118653002103137700002003158700002003178700001803198700001503216773010303231856008603334852000903420655001203429IND60541064420221123025434.0190318e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054106442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2014.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalash, Cheslav14aThe effect of mesh orientation on netting drag and its application to innovative prawn trawl design  ap. 206-213.  aPrawn fisheries around the world comprise fuel intensive enterprises currently stressed financially by rising diesel costs. An avenue for relieving the situation is to improve the energy efficiency of trawling by raising the productivity of fishing per litre of fuel consumed. This paper presents work to develop a new prawn trawl design that leads to reduced trawl system drag. The trawl has a ‘double-tongue’ format, which refers to extensions forward of the upper and lower panels to form two additional towing points for the trawl. For this design concept, named ‘W’ trawl, drag generated in the trawl is largely directed to the centreline tongues and transferred forward to the trawler through a connected sled and towing wire. The associated reduction of drag-transfer to the wings makes the trawl substantially easier to spread and results in smaller otter boards being required and subsequently reduced overall drag of the trawl system. The study determined the effect on frame-line tensions of implementing T0 (diamond) and T45 (square) mesh in the main body and side sections of trawl models of conventional and ‘W’ configuration, with the aim to establish an optimal combination of mesh orientation for the principle parts of the ‘W’ trawl. The objective was to achieve minimum netting drag and beneficial strain transfer within the trawl such that maximum trawling performance (catch per unit of fuel) might be obtained in the field. T45 mesh in the side sections of the trawl was found to exhibit a progressively lower drag compared to T0 mesh as the flow speed increased, but the extent of drag reduction was not of practical significance. The ‘W’ trawl showed a capacity of redirecting 59% of the total netting drag to the centre line tongues when T45 netting was implemented in the body section, and only 40% when T0 orientation was used. However, the introduction of bracing ropes (at E=0.71) along the upper and lower centrelines of the T0 version of the “W” trawl improved the drag transfer to the tongues from 40% to 50% of the total drag. Overall, the most practical and economic configuration of the model ‘W’ designs tested produced an estimated drag reduction of 8.3%±0.6%, compared to the conventional trawl. It is expected that drag saving benefits in practice will be more substantial as the tested trawl models were not completely representative of practical commercial gear in that they had minimum twine area to make the experiment most sensitive to the drag-effect of mesh orientation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy use and consumption 3afishing boats 3afuels 3amodels 3anetting 3aropes 3ashrimp 3ashrimp fisheries 3atrawl nets 0aPrawn trawl 0aMesh orientation 0aTrawl strain transfer 0aDrag reduction 0aTrawl efficiency1 aSterling, David1 aBinns, Jonathan1 aThomas, Giles1 aBose, Neil0 tFisheries research.g2015 Apr., v. 164 p.206-213dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2014.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02052naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245007300174300001600247520115900263592002801422650000801450650002601458650001601484650001001500650002601510650001301536700001801549773008801567856008601655852000901741655001201750IND60089105020221118050424.0141102e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008910502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aByeon, Jeong Hoon10aParticle emission from laser printers with different printing speeds  ap. 272-276.  aThe present work investigated particle emissions for 10 min operating time for commercial color laser printers having different printing speeds (5, 24, 38 prints per minute (ppm)) in an experimental chamber (5 m³) under 1 h⁻¹ of air exchange rate. Number and mass concentrations of the emission particles were measured, and a correlation between emission and printing speed is discussed. The average mobility equivalent particle diameter (50–244 nm) of the emission was proportional to the printing speed (5–38 ppm) but the average particle number concentration (5.3–1.2 × 10⁴ particles cm⁻³) was inversely proportional to the speed. From morphology analyses of the particles, it could be estimated that the number decrease (or diameter increase) rates of the primary particles due to coagulation were 3.25 (0.17), 3.40 (0.44), and 9.31 × 10³ (0.96) particles cm⁻³ s⁻¹ (nm s⁻¹) for 5, 24, and 38 ppm, respectively.

Disordered protein sequences account for roughly 30% of the human proteome and in many proteins, disordered and ordered domains coexist. However, few studies have assessed how either feature affects the properties of the other. In this study, we examine the role of a disordered tail in the overall properties of the two-domain, calcium-sensing protein neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS-1). We show that loss of just six of the 190 residues at the flexible C-terminus is sufficient to severely affect stability, dynamics, and folding behavior of both ordered domains. We identify specific hydrophobic contacts mediated by the disordered tail that may be responsible for stabilizing the distal N-terminal domain. Moreover, sequence analyses indicate the presence of an LSL-motif in the tail that acts as a mimic of native ligands critical to the observed order–disorder communication. Removing the disordered tail leads to a shorter life-time of the ligand-bound complex likely originating from the observed destabilization. This close relationship between order and disorder may have important implications for how investigations into mixed systems are designed and opens up a novel avenue of drug targeting exploiting this type of behavior.  aPublisher supplied data  aNNF18OC0033926cNovo Nordisk Fonden  a4181-00344cStatens Naturvidenskabelige Forskningsrad 3acalcium 3adrugs 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3aligands 3aneurons 3aproteome1 aKemplen, Katherine R.1 aStein, Amelie1 aPloug, Michael1 aClarke, Jane1 aSkriver, Karen1 aHeidarsson, Pétur O.1 aKragelund, Birthe B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7454-17610 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2021 Mar., v. 78, no. 5 p.2263-2278dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-020-03639-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245020700179300001600386520094800402592002801350650002301378650002201401650000801423650002101431650002801452650002601480650001301506650002201519650001101541650001901552650001801571650003301589650001301622650002201635700002501657700001801682700001901700773007501719856008901794990002301883852000901906655001201915IND60096012820221121031952.0141104e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009601282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2012.10.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnsari, Mohd Omaish10aThermal stability in terms of DC electrical conductivity retention and the efficacy of mixing technique in the preparation of nanocomposites of graphene/polyaniline over the carbon nanotubes/polyaniline  ap. 155-161.  aElectrically conductive HCl doped polyaniline (Pani)/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and Pani/graphene (GR) nanocomposites thin films were prepared by mixing method in the presence of different amounts of nanoparticles.

The formation of Pani/MWCNT and Pani/GR nanocomposites were characterized by Fourier Transform Infra-Red spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Due to poor dispersion of MWCNT in Pani, only Pani/GR nanocomposite films were studied for DC electrical conductivity retention in air by isothermal and cyclic techniques. The films of Pani/GR nanocomposites were observed to be thermally more stable under ambient environmental conditions than pure Pani film.

While over-expression of BnSTM increased microspore-derived embryo (MDE) yield and quality, down-regulation of BnSTM repressed embryo formation [16]. Transcriptional analyses were conducted to investigate the molecular mechanisms underpinning these responses. The induction of BnSTM resulted in a heavy transcriptional activation of genes involved in antioxidant responses, hormone signalling and developmental processes. Several antioxidant enzymes, including catalases, superoxide dismutases, and components of the Halliwell–Asada cycle were induced in embryos ectopically expressing BnSTM and contributed to the removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These changes were accompanied by elevated levels of ascorbate and glutathione, which have been shown to promote embryonic growth and development. Induction or repression of BnSTM altered the early cytokinin response, whereas late responses, modulated by Type-A Arabidopsis response regulators (ARRs), were induced in MDEs over-expressing BnSTM. Major differences between transgenic MDEs were also observed in the expression pattern of several auxin transporters and key developmental factors required for normal embryogenesis. While some of these factors, BABYBOOM1 (BBM1) and SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASE (SERK), play a key role during early embryogeny, others, CYP78A5, LEAFY COTYLEDON1 and 2 (LEC1 and LEC2), as well as WOX2 and 9, are required for proper embryo development. Collectively these results demonstrate the involvement of BnSTM in novel developmental processes which can be utilized to enhance in vitro embryogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aBrassica napus 3aauxins 3acatalase 3acytokinins 3agenetically modified organisms 3aglutathione 3aplant physiology 3areactive oxygen species 3asomatic embryogenesis 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptional activation1 aYang, Cunchun1 aBelmonte, Mark F.1 aGulden, Robert H.1 aStasolla, Claudio0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2012 Sept., v. 58 p.297-311dElsevier Masson SASx0981-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.06.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03631naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010600163300001800269520165500287592002801942650001601970650001601986650001702002650001402019650001702033650001702050650001802067650001802085650001502103650001602118650001202134650003002146650001002176650001502186650004302201650001702244653000802261653000802269653000802277653000802285653000802293653001002301653000802311653000802319653001302327653000902340653001002349653000902359653001302368653001302381653000802394653002902402653004602431653001902477653001402496653001502510700001602525700001702541700001902558700002002577700001802597700001802615700001502633700001702648773012802665856008302793852000902876655001202885IND60755331020221118062530.0211219s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075533102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2021.10.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSi, Jiyeon10aGut microbiome signatures distinguish type 2 diabetes mellitus from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease  ap. 5920-5930.  aNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), and these two metabolic diseases demonstrate bidirectional influences. The identification of microbiome profiles that are specific to liver injury or impaired glucose metabolism may assist understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in the relationship between NAFLD and T2D. Here, we studied a biopsy-proven Asian NAFLD cohort (n = 329; 187 participants with NAFLD, 101 with NAFLD and T2D, and 41 with neither) and identified Enterobacter, Romboutsia, and Clostridium sensu stricto as the principal taxa associated with the severity of NAFLD and T2D, whereas Ruminococcus and Megamonas were specific to NAFLD. In particular, the taxa that were associated with both severe liver pathology and T2D were also significantly associated with markers of diabetes, such as fasting blood glucose and Hb1Ac. Enterotype analysis demonstrated that participants with NAFLD had a significantly higher proportion of Bacteroides and a lower proportion of Ruminococcus than a Korean healthy twin cohort (n = 756). However, T2D could not be clearly distinguished from NAFLD. Analysis of an independent T2D cohort (n = 185) permitted us to validate the T2D-specific bacterial signature identified in the NAFLD cohort. Functional inference analysis revealed that endotoxin biosynthesis pathways were significantly enriched in participants with NAFLD and T2D, compared with those with NAFLD alone. These findings may assist with the development of effective therapeutic approaches for metabolic diseases that are associated with specific bacterial signatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides 3aClostridium 3aEnterobacter 3aMegamonas 3aRuminococcus 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3ablood glucose 3aendotoxins 3afatty liver 3aglucose 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aliver 3amicrobiome 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3atherapeutics 0aALT 0aBMI 0aFBS 0aFDR 0aFLI 0aHbA1c 0aLDL 0aLPS 0aMaAsLin2 0aNAFL 0aNAFLD 0aNASH 0aNASH-CRN 0aPICRUSt2 0aT2D 0aType 2 diabetes mellitus 0aNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 0aGut microbiome 0aBiomarker 0aEnterotype1 aLee, Giljae1 aYou, Hyun Ju1 aJoo, Sae Kyung1 aLee, Dong Hyeon1 aKu, Bon Jeong1 aPark, Seoyeon1 aKim, Wŏn,1 aKo, GwangPyo0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2021, v. 19 p.5920-5930dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2021.10.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011700166300001600283520129900299592002801598650001501626650002001641650001501661650001601676650001401692650003101706650001301737650001701750650001301767650002001780650001501800650002701815700002301842700001801865700001501883773007301898856008401971852000902055655001202064IND60096504520221118214351.0141104e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009650452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2012.10.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÇay, Yusuf10aPrediction of engine performance and exhaust emissions for gasoline and methanol using artificial neural network  ap. 177-186.  aThis study investigates the use of ANN (artificial neural networks) modelling to predict BSFC (break specific fuel consumption), exhaust emissions that are CO (carbon monoxide) and HC (unburned hydrocarbon), and AFR (air–fuel ratio) of a spark ignition engine which operates with methanol and gasoline. To obtain training and testing data, a number of experiments were performed with a four-cylinder, four-stroke test engine operated at different engine speeds and torques. The experimental results reveal that the methanol improved the emission characteristics compared with the gasoline. For the ANN modelling, the standard back-propagation algorithm was found to be the optimum choice for training the model. In the building of the network structure, four different learning algorithms were used such as BFGS (Quasi-Newton back propagation), LM (Levenberg–Marquardt learning algorithm). It was found that the ANN model is able to predict the engine performance and exhaust emissions with a correlation coefficient of 0.998621, 0.977654, 0.998382 and 0.996075 for the BSFC, CO, HC and AFR for testing data, respectively. It was obvious that the developed ANN model is fairly powerful for predicting the brake specific fuel consumption and exhaust emissions of internal combustion engines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion 3acorrelation 3aemissions 3aenergy use and consumption 3agasoline 3ahydrocarbons 3amethanol 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3aspark ignition engines1 aKorkmaz, İbrahim,1 aÇiçek, Adem1 aKara, Fuat0 tEnergy.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 50 p.177-186dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2012.10.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245016900163300001800332520172800350592002802078650001302106650001002119650001302129650001002142650001002152650001302162650001402175650002402189651001002213651001102223700001702234700002502251700001802276773013802294856008202432852000902514655001202523IND60586139520221117232053.0180619e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058613952DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-017-5340-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xulei10aTaxonomic revision of Gelidium tsengii and Gelidium honghaiwanense sp. nov. (Gelidiales, Rhodophyta) from China based upon molecular and morphological data analyses  ap. 1442-1453.  aThe taxonomic relationship of Chinese Gelidium tsengii and Gelidium johnstonii was ambiguous. For almost 20 years they have been regarded as distinct taxa and until 2002 G. johnstonii was considered as a misapplied name of G. tsengii. In this study, herbarium specimens that initially attributed to G. tsengii and fresh G. tsengii specimens were used to address the taxonomic issues. In phylogenetic studies, G. tsengii from Dayawan, China, near the type locality of G. tsengii and G. johnstonii from Sonora, Mexico, the type locality of G. johnstonii, formed a monophyletic group with maximum support in rbcL and COI genes analyses, indicating that they were genetically identical. In morphological studies, G. tsengii was similar to G. johnstonii in branching pattern, inner structures and fructiferous organs. Consequently, we considered that semi-circular outline of G. tsengii could no longer be treated as a discrimating feature. G. johnstonii had priority of publication and according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, G. tsengii was proposed as a synonym of G. johnstonii. Gelidium honghaiwanense sp. nov. was described from Guangdong, China on the basis of morphological and molecular data. For vegetative structures, it was characterized by flattened upright frond, regular two-three times branches pinnate or alternate and clavate ultimate branchlets. For reproductive structures, the tetrasporangial sori were in the apical part of branches and the tetrasporangial branchlets were distichously distributed along second order branches. The present study clarified the relationship between G. tsengii and G. johnstonii from Guangdong and added a new Gelidium species to the Chinese algal flora.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGelidium 3aalgae 3abranches 3aflora 3agenes 3aherbaria 3amonophyly 3ataxonomic revisions 3aChina 3aMexico1 aXia, Bangmei1 aBottalico, Antonella1 aWang, Guangce0 tChinese journal of oceanology and limnology.g2017 Nov., v. 35, no. 6 p.1442-1453dScience PresswJournal:J000001677x0254-40597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-017-5340-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245014600161300001400307520125000321592002801571650002001599650001901619650000901638650001201647650002001659650002001679650003201699650002401731650003201755650001401787651001301801651001701814700002001831700001801851700001901869773013201888856007802020852000902098655001202107IND60765009520221118063025.0220904e20140218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076500952DNAL7 a10.17221/31/2013-cjfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStancheva, M.10aCommon carp (Cyprinus caprio) and European catfish (Sillurus glanis) from the Danube River as sources of fat soluble vitamins and fatty acids  ap. 16-24.  aThe total content of fat soluble vitamins and their percentages in the recommended daily intake for humans per 100&nbsp;g portion, fatty acids composition, the atherogenic (IA) and thrombogenicity (IT) indices in two freshwater fish species &ndash; Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and European catfish (Sillurus glanis) were investigated.

Noni leaves are processed with four methods i.e., mealing, blending, juicing, and decocting. The data obtained were analyzed descriptively. The variables measured were phytochemical analysis and antibacterial activity through bacterial inhibitory test. Qualitative test was used for phytochemical analysis and quantitative analysis was used for antibacterial of noni leaves. The antibacterial activity of noni leaves with diffusion well method used 4 concentrations i.e., 2.5; 5; 7.5; and 10% and extracted by maceration with 4 solvents i.e., water, ethanol, ethyl acetate, and hexane. The results showed that the processing of Noni leaves produced various active compounds. The noni leaves meal produces a more active type of compound group compared to 3 other treatments. Antibacterial tests against Escherichia coli were not seen in all noni leaves processing, but were seen to positively inhibit Salmonella typhimurium in the extraction process of Noni leaves meal using ethanol and ethyl acetate solvents at 48 hours maceration. The conclusions of the results showed that noni leaves meal extract using ethanol and ethyl acetate macerated for 48 hours was able to inhibit Salmonella typhimurium bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aMorinda citrifolia 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3aethanol 3aethyl acetate 3ahexane 3amaceration 3aphytochemicals 3aquantitative analysis 3aIndonesia 0aantibacterial 0aEscherichia coli 0anoni leaves 0aSalmonella typhimurium1 aSuci, Dwi Margi1 aWijayanti, Indah0 tJurnal Ilmu Pertanian Indonesia.g2019, v. 24, no. 1dBogor Agricultural UniversitywJournal:27739x2443-34627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18343/jipi.24.1.583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245011600172300001600288520134300304592002801647650001701675650001201692650001901704650001001723650002301733650002301756650001601779650002301795650001601818650001401834650001501848650001801863650002401881650000901905650001401914650001101928650001601939650001001955651002101965653003001986653002502016653002202041653001902063653002102082653001802103700002102121700002202142700002402164773013802188856008702326852000902413655001202422IND50068883720221118001533.0190318e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006888372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2013.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGray, Laura K.10aPredicting the risk of cedar leaf blight (Didymascella thujina) in British Columbia under future climate change  ap. 152-163.  aCedar leaf blight (Didymascella thujina) is considered to be the most important disease of western redcedar in British Columbia. The disease is most prevalent in warm-moist coastal low-elevation environments causing mortality among seedlings and significant loss of incremental growth and branch death among mature trees. In this study we used a principle component regression model to spatially project the disease risk under observed climate (2003–2008) and multiple future climate scenarios for the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. We found that while the majority of future climate scenarios predicted coastal environments will continue to favor occurrence of the disease, intensity is predicted to decrease toward the 2080s. Projected reductions of available summer climate moisture (cumulative precipitation – potential evapotranspiration), corresponding to the time of ascospore discharge and germination, contribute significantly to this finding. Disease intensity is however, projected to increase under moderate temperature and precipitation increases for the 2020s. We therefore recommend current reforestation efforts deploy disease resistant western redcedar seedlots in high risk environments common to hypermaritime coastal regions such as Haida Gwaii and northern maritime, to avoid significant mortality and growth reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDidymascella 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adeath 3adisease occurrence 3aevapotranspiration 3agermination 3agrowth retardation 3aleaf blight 3amortality 3aprediction 3areforestation 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3aseedlings 3asummer 3atemperature 3atrees 3aBritish Columbia 0aClimate envelope modeling 0aDidymascella thujina 0aCedar leaf blight 0aClimate change 0aWestern redcedar 0aForest health1 aRussell, John H.1 aYanchuk, Alvin D.1 aHawkins, Barbara J.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 180 p.152-163dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2013.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011800156300002000274520140700294592002801701650001901729650001601748650001401764650001101778650001101789650001901800650001601819650001301835650002501848700001301873700001801886700001601904700001201920700001101932700001701943700001901960700001601979773012301995856007402118852000902192655001202201IND60641594320221117231644.0190505e20170512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064159432DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra01920c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Yaqiang10aEffect of an external electric field on the electronic properties of SnS₂/PbI₂ van der Waals heterostructures  ap. 25582-25588.  aThe future development of optoelectronic devices will require an advanced control technology in electronic properties, for example by an external electric field (Efᵢₑₗd). Here we demonstrate an approach that the heterostructure based on van der Waals (vdW) heterobilayer built by monolayer SnS₂ and PbI₂ has a well-controlled electronic properties with Efᵢₑₗd. A type-II staggered-gap band alignment is achieved from the SnS₂/PbI₂ vdW heterostructure with which SnS₂ dominated the lowest energy holes as well as the lowest energy electrons are separated in PbI₂. The charge redistribution with an Efᵢₑₗd is mainly on the surface of SnS₂ layer and PbI₂ and the numbers of polarized electrons on the monolayers display a linear evaluation with external Efᵢₑₗd. The band structure under different Efᵢₑₗd experiences not only a transition from semiconductor to metal but also conversions between type-I straddling-band alignment and type-II staggered-gap, which results in different spatial distribution of the lowest energy electrons and holes. Moreover, when the Efᵢₑₗd is between −0.06 V Å⁻¹ and −0.34 V Å⁻¹, the material manifests a varied direct bandgap which is more favor to optoelectronics and solar cell. Consequently, this vdW heterobilayer with well-controlled manner shows expectation for huge potential in optics and electronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric field 3aelectronics 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3aoptics 3asemiconductors 3asolar cells 3asulfides 3avan der Waals forces1 aZhao, Xu1 aNiu, Mengmeng1 aDai, Xianqi1 aLi, Wei1 aLi, Yi1 aZhao, Mingyu1 aWang, Tianxing1 aTang, Yanan0 tRSC advances.g2017 May 12, v. 7, no. 41 p.25582-25588dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra01920c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04168naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245020800172300001400380520209300394592002802487650002102515650001502536650002302551650001302574650002602587650001702613650001602630650001802646650002402664650001802688650001902706650000902725650002302734650001902757650002002776650002902796650001002825650002102835650002602856650003002882650001602912650002802928650001602956650002102972650001202993653000903005653000803014653000803022653000803030653000803038653000803046653000803054653000803062653000903070653000703079653001903086653001903105653001903124653002803143653001603171653002803187700001703215773011603232856008903348852000903437655001203446IND60526195620221117203159.0190403e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052619562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2015.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhasemian, M.10aDietary mannan-oligosaccharides supplementation could affect performance, immunocompetence, serum lipid metabolites, intestinal bacterial populations, and ileal nutrient digestibility in aged laying hens  ap. 81-89.  aMannan-oligosaccharides (MOS) have been identified as feed additives that potentially affect gastrointestinal status in different animal species. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of supplemental MOS on production performance, immunological responses, and ileal bacterial communities in aged laying hens. A total of one-hundred-fifty 68 weeks-aged laying hens (Hy-Line W-36) were randomly allotted to the 6 replicates (5 hens per each) of 5 experimental diets. Dietary treatments consisted of 5 different levels of MOS (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2g/kg of diet). After a 7-d of adaptation, the main experimental period was commenced for 70-d subdivided into two 35-d periods (69–74 and 74–79 weeks of age). Results showed that dietary supplementation of MOS at the levels of 1 and 1.5g/kg increased (P<0.05) egg production percentage during the whole experimental period. As a result, the greatest egg mass was allotted to these experimental groups throughout the trial period. Supplementation of MOS at the levels of 1–2g/kg reduced (P<0.01) serum concentrations of triglycerides and low-density lipoproteins, and increased (P<0.01) serum high-density lipoproteins compared to the control hens. Dietary supplementation of MOS increased (P<0.05) antibody production titers against Newcastle and infectious bronchitis disease viruses. Moreover, inclusion of MOS into the diets increased digestibility coefficients of crude protein (P<0.01) and dry matter (P<0.05). Ileal population of Salmonella was greater (P<0.01) in control birds compared with other experimental groups. Supplemental MOS at the level of 1g/kg decreased (P<0.05) ileal enumerations of Escherichia coli and total bacteria. The present findings indicate that dietary MOS supplementation, particularly at the levels of 1 and 1.5g/kg, could increase production performance and feed conversion efficiency in aged laying hens. These improvements could be mainly attributed to the increased ileal nutrient digestibility and reduced pathogenic intestinal bacteria as the result of dietary supplementation of MOS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aSalmonella 3aantibody formation 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3acrude protein 3adietary supplements 3adigestibility 3aegg production 3aeggs 3aexperimental diets 3afeed additives 3afeed conversion 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3aileum 3aimmunocompetence 3ainfectious bronchitis 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alaying hens 3alow density lipoprotein 3ametabolites 3atriacylglycerols 3aviruses 0aADFI 0aAIA 0aFCR 0aHDL 0aIBV 0aLDL 0aMOS 0aNDV 0aSRBC 0aTG 0aAntibody titer 0aEgg production 0aGut microflora 0aImmunological responses 0aLaying hens 0aMannan-oligosaccharides1 aJahanian, R.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2016 Mar., v. 213 p.81-89dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2015.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003100146245014200177300001600319520107000335592002801405650002101433650002501454650001601479650001501495650001901510650001601529650001201545650001901557650002601576650001601602650002101618650001501639650002601654653001501680653002601695653002201721653001901743653001001762653002501772700002001797700002601817773012901843856008001972852000902052655001202061IND60622180220221121214728.0181124e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062218022DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132145281882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanthirasegaram, Vicknesha10aEffects of sonication and ultraviolet-C treatment as a hurdle concept on quality attributes of Chokanan mango (Mangifera indica L.) juice  ap. 232-241.  aThe growing demand for fresh-like food products has encouraged the development of hurdle technology of non-thermal processing.

Selected physicochemical properties, antioxidant activities, microbial inactivation and other quality parameters of combined treated juice were compared to conventional thermal treatment (at 90 ℃ for 60 s). After thermal and combined treatment, no significant changes occurred in physicochemical properties. A significant increase in extractability of carotenoids (15%), polyphenols (37%), flavonoids (35%) and enhancement in antioxidant capacity was observed after combined treatment.

Anti‐prion monoclonal antibodies can arrest the progression of prion diseases by stabilizing the cellular form of the prion protein. Here, we present the crystal structure of the POM6 Fab fragment, in complex with the mouse prion protein (moPrP). The prion epitope of POM6 is in close proximity to the epitope recognized by the purportedly toxic antibody fragment, POM1 Fab also complexed with moPrP. The POM6 Fab recognizes a larger binding interface indicating a likely stronger binding compared to POM1. POM6 and POM1 exhibit distinct biological responses. Structural comparisons of the bound mouse prion proteins from the POM6 Fab:moPrP and POM1 Fab:moPrP complexes reveal several key regions of the prion protein that might be involved in initiating mis‐folding events.

The optical properties of GaN MWs exhibit a multiple-mode-stimulated-amplified emission with a peak around 375 nm and a corresponding lasing threshold of about 120 kW cm⁻². In addition, the lasing characteristics of GaN MWs were explored by the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3aoptical properties 3aphotoluminescence 3asilicon 3atemperature 3avapors1 aChen, A.

Stable empty particles devoid of viral genomic RNA have historically been generated from virions by: 1. high pressure; 2. extreme alkaline pH; and 3. freeze-thaw using liquid nitrogen. Herein we report a fourth and more convenient avenue for empty particle formation through EDTA treatment, implicating chelation of virion-associated cations. We present findings that confirm TYMV virions purified in an EDTA-based buffer are converted to 94 % empty on average during purification. Additional experimentation revealed TYMV virions purified through CsCl vs. sucrose gradients are more readily converted to empty particles after freeze thaw. These studies are novel as they show a purification method through EDTA-treatment that can generate stable empty particles devoid of viral genome. The convenience of this method should prove suitable for scientists seeking to use TYMV capsids in nanoscience-inspired applications. Importantly, these findings provide insight into historical discrepancies in creating empty particles after freeze-thaw, as the method in which TYMV virions are purified influences the downstream virion-to-empty conversion process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aTurnip yellow mosaic virus 3acapsid 3achelation 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3agenomics 3aliquid nitrogen 3apH 3apurification methods 3asucrose 3aviral genome 3aviruses 0aTYMV 0aTymovirus 0aCapsid 0aIcosahedral 0aTYMV 0aATC 0aTEM1 aDreher, Theo W.0 tJournal of virological methods.g2022 Nov., v. 309 p.114595-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2022.1145953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04434naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100005700154245015900211300001400370520247400384592002802858650001602886650001302902650001102915650001302926650001102939650001202950650001802962650001402980650002102994650001403015650001003029650001703039650002403056650001003080650001103090650001203101650001703113650002103130650001603151650002503167653000803192653000903200653000703209653000703216653001003223653000703233653000703240653000703247653001103254653000803265653000703273653000803280653000803288653002103296653001803317653003103335653003203366653001103398700001803409700001403427700001103441700001603452700001803468773011603486856008903602852000903691655001203700IND60526195720221117203047.0190403e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052619572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2015.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnett, M.C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6306-788410aUsing portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) to determine fecal concentrations of non-absorbable digesta kinetic and digestibility markers in sheep and cattle  ap. 35-41.  aConcentration of indigestible markers in feces is routinely used to estimate the digestibility or rate of passage of feed through the gut. Current procedure for measuring fecal marker concentrations is an acid digest before analysis using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP). Portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectroscopy uses short wavelength X-rays to excite sample material and generate characteristic elemental emissions proportional to the concentration of the element present in ground fecal material. The aim of this study was to measure fecal concentrations of Co, Cr, Ti, and Yb digesta marker by both ICP and pXRF and determine any correlation between the two methods, thereby assessing the potential of using pXRF as a marker analysis method. Silica (Si) concentrations in fecal and feed samples were also measured using both methods. Cattle and sheep feces and various feed samples collect from four separate studies were analyzed for concentrations of Co (CoEDTA), Cr (Cr mordanted fibre), Ti (TiO2), Yb (Yb(III)acetate), and Si using ICP and pXRF. Regression analysis used to assess the relationship between ICP and pXRF determined fecal concentrations indicated strong linear relationships (P<0.01) between pXRF and ICP estimates of Co (r2=1.00), Cr (r2=0.95), Ti (r2=0.97), Yb (r2=0.94), and Si (r2=0.88). All curves were validated using a second set of independent fecal samples. A full set of total collection fecal samples for six sheep were also analyzed by pXRF for Co and Cr (digesta kinetics), and Si (digestion) marker concentrations. These fecal Co and Cr concentrations were used to estimate digesta mean retention times (MRT) and compared to estimated digesta MRT from the same sheep using Co and Cr marker concentrations determined by ICP analysis. No differences in estimated MRT were found when using either analytical method. Silica concentrations from the same fecal samples as determined by pXRF were used to determine the rate of DMD for each animal. When compared to apparent DMD for the same animals as determined using feed DM intake and fecal DM output collected during the total collection, no differences were again found using either analytical method. The results indicate that pXRF can be used as an alternative to standard ICP procedure, obviating the need for acid digestion, reducing cost and time; and may also offer an alternative analytical method for determining livestock DM digestibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aacetates 3acattle 3achromium 3acobalt 3adigesta 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3adigestive system 3aemissions 3afeces 3afluorescence 3aregression analysis 3asheep 3asilica 3asilicon 3aspectroscopy 3atitanium dioxide 3awavelengths 3awet digestion method 0aICP 0apXRF 0aCo 0aCr 0aCr2O3 0aSi 0aTi 0aYb 0aCoEDTA 0aMRT 0aDM 0aDMD 0aNDF 0aDigesta kinetics 0aDigestibility 0aFecal marker concentration 0aPortable X-ray fluorescence 0aSilica1 aForster, N.A.1 aRay, G.A.1 aLi, L.1 aGuppy, C.N.1 aHegarty, R.S.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2016 Feb., v. 212 p.35-41dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2015.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03574naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245014500173520214300318592002802461650002602489650002902515650002602544650002402570650001602594650001402610650002102624650001702645650001602662650001802678650003102696650001102727650001502738653001802753653001802771700002102789700002202810700001902832700002202851700002302873700001902896773010702915856008503022852000903107655001203116IND60755331420221118062403.0211129e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075533142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hermed.2021.1005172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShirakawa, Satoshi10aEffects of natural herb-containing dental toothpaste on periodontal pathogenic bacteria and clinical parameters: A randomized clinical trial  aToothpastes containing natural herbs (NHs) have been commercially sold based on the claim that NHs possess anti-inflammatory, astringency, and antibacterial activities that reduce gingival inflammation. However, there have been few reports on the effects of such toothpastes on periodontitis or oral bacteria. The aim was to investigate the effects of a toothpaste containing NHs (Acess®) on clinical parameters and oral bacteria.Seventy-four patients with periodontitis were divided into test and control (n = 37 each) groups. Participants were then instructed to use either the test or the control toothpaste twice per day (in the morning and at night) to brush their teeth for 5 min for 4weeks.The NHs present in the test toothpaste was rhatany tincture (1.25%), chamomile tincture (1.25%), and myrrh tincture (0.62%). The control toothpaste contained the basic components of general toothpaste without any of the medicinal components present in Acess. The plaque control record (PCR), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), and probing depth (PD) at baseline and 2 and 4 weeks was measured. Bacterial samples from periodontal pockets or saliva at each time point was also collected.Compared with the control group, the test group showed significant improvement in PD, GI, and BOP at 2 and 4 weeks after the intervention (p < 0.01). Bacteriologic evaluation of samples from periodontal pockets indicated no changes for both groups. Over time, total bacterial counts and the counts of Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Prevotella intermedia in the bacterial samples from the saliva of the test group decreased (p < 0.01). No significant changes were detected in the count of Porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.55). There was a significant decrease in the total bacterial counts in the test group compared with the control group (p < 0.01).A toothpaste containing NHs significantly improves clinical periodontal parameters and lower oral bacterial counts, including that of periodontal pathogenic bacteria in saliva.Clinical significance:The use of toothpaste containing NHs reduces periodontitis symptoms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides forsythus 3aPorphyromonas gingivalis 3aPrevotella intermedia 3aTreponema denticola 3aastringency 3achamomile 3aherbal medicines 3ainflammation 3amyrrh resin 3aperiodontitis 3arandomized clinical trials 3asaliva 3atoothpaste 0aNatural herbs 0aOral bacteria1 aMatsushima, Yuji1 aKajiyama, Sohtaro1 aSuzuki, Takuma1 aNagano, Takatoshi1 aNikaidou, Masahiko1 aGomi, Kazuhiro0 tJournal of herbal medicine.g2021 Dec., v. 30 p.100517-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:21606x2210-80337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hermed.2021.1005173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245011000162300001800272520170300290592002801993650001302021650000802034650001302042650002102055650001402076650001502090650001802105650002402123650001102147650001002158650000902168650001302177700002002190773014602210856007202356852000902428655001202437IND60661939120221119104032.0190904e20081112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066193912DNAL7 a10.1039/b813784f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilmutdinov, Albert10aThree dimensional modeling of air flow, aerosol distribution and aerosol samplers for unsteady conditions  ap. 1417-1425.  aDespite the importance and wide use of aerosol samplers, their basic characteristics including gas flow dynamics, sampling, and aspiration efficiency are still not fully understood and characterized. This is especially the case when a personal inhalable sampler operates under conditions of calm or slowly moving air. Under such conditions, the results may be affected by the breathing of the person. The development of the next generation of sampling devices should be facilitated by the improved knowledge derived from mathematical studies of particle motion in the complex flows around bluff bodies where aspiration occurs. In this work, a three-dimensional and time dependent model of aerosol sampling is developed that can be applied to any feasible aspiration situation. Direct accounting for all the three spatial coordinates and temporal dependence makes the model four dimensional. In order to investigate aspiration characteristics when a sampler is fixed on a person, a digital model of a person is developed. The “digital mannequin” can breathe through the mouth or nose and is heated to body temperature to account for convection effects of warm air around the body. The developed model allows simulation of nonstationary air flow and aerosol particles dynamics around any bluff body in both indoor and outdoor conditions. The gas flow and aerosol particles dynamics around a breathing person at the conditions of calm or slowly air moving are computed for both mouth and nasal breathing. It is shown that in such a situation the aspiration efficiency is place and time sensitive. Temporal dependences of aspiration efficiency are computed and averaged characteristics are derived.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aair flow 3abody temperature 3abreathing 3aconvection 3ahydrodynamics 3ainhalation exposure 3amodels 3amouth 3anose 3asamplers1 aZivilskii, Ilya0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2008 Nov. 12, v. 10, no. 12 p.1417-1425dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b813784f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008600170300001800256520150500274592002801779650001201807650001901819650001001838650000901848650000901857650001601866650002001882650001101902650001501913650001601928651001001944700001501954773012801969856008102097852000902178655001202187IND60586139920221117232012.0171118e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058613992DNAL7 a10.1007/s00484-017-1393-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatanabe, Shinichi10aMitigation of pedestrian heat stress using parasols in a humid subtropical region  ap. 2009-2019.  aConcerns over heat illness have been an increasing social problem in humid subtropical regions. One measure for avoiding excessive heat stress in hot outdoor environments is the use of parasols or umbrellas. The advantage of parasols is that they are a mobile and inexpensive way to provide personal shade outdoors. The objectives of this study were to compare the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) under parasols and at an unshaded point as a reference, and to quantify the reduction in WBGT from the use of parasols in a humid subtropical region. Measurements using three parasols of different colors and materials were conducted at the athletics field at Daido University, Nagoya, Japan, between 9:00 and 15:00 Japan Standard Time in August 2015. The WBGT was obtained at heights of 0.1 m (ankles), 1.1 m (abdomen), and 1.7 m (head) above ground, according to the measurement procedure described in ISO 7243. On a sunny and partly cloudy day, the use of a parasol lowered the average globe temperature by up to 6.2 °C, through blocking direct solar radiation. The average reduction in WBGT by the parasol was found to be 1.8 °C at head level in sunny conditions with solar radiation of over 800 W/m². The reduction in WBGT at head level by the use of parasols in sunny conditions was greater than that in cloudy conditions. However, although parasols can reduce WBGT at the head level of the user regardless of solar radiation, they cannot reduce it at the level of the abdomen or ankles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdomen 3abioclimatology 3acolor 3ahead 3aheat 3aheat stress 3asolar radiation 3asports 3asubtropics 3atemperature 3aJapan1 aIshii, Jin0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2017 Nov., v. 61, no. 11 p.2009-2019dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0020-71287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-017-1393-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03430naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005100151245008600202300001600288520178300304592002802087650001702115650001502132650001202147650002502159650001102184650001402195650001902209650001702228650002102245650000902266650002902275650001202304650002202316650002102338650003902359650001302398650002302411650002702434650001302461650001102474653002502485653002002510653001602530653002402546700001702570700001902587700001502606700002002621700001702641773011102658856008602769852000902855655001202864IND60605522220221119033234.0190620e20180815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060552222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2018.06.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXin, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5396-431910aAffinity adsorption of bovine hyaluronidase with ligands targeting to active site  ap. 422-431.  aFour affinity ligands were designed from 6-chloromethyluracil and 2-aminobenzimidazole and simulated for the interaction with bovine hyaluronidase-1. Regarding sequence alignment, bovine hyaluronidase-1 precursor showed circa 83.6% similarity with human hyaluronidase-1.

As calculated, the densities of four ligands on sorbents (entitled as L-1, L-2, L-3 and L-4) were 37.7 ± 2.3, 36.4 ± 3.2, 42.4 ± 4.2 and 33.7 ± 2.3 μmol/g wet gel; the theoretical maximum adsorption (Qmax) of bovine hyaluronidase on the four sorbents were 63.6 ± 1.6, 72.0 ± 0.7, 111.0 ± 4.1 and 121.7 ± 2.3 mg/g wet gel, respectively; the dissociation constants (Kd) of the four sorbents were 18.5 ± 0.8, 48.1 ± 4.3, 35.0 ± 3.0, 40.6 ± 2.7 μg/g wet gel, respectively. After optimization, the proteins captured by sorbents attaching 2-aminobenzimidazole based ligands (L-3 and L-4) revealed the main single band at approximately 50 kDa, and the purities were about 85.2 and 96.4%; the bioactivity recoveries were 83.5 and 89.4%. In addition, the bands on SDS-PAGE gel were also extracted and confirmed with linear trap quadropole mass spectrometry (LTQ-MS) analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3aagarose 3abioactive properties 3acattle 3achlorides 3achromatography 3adissociation 3aepichlorohydrins 3agels 3ahyaluronoglucosaminidase 3aligands 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular models 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteins 3asequence alignment 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asorbents 3atestes 0aBovine hyaluronidase 0aAffinity ligand 0aActive site 0aAffinity adsorption1 aHao, Mengyao1 aFan, Guangming1 aZhang, Yao1 aZheng, Mengling1 aZhang, Liang0 tJournal of chromatography.g2018 Aug. 15, v. 1092 p.422-431dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2018.06.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245018700178300001600365520156800381592002801949650001501977650001501992650001902007650001402026650002202040650002102062650001702083650002902100650001502129700002002144700003402164773007302198856008402271852000902355655001202364IND60096505020221118214733.0141104e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009650502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2012.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahmani-Firouzi, Bahman13aAn efficient scenario-based and fuzzy self-adaptive learning particle swarm optimization approach for dynamic economic emission dispatch considering load and wind power uncertainties  ap. 232-244.  aRenewable energy resources such as wind power plants are playing an ever-increasing role in power generation. This paper extends the dynamic economic emission dispatch problem by incorporating wind power plant. This problem is a multi-objective optimization approach in which total electrical power generation costs and combustion emissions are simultaneously minimized over a short-term time span. A stochastic approach based on scenarios is suggested to model the uncertainty associated with hourly load and wind power forecasts. A roulette wheel technique on the basis of probability distribution functions of load and wind power is implemented to generate scenarios. As a result, the stochastic nature of the suggested problem is emancipated by decomposing it into a set of equivalent deterministic problem. An improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to obtain the best expected solutions for the proposed stochastic programming framework. To enhance the overall performance and effectiveness of the particle swarm optimization, a fuzzy adaptive technique, θ-search and self-adaptive learning strategy for velocity updating are used to tune the inertia weight factor and to escape from local optima, respectively. The suggested algorithm goes through the search space in the polar coordinates instead of the Cartesian one; whereby the feasible space is more compact. In order to evaluate the efficiency and feasibility of the suggested framework, it is applied to two test systems with small and large scale characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acombustion 3aelectric power 3aemissions 3amodel uncertainty 3apower generation 3apower plants 3aprobability distribution 3awind power1 aFarjah, Ebrahim1 aAzizipanah-Abarghooee, Rasoul0 tEnergy.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 50 p.232-244dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2012.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245011200169300001800281520165000299592002801949650001301977650001601990650002902006650001702035650001102052650000802063650001102071650001102082650000902093650000902102650001102111651002102122653001302143653001902156653003002175653000802205700002002213700005902233700002302292700001902315773010402334856008702438852000902525655001202534IND60562440820221119133313.0170719e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056244082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.10.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBae, Soo Ya10aWeekly variability of precipitation induced by anthropogenic aerosols: A case study in Korea in summer 2004  ap. 1531-1539.  aWe examine the effect of anthropogenic aerosols on the weekly variability of precipitation in Korea in summer 2004 by using Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) models. We conduct two WRF simulations including a baseline simulation with empirically based cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) number concentrations and a sensitivity simulation with our implementation to account for the effect of aerosols on CCN number concentrations. The first simulation underestimates observed precipitation amounts, particularly in northeastern coastal areas of Korea, whereas the latter shows higher precipitation amounts that are in better agreement with the observations. In addition, the sensitivity model with the aerosol effects reproduces the observed weekly variability, particularly for precipitation frequency with a high R at 0.85, showing 20% increase of precipitation events during the weekend than those during weekdays. We find that the aerosol effect results in higher CCN number concentrations during the weekdays and a three-fold increase of the cloud water mixing ratio through enhanced condensation. As a result, the amount of warm rain is generally suppressed because of the low auto-conversion process from cloud water to rain water under high aerosol conditions. The inefficient conversion, however, leads to higher vertical development of clouds in the mid-atmosphere with stronger updrafts in the sensitivity model, which increases by 21% cold-phase hydrometeors including ice, snow, and graupel relative to the baseline model and ultimately results in higher precipitation amounts in summer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair quality 3aanthropogenic activities 3acase studies 3acoasts 3aice 3amixing 3amodels 3arain 3asnow 3asummer 3aKorean Peninsula 0aAerosols 0aWeekend effect 0aPrecipitation variability 0aWRF1 aJeong, Jaein I.1 aPark, Rokjin J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8922-02341 aLim, Kyo-Sun Sunny1 aHong, Song-You0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 541 p.1531-1539dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.10.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01257naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245005500175300001600230520039900246592002800645650001300673650002300686650001600709650001200725650002400737650001400761700001600775773007300791856008200864852000900946655001200955IND60551663520221120054905.0161019e20140508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055166352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2014.04.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Mosqueda, Jaime10aDeciphering Functions of Branched Ubiquitin Chains  ap. 767-769.  aThe anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome targets proteins for degradation by catalyzing homotypic ubiquitin chains of different linkage types.

(Research purpose) To develop and study a new kinematic scheme of a mobile vehicle based on a self-propelled tractor T-16 chassis, which provides increased reliability, comfortable working conditions for the operator, a significant improvement in the environmental situation, and better economic efficiency. (Materials and methods) The authors listed the advantages of the new hybrid vehicle kinematic scheme. They gave the comparative technical characteristics of a diesel engine and an asynchronous electric motor. They developed a new methodology for calculating gas turbine engine technical parameters and described the production process of an electric drive with a capacity of 11 kilowatts to drive the driving wheels. The authors gave a thermal design of the compressor parameters, turbine. They calculated the excess air ratio. According to the parameters obtained, a K27-145 turbocharger was chosen, which simultaneously served as a turbine and a compressor of a gas turbine engine. A kinematic diagram was created with a gas turbine electric generator, storage batteries, an asynchronous frequency-controlled motor and a mechanical gearbox. (Results and discussion) The authors proposed to use a mobile vehicle as a mobile power plant: an output socket with a voltage of 220-230 volts operated from an inverter connected to batteries; the second socket – with a three-phase voltage of 400 volts – from the generator of the power gas turbine plant. (Conclusions) It was proved that the proposed hybrid mobile vehicle design on a battery and a gas turbine was capable of operating throughout the entire working day, and to provide 16 horsepower of a diesel engine, it was enough to install an asynchronous electric motor with a capacity of 7.5 kilowatts. The authors calculated the compressor performance of the gas turbine engine, which was 0.178 kilograms per second. The geometric parameters of the combustion chamber and the technical characteristics of the turbocharger were determined.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3abatteries 3acombustion 3acompressors 3adiesel engines 3aelectric motors 3aelectric potential difference 3agas turbine engines 3ageometry 3amethodology 3apower plants 3atractors 3atransmission systems 0ahybrid mobile vehicle 0astorage battery 0apower plant 0agas turbine plant 0aasynchronous electric motor 0aelectric generator0 tSelʹskohozâjstvennye mašiny i tehnologii.g2021 June, v. 15, no. 2 p.26-32dFederal Scientific Agroengineering Centre VIMwJournal:27913x2618-67487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22314/2073-7599-2021-15-2-26-323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002800146245014100174300001600315520126800331592002801599650003401627650002001661650001801681650001401699650001101713650002201724650001701746653002501763653001701788653002501805700002001830700002401850773012901874856008002003852000902083655001202092IND60622180520221121235920.0181124e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062218052DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132145336872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerdán-Calero, Manuela10aDetermination of the antiradical activity and kinetics of pomegranate juice using 2,2-diphenylpicyrl-1-hydrazyl as the antiradical probe  ap. 277-283.  aWhole fruit pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) juice of the ‘Wonderful’ cultivar was characterized through the elucidation of its antiradical kinetics and activity using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl as the antiradical probe. Time-dependent concentration of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl during its reduction by the juice has been adjusted through a non-linear parametric fitting. Determined total antiradical activity was high, able to reduce 84.58 µmol/l of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl per concentration unit of juice (µl/ml), equivalent to a concentration of 42.29 mmol/l of ascorbic acid (or Trolox). Partial antiradical activities due to the fast-, medium- and slow-kinetics were 49.09, 18.16 and 17.33 µmol/l of reduced 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl per concentration unit of juice (µl/ml), respectively. The corresponding rate constant for the fast-, medium- and slow-kinetics were κ₁ = 6.03, κ₂ = 0.169 and κ₃ = 0.0094 (μl l)/(ml µmol min), respectively. This methodology allows characterization of samples through the accurate determination of the kinetics of their antiradical features, avoiding the use of empirical approximations that hinder the realistic comparison between extracts independently of their origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aPunica granatum 3aascorbic acid 3acultivars 3afruits 3apomegranate juice 3apomegranates 0aNatural antioxidants 0afruit juices 0aantiradical kinetics1 aSendra, José M1 aSentandreu, Enrique0 tFood science and technology international.g, v. 21, no. 4 p.277-283dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132145336873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002300190245004400213300001600257520137900273592002801652653000801680653000801688653001401696653001501710653001101725653000801736653000801744653000801752653000801760653000801768653000701776653000801783653000801791653000801799653000901807653000801816653000801824653000701832653000901839653001001848653000801858653001001866653001001876653001301886773008401899856008301983852000902066655001202075IND60555276720221121064441.0161026e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055527672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcmgh.2015.09.0042doi7 aPMC46789272pmcid7 a266822812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRehermann, Barbara10aNatural Killer Cells in Viral Hepatitis  ap. 578-588.  aNatural killer (NK) cells are traditionally regarded as first-line effectors of the innate immune response, but they also have a distinct role in chronic infection. Here, we review the role of NK cells against hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV), two agents that cause acute and chronic hepatitis in humans. Interest in NK cells was initially sparked by genetic studies that demonstrated an association between NK cell–related genes and the outcome of HCV infection. Viral hepatitis also provides a model to study the NK cell response to both endogenous and exogenous type I interferon (IFN). Levels of IFN-stimulated genes increase in both acute and chronic HCV infection and pegylated IFNα has been the mainstay of HCV and HBV treatment for decades. In chronic viral hepatitis, NK cells display decreased production of antiviral cytokines. This phenotype is found in both HCV and HBV infection but is induced by different mechanisms. Potent antivirals now provide the opportunity to study the reversibility of the suppressed cytokine production of NK cells in comparison with the antigen-induced defect in IFNγ and tumor necrosis factor-α production of virus-specific T cells. This has implications for immune reconstitution in other conditions of chronic inflammation and immune exhaustion, such as human immunodeficiency virus infection and cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHBV 0aHCV 0aInfection 0aInterferon 0aT Cell 0aCMV 0aHBV 0aHCV 0aHLA 0aIFN 0aIL 0aILC 0aISG 0aKIR 0aLCMV 0aMHC 0aNCR 0aNK 0aSTAT 0aTGFβ 0aTLR 0aTNFα 0aTRAIL 0aTRAIL-R20 tCMGH.g2015 Nov., v. 1 p.578-588dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23408x2352-345X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcmgh.2015.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02119naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008500158300002000243520088600263592002801149650002101177650001801198650002501216650002101241650001501262650001701277650001901294650001801313650002401331650002401355700001801379700001701397700001401414700001501428700001601443700001701459700001501476773012301491856007401614852000901688655001201697IND60641594920221117231721.0190505e20170510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064159492DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra01954h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Bingwei12aA Cr₂O₃/MWCNTs composite as a superior electrode material for supercapacitor  ap. 25019-25024.  aIt has been a challenge to achieve a good capacitive performance for Cr-based oxides, and only few studies have been reported on these oxides. Herein, a composite of chromium oxide (Cr₂O₃) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was prepared by a simple hydrothermal procedure followed by thermal decomposition. The Cr₂O₃ nanoparticles were evenly decorated on the surface of MWCNTs. The prepared Cr₂O₃/MWCNTs composite exhibited superior electrochemical performance in a 1 M KOH electrolyte, i.e., 257 F g⁻¹ at the current density of 0.25 A g⁻¹, and the capacity fade was only 12% after 3000 cycles. In addition, the Cr₂O₃/MWCNTs//AC asymmetric capacitor has high energy density (15.2 W h kg⁻¹ at 266 W kg⁻¹). The abovementioned results for the first time indicate the potential application of Cr₂O₃ as an electrode material for supercapacitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3achromic oxide 3aelectrical equipment 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy density 3ananoparticles 3apotassium hydroxide 3athermal degradation1 aWang, Yanfang1 aLi, Chunyang1 aFu, Lijun1 aLiu, Xiang1 aZhu, Yusong1 aZhang, Lixin1 aWu, Yuping0 tRSC advances.g2017 May 10, v. 7, no. 40 p.25019-25024dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra01954h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01883naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245006400163520070600227592002800933650002500961650001200986650002100998650001701019650001701036650001301053653001201066653000901078653001201087653001601099653002801115653001801143700001501161700002001176700001501196700005701211773012501268856008301393852000901476655001201485IND60755332020221118062456.0220328e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075533202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.teac.2021.e001522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Yinhui10aRecent developments in electrochemical detection of cadmium  aHeavy metal cadmium (Cd) poses extreme toxicity to the environmental and human health, thus its detection provides a great challenge in the environmental and analytical science, yet the solution is needed urgently owing to the adverse effects.

Thus, more selective PGE2 targeting therapeutics are needed to treat inflammatory disease in horses. One potential target is microsomal prostaglandin E-synthase-1 (mPGES-1), which is the terminal enzyme downstream of COX-2 in the inducible PGE2 synthesis cascade. This enzyme has yet to be studied in equine leukocytes, which play a pivotal role in equine inflammatory disease. The objective of this study was to determine if mPGES-1 is a PGE2-selective anti-inflammatory target in equine leukocytes. To evaluate this objective, leukocyte-rich plasma (LRP) was isolated from equine whole blood collected via jugular venipuncture of six healthy adult horses of mixed breeds and genders. LRP was primed with granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence or absence of an mPGES-1 inhibitor (MF63), a COX-2 inhibitor (NS-398), or a nonselective COX inhibitor (indomethacin). Following treatment, mPGES-1 and COX-2 mRNA and protein levels were measured via qPCR and western blot, respectively, and PGE2, thromboxane (TXA2) and prostacyclin (PGI2) levels were measured in cellular supernatants via ELISA. This study revealed that LPS significantly increased mPGES-1 mRNA, but not protein levels in equine LRP as measured by qPCR and western blot, respectively. In contrast, COX-2 mRNA and protein were coordinately induced by LPS. Importantly, treatment of LPS-stimulated leukocytes with indomethacin and NS-398 significantly reduced extracellular concentrations of multiple prostanoids (PGE2, TXA2 and PGI2), while the mPGES-1 inhibitor MF63 selectively inhibited PGE2 production only. mPGES-1 inhibition also preserved higher basal levels of PGE2 production when compared to either COX inhibitor, which might be beneficial in a clinical setting. In conclusion, this work identifies mPGES-1 as a key regulator of PGE2 production and a PGE2-selective target in equine leukocytes. This study demonstrates that mPGES-1 is a potentially safer and effective therapeutic target for treatment of equine inflammatory disease when compared to traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWestern blotting 3aadults 3aadverse effects 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agastrointestinal system 3agranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 3ahorses 3aindomethacin 3ainflammation 3aleukocytes 3alipopolysaccharides 3amessenger RNA 3amixed breeds 3amodels 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3apatients 3aprostacyclin 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atherapeutics 0aProstaglandin E2 0aProstaglandin E-synthase 0aLeukocyte 0aAnti-inflammatory 0aNSAID 0aHorse1 aJones, Samuel L.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2017 Oct., v. 192 p.33-40dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2017.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03718naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002300190245010300213300001500316520203000331592002802361653002502389653001802414653001702432653001402449653002702463653001502490653000802505653000902513653000802522653000802530653000802538653000902546653000902555653000902564653000902573653000802582653000702590653000902597653000902606653000802615653000802623653001202631653000802643653000802651653001002659653000902669700002102678700002102699700002902720700002702749700001702776700002102793700002302814700002002837700002402857773008302881856008302964852000903047655001203056IND60555276920221121054307.0161026e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055527692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcmgh.2015.09.0072doi7 aPMC49807422pmcid7 a281747052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRollo, Benjamin N.10aEnteric Neural Cells From Hirschsprung Disease Patients Form Ganglia in Autologous Aneuronal Colon  ap. 92-109.  aHirschsprung disease (HSCR) is caused by failure of cells derived from the neural crest (NC) to colonize the distal bowel in early embryogenesis, resulting in absence of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and failure of intestinal transit postnatally. Treatment is by distal bowel resection, but neural cell replacement may be an alternative. We tested whether aneuronal (aganglionic) colon tissue from patients may be colonized by autologous ENS-derived cells.Cells were obtained and cryopreserved from 31 HSCR patients from the proximal resection margin of colon, and ENS cells were isolated using flow cytometry for the NC marker p75 (nine patients). Aneuronal colon tissue was obtained from the distal resection margin (23 patients). ENS cells were assessed for NC markers immunohistologically and by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and mitosis was detected by ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine labeling. The ability of human HSCR postnatal ENS-derived cells to colonize the embryonic intestine was demonstrated by organ coculture with avian embryo gut, and the ability of human postnatal HSCR aneuronal colon muscle to support ENS formation was tested by organ coculture with embryonic mouse ENS cells. Finally, the ability of HSCR patient ENS cells to colonize autologous aneuronal colon muscle tissue was assessed.ENS-derived p75-sorted cells from patients expressed multiple NC progenitor and differentiation markers and proliferated in culture under conditions simulating Wnt signaling. In organ culture, patient ENS cells migrated appropriately in aneural quail embryo gut, and mouse embryo ENS cells rapidly spread, differentiated, and extended axons in patient aneuronal colon muscle tissue. Postnatal ENS cells derived from HSCR patients colonized autologous aneuronal colon tissue in cocultures, proliferating and differentiating as neurons and glia.NC-lineage cells can be obtained from HSCR patient colon and can form ENS-like structures in aneuronal colonic muscle from the same patient.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHirschsprung Disease 0aAganglionosis 0aCell Therapy 0aMegacolon 0aEnteric Nervous System 0aCHIR-99021 0aEdU 0aeGFP 0aENC 0aENS 0aFBS 0aGFAP 0aGSK3 0aHNK1 0aHSCR 0aMTR 0aNC 0anNOS 0anTCM 0aPBS 0aPFA 0aqRT-PCR 0aRCH 0aSMA 0aSOX10 0aTUJ11 aZhang, Dongcheng1 aStamp, Lincon A.1 aMenheniott, Trevelyan R.1 aStathopoulos, Lefteris1 aDenham, Mark1 aDottori, Mirella1 aKing, Sebastian K.1 aHutson, John M.1 aNewgreen, Donald F.0 tCMGH.g2016 Jan., v. 2 p.92-109dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23408x2352-345X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcmgh.2015.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01671naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012500156300002000281520063400301592002800935650001400963650001400977650001200991650001801003650001401021650001301035650003301048700001401081700001501095700001601110773012401126856007401250852000901324655001201333IND60641595120221117231637.0190505e20170328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064159512DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra01961k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBysting, F.10aInvestigation of Heck coupling on 6-bromo[2,3-d]thienopyrimidines for construction of new EGFR inhibitor lead structures  ap. 18569-18577.  aWith the aim of identifying new lead structures for EGFR inhibition, a study of palladium catalysed Heck coupling between (R)-6-bromo-N-(1-phenylethyl)thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-amine and various acrylates was performed.

Six rumen-fistulated Holstein dairy cows (body weight: 630±55kg, 110±25 days in milk, mean±SD) were assigned to the following treatments in a 3×3 Latin square design: (1) control TMR (CON); (2) a TMR supplemented with 80g of sodium–calcium malate/head per day (MAL); and (3) a TMR supplemented with 10g of active dried yeast providing 20×109 CFU of Saccharomyces cerevisiae/head per day (ADY). Each experimental period consisted of 14 days of adaptation to the experimental treatments, 4 days of SARA challenge, and 10 days of rest. Dry matter intake (18.4 vs. 19.8kg/day), and milk yield (29.3 vs. 30.4kg/day) were depressed during SARA compared with adaptation. Malate and ADY had no effect on DMI and milk yield during the adaptation and SARA phases. Malate and ADY had no effect on ruminal pH characteristics during adaptation. During SARA, maximum and mean ruminal pH was not affected by supplementation, but minimum ruminal pH tended to be higher for ADY compared to CON and MAL. Time spent with ruminal pH <5.6 and < 5.8 tended be lower for ADY compared to CON. During adaptation, ADY tended to decrease rumen NH3-N concentration compared to CON. Malate and ADY had no effect on selected blood metabolites, but glucose and insulin concentration increased during SARA compared to adaptation. The population of Fibrobacter succinogenes tended to increase with MAL and ADY during adaptation, but its population was decreased during SARA compare with adaptation. During SARA, the abundance of Megasphaera elsdenii tended to be higher for ADY than for MAL. The abundance of Streptococcus bovis increased during SARA, but was not affected by MAL or ADY supplementation. The relative abundances of protozoa in the rumen decreased during SARA. In conclusion, ADY supplementation to dairy cows with SARA can potentially improve rumen function, as indicated by a tendency for an improved ruminal pH and greater abundance of M. elsdenii within the rumen.

Neonates (n = 100) (<32 week’s gestation and/or <1500 g) were divided into two groups: mother’s milk group (n = 48), receiving 0.2 mL of oropharyngeal mother’s milk every 4 h for the first 15 days of life, and a control group (n = 52), not receiving oropharyngeal mother’s milk. Serum concentrations of interleukin (IL) IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1ra, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interferón gamma (IFN-γ) were assessed at 1, 3, 15, and 30 days of postnatal life. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were collected. The rate of common neonatal morbidities in both groups was similar. The mother’s milk group achieved full enteral feeding earlier, and showed a decrease in Il-6 on days 15 and 30, in IL-8 on day 30, and in TNF-α and INF-γ on day 15, as well as an increase in IL-1ra on days 3 and 15 and in IL-10 on day 30. Oropharyngeal mother’s milk administration for 15 days decreases the pro-inflammatory state of preterm neonates and provides full enteral nutrition earlier, which could have a positive influence on the development of the immune system and inflammatory response, thereby positively influencing other developmental outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3abreast feeding 3acolostrum 3adeglutition 3aenteral feeding 3aimmune system 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3aneonates 3anutrients 3apregnancy 3apremature birth 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aDiaz-Castro, Javier 1 aPeña-Caballero, Manuela 1 aSerrano-López, Laura 1 aMoreno-Fernández, Jorge 1 aSánchez-Martínez, Belen 1 aMartín-Peregrina, Francisca 1 aAlonso-Moya, Mercedes 1 aMaldonado-Lozano, José 1 aHurtado-Suazo, Jose  A.1 aOchoa, Julio  J.0 tNutrients.g2020 Feb. 05, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120204133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245011800169300001600287520090500303592002801208650002501236650001301261650001701274650001201291650001301303650002401316650002701340650002001367653002001387653002501407653003301432653002701465700002801492700002101520700001901541700002001560700002101580773012901601856008001730852000901810655001201819IND60622180920221122000401.0181124e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062218092DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132145359442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndrade, Ricardo D10aRheological and physical properties of gelatin suspensions containing cellulose nanofibers for potential coatings  ap. 332-341.  aRheological and physical properties of edible coating formulations containing gelatin, cellulose nanofibers (CNFs), and glycerol are characterized.

Surface tension decreases with either gelatin or CNF concentration increases. Power law model well described the rheological behavior of edible coating formulations since determination coefficient was high (R² > 0.98) and standard error was low (SE < 0.0052). Formulations showed pseudoplastic (shear-thinning) flow behavior and no time-dependent features were observed. The flow behavior index was not significantly affected by any factor.

There are several advantages to using tissue residues over exposure concentrations (e.g., water, sediment, and diet) to calculate toxicity metrics. These include a large reduction in toxic response variability among all species for a given compound, an improved ability to address mixture toxicity, an increased use of information on modes and mechanisms of toxic action, a likely reduction in the number of species needed to characterize toxicant potency, the potential to improve ecological risk assessments, and the generation of more scientifically defensible tissue, water, and sediment toxicity guidelines or criteria. A keystone concept for the TRA is that the body/tissue residue reflects the target “dose” better than the traditional dose (e.g., water, air, soil/sediment, or diet) because the closer the dose surrogate is to the actual site of toxic action the less it is influenced by myriad modifying factors. Our goal for this review is to present the concepts and issues associated with the TRA and discuss some of the potential applications and expected improvements to the field of environmental toxicology that we believe will promote enhanced protection for species and ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3adiet 3aecosystems 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental assessment 3aguidelines 3arisk assessment 3asediments 3asoil 3atoxicity1 aMcCarty, Lynn S.1 aEscher, Beate I.1 aAdams, William J.0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2008 Nov. 12, v. 10, no. 12 p.1486-1498dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b814041n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245014800176300001800324520153600342592002801878650001301906650001901919650001101938650002601949650003101975650001902006650001302025650003702038650002202075650002402097650002002121650001602141650001902157650001802176650002002194650001302214700001602227700001502243700001702258700001602275700001702291700001902308773012802327856008102455852000902536655001202545IND60586140420221117232341.0171118e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058614042DNAL7 a10.1007/s00484-017-1392-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrikanth, Krishnamoorthy10aTranscriptome analysis and identification of significantly differentially expressed genes in Holstein calves subjected to severe thermal stress  ap. 1993-2008.  aRNA-Seq analysis was used to characterize transcriptome response of Holstein calves to thermal stress. A total of eight animals aged between 2 and 3 months were randomly selected and subjected to thermal stress corresponding to a temperature humidity index of 95 in an environmentally controlled house for 12 h consecutively for 3 days. A set of 15,787 unigenes were found to be expressed and after a threshold of threefold change, and a Q value <0.05; 502, 394, and 376 genes were found to be differentially expressed on days 1, 2, and 3 out of which 343, 261 and 256 genes were upregulated and 159, 133, and 120 genes were downregulated. Only 356 genes out of these were expressed on all 3 days, and only they were considered as significantly differentially expressed. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that ten pathways were significantly enriched; the top two among them were protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum and MAPK signaling pathways. These results suggest that thermal stress triggered a complex response in Holstein calves and the animals adjusted their physiological and metabolic processes to survive. Many of the genes identified in this study have not been previously reported to be involved in thermal stress response. The results of this study extend our understanding of the animal’s response to thermal stress and some of the identified genes may prove useful in the efforts to breed Holstein cattle with superior thermotolerance, which might help in minimizing production loss due to thermal stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3abioclimatology 3acalves 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agene expression regulation 3aheat tolerance 3ahumidity 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3astress response 3atemperature 3athermal stress 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aunigenes1 aLee, Eunjin1 aKwan, Anam1 aLim, Youngjo1 aLee, Junyep1 aJang, Gulwon1 aChung, Hoyoung0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2017 Nov., v. 61, no. 11 p.1993-2008dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0020-71287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-017-1392-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245011700169300001800286520157800304592002801882650000801910650001001918650001501928650002401943650001701967650001101984650001901995650001502014650002302029650002002052650002502072650001102097650000702108650001402115653003102129653001902160653001102179653001502190700001702205700001602222700003002238773010402268856008702372852000902459655001202468IND60562441220221119133158.0170719e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056244122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.10.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yimin10aDissolved inorganic carbon speciation in aquatic environments and its application to monitor algal carbon uptake  ap. 1282-1295.  aDissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) speciation is an important parameter that enables chemical and ecological changes in aquatic environments, such as the aquatic environmental impact of increasing atmospheric CO2 levels, to be monitored. We have examined and developed a sensitive and cost-effective ‘back-titration’ method to determine the DIC species and abundance in aqueous environments that is more accurate and reproducible than existing methods and is applicable in a range of fresh, brackish and sea waters. We propose the use of pHHCO3 (bicarbonate-dominant pH) and pH3.5 as the titration end points in the back-titration technique to accurately determine carbonate alkalinity. The proposed method has a higher accuracy and precision than other modified Gran's methods that are currently in use. The detection limit was found to be ~5μmolkg−1 with an accuracy within 1% and a precision (CV) within 0.2% and 0.5% at high and low level of carbonates, respectively. This method was successfully applied to monitor DIC in the aqueous medium of Nannochlopsis salina cultivation separately carried out with NaHCO3 and CO2 as the respective inorganic carbon source. The cells were able to grow in the NaHCO3 medium with a similar growth curve to cells with 0.039% CO2 (air). Increases in CO2 level stimulated lipid accumulation by diverting the fixed carbon from protein to lipids. The increased concentration of gaseous CO2 and the accompanying lower pH appears to significantly inhibit the growth of algae despite the presence of HCO3− when 20% CO2 was employed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalgae 3aalkalinity 3aaquatic environment 3abicarbonates 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3aenvironmental impact 3alipids 3apH 3atitration 0aDissolved inorganic carbon 0aBack-titration 0apHHCO3 0aAlkalinity1 aZhang, Liang1 aXu, Changan1 aVaidyanathan, Seetharaman0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 541 p.1282-1295dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.10.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03317naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002900153245014700182506010400329506007600433520185100509592002802360506003702388650002302425650001402448650001302462650002002475650002602495650002402521650002402545653001502569653001502584653002302599653002902622700003702651700001902688773011502707856008802822852000902910655001202919IND60787384520221207093457.0220816e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078738452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2022.1057332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan den Borne, Bart H.P.10aDisentangling the relationships between lameness, milking frequency and milk production in Dutch dairy herds using an automatic milking system  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLameness in dairy cattle commonly results in milk production losses. Previous studies have quantified this effect in cows milked with conventional milking systems. The effect of lameness on milk production in herds with automatic milking systems (AMS) might differ because lame cows may visit the AMS less frequently, resulting in an additional milk production loss. This observational study aimed to quantify the direct and indirect effect, through milking frequency, of lameness on milk production in AMS herds by means of a multilevel mediation analysis. Lameness scores, the number of visits to the AMS, and daily milk production records of 1608 dairy cows from 87 Dutch AMS herds were available for analysis. Of those cows, 27 % were mildly lame and 11 % were severely lame. Using a multilevel Poisson regression model, both mildly lame and severely lame cows were identified to visit the AMS less frequently. A separate multilevel linear regression model identified that the direct effect of severe lameness on milk production was 1.4 kg per day. The subsequent multilevel mediation analysis showed that the relationship between severe lameness and milk production was mediated through a reduced milking frequency; 63 % of the total milk production losses (3.9 kg per day) were due to a reduced milking frequency (2.5 kg per day). The mediating effect of a reduced milking frequency was most prominent in cows with parity ≥ 4 and in cows that were ≥ 30 days in lactation. This study suggests that milk production losses due to severe lameness of dairy cows might be higher in AMS herds compared with cows in herds with a conventional milking system, a likely result of a reduced milking frequency of those cows. Prevention of severe lameness may be more cost-effective in AMS herds than in herds with a conventional milking system.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acost effectiveness 3alactation 3alameness 3amilk production 3aobservational studies 3aregression analysis 3aveterinary medicine 0aLocomotion 0aMilk yield 0aMediation analysis 0aCounterfactual framework1 aDi Giacinto Villalobos, Alice M.1 aHogeveen, Henk0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2022 Nov., v. 208 p.105733-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2022.1057333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009900172300001600271520149200287592002801779650000801807650002101815650002201836650001201858650001901870650001401889650001401903650000901917650001801926650001601944773007301960856008402033852000902117655001202126IND60096505820221118214258.0141104e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009650582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2012.10.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhiaus, Christian10aCausality issue in the heat balance method for calculating the design heating and cooling load  ap. 292-301.  aThermal load calculation based on dynamic models is widely used in simulation software and it is the method recommended by ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers) and CEN (European Committee for Standardization, in French: Comité Européen de Normalisation). The principle is to make the heat balance for the air volume of a room space considered at uniform temperature and to calculate from this equation the load, i.e. the power needed to obtain the required indoor temperature. The problem is that, by doing so, the physical causality is not respected. If the model is approximated by a piece-wise linear dynamical system, this procedure results in an improper transfer function in the case of non-negligible thermal capacity of the indoor air. In order to point out this problem, a method to obtain state-space and transfer function models from thermal networks is introduced. Then, the transfer function representation is employed to show that changing the physical causality results in an improper transfer function. The practical consequence is that when the space temperature has a step variation, the calculated load tends to infinity if the simulation time step approaches zero. The issue of causality may be a problem in equation-based simulation software, such as Modelica, in which the equations do not represent causal relations: a wrong choice of the causality in a balance equation may result in an improper transfer functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair conditioning 3acomputer software 3acooling 3adynamic models 3aengineers 3aequations 3aheat 3arefrigeration 3atemperature0 tEnergy.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 50 p.292-301dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2012.10.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009400163300001800257520144100275592002801716650002301744650001701767650002401784650001001808650001301818650001501831650001901846650002801865700001901893700001501912700001601927700001901943700001701962773010201979856004802081852000902129655001202138IND4483869520221122054536.0120715e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448386952DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-012-5279-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Zhihong,10aStatistical method for mapping QTLs for complex traits based on two backcross populations  ap. 2645-2654.  aMost important agronomic and quality traits of crops are quantitative in nature. The genetic variations in such traits are usually controlled by sets of genes called quantitative trait loci (QTLs), and the interactions between QTLs and the environment. It is crucial to understand the genetic architecture of complex traits to design efficient strategies for plant breeding. In the present study, a new experimental design and the corresponding statistical method are presented for QTL mapping. The proposed mapping population is composed of double backcross populations derived from backcrossing both homozygous parents to DH (double haploid) or RI (recombinant inbreeding) lines separately. Such an immortal mapping population allows for across-environment replications, and can be used to estimate dominance effects, epistatic effects, and QTL-environment interactions, remedying the drawbacks of a single backcross population. In this method, the mixed linear model approach is used to estimate the positions of QTLs and their various effects including the QTL additive, dominance, and epistatic effects, and QTL-environment interaction effects (QE). Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed method and to assess the accuracy and efficiency of its estimations. The results showed that the proposed method could estimate the positions and the genetic effects of QTLs with high efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3abackcrossing 3aexperimental design 3agenes 3ahaploidy 3ainbreeding 3aplant breeding 3aquantitative trait loci1 aHayart, Yousaf1 aYang, Jian1 aCao, LiYong1 aLou, XiangYang1 aXu, Haiming,0 tChinese science bulletin.g2012 July, v. 57, no. 21 p.2645-2654dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-012-5279-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245007100163300001400234506002800248520127400276592002801550506003701578650001401615650001501629650001401644650000901658651001401667653001701681653001401698653001601712653002301728700002901751700002601780773010901806856007601915852000901991655001202000IND60747680320221207130959.0210803e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074768032DNAL7 a10.22146/ipas.628992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartina, Baiq Sri10aMorphological characterization of six Lombok upland rice cultivars  ap. 88-98.  aResource is Open Access  aLombok upland rice is one of the cultivars that have the potential as a genetic source. However, Lombok upland rice is almost rarely found. Therefore, conservation was carried out through morphological characterization to provide genetic information. This study aimed to describe the characteristics of six Lombok upland rice cultivars, namely, Reket Putek Bulu, Reket Putek Buntung, Reket Bireng Bulu, Reket Bireng Buntung, Pare Beaq Sapit, and Beaq Ganggas. A completely randomized design was used, consisting of these six Lombok upland rice cultivars as treatments. Two superior cultivars were also used for comparison. The study revealed sufficient divergence for various qualitative and quantitative traits. Pare Beaq Sapit and Beaq Ganggas shared common morphological characters, and both were tall plants. The auricle and ligule colors of Reket Bireng Bulu were different from those of the other cultivars. Reket Putek Buntung had the latest flowering and harvesting age. Reket Putek Bulu and Reket Bireng Buntung had a high number of productive tillers. Six cultivars of Lombok upland rice were characterized to have morphological diversity, so that they are expected to be used as genetic material in rice plant breeding, thereby developed to avoid extinction.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acultivars 3aextinction 3ahighlands 3arice 3aIndonesia 0aconservation 0agermplasm 0aprevaration 0awest nusa tenggara1 aWulandari, Rani Agustina1 aBasunanda, Panjisakti0 tIlmu pertanian.g2021 July, v. 6, no. 2 p.88-98dUniversitas Gadjah MadawJournal:22161x2527-71627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22146/ipas.628993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245017200158300001600330520123500346592002801581650003401609650002201643650002501665650001801690650001301708650002801721650002401749650002801773650001601801650001901817650001201836650003501848650001101883650000701894650001101901650002201912650003301934650001301967650002501980650001602005653001302021653001402034653004502048653002502093653003302118700001802151700001502169700001402184700002002198773012902218856008002347852000902427655001202436IND60622181020221122062411.0181124e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062218102DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132145361742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Hao10aUltrasonic-assisted enzymatic extraction of phenolics from broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica) inflorescences and evaluation of antioxidant activity in vitro  ap. 306-319.  aAn efficient ultrasonic-assisted enzymatic extraction technique was applied to extracting phenolics from broccoli inflorescences without organic solvents. The synergistic model of enzymolysis and ultrasonication simultaneously was selected, and the enzyme combination was optimized by orthogonal test: cellulase 7.5 mg/g FW (fresh weight), pectinase 10 mg/g FW, and papain 1.0 mg/g FW. The operating parameters in ultrasonic-assisted enzymatic extraction were optimized with response surface methodology using Box–Behnken design. The optimal extraction conditions were as follows: ultrasonic power, 440 W; liquid to material ratio, 7.0:1 mL/g; pH value of 6.0 at 54.5 ℃ for 10 min. Under these conditions, the extraction yield of phenolics achieved 1.816 ± 0.0187 mg gallic acid equivalents/gram FW. The free radical scavenging activity of ultrasonic-assisted enzymatic extraction extracts was determined by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl·assay with EC₅₀ values of 0.25, and total antioxidant activity was determined by ferric reducing antioxidant power assay with ferric reducing antioxidant power value of 0.998 mmol FeSO₄/g compared with the referential ascorbic acid of 1.184 mmol FeSO₄/g.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aBrassica oleracea 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3abroccoli 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aexperimental design 3afree radical scavengers 3agallic acid 3ainflorescences 3aliquids 3amedian effective concentration 3amodels 3apH 3apapain 3apolygalacturonase 3aresponse surface methodology 3asolvents 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 0aBroccoli 0aphenolics 0aultrasonic-assisted enzymatic extraction 0aantioxidant activity 0aresponse surface methodology1 aZhu, Junxiang1 aYang, Long1 aWang, Ran1 aWang, Chengrong0 tFood science and technology international.g, v. 21, no. 4 p.306-319dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132145361743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002700190245010400217300001600321520179500337592002802132653003102160653001802191653002502209653000902234653001702243653001202260653000902272653000802281653000802289653000602297653000902303653001102312653000802323653001002331653001102341653001002352653001002362653000802372653000802380653000802388700002302396700002102419700002302440773008402463856008302547852000902630655001202639IND60555277420221121054450.0161026e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055527742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcmgh.2015.11.0102doi7 aPMC48230062pmcid7 a270665252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKohlnhofer, Bridget M.10aGATA4 Regulates Epithelial Cell Proliferation to Control Intestinal Growth and Development in Mice  ap. 189-209.  aThe embryonic small intestinal epithelium is highly proliferative, and although much is known about mechanisms regulating proliferation in the adult intestine, the mechanisms controlling epithelial cell proliferation in the developing intestine are less clear. GATA4, a transcription factor that regulates proliferation in other developing tissues, is first expressed early in the developing gut in midgut endoderm. GATA4 function within midgut endoderm and the early intestinal epithelium is unknown.By using Sonic Hedgehog Cre to eliminate GATA4 in the midgut endoderm of mouse embryos, we determined the impact of loss of GATA4 on intestinal development, including epithelial cell proliferation, between embryonic day (E)9.5 and E18.5.We found that intestinal length and width were decreased in GATA4 mutants compared with controls. GATA4-deficient intestinal epithelium contained fewer cells, and epithelial girth was decreased. We further observed a decreased proportion of proliferating epithelial cells at E10.5 and E11.5 in GATA4 mutants. We showed that GATA4 binds to chromatin containing GATA4 consensus binding sites within cyclin D2 (Ccnd2), cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (Cdk6), and frizzled 5 (Fzd5). Moreover, Ccnd2, Cdk6, and Fzd5 transcripts were reduced at E11.5 in GATA4 mutant tissue. Villus morphogenesis was delayed, and villus structure was abnormal in GATA4 mutant intestine.Our data identify GATA4 as an essential regulator of early intestinal epithelial cell proliferation. We propose that GATA4 controls proliferation in part by directly regulating transcription of cell-cycle mediators. Our data further suggest that GATA4 affects proliferation through transcriptional regulation of Fzd5, perhaps by influencing the response of the epithelium to WNT signaling.  aPublisher supplied data 0aTranscriptional Regulation 0aWNT Signaling 0aVillus Morphogenesis 0aAtoh 0aBio-ChIP-Seq 0aCcnd1/2 0aCdk6 0acKO 0aEdU 0aE 0aFzd5 0aHes1/6 0aPCR 0aPdgfa 0aPDGFRA 0aPrdm1 0aOlfm4 0aSBS 0aShh 0aWnt1 aThompson, Cayla A.1 aWalker, Emily M.1 aBattle, Michele A.0 tCMGH.g2016 Mar., v. 2 p.189-209dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23408x2352-345X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcmgh.2015.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009700171520168700268592002801955650001501983650002401998650001702022650001702039650001902056650001302075650000902088650001002097650001902107650002602126650001102152650001702163653002002180653001802200653002202218653002002240653002302260653002602283700001802309700001002327700001702337700001902354700001702373700001702390700001902407773011902426856008502545852000902630655001202639IND60755332520221118062340.0211206e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075533252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.susmat.2021.e003522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPathania, Diksha10aEssential oil derived biosynthesis of metallic nano-particles: Implementations above essence  aNanoscience is a nano-scale analysis of materials constrained in at least one direction to 100 nm that introduces new perspectives in various areas of science such as genomics, therapeutics, bio-medicine and tissue engineering. For such applications physical, biological and chemical approaches could be used to fabricate nano-materials of diverse configurations. Green fabrication, which encompasses the use of organic materials including some plants and plant-essential oils (PEOs), has exploded in popularity as a durable, efficient, convenient and eco-sustainable protocol for the fabrication of numerous nanostructures. PEOs comprise a variety of secondary metabolites, including volatile compounds that attribute to fragrance and certain phytochemicals with ethno-medicinal implications, specifically in regard to the use of aroma-therapy to treat various ailments. Interestingly, it was recently discovered that such secondary constituents may be used as adsorbents, reductors and capping agents of metal precursor, facilitating the generation of nanomaterials. Such fabrication is often conducted at room temperature and is environment conscious since no noxious derivatives are produced. The nanomaterials obtained this way possess peculiar, wide applications that can be optimized in specialized disciplines for numerous implementations. This review reveals how essential oil from plants can beused for the sustainable fabrication and implementation of metal nanostructures based on gold and silver. Essential-oil (EO) based nanoparticles revealed good anti-microbial, photocatalytic, anti-oxidant and insecticidal assessments so they can be used in numerous deployments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aambient temperature 3aantioxidants 3abiosynthesis 3aessential oils 3agenomics 3agold 3aodors 3aphotocatalysis 3asecondary metabolites 3asilver 3atherapeutics 0aAdsorbing agent 0aEssential oil 0aGreen fabrication 0aNano-structures 0aPhyto-constituents 0aBiological properties1 aSharma, Mamta1 aSonu,1 aKumar, Sunil1 aThakur, Pankaj1 aTorino, Enza1 aJanas, Dawid1 aThakur, Sourbh0 tSustainable materials and technologies.g2021 Dec., v. 30 p.e00352-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23531x2214-99377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.susmat.2021.e003523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01540naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245014900159300001800308520055300326592002800879650001400907650002100921650001900942650001300961650001600974700001500990700001801005700001801023700001301041773010301054856004801157852000901205655001201214IND4483869620221122034242.0120715e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448386962DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-011-4652-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Yang10aPolymerization of acrylonitrile catalyzed by lanthanide-sodium alkoxide clusters Ln2(OCH 2CH 2NMe 2) 12(OH) 2Na 8 [Ln=Yb (1), Nd (2) and Sm (3)]  ap. 2780-2784.  aPolymerization of acrylonitrile was carried out using, for the first time, the lanthanide-sodium alkoxide clusters Ln2(OCH2CH2NMe2)12(OH)2Na8 [Ln=Yb (1), Nd (2) and Sm (3)] as single component catalysts.

The temporal variation of such VOCs was studied together with their relationship to biological, meteorological and physico-chemical factors. Sixty four different VOCs were quantified including halogenated (<LoD to 906 ng L⁻¹), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) (<LoD to 1539 ng L⁻¹), mono-aromatics (<LoD to 4232 ng L⁻¹), oxygenated (<LoD to 1539 ng L⁻¹) and sulfur containing compounds (<LoD to 160 ng L⁻¹). The analyses were performed employing solid phase microextraction (SPME) coupled to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. Pigments such as chlorophyll a correlated with halogenated compounds (e.g. chloroform and dichloromethane) and dimethylsulfide (DMS) was maximal during the spring bloom. Multivariate statistical analyses demonstrated seasonal changes in the VOC signature (more mono-aromatics and alkanes in the winter and halocarbons in the summer). Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated that physico-chemical and meteorological factors such as wind speed and water temperature can influence the detection of VOCs in surface waters as well their productions. Partial least squares (PLS) modelling highlighted the importance of the microalgae signature in spring while macroalgae and sediments dominated at other times. Short term variability in concentrations and fluxes was due to such factors as tidal state, wind speed and seawater temperature. The atmospheric concentrations were significantly less than any regulatory values although no measurements were made in eutrophic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3aanthropogenic activities 3achloroform 3achlorophyll 3acoastal water 3adimethyl sulfide 3aeutrophication 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aleast squares 3amacroalgae 3amarine environment 3amethylene chloride 3amicroalgae 3amodels 3aphysicochemical properties 3aphytoplankton 3apigments 3aprincipal component analysis 3aseasonal variation 3aseawater 3asediments 3asolid phase microextraction 3aspring 3asulfur 3asummer 3asurface water 3avolatile organic compounds 3awater temperature 3awind speed 3awinter1 aMudge, Stephen M.0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2009 Mar. 10, v. 11, no. 3 p.628-641dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b814260m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03289naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001700190245012300207300001900330520179200349592002802141653003002169653002402199653001302223653002802236653000902264653000802273653001002281653001002291653000802301653000902309653000902318653000902327653000702336653000902343653000802352700002102360700002202381700002402403700005602427700001902483700002102502700001602523700002102539700002002560773008702580856008302667852000902750655001202759IND60555277520221121085527.0161026e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055527752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcmgh.2015.12.0022doi7 aPMC47692212pmcid7 a269738642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Jinsheng10aEnvironmental Enteric Dysfunction Includes a Broad Spectrum of Inflammatory Responses and Epithelial Repair Processes  ap. 158-174.e1.  aEnvironmental enteric dysfunction (EED), a chronic diffuse inflammation of the small intestine, is associated with stunting in children in the developing world. The pathobiology of EED is poorly understood because of the lack of a method to elucidate the host response. This study tested a novel microarray method to overcome limitation of RNA sequencing to interrogate the host transcriptome in feces in Malawian children with EED.In 259 children, EED was measured by lactulose permeability (%L). After isolating low copy numbers of host messenger RNA, the transcriptome was reliably and reproducibly profiled, validated by polymerase chain reaction. Messenger RNA copy number then was correlated with %L and differential expression in EED. The transcripts identified were mapped to biological pathways and processes. The children studied had a range of %L values, consistent with a spectrum of EED from none to severe.We identified 12 transcripts associated with the severity of EED, including chemokines that stimulate T-cell proliferation, Fc fragments of multiple immunoglobulin families, interferon-induced proteins, activators of neutrophils and B cells, and mediators that dampen cellular responses to hormones. EED-associated transcripts mapped to pathways related to cell adhesion, and responses to a broad spectrum of viral, bacterial, and parasitic microbes. Several mucins, regulatory factors, and protein kinases associated with the maintenance of the mucous layer were expressed less in children with EED than in normal children.EED represents the activation of diverse elements of the immune system and is associated with widespread intestinal barrier disruption. Differentially expressed transcripts, appropriately enumerated, should be explored as potential biomarkers.  aPublisher supplied data 0aEnvironmental Enteropathy 0aFecal Transcriptome 0aStunting 0aIntestinal Inflammation 0adHAZ 0aEED 0aFARMS 0aG-CSF 0aHAZ 0aIRON 0aKEGG 0amRNA 0a%L 0aqPCR 0aRMA1 aOrdiz, M.

A number of preclinical in vivo and in vitro experiments as well as clinical trials have shown a wide range of biological and pharmacological properties of polyphenolic compounds such as anti-oxidative, antimicrobial, anti-allergic, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, chemoprotective, neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects. Epigallocatechin gallate controls high blood pressure, decreases blood cholesterol and body fat and decreases the risk of osteoporotic fractures.

Verdc.) Landraces  aResource is Open Access  aField studies on the effect of differing seedcoat colour on plant growth and symbiotic performance of three Bambara groundnut landraces using the 15N natural abundance technique and ureide analysis in the xylem stream and petiole extracts revealed a consistent pattern in nodule function between ureide levels and shoot δ15N values, as well as between ureide levels and percent N derived from fixation at Gbalahi, Kpalisogu, and Manga. At those three sites, where shoot δ15N was low and percent N derived from fixation high, ureide concentrations in the xylem sap and petiole extracts were also high, indicating that the two techniques were comparatively quite robust in estimating N2 fixation at a higher precision in the test Bambara groundnut landraces. A comparison of the effect of differing seedcoat pigmentation on the concentration of phenolics released by imbibed seeds showed that the Black landrace contained higher levels of flavonoids and anthocyanins, followed by the Red, and lowest in the Cream landrace. The Black landrace also recorded much higher nodule number and nodule fresh weight per plant, greater shoot biomass, lower shoot δ15N values, greater N derived from fixation, higher symbiotic N contribution, and increased water-use efficiency across all the five study sites, followed by the Red landrace, which produced the highest grain yield. Black seedcoat pigmentation in Bambara groundnut is therefore a marker for increased nodulation, N2 fixation, and plant growth that can be tapped in breeding programs for developing high N2-fixing, water-use efficient grain legumes for use by farmers in Africa.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVigna subterranea 3aagronomy 3aanthocyanins 3abiomass 3acolor 3acream 3agrain yield 3alandraces 3anitrogen fixation 3anodulation 3apetioles 3aphenolic compounds 3apigmentation 3aplant growth 3asap 3aseed coat 3atranspiration 3awater use efficiency 3axylem 3aAfrica 0a15N natural abundance 0ashoot δ 15N 0aureides 0aN-fixed 0anodulation 0aphenolics1 aPuozaa, Doris K.1 aJaiswal, Sanjay K.1 aDakora, Felix D.0 tFrontiers in agronomy.g2021 Aug., v. 3dFrontiers Media S.A.wJournal:27918x2673-32187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fagro.2021.6922383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245014500167300001800312520109600330592002801426650003401454650001701488650001401505650001401519650000901533650001201542650002801554650001501582700001701597700002001614700001701634700002201651700002201673700005901695773014701754856007701901852000901978655001201987IND60603883520221120085631.0201118e20180314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060388352DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b011012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyland, Elizabeth S.10aTabletop Femtosecond M-edge X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure of FeTPPCl: Metalloporphyrin Photophysics from the Perspective of the Metal  ap. 4691-4696.  aIron porphyrins are the active sites of many natural and artificial catalysts, and their photoinduced dynamics have been described as either relaxation into a vibrationally hot ground state or as a cascade through metal-centered states. In this work, we directly probe the metal center of iron(III) tetraphenyl porphyrin chloride (FeTPPCl) using femtosecond M₂,₃-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Photoexcitation at 400 nm produces a (π,π*) state that evolves in 70 fs to an iron(II) ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) state. The LMCT state relaxes to a vibrationally hot ground state in 1.13 ps, without involvement of (d,d) intermediates. The tabletop extreme-ultraviolet probe, combined with semiempirical ligand field multiplet calculations, clearly distinguishes between metal-centered and ligand-centered excited states and resolves competing accounts of Fe(III) porphyrin relaxation. This work introduces tabletop M-edge XANES as a valuable tool for measuring femtosecond dynamics of molecular transition metal complexes in the condensed phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aactive sites 3acatalysts 3achlorides 3airon 3aligands 3aphotochemical reactions 3aporphyrins1 aLin, Ming-Fu1 aVerkamp, Max A.1 aZhang, Kaili1 aBenke, Kristopher1 aCarlson, Michaela1 aVura-Weis, Josh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7734-31300 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Mar. 14, v. 140, no. 13 p.4691-4696dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b011013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01888naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245005500156300001800211520089800229592002801127650001801155650001801173650001201191650002101203650002401224650001901248650001301267700006201280773014701342856007601489852000901565655001201574IND60603883620221120085731.0180716e20180409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060388362DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b011062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Rong10aPolymer Valence Isomerism: Poly(Dewar-o-xylylene)s  ap. 5211-5216.  aPoly(o-xylylene) (POX) has long been a challenging synthetic target despite its simple structure and potentially useful physical properties. In this report, we demonstrate a valence isomer strategy that leads to the formation of high molecular weight POX via an intermediate polymer of a unique structure, namely poly(Dewar-o-xylylene) (PDOX). We show that the free radical polymerization of highly strained Dewar-o-xylylene (DOX) monomer afforded PDOX, a material with a high density of Dewar benzene units in the backbone through ring-retaining propagation. The thermal- and photoinduced isomerizations of PDOX to produce POX were investigated. This chemistry yields POXs that are difficult to obtain using traditional methods. Moreover, it also provides a potential entry into new reconfigurable materials featuring highly efficient postpolymerization main chain structural transformations.  aPublisher supplied data 3afree radicals 3aisomerization 3aisomers 3amolecular weight 3aphysical properties 3apolymerization 3apolymers1 aSwager, Timothy M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3577-05100 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Apr. 09, v. 140, no. 15 p.5211-5216dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b011063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245012700169506010400296506007600400520110500476592002801581506003701609650002001646650001101666650001701677650001501694650001501709650002101724650001701745650001101762650001301773651001001786653002201796653002301818653001201841653002201853653002801875653001601903653000901919653000801928653000801936653000801944653000801952653000801960653000901968700001801977700001901995700002202014700001402036700001802050700003302068773011002101856008802211852000902299655001202308IND60787467320221207061914.0220921e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078746732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2022.1039142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Zhicai10aImproving paleoenvironment in North China aided Triassic biotic recovery on land following the end-Permian mass extinction  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe driver of the Early–Middle Triassic biotic recovery on land following the end-Permian crisis is puzzling. Here, we show the biotic recovery was gradual and spanned up to 8 Myr after the end-Permian mass extinction, based on continuous, well-dated sections over large areas in the northeastern Ordos Basin, North China. Initial recovery began in the Olenekian, marked by the disappearance of microbially induced sedimentary structures and reappearance of bioturbation, and continued in the Anisian, with a bloom of plants and tetrapods and intense bioturbation. Sedimentary environments changed from Induan braided-eolian conditions to Olenekian–Anisian shallow lacustrine and meandering river systems, marking an overall deepening lacustrine system. Carbonate δ¹³C and geochemical proxies of weathering intensity, salinity and clayiness reveal an overall warm and semi-humid paleoclimate in the Olenekian–Anisian. This improved stable paleoenvironment of warm and semi-humid conditions likely contributed to the biotic recovery following the Permian-Triassic hyperthermal-related crisis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTriassic period 3abasins 3abioturbation 3acarbonates 3aextinction 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3arivers 3asalinity 3aChina 0aTriassic recovery 0aErmaying Formation 0aAnisian 0aLacustrine system 0aSedimentary environment 0aOrdos Basin 0aEPME 0aPTB 0aCIA 0aCIW 0aPIA 0aICV 0aMISS1 aLiu, Yongqing1 aKuang, Hongwei1 aNewell, Andrew J.1 aPeng, Nan1 aCui, Mingming1 aBenton, M.

It can improve torsional behavior as well as flexural and shear behavior. However, analysis of the torsional behavior of SFRC members is quite complicated because force equilibrium and strain compatibility in a three-dimensional space should be satisfied. Accordingly, many studies proposed empirical evaluation equations for the torsional strength of SFRC members based on experimental results. Therefore, this study derived a constitutive model of SFRC in tension, which greatly influences the torsional behavior of SFRC, based on the test results of SFRC shear panels under biaxial stress, and this tensile behavior model was introduced to a fixed-angle softened-truss model. A theoretical evaluation model based on the modified fixed-angle model for torsional behavior of SFRC was developed, and the performance of the analytical model was also evaluated compared to test results obtained from literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite materials 3aconcrete 3aequations 3amodels 3atorsional strength1 aLee, Deuck Hang1 aHwang, Jin-Ha1 aKang, Joo-Won1 aKim, Kang-su,1 aOh, Young-Hun0 tComposites.g2013 Feb., v. 45, no. 1 p.215-231dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2012.09.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03656naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245017500210300001800385520200800403592002802411650002802439650002302467650002102490650002202511650001402533650001902547650001002566650001402576650001402590650002602604650002402630650003102654650000902685653002302694653002102717653002302738653004202761700002702803700002702830700002702857700006302884700002202947773011302969856008303082852000903165655001203174IND60752482920221122031408.0220621e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075248292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2021.09.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaranikas, Ioannis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7245-995910aBody composition parameters and functional status test in predicting future acute exacerbation risk among hospitalized patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  ap. 5605-5614.  aChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Nutritional and functional status derangement is a commonly seen in COPD patients, and this is associated with a higher disease severity and mortality. To assess body composition analysis - measured by segmental multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)- and functional status and investigate their relationship with the COPD acute exacerbation risk. Eighty COPD patients admitted to hospital for COPD acute exacerbation were prospectively followed-up for one year after discharge, focusing on a new incidence of COPD acute exacerbation. Following discharge, participants’ body composition was assessed with the use of segmental multi-frequency BIA, whereas physical function by performing 5-repetitions and 30 s sit-to-stand (STS) tests. Unadjusted and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the ability of the various measures to predict incidence of future COPD acute exacerbation in one-year period. Seventy-six out of 80 participants completed the study and were analyzed. Fifty-one [24 male (47.1%)] out of 76 participants (67.1%), mean aged of 69.3 ± 8.9 years, developed at least one new COPD acute exacerbation during the one year follow-up. The probability of COPD acute exacerbation in one year was significantly related to BMI (OR = 0.75, 95% CI; 0.61–0.91, p = 0.004) and Fat Free Mass (OR = 0.88, 95% CI; 0.79–0.97, p = 0.012) after adjustment for sex, age and smoking index (pack × years). Both 5-repetitions and 30 s STS tests had a good predictive ability for the incidence of COPD acute exacerbation in one year (AUC = 0.80, 95% CI; 0.65–0.95, p = 0.009 and AUC = 0.83, 95% CI; 0.70–0.96, p = 0.004, respectively). In an observational study among patients admitted with COPD acute exacerbation, body composition analysis parameters and functional status are related to acute exacerbation risk incidence.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioelectrical impedance 3aclinical nutrition 3adisease severity 3afunctional status 3ahospitals 3alean body mass 3amales 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aobservational studies 3aregression analysis 3arespiratory tract diseases 3arisk 0aNutritional status 0aBody composition 0aAcute exacerbation 0aChronic obstructive pulmonary disease1 aKarayiannis, Dimitrios1 aKarachaliou, Alexandra1 aPapanikolaou, Aggeliki1 aChourdakis, Michail1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9490-83561 aKakavas, Sotirios0 tClinical nutrition.g2021 Nov., v. 40, no. 11 p.5605-5614dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2021.09.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01748naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011100171300001400282520081300296592002801109650001001137650001401147650001701161650001001178700001501188700001501203700004001218773009801258856008101356852000901437655001201446IND60085697120221118060137.0141101e20110408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008569712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2011.02.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrindlay, Guillermo10aAtomic spectrometry methods for wine analysis: A critical evaluation and discussion of recent applications  ap. 18-32.  aThe analysis of wine is of great importance since wine components strongly determine its stability, organoleptic or nutrition characteristics. In addition, wine analysis is also important to prevent fraud and to assess toxicological issues. Among the different analytical techniques described in the literature, atomic spectrometry has been traditionally employed for elemental wine analysis due to its simplicity and good analytical figures of merit. The scope of this review is to summarize the main advantages and drawbacks of various atomic spectrometry techniques for elemental wine analysis. Special attention is paid to interferences (i.e. matrix effects) affecting the analysis as well as the strategies available to mitigate them. Finally, latest studies about wine speciation are briefly discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3afraud 3anutrition 3aspectroscopy 3awines1 aMora, Juan1 aGras, Luis1 ade Loos-Vollebregt, Margaretha T.C.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2011 Apr. 8, v. 691, no. 1-2 p.18-32dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2011.02.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03664naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245012100166300001800287520201500305592002802320650001602348650001502364650001702379650003002396650001002426650001302436650001602449650001602465650001302481650001402494650001302508650001302521650001102534650001302545700002602558700002502584700002202609700002202631700002202653700001902675700002002694700006102714700006002775700002002835700006002855773014602915856007603061852000903137655001203146IND60603883820221120085648.0180716e20180531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060388382DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b011362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonnelly, Daniel P.10aCyclic Thiosulfinates and Cyclic Disulfides Selectively Cross-Link Thiols While Avoiding Modification of Lone Thiols  ap. 7377-7380.  aThis work addresses the need for chemical tools that can selectively form cross-links. Contemporary thiol-selective cross-linkers, for example, modify all accessible thiols, but only form cross-links between a subset. The resulting terminal “dead-end” modifications of lone thiols are toxic, confound cross-linking-based studies of macromolecular structure, and are an undesired, and currently unavoidable, byproduct in polymer synthesis. Using the thiol pair of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), we demonstrated that cyclic disulfides, including the drug/nutritional supplement lipoic acid, efficiently cross-linked thiol pairs but avoided dead-end modifications. Thiolate-directed nucleophilic attack upon the cyclic disulfide resulted in thiol–disulfide exchange and ring cleavage. The resulting disulfide-tethered terminal thiolate moiety either directed the reverse reaction, releasing the cyclic disulfide, or participated in oxidative disulfide (cross-link) formation. We hypothesized, and confirmed with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, that mono-S-oxo derivatives of cyclic disulfides formed a terminal sulfenic acid upon ring cleavage that obviated the previously rate-limiting step, thiol oxidation, and accelerated the new rate-determining step, ring cleavage. Our calculations suggest that the origin of accelerated ring cleavage is improved frontier molecular orbital overlap in the thiolate-disulfide interchange transition. Five- to seven-membered cyclic thiosulfinates were synthesized and efficiently cross-linked up to 10⁴-fold faster than their cyclic disulfide precursors; functioned in the presence of biological concentrations of glutathione; and acted as cell-permeable, potent, tolerable, intracellular cross-linkers. This new class of thiol cross-linkers exhibited click-like attributes including, high yields driven by the enthalpies of disulfide and water formation, orthogonality with common functional groups, water-compatibility, and ring strain-dependence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3abyproducts 3acrosslinking 3adensity functional theory 3adrugs 3aenthalpy 3aglutathione 3alipoic acid 3amoieties 3aoxidation 3apolymers 3asulfides 3athiols 3atoxicity1 aDowgiallo, Matthew G.1 aSalisbury, Joseph P.1 aAluri, Krishna C.1 aIyengar, Suhasini1 aChaudhari, Meenal1 aMathew, Merlit1 aMiele, Isabella1 aAuclair, Jared R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3094-15441 aLopez, Steven A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8418-36381 aManetsch, Roman1 aAgar, Jeffrey N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2645-18730 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 May 31, v. 140, no. 24 p.7377-7380dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b011363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003000152245010800182300001600290520095000306592002801256650002001284650001401304650001501318650001001333650001601343650001501359650001701374650001001391650001301401650001701414650006601431650001801497650001901515650001701534650001101551650001401562650000901576650001301585650001701598650001301615650001001628653002001638653002101658653001901679653001701698653001301715653001101728700001901739700002201758700003201780773008801812856008701900852000901987655001201996IND60625852320221119190428.0181218e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062585232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anaerobe.2018.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCobo Martínez, Fernando,10aPolymicrobial anaerobic bacteremia due to Atopobium rimae and Parvimonas micra in a patient with cancer  ap. 260-263.  aAtopobium rimae and Parvimonas micra are both Gram-positive anaerobes involved infrequently in human infections.

Treatment with levofloxacin was started and subsequently it was changed to piperacillin/tazobactam plus metronidazole and completed for 10 days, but the patient died days later due to her underlying disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAtopobium rimae 3aanaerobes 3abacteremia 3ablood 3aclindamycin 3adesorption 3adrug therapy 3afever 3aimipenem 3alevofloxacin 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3ametronidazole 3amicroorganisms 3amoxifloxacin 3anausea 3aneoplasms 3apain 3apatients 3apiperacillin 3avomiting 3awomen 0aAtopobium rimae 0aParvimonas micra 0aBlood cultures 0aMALDI-TOF MS 0aAnaerobe 0aCancer1 aBorrego, Jaime1 aRojo, Mª Dolores1 aNavarro-Marí, José María0 tAnaerobe.g2018 Dec., v. 54 p.260-263dElsevier LtdwJournal:12008x1075-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2018.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02286naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245004500163300001800208500001900226500001100245520116600256592002801422596006601450650001501516650001901531650001301550650002101563700001801584700002101602700005501623700001801678773014901696856008201845852000901927655001201936IND60731118920221120055743.0210317e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073111892DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-020-03676-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Dejun10aDrugging the “undruggable” microRNAs  ap. 1861-1871.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aAs a naturally occurring class of gene regulators, microRNAs (miRNAs) have attracted much attention as promising targets for therapeutic development. However, RNAs including miRNAs have long been considered undruggable, and most efforts have been devoted to using synthetic oligonucleotides to regulate miRNAs. Encouragingly, recent findings have revealed that miRNAs can also be drugged with small molecules that directly target miRNAs. In this review paper, we give a summary of recently emerged small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) and small-molecule degraders (SMDs) for miRNAs. SMIs are small molecules that directly bind to miRNAs to inhibit their biogenesis, and SMDs are bifunctional small molecules that upon binding to miRNAs induce miRNA degradation. Strategies for discovering SMIs and developing SMDs were summarized. Applications of SMIs and SMDs in miRNA inhibition and cancer therapy were also introduced. Overall, SMIs and SMDs introduced here have high potency and specificity in miRNA inhibition. We envision that these small molecules will pave the way for developing novel therapeutics toward miRNAs that were previously considered undruggable.  aPublisher supplied data  a202002118cFoundation of Yancheng City No.1 People's Hospital 3abiogenesis 3acancer therapy 3amicroRNA 3aoligonucleotides1 aWan, Xinqiang1 aShan, Xiangxiang1 aFan, Rengen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7882-03731 aZha, Wenzhang0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2021 Mar., v. 78, no. 5 p.1861-1871dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-020-03676-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03360naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245011400206300001200320520187800332592002802210650002402238650002002262650002202282650001302304650001502317650000902332650002302341650001202364650001502376650001702391650004102408650001402449650001802463650001302481650001302494650001602507650001902523650001102542650001802553700005902571700006302630773010502693856008302798852000902881655001202890IND60784475720221119111817.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078447572DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-022-03702-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZakavi, Maryam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2597-596910aMaize growth response to different Bacillus strains isolated from a salt-marshland area under salinity stress  ap. 367.  aMaize (Zea mays) growth performance has been hindered due to the high soil salinity. Salinity is one of the most severe abiotic stresses that has led to growth imbalance and profitability of harvests in arid and semi-arid regions. Plants have taken advantage of salt-tolerant bacteria as plant growth-promoters to enhance growth and reduce the adverse effects of salinity through the regulation of some biochemical, physiological, and molecular features. Preferences for non-chemical, eco-friendly, and economical approaches have caused the inquiry of the Bacillus genus as a joint group of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria known to alleviate salt-stress impacts. In the present study, halotolerant Bacillus strains were isolated from salt-marshland soil and characterized for their physiological, molecular, and biochemical properties. Twenty-four bacterial isolates collected from high saline fields of salt marshland were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS proteome analysis, which confirmed the taxonomic affiliation with Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus atrophaeus, and Bacillus thorngiensis. Applying the isolates on maize plants as bio-inoculant bacteria obviously increased the growth parameters (P < 0.01). Pot experiments showed that isolates 74 and 90 were the most prominent strains to minimize the harmful effects of salinity. Its effects are heightening the potassium/sodium ratio and K-Na selectivity in shoots and roots measured by flame atomic absorption photometry (AAS). Accordingly, Bacillus cereus isolate 74 showed a maximum increase in dry weights of the shoot (133.89%), root (237.08%), length of the shoot (125%), and root (119.44%) compared to the control condition. Our findings suggest that bacteria isolated from marshland may be an economical and simple means to increase plant growth and resistance to high salinity soil conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus atrophaeus 3aBacillus cereus 3aBacillus subtilis 3aZea mays 3aabsorption 3acorn 3agrowth performance 3amarshes 3aphotometry 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3apotassium 3aprofitability 3aproteome 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium 3asoil salinity1 aAskari, Hossein1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8973-366X1 aShahrooei, Mohammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4974-34410 tBMC plant biology.g2022 Dec., v. 22, no. 1 p.367-367dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-022-03702-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245012100178300001400299520110300313592002801416650003701444650002201481650001301503650001801516650001001534650001301544650003901557650002501596650001901621650001901640650002201659650001101681650003201692650003701724650003701761650001901798653003301817653001601850653002801866653002401894700002201918700002201940700002501962700001901987700002802006773010602034856008602140852000902226655001202235IND60572984820221119060532.0190318e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057298482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.06.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Álvarez, Leyre10aActive release coating of multilayer assembled branched and ionic β-cyclodextrins onto poly(ethylene terephthalate)  ap. 65-71.  aBranched ionic cyclodextrins multilayers were assembled onto the surface of previously aminolyzed poly(ethylene terephthalate) in order to construct local drug delivery tailored platforms with potential applicability as materials for indwelling medical devices. The construction of the multilayers took place by the alternate deposition of ionic cyclodextrin derivatives and was characterized by surface zeta-potential measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and, after fluorescent labeling of anionic branched cyclodextrins, by UV–vis spectroscopy and confocal fluorescence spectroscopy. Transmission electron microscopy is used for the first time to show the deposited coating, and an average thickness of ∼270nm for 20 bilayered covering was measured. Contact angle measurements showed great differences in the films as the number of cyclodextrin layers was increased, and highly hydrophilic (19.7±1.5° for 10 bilayers) surfaces were obtained. The loading and release capacity of the antimicrobial triclosan, as hydrophobic model molecule, from PET coated surfaces was also studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3acoatings 3acontact angle 3adrugs 3aethylene 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afluorescent labeling 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amedical equipment 3amodels 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3azeta potential 0aPoly(ethylene terephthalate) 0aMultilayers 0aLayer by layer assembly 0aIonic cyclodextrins1 aRuiz-Rubio, Leire1 aLizundia, Erlantz1 aHernáez, Estíbaliz1 aLeón, Luis M.1 aVilas-Vilela, Jose Luis0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 174 p.65-71dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.06.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03706naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245018900207300001800396506010400414506007600518520175400594592002802348506003702376650002302413650002702436650001402463650003102477650002802508650002202536650001402558650003102572650001202603650001202615653003202627653001302659653002802672653003002700653002302730700006102753700006102814700001902875700002202894700002002916700005902936773011302995856008303108852000903191655001203200IND60752483120221207133526.0220621e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075248312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2021.09.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdiamah, Alfred1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0624-619710aPostoperative arginine-enriched immune modulating nutrition: Long-term survival results from a randomised clinical trial in patients with oesophagogastric and pancreaticobiliary cancer  ap. 5482-5485.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aImmune modulating nutrition (IMN) has been shown to reduce postoperative infectious complications and length of stay in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Two studies of IMN in patients undergoing surgery for head and neck cancer also suggested that this treatment might improve long-term survival and progression-free survival. In the present study, we analysed follow-up data from our previous randomised controlled trial of IMN, in patients undergoing surgery for oesophagogastric and pancreaticobiliary cancer, in order to evaluate the long-term impact on survival of postoperative IMN versus an isocaloric, isonitrogenous control feed. This study included patients undergoing surgery for cancers of the pancreas, oesophagus and stomach, who had been randomised in a double-blind manner to receive postoperative jejunostomy feeding with IMN (Stresson, Nutricia Ltd.) or an isonitrogenous, isocaloric feed (Nutrison High Protein, Nutricia) for 10–15 days. The primary outcome was long-term overall survival. There was complete follow-up for all 108 patients, with 54 patients randomised to each group. There were no statistically significant differences between groups by demographics [(age, p = 0.63), sex (p = 0.49) or site of cancer (p = 0.25)]. 30-day mortality was 11.1% in both groups. Mortality in the intervention group was 13%, 31.5%, 70.4%, 85.2%, 88.9%, and 96.3% at 90 days, and 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 years respectively. Corresponding mortality in the control group was 14.8%, 35.2%, 68.6%, 79.6%, 85.2% and 98.1% (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). Early postoperative feeding with arginine-enriched IMN had no impact on long-term survival in patients undergoing surgery for oesophagogastric and pancreaticobiliary cancer.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclinical nutrition 3ademographic statistics 3aesophagus 3agastrointestinal neoplasms 3ahead and neck neoplasms 3along term effects 3amortality 3arandomized clinical trials 3astomach 3asurgery 0aImmune modulating nutrition 0aArginine 0aOesophagogastric cancer 0aPancreaticobiliary cancer 0aLong-term survival1 aRollins, Katie E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9475-96131 aKapeleris, Audrey1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7659-26531 aWelch, Neil T.1 aIftikhar, Syed Y.1 aAllison, S.

Rock-Eval pyrolysis and fluid inclusion micro-thermometry analyses were performed. The technique has been routinely used for about fifteen years and has become a standard tool for hydrocarbon exploration. Rock-Eval pyrolysis reveals the distribution of organic and mineral carbon affected by the impact and later affected by hydrothermal activity. All measured inclusions are primary and were found in basement samples only. Both the fluid inclusions data and Rock-Eval pyrolysis show that composition and temperature of the fluids changed as the fluids migrated though crater rocks. An evolution of temperatures occurs (vertical, horizontal, or both), from the surface and from the center of the crater; this spatial evolution is consistent with model of Abramov and Kring, showing a thermal evolution of temperature with depth in the crater as well as its influence on the hydrothermal system. Post-impact fluid circulation modifies the temperature distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3ageochemistry 3amodels 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 0aFluid inclusion 0aMeteorite 0aChicxulub crater 0aMicrothermometry 0aRock-eval 0aOrganic matter1 aMartínez, L.1 aSzamotulski, J.1 aGonzález-Partida, E.1 aMorgan, J.V.1 aLowery, C.M.1 aGulick, S.P.S.1 aRebolledo-Vieyra, M.1 aKring, D.0 tApplied geochemistry.g2022 Feb., v. 137 p.105194-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2021.1051943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013200166520139300298592002801691650001901719650001701738650001001755650002601765650004101791650001801832650000901850650001501859650001801874650002101892650001701913650002001930651001001950653001801960653002501978653002902003653002802032653001202060653002802072700001802100700001602118700001902134700001402153700001802167700002002185773009502205856008302300852000902383655001202392IND60708323020221119003903.0211030e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070832302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2020.1007392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Dong-Ju10aTranscriptome analysis of unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis shows essential genes in sprouting of Acer truncatum Bunge seeds  aThe seeds of Acer truncatum Bunge (ATB) are rich in unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), especially nervonic acid, an important nutrient for the growth and maintenance of the brain. Therefore, the oil of ATB seeds has been approved as a New Resource Food in China. In the present study, changes of transcriptomic profiling and contents of UFA during the sprouting of ATB seeds were analyzed. The results of RNA-seq-based transcriptome analysis showed that the transcription of genes in various metabolic pathways, including the biosynthesis pathway of UFA, were significantly altered during seed sprouting. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry assay consistently showed that the content of palmitoleic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, gondoic acid, arachidic acid, behenic acid, nervonic acid and lignoceric acid increased 77.9, 20.9, 39.6, 26.3, 95.6, 80.0, 41.7 and 141%, respectively, while the content of oleic acid decreased 49.2%, after sprouting. The whole coding sequence regions of genes involved in the UFA biosynthesis were cloned and sequenced, and the alignment analysis predicted that omega-6 fatty acid desaturase and short-chain type dehydrogenase/reductase might have important roles in the biosynthesis of UFA during the sprouting. The results suggested that nervonic acid could be enriched in ATB seeds via sprouting-stimulation, which had not been previously observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer truncatum 3abiosynthesis 3abrain 3afatty acid desaturase 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3anervonic acid 3aoils 3aoleic acid 3apalmitic acid 3apalmitoleic acid 3astearic acid 3atranscriptomics 3aChina 0aYuanbao maple 0aAcer truncatum Bunge 0aTranscriptome sequencing 0aBioinformatics analysis 0aCloning 0aUnsaturated fatty acids1 aLuo, Xue-Gang1 aYan, Li-Hua1 aSi, Chuan-Ling1 aWang, Nan1 aHe, Hong-Peng1 aZhang, Tong-Cun0 tFood bioscience.g2021 June, v. 41 p.100739-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2020.1007393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03360naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245007000208520207500278592002802353650005302381650001202434650002102446650001002467650001802477650001802495650001402513650001802527650001302545650002402558653001202582653002702594653001702621653001102638700002302649700002202672700002402694700002102718773010502739856008502844852000902929655001202938IND60740973220221119224049.0210904e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074097322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2021.1113872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNigra, Anne E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5033-034510aUrinary arsenic and heart disease mortality in NHANES 2003–2014  aEvidence evaluating the prospective association between low-to moderate-inorganic arsenic (iAs) exposure and cardiovascular disease in the general US population is limited. We evaluated the association between urinary arsenic concentrations in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003–2014 and heart disease mortality linked from the National Death Index through 2015.We modeled iAs exposure as urinary total arsenic and dimethylarsinate among participants with low seafood intake, based on low arsenobetaine levels (N = 4990). We estimated multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for heart disease mortality per interquartile range (IQR) increase in urinary arsenic levels using survey-weighted, Cox proportional hazards models, and evaluated flexible dose-response analyses using restricted quadratic spline models. We updated a previously published relative risk of coronary heart disease mortality from a dose-response meta-analysis per a doubling of water iAs (e.g., from 10 to 20 μg/L) with our results from NHANES 2003–2014, assuming all iAs exposure came from drinking water.A total of 77 fatal heart disease events occurred (median follow-up time 75 months). The adjusted HRs (95% CI) of heart disease mortality for an increase in urinary total arsenic and DMA corresponding to the interquartile range were 1.20 (0.83, 1.74) and 1.18 (0.68, 2.05), respectively. Restricted quadratic splines indicate a significant association between increasing urinary total arsenic and the HR of fatal heart disease for all participants at the lowest exposure levels <4.5 μg/L. The updated pooled relative risk of coronary heart disease mortality per doubling of water iAs (μg/L) was 1.16 (95% CI 1.07, 1.25).Despite a small number of events, relatively short follow-up time, and high analytical limits of detection for urinary arsenic species, iAs exposure at low-to moderate-levels is consistent with increased heart disease mortality in NHANES 2003–2014 although the associations were only significant in flexible dose-response models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aarsenic 3acoronary disease 3adeath 3adose response 3ameta-analysis 3amortality 3arelative risk 3aresearch 3aseafood consumption 0aArsenic 0aCardiovascular disease 0aEpidemiology 0aNHANES1 aMoon, Katherine A.1 aJones, Miranda R.1 aSanchez, Tiffany R.1 aNavas-Acien, Ana0 tEnvironmental research.g2021 Sept., v. 200 p.111387-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.1113873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03442naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011300164300001200277520206900289592002802358650000902386650001602395650001902411650001902430650001402449650002902463650001002492650002402502650002702526650001702553650001202570650002902582650002002611700001902631700001702650700001802667700001902685700001902704700001902723700001602742700001702758773010502775856008302880852000902963655001202972IND60784475920221119112117.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078447592DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-022-03767-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Zhenyu10aTranscriptome-based gene regulatory network analyses of differential cold tolerance of two tobacco cultivars  ap. 369.  aBACKGROUND: Cold is one of the main abiotic stresses that severely affect plant growth and development, and crop productivity as well. Transcriptional changes during cold stress have already been intensively studied in various plant species. However, the gene networks involved in the regulation of differential cold tolerance between tobacco varieties with contrasting cold resistance are quite limited. RESULTS: Here, we conducted multiple time-point transcriptomic analyses using Tai tobacco (TT, cold susceptibility) and Yan tobacco (YT, cold resistance) with contrasting cold responses. We identified similar DEGs in both cultivars after comparing with the corresponding control (without cold treatment), which were mainly involved in response to abiotic stimuli, metabolic processes, kinase activities. Through comparison of the two cultivars at each time point, in contrast to TT, YT had higher expression levels of the genes responsible for environmental stresses. By applying Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), we identified two main modules: the pink module was similar while the brown module was distinct between the two cultivars. Moreover, we obtained 100 hub genes, including 11 important transcription factors (TFs) potentially involved in cold stress, 3 key TFs in the brown module and 8 key TFs in the pink module. More importantly, according to the genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) between TFs and other genes or TFs by using GENIE3, we identified 3 TFs (ABI3/VP1, ARR-B and WRKY) mainly functioning in differential cold responses between two cultivars, and 3 key TFs (GRAS, AP2-EREBP and C2H2) primarily involved in cold responses. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our study provides valuable resources for transcriptome- based gene network studies of cold responses in tobacco. It helps to reveal how key cold responsive TFs or other genes are regulated through network. It also helps to identify the potential key cold responsive genes for the genetic manipulation of tobacco cultivars with enhanced cold tolerance in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3acold stress 3acold tolerance 3acold treatment 3acultivars 3agene regulatory networks 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3agrowth and development 3aplant growth 3atobacco 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics1 aZhou, Zhicheng1 aLi, Yangyang1 aTao, Shentong1 aHu, Zheng-Rong1 aYang, Jia-Shuo1 aCheng, Xuejiao1 aHu, Risheng1 aZhang, Wenli0 tBMC plant biology.g2022 Dec., v. 22, no. 1 p.369-369dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-022-03767-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03931naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245008200198300001600280500002000296500001500316520223000331592002802561596011302589650002002702650001202722650001302734650001702747650001602764650002402780650001502804650001102819650001102830650001702841650002502858650001702883650002002900650001402920650001002934650001802944650001002962650001102972653001902983700001803002700001903020700001503039700001403054700001703068700001703085700001703102700001603119773013503135856007403270852000903344655001203353IND60611742920221123032539.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061174292DNAL7 a10.1111/ejss.126772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMassaccesi, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5498-829110aOrganic carbon pools and storage in the soil of olive groves of different age  ap. 843-855.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aSUMMARY: Compared with annual crop cultivation, tree groves might represent a relevant land‐use system to improve C sequestration, but few data are available to support this hypothesis. To evaluate the potential of olive tree (Olea europaea L., 1753) cultivation to store soil organic C (SOC), we assessed (i) the distribution of organic C in active (water‐extractable and particulate organic C, WEOC and POC, respectively), intermediate (organic matter associated with stable sand‐size aggregates and silt‐ and clay‐size aggregates, SSAs and SCAs, respectively) and passive (organic matter resistant to oxidation, rSOM) pools, (ii) the phenol content of the C pools, (iii) the humic‐C distribution of the intermediate C pool and (iv) the stocks of SOC pools in two olive groves of different age (7 years (OG7) and 30 years (OG30)) compared with a nearby site with cereal crops (arable soil, AS). In OG30 the organic C stock of the olive grove was no different from that of the AS, but the distribution of SOC pools changed with the age of the olive groves. The WEOC and POC increased in the Ap horizon of OGs, probably because of the herbaceous cover and distribution of chipped prunings on the soil. There were fewer SSAs in OG7 than AS, possibly because of pedoturbations from deep tillage before the olive trees were established, but they increased in OG30. The increase in SSAs and SCAs in the Bw and BC horizons of OG30 was associated with humic‐C and unextractable‐C and a smaller phenol content than AS. This suggested that the olive tree roots had a positive role through rhizodeposition and root turnover, which favoured the stabilization of organic matter into aggregates at depth. In contrast to the active and intermediate C pools, the passive C pool did not vary following the change in land use from arable to olive grove. HIGHLIGHTS: Effects of land‐use change from arable to olive grove on soil organic C pools and stocks. Soil organic C stock increased from 7‐ to 30‐year‐old olive orchard. Olive tree cultivation affected active and intermediate C pools, but not the passive C pool. After 30 years, the olive grove stored an amount of SOC similar to that of the arable system.  aPublisher supplied data  aPRIN Project 2010‐2011 prot. 201049EXTW_009 ‘‘cItalian Ministry of Education, University and Research 3aland use change 3aannuals 3aorchards 3adeep tillage 3agrain crops 3asoil organic carbon 3aA horizons 3aphenol 3aolives 3aarable soils 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3arhizodeposition 3aoxidation 3atrees 3aOlea europaea 3aroots 3agroves 0aorganic matter1 aDe Feudis, M.1 aAgnelli, A.

These analyses require simplifying assumptions that may impact the results of hypothesis tests and subsequent conclusions about the factors impacting survival. Modern statistical methods can reduce the dependence of analyses on these simplifying assumptions. State-space models and the related concept of random effects allow the modeling of both process and observation error. Nonlinear models and associated estimation techniques allow for flexibility in the system model, including density dependence, and in error structure. Population dynamics models link information from one stage to the next and over multiple time periods and automatically accommodate missing observations. We investigate the impact of observation error, density dependence, population dynamics, and data for multiple stages on hypothesis testing using data for longfin smelt in the San Francisco Bay-Delta.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpirinchus thaleichthys 3anonlinear models 3apopulation dynamics 3astatistical analysis 0aData assimilation 0aLongfin smelt 0aPopulation dynamics 0aRandom effects 0aState-space model 0aSurvival1 aDeriso, R.

In L. brevis, the GAD system comprises a transcriptional regulator (Gad-tr), a glutamate γ-aminobutyrate antiporter (GadC) and two glutamate decarboxylases (GadB₁, GadB₂). Hop iso-α-acids act as ionophores, which impair cells’ proton motive force. Hop-tolerant bacteria must therefore express effective mechanisms of pH maintenance such as the GAD system. To elucidate the specific roles of the two Gad isoenzymes, we examined the influence of iso-α-acids on the GAD system on a metabolic and transcriptional level of two L. brevis strains. Highly hop-tolerant L. brevis TMW 1.465 proved to perform better in maintenance of pHᵢₙ in the presence of glutamate under hop stress when compared to the rather hop-sensitive strain L. brevis TMW 1.6. The transcriptional analysis unravelled the up- or downregulation of gad-tr, gadB ₁ and gadC in hop-tolerant and hop-sensitive L. brevis, respectively. Since gadB ₂ expression remained fairly unaltered, we concluded that L. brevis TMW 1.6 employs both Gad isoenzymes under acid stress, whereas L. brevis TMW 1.465 manages to survive with only one isoform (GadB₂) and can consequently master additional hop stress better by inducing gadB ₁ . These findings elucidate the GAD system’s role in high and low tolerance to antimicrobial hop components.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus brevis 3aacid tolerance 3abacteria 3aglutamate decarboxylase 3aglutamates 3ahops 3aionophores 3aisozymes 3apH 3aprotons 3atranscription (genetics)1 aBehr, Jürgen,1 aVogel, Rudi F.0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2013 Aug., v. 237, no. 2 p.199-207dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-013-1980-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03201naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245010500178300001800283520176300301592002802064650001502092650001202107650001902119650001202138650001702150650003202167650001902199650001602218650002002234650001102254650001502265650001702280650002202297650002502319650001002344650001702354650002302371653002302394653001702417653002002434653001702454700002002471700002002491773010002511856008702611852000902698655001202707IND60582435820221117045657.0180830e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058243582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.09.1012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález G., Alonso,10aAssessment of pilot-scale water purification module with electrodialysis technology and solar energy  ap. 1643-1652.  aIn this research, an autonomous power module for the purification of brackish water (TDS=5482mg/L) with high concentration of arsenic (2.04mg/L) was successfully designed, constructed and tested. The energy supply for the module is provided by solar power and includes an electrical energy storage system composed of lithium ion batteries. The purification process combines ion exchange and adsorption technologies (column filtration system) with an electrodialysis (ED) system. Different configurations or process sequences were studied to determine the best operating conditions of the system. The salt removal efficiency and specific electricity consumption (SEC) were determined at each stage. It was found that the process that combines all technologies is more efficient than just using ED for the removal of arsenic and salts. The ion exchange step removes the divalent cations, whereas most of the arsenic is adsorbed in the adsorption column system increasing the removal efficiency in the electrodialysis stage. This combined process reduces the time of desalination and the consumption of electricity during the ED. The lowest specific electricity consumption was 2.16kWh/m³ for the ED and 5.46kWh/m³ for the global system. Salt removal exceeded 95% and in the majority of tests, the arsenic removal was more than 99.9%. The power module with the water purification system has a versatile design that allows working with different salts concentration either for the treatment of water from river or underground, effectively removing arsenic. Our proposed solution is an alternative to the conventional technologies for arsenic removal and the results of this study should be useful for the design of other large-scale water desalination systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aarsenic 3abrackish water 3acations 3adesalination 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aelectrodialysis 3aenergy 3afiltration 3aion exchange 3alithium batteries 3apurification methods 3asalts 3asolar energy 3awater purification 0aWater purification 0aDesalination 0aElecrtodyalisis 0aSolar energy1 aGrágeda, Mario1 aUshak, Svetlana0 tApplied energy.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 206 p.1643-1652dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.09.1013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02036naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245013300179300001400312520092600326592002801252650001801280650002001298650001201318650001201330650001001342650001301352650001001365650001601375651001301391653001601404653002401420653001701444653001801461773009001479856008401569852000901653655001201662IND60566097520221117044654.0170410s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056609752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.proenv.2017.03.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUtarasakul, Tatsanawalai10aEfficiency of Ground Cover Types under Samanea saman on Reducing Outdoor Thermal Environment in Urban Parks of Bangkok, Thailand  ap. 78-82.  aThis research was investigated outdoor thermal environment under Samanea saman based on 2 types of ground covers during January 2015 in 2 urban parks of Bangkok, Thailand. Outdoor temperature was evaluated during 10 am to 2 pm under Samanea saman which were representative of asphalt and grass covering. Average temperature was evaluated at 2 meters far from the stem in north south east west directions, and at 0 and 100 centimeters above the ground. The results revealed that, grass covering at 0 centimeter was the highest ground cover type which can be reduced air temperature by 1.23% compared with other types of ground covers whereas the results were not difference statistically in both different types of ground cover and height. Additionally, Samanea saman were recommended as the suitable tree for planting in urban environment as this species can be reduced outdoor temperature for all types of ground covers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSamanea saman 3aair temperature 3abitumen 3agrasses 3aparks 3aplanting 3atrees 3aurban areas 3aThailand 0aurban parks 0aoutdoor temperature 0aground cover 0aSamanea saman0 tProcedia Environmental Sciences.g2017, v. 37 p.78-82dElsevier B.V.x1878-02967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2017.03.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03012naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003200149245009100181300001600272520157900288592002801867650001401895650001001909650001301919650001201932650001501944650001501959650001401974650001501988650001502003650003002018650001802048650002102066650001402087650001102101650001502112650001102127650001602138650002502154650001402179650002102193653002402214653004102238653002202279700001702301773009502318856008402413852000902497655001202506IND60612569120221122091519.0190416e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061256912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2017.05.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez-Fernandez, Jose S.10aSequential Hydrothermal Liquefaction characterization and nutrient recovery assessment  ap. 274-284.  aHydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) has been considered as an effective process for converting wet algal biomass to biocrude. A major limitation of HTL however, is its inability to harvest high value-added byproducts or recover nutrients. Sequential Hydrothermal Liquefaction (SEQHTL) was recently developed to overcome this limitation to allow the simultaneous extraction of co-products and biocrude production. In this study, the performance for SEQHTL treating different algal species was assessed in terms of process versatility, biocrude production and nutrient recovery. The impact of feedstock and relevant feed stream thermophysical properties was evaluated. The biocrudes produced had moderately low oxygen content (<14%), reduced nitrogen content (<8%), very low sulfur (<1.4%), and HHV ranging from 33 to 37MJ/kg. Galdieria sulphuraria produced less crude (~20wt%) as well as less char (~11wt%). The Chlorella sp. had higher crude yields (~30wt%) and superior nutrient recovery in aqueous effluents, ranging from 2640 to 3600mg/L of phosphorous and from 2100 to 3700mg/L of total nitrogen. The results also show non-Newtonian shear thinning and increasing effective viscosity at higher solid loadings. Although SEQHTL proved more suitable for algae with moderate to high lipid content, its versatility and mild reaction conditions allow for the harvesting significant quantities of water-soluble nutrients. These findings compare favorably to HTL studies and suggest that these compounds can be recovered for either recycle or producing other value-added co-products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella 3aalgae 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abyproducts 3acoproducts 3aeffluents 3afeedstocks 3aharvesting 3ahydrothermal liquefaction 3alipid content 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3asulfur 3avalue added 3avalue-added products 3aviscosity 3awater solubility 0aMicroalgae biofuels 0aSequential Hydrothermal Liquefaction 0aNutrient recovery1 aChen, Shulin0 tAlgal research.g2017 July, v. 25 p.274-284dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2017.05.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03404naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100002100160245010700181300001800288520207600306592002802382650001602410650001202426650001702438650002402455650001902479650001202498650002002510650001902530650001702549650001802566650001502584650001002599650001202609650001302621650002202634650002002656700001702676700001502693700002402708700001702732700001702749773010302766856004402869852000902913655001202922IND4469260920221120103045.0120502e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446926092DNAL7 a224998842pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2011-019472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuttappan, V.

The present study was intended to assess the consumer acceptance of broiler fillets with different degrees of white striping condition. High resolution digital images of fillets, representative of varying degrees of white striping, were shown to 75 consumers in a blind study. Individual images were presented using a completely randomized design. There were 4 replicates of individual fillets within each white striping category (normal = NORM, moderate = MOD, and severe = SEV) and one picture of tray pack (3 fillets) for each category. The consumers were asked to express their overall liking for appearance with a 9-point hedonic scale (9 = like extremely; 1 = dislike extremely) and purchase intent using a 5-point scale (5 = definitely would buy; 1 = definitely would not buy). An open-ended comments section was also included. The results showed that NORM fillets had a significantly higher hedonic score (6.9) than the MOD fillets (6.1), which was also significantly higher than the SEV fillets (4.5), indicating that as severity of white striping increased, the consumer acceptance decreased. From the distribution of the responses, 10.7, 22.4, and 56.7% of the consumers disliked the NORM, MOD, and SEV fillets, respectively. Furthermore, the average purchase intent score for the NORM fillets (3.6) was significantly higher than those with 2 degrees of white striping (2.4 and 2.5, respectively), suggesting that the consumers were more likely to buy NORM fillets. Over 50% of the consumers indicated that they would probably not or definitely not buy MOD or SEV fillets. The correspondence analysis of open-ended comments revealed the major reasons for the dislike of the white-striped meat was that the fillets had a more fatty or marbled appearance. The results of the study suggest that the white striping does affect the consumer acceptance based on the appearance of the fillets.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast meat 3abreasts 3achicken meat 3aconsumer acceptance 3adigital images 3afillets 3afood purchasing 3aimage analysis 3ameat quality 3amuscle fibers 3apurchasing 3atrays 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aConsumer Behavior 2aMeatxstandards1 aLi, Rushang,1 aErf, G.

The aim of this study was to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of vitamin D supplementation alone on cancer incidence and mortality. A systematic review was undertaken. MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, conference abstracts, and clinical trial registries were searched (last search March 2017) for RCTs investigating vitamin D supplementation alone. RCTs with ≥12 mo of follow-up and in participants with a mean or median age ≥60 y were eligible. During-study events were used as the main analysis, but after-study events were included in a secondary analysis. Subgroup analyses concerning different forms of vitamin D supplementation, 25-hydroxyvitamin D status at baseline, vitamin D dose, and exclusion of open-label trials were undertaken. Thirty studies in 18,808 participants were included in the systematic review, with a median follow-up ranging from 1 to 6.2 y. The results of the meta-analysis for during-study events showed no evidence of an effect of vitamin D supplementation for cancer incidence (RR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.15) and cancer-related deaths (RR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.70, 1.04). Including after-study events, the RRs were 1.02 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.13) and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.00), respectively. These results did not appear to be affected by baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D status, vitamin D dose, or the exclusion of open-label trials. We did not find evidence to suggest that vitamin D supplementation alone reduces the incidence of cancer or cancer mortality, even after including long-term follow-up results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepidemiological studies 3ameta-analysis 3amortality 3aneoplasms 3anutrition risk assessment 3arandomized clinical trials 3asystematic review 3avitamin D 0avitamin D 0acancer 0amortality 0asystematic review 0ameta-analysis1 aStewart, Fiona1 aFord, John A.,1 aMacLennan, Graeme1 aAvenell, Alison0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 107, no. 4 p.652-663dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl45206x1938-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqx0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002900147245009100176300001800267500000900285520128000294592002801574650001501602650002701617650001701644650001401661650003301675650001401708650001401722650001401736650001901750650001601769650001901785650001301804650002201817650002501839650002301864650002001887700002501907700002501932700002101957700002001978700002801998700002102026773012302047852000902170856008402179655001202263IND4407569220221121112940.0191228e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440756922DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2007.11.06412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Zijll de Jong, Eline10aGlobal Genetic Diversity of the Perennial Ryegrass Fungal Endophyte Neotyphodium lolii  ap. 1487-1501.  aepub  aThe symbiotic association between perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium lolii is associated with host-specific adaptations, particularly in response to abiotic and biotic stresses. Knowledge of the origin of the symbiosis and the contribution of endophyte genotype to host phenotypic variation is currently limited. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to assess endophyte genetic diversity in a globally distributed collection of perennial ryegrass accessions. Consistent in planta detection was achieved with 18 of 22 SSR markers (primer pairs). Endophytes representing as many as four different taxa were detected in 42 accessions from 20 different countries, N. lolii being predominant. A total of 33 unique N. lolii genotypes were discriminated, of which 29 clustered into three major groups with limited within-group variation. The three major N. lolii groups were associated with distinct perennial ryegrass chloroplast haplotypes. The alkaloid profiles of accessions were apparently associated with the presence of specific N. lolii genotypes. Genotypic analysis provides a powerful method for genetic dissection of the grass–endophyte interaction and prediction of phenotypic variation based on genotypic variation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aendophytes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aforage crops 3aalkaloids 3aEpichloe festucae var. lolii 3aphenotype 3asymbiosis 3asymbionts 3aLolium perenne 3ahost plants 3aforage grasses 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3aphenotypic variation 3amicrobial genetics 3agenetic markers1 aDobrowolski, Mark P.1 aBannan, Nathaniel R.1 aStewart, Alan V.1 aSmith, Kevin F.1 aSpangenberg, Germán C.1 aForster, John W.0 tCrop science.g2008 July, v. 48, no. 4 p.1487-1501dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2007.11.06413Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03191naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245009800173300001800271520152300289592002801812650002701840650002701867650000801894650001601902650001401918650002201932650002201954650001001976650002501986650002602011650001902037650001502056650000902071650001302080650001802093650002102111650002602132650002502158650001502183700002302198700002402221700001802245700002102263700002502284700002202309700002602331700002402357700002002381773014602401856008102547852000902628655001202637IND60569836520221119214710.0170612e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056983652DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-7137-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues-Silva, Caio10aBacteria and fungi inactivation by photocatalysis under UVA irradiation: liquid and gas phase  ap. 6372-6381.  aIn the last decade, environmental risks associated with wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have become a concern in the scientific community due to the absence of specific legislation governing the occupational exposure limits (OEL) for microorganisms present in indoor air. Thus, it is necessary to develop techniques to effectively inactivate microorganisms present in the air of WWTPs facilities. In the present work, ultraviolet light A radiation was used as inactivation tool. The microbial population was not visibly reduced in the bioaerosol by ultraviolet light A (UVA) photolysis. The UVA photocatalytic process for the inactivation of microorganisms (bacteria and fungi, ATCC strains and isolates from indoor air samples of a WWTP) using titanium dioxide (TiO₂ P25) and zinc oxide (ZnO) was tested in both liquid-phase and airborne conditions. In the slurry conditions at liquid phase, P25 showed a better performance in inactivation. For this reason, gas-phase assays were performed in a tubular photoreactor packed with cellulose acetate monolithic structures coated with P25. The survival rate of microorganisms under study decreased with the catalyst load and the UVA exposure time. Inactivation of fungi was slower than resistant bacteria, followed by Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria.

The aim of this paper is the demonstration of a novel mathematical model capable to describe ectotherms life cycle, and to test it in the case of T. absoluta. A mathematical description can help farmers and stakeholders to forecast when the stages at which the insect is most susceptible to control strategies, will be reached. This will allow timely planning for the performance of the most efficient and environmentally friendly control strategy. The model is based on a first order partial differential equation, which can describe the density of population in function of the time t, and physiological age x, and which is driven by the environmental parameters and fundamental conditions for poikilothermic organisms. The result is a simulation of the life cycle, which depicts that the development of the insect is largely due to daily average temperature. This study is strengthened by double validation with semi-field data collected in an experimental greenhouse.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum 3aSolanum 3aTuta absoluta 3acase studies 3adata collection 3adifferential equation 3aectothermy 3aenvironmental factors 3afarmers 3afinancial economics 3agreenhouses 3aleafminers 3amathematical models 3aplanning 3aplant protection 3astakeholders 3atemperature 3atomatoes 0aPhysiological based models 0aVon Foerster’s equation 0aROOT 0aIntegrated Pest Management 0aAlien species1 aSeverini, Maurizio1 aContarini, Mario1 aSperanza, Stefano0 tEcological modelling.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 409 p.108778-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.1087783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100003300141245008900174300001600263520163600279592002801915650001501943650001601958650001901974650001201993650001102005650002102016650001402037650001502051650001802066650001302084650001302097650001902110650001702129650001002146653001902156653002002175653002102195700002102216700002402237700002702261700002202288700002402310700003202334773014302366856007602509852000902585655001202594IND60624371220221118103937.0191016e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062437122DNAL7 a10.1093/ajcn/nqx0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSyage, J.

We analyzed prior clinical data to determine how much gluten is accidentally consumed while on a GFD. The aim was to understand the range of gluten consumption for a wide distribution of CD patients. A meta-analysis was conducted on data from 2 different clinical programs: 1) measurements of gluten in stool and urine in CD and non-CD populations; and 2) analysis of data from trials for the investigational therapeutic latiglutenase. The stool and urine studies included controlled gluten challenges. A calibration factor was applied that allowed normal ingestion of gluten to be computed from the urine and stool measurements. From the latiglutenase trial data, a determination of gluten consumption was made by estimating how much gluten was eliminated from patients’ diets due to a trial effect that led to improved histology even in the placebo group. The average inadvertent exposure to gluten by CD individuals on a GFD was estimated to be ∼150–400 (mean) and ∼100–150 (median) mg/d using the stool test and ∼300–400 (mean) and ∼150 (median) mg/d using the urine test. The analyses of the latiglutenase data for CD individuals with moderate to severe symptoms indicate that patients ingested significantly >200 mg/d of gluten. These surrogate biomarkers of gluten ingestion indicate that many individuals following a GFD regularly consume sufficient gluten to trigger symptoms and perpetuate intestinal histologic damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acalibration 3aceliac disease 3aenzymes 3agluten 3agluten-free diet 3ahistology 3aintestines 3ameta-analysis 3apatients 3aplacebos 3aprotein intake 3atherapeutics 3aurine 0aceliac disease 0agluten exposure 0agluten-free diet1 aKelly, Ciarán P1 aDickason, Matthew A1 aRamirez, Angel Cebolla1 aLéon, Francisco,1 aDominguez, Remedios1 aSealey-Voyksner, Jennifer A0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2018 Feb. 01, v. 107, no. 2 p.201-207dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl45206x1938-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqx0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03795naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245011300174300001600287520210500303592002802408650001502436650001802451650001402469650001102483650001202494650001302506650001902519650001602538650001102554650002902565650003002594650001102624650001102635650001302646650002302659650001702682650001802699650002202717650001102739650001602750650001802766651001502784653001402799653002102813653000902834653001702843700002702860700002202887700001902909700002102928700002202949700002402971773010202995856008703097852000903184655001203193IND60545775320221121215311.0170719e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054577532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.08.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hongliang10aAtmospheric impacts of black carbon emission reductions through the strategic use of biodiesel in California  ap. 412-422.  aThe use of biodiesel as a replacement for petroleum-based diesel fuel has gained interest as a strategy for greenhouse gas emission reductions, energy security, and economic advantage. Biodiesel adoption may also reduce particulate elemental carbon (EC) emissions from conventional diesel engines that are not equipped with after-treatment devices. This study examines the impact of biodiesel blends on EC emissions from a commercial off-road diesel engine and simulates the potential public health benefits and climate benefits.EC emissions from the commercial off-road engine decreased by 76% when ultra-low sulfur commercial diesel (ULSD) fuel was replaced by biodiesel. Model calculations predict that reduced EC emissions translate directly into reduced EC concentrations in the atmosphere, but the concentration of secondary particulate matter was not directly affected by this fuel change. Redistribution of secondary particulate matter components to particles emitted from other sources did change the size distribution and therefore deposition rates of those components. Modification of meteorological variables such as water content and temperature influenced secondary particulate matter formation.Simulations with a source-oriented WRF/Chem model (SOWC) for a severe air pollution episode in California that adopted 75% biodiesel blended with ULSD in all non-road diesel engines reduced surface EC concentrations by up to 50% but changed nitrate and total PM2.5 mass concentrations by less than ±5%. These changes in concentrations will have public health benefits but did not significantly affect radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere. The removal of EC due to the adoption of biodiesel produced larger coatings of secondary particulate matter on other atmospheric particles containing residual EC leading to enhanced absorption associated with those particles. The net effect was a minor change in atmospheric optical properties despite a large change in atmospheric EC concentrations. These results emphasize the importance of considering EC mixing state in climate research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aair pollution 3abiodiesel 3acarbon 3aclimate 3acoatings 3adiesel engines 3adiesel fuel 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ameteorological parameters 3amixing 3amodels 3anitrates 3aoptical properties 3aparticulates 3apublic health 3aradiative forcing 3asulfur 3atemperature 3awater content 3aCalifornia 0aBiodiesel 0aOff-road engines 0aSOWC 0aBlack carbon1 aMagara-Gomez, Kento T.1 aOlson, Michael R.1 aOkuda, Tomoaki1 aWalz, Kenneth A.1 aSchauer, James J.1 aKleeman, Michael J.0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 538 p.412-422dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.08.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245007900200300001800279500001900297500002000316520173300336592002802069650001302097650001602110650002502126650002302151650003602174650002002210650002602230650001602256650001602272650002402288650002102312650001102333650001702344650001502361650000902376650001102385650001402396650001902410650001602429700002202445700005602467700002402523700001902547700005402566700002002620773015302640856007302793852000902866655001202875IND60701305520221119021656.0200710e20200830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070130552DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.97962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTruzzi, Francesca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2613-843310aPhenolic acids of modern and ancient grains: Effect on in vitro cell model  ap. 4075-4082.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The gastrointestinal tract establishes a barrier between the external and internal compartments. When this barrier is disrupted, an inflammatory cascade promotes intestinal inflammation and the development of several intestinal diseases. Plant‐derived polyphenols are health‐promoting phytochemicals with a role in the regulation of the intestinal barrier and in the prevention of intestinal inflammatory diseases. Modern wheat‐breeding programs have been focused primarily on yield improvement rather than nutritional and functional proprieties. Research that aims to characterize the phytochemical profile of wheat varieties and their healthy proprieties could therefore provide new prospects for the genetic improvement of the genus Triticum. In the present work, the effects of phenolic compounds extracted from nine soft and seven durum wheat varieties were studied for their polyphenol content and antioxidant activity. Experiments were conducted to study their effects on cell proliferation and wound healing in three different cell lines: mouse fibroblasts (L929), intestinal human cells (Caco2), and human monocytes (U937). RESULTS: Discriminant analysis evidenced differences between soft and durum wheat phenolic compounds. Among the soft varieties, it was possible to identify clusters in which ancient wheat varieties showed different properties from modern ones, whereas no evident clusters were detected among durum varieties. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results suggest that the selection of specific wheat grains based on their nutritional parameters will help in the design of diets with protective effects against chronic and inflammatory diseases. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum 3aagriculture 3aantioxidant activity 3acell proliferation 3achemical constituents of plants 3adigestive tract 3adiscriminant analysis 3adurum wheat 3afibroblasts 3agenetic improvement 3ahealth promotion 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3aintestines 3amice 3amodels 3amonocytes 3aphytochemicals 3apolyphenols1 aDinelli, Giovanni1 aSpisni, Enzo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8525-29811 aSimonetti, Emanuela1 aTrebbi, Grazia1 aBosi, Sara1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2722-83901 aMarotti, Ilaria0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2020 Aug. 30, v. 100, no. 11 p.4075-4082dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.97963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01680naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009300156300001600249520067900265592002800944650001600972650001500988650002301003650001601026650002001042650001201062650001401074700001501088700001801103700001601121773012201137856007401259852000901333655001201342IND60662647720221116212810.0190906e20120103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066264772DNAL7 a10.1039/c2gc16457d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Guiyong10aOne-pot synthesis of useful heterocycles in medicinal chemistry using a cascade strategy  ap. 580-585.  aTo access useful heterocycles in medicinal chemistry such as pyridazinones, dihydropyrimidinones, and dihydropyrimidinthiones, a “green” mild and highly efficient one-pot triple cascade was developed involving a Claisen–decarboxylation, electrophilic reaction, and subsequent heterocyclization. In addition, indazoles and benzofurans could also be constructed via a double cascade. To develop the cascade process, a direct Claisen–decarboxylation reaction was firstly optimized.

In this study we aimed to evaluate the effects of nanoemulsions containing photosensitizer and chemotherapeutic agents associated with photodynamic therapy in a breast cancer in vivo model. Our results showed that synergistic treatments in which chloroaluminum phthalocyanine (NE-Pc) administered together with Doxorubicin (Dox) in the presence of laser irradiation (NE-PcDoxo + PDT) led to a reduction of 4 T1 induced breast cancer in mice, decline of tumor VEGF expression, increase in Caspase-3 expression, tissue necrosis and massive decrease in proliferative cells, as shown by Ki67 immunostaining. Furthermore, this associated treatment induced overexpression of apoptotic genes ABL1, CD70, CRADD, FASL, and NME5 and a reduction in expression of anticancer drug target genes CDK2, ERBB2, FIGF, IGF2, PARP4 and PGR. These results validate this treatment as a promising alternative to improve the currently applied anticancer strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3acancer therapy 3acaspase-3 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3adoxorubicin 3airradiation 3amodels 3anecrosis 3aphotobiology 3aphotochemistry 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotosensitizing agents 3aprognosis 0aAlternative therapy 0aAnticancer treatment 0aBreast cancer 0aNanotechnology 0aPDT 0aPhotosensitizer1 aLeonel, Ellen Cristina Rivas1 aCandido, Natália Maria1 aPiva, Henrique Luis1 ade Melo, Maryanne Trafani1 aTaboga, Sebastião Roberto1 aRahal, Paula1 aTedesco, Antonio Claudio1 aCalmon, Marilia Freitas0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2021 May, v. 218 p.112181-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2021.1121813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03646naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245011900170300001600289520208100305592002802386650002902414650001302443650002402456650002002480650001502500650001602515650001302531650001302544650001402557650002202571650000902593650002402602650002302626650001202649650001102661650002102672650001502693651001002708653003002718653002302748653003602771653002202807653003202829700001802861700002002879700001902899773010202918856008703020852000903107655001203116IND60545775420221121230808.0170719e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054577542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.08.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Dongmei10aResidence times of groundwater and nitrate transport in coastal aquifer systems: Daweijia area, northeastern China  ap. 539-554.  aGroundwater within the coastal aquifer systems of the Daweijia area in northeastern China is characterized by a large of variations (33–521mg/L) in NO3− concentrations. Elevated nitrate concentrations, in addition to seawater intrusion in the Daweijia well field, both attributable to anthropogenic activities, may impact future water-management practices. Chemical and stable isotopic (δ18O, δ2H) analysis, 3H and CFCs methods were applied to provide a better understanding of the relationship between the distribution of groundwater mean residence time (MRT) and nitrate transport, and to identify sources of nitrate concentrations in the complex coastal aquifer systems. There is a relatively narrow range of isotopic composition (ranging from −8.5 to −7.0‰) in most groundwater. Generally higher tritium contents observed in the wet season relative to the dry season may result from rapid groundwater circulation in response to the rainfall through the preferential flow paths. In the well field, the relatively increased nitrate concentrations of groundwater, accompanied by the higher tritium contents in the wet season, indicate the nitrate pollution can be attributed to domestic wastes. The binary exponential and piston-flow mixing model (BEP) yielded feasible age distributions based on the conceptual model. The good inverse relationship between groundwater MRTs (92–467years) and the NO3− concentrations in the shallow Quaternary aquifers indicates that elevated nitrate concentrations are attributable to more recent recharge for shallow groundwater. However, there is no significant relationship between the MRTs (8–411years) and the NO3− concentrations existing in the carbonate aquifer system, due to the complex hydrogeological conditions, groundwater age distributions and the range of contaminant source areas. Nitrate in the groundwater system without denitrification effects could accumulate and be transported for tens of years, through the complex carbonate aquifer matrix and the successive inputs of nitrogen from various sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquifers 3achlorofluorocarbons 3adenitrification 3adry season 3agroundwater 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3apollution 3apreferential flow 3arain 3asaltwater intrusion 3astatistical models 3atritium 3awastes 3awater management 3awet season 3aChina 0aCoastal carbonate aquifer 0aSeawater intrusion 0aGroundwater mean residence time 0aNitrate transport 0aAnthropogenic contamination1 aCao, Guoliang1 aMcCallum, James1 aSong, Xianfang0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 538 p.539-554dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.08.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04068naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245012400160300001600284500002000300500000900320520262200329592002802951596005902979596005903038650001503097650001903112650001103131650001503142650001903157650001503176650002703191650001603218650001203234650001803246650001503264650001503279650001903294700001903313700001203332700001703344773015803361856008203519852000903601655001203610IND60668354220221117233201.0220813e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066835422DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2017.03.00882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ce10aMorphological Approach to Quantifying Soil Cracks: Application to Dynamic Crack Patterns during Wetting‐Drying Cycles  ap. 757-771.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aCore Ideas We propose a methodology for soil crack recognition and quantification. Crack skeleton, outline and nodes are produced using morphological algorithms. A novel method for separating cracks is proposed based on SKIZ, distance transform, and watershed segmentation. The approach is assessed on dynamic crack patterns derived from three wetting‐drying cycles. Crack degree, velocity, similarity and network topology within wet‐dry cycles are analyzed. Water flow and solute transport through shrink‐swell soils with desiccation cracks are dominated by the crack distribution and variable hydraulic properties. The quantification of cracks is therefore inevitable for predicting moisture movement in cracked soils. This study presents a morphological approach to crack recognition and quantification based on digital image processing and morphological algorithms. The methodology comprises three sections: image segmentation, morphological processing and parameter calculation. A crack image is first segmented and then subjected to morphological operations including skeletonization, node identification and crack outline extraction. Based on the resulting binary crack image, skeleton and nodes of crack network, we propose a novel approach to crack separation by employing the concept of skeleton by zones of influence (SKIZ) and algorithms including distance transform and watershed segmentation. Calculations of crack parameters are presented and we apply this methodology to quantify the characteristics of dynamic crack patterns derived from wetting‐drying (W‐D) cycles. Crack degree, propagation velocity of cracks, similarity between crack patterns and network topology are exemplified to delineate the dynamic crack patterns. We find that the cracking degree present hysteresis between W‐D processes, similarly to soil shrink‐swell characteristics and water retention curves. The crack skeleton simultaneously, non‐hierarchically and rapidly propagated in successive drying cycles compared to the initial drying process. The similarity between two crack patterns with similar moisture contents derived from W‐D cycles is positively correlated with the drying intensity, and the evolution of the similarity gradually decelerates with decreasing water content. The crack patterns at full desiccation across W‐D cycles exhibit a marked similarity, with a maximum similarity measure of approximately 0.8. Overall, this approach could achieve efficient recognition and quantification of crack patterns and has great potential in the 3‐D quantification of cracks or related structures.  aPublisher supplied data  a51579069cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51179050cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aalgorithms 3adigital images 3adrying 3ahysteresis 3aimage analysis 3aprediction 3ashrink-swell potential 3asoil cracks 3asolutes 3awater content 3awater flow 3awatersheds 3awet-dry cycles1 aZhang, Zhan-yu1 aQi, Wei1 aFan, Shi-min0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2018 July, v. 82, no. 4 p.757-771dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2017.03.00883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03320naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245007000204300001600274520122600290536040901516592002801925596014401953596008802097650003002185650001902215650001602234650001002250650002202260650001502282650001102297650001702308651001502325651001202340651001402352651001102366653000902377653001602386653001402402653001202416653001602428700003302444700002302477700002402500700002502524700002402549700002102573773010502594856008202699852000902781655001202790IND60773505220221123012428.0220417e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077350522DNAL7 a10.1177/095968362210807642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhlgren, Hans1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9116-038914aThe Baltic grey seal: A 9000-year history of presence and absence  ap. 569-577.  aThe grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) has been part of the Baltic Sea fauna for more than 9000 years and has ever since been subjected to extensive human hunting, particularly during the early phases of its presence in the Baltic Sea, but also in the early 20th century. In order to study their temporal genetic structure and to investigate whether there has been a genetically continuous grey seal population in the Baltic, we generated mitochondrial control region data from skeletal remains from ancient grey seals from the archaeological sites Stora Förvar (Sweden) and Neustadt (Germany) and compared these with modern grey seal data. We found that the majority of the Mesolithic grey seals represent haplotypes that is not found in contemporary grey seals, indicating that the Baltic Sea population went extinct, likely due to human overexploitation and environmental change. We hypothesize that grey seals recolonised the Baltic Sea from the North Sea. during the Bronze Age or Iron Age, and that the contemporary Baltic grey seal population is direct descendants of this recolonisation. Our study highlights the power of biomolecular archaeology to understand the factors that shape contemporary marine diversity.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the European Union’s EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation Horizon 2020 under Marie Curie Actions Grant Agreement No 676154 as part of ‘ArchSci2020’; and the Swedish Research Council, Sweden [grant number 2015-02151].  aPublisher supplied data  aAgreement No 676154 as part of “ArchSci2020”cH2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actionsdhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/100010665  a2015-02151cVetenskapsrådetdhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004359 3aHalichoerus grypus grypus 3aHolocene epoch 3aarchaeology 3afauna 3agenetic structure 3ahaplotypes 3ahumans 3amitochondria 3aBaltic Sea 3aGermany 3aNorth Sea 3aSweden 0aaDNA 0aextirpation 0aGrey Seal 0ahunting 0amitogenomes1 aBro-Jørgensen, Maiken Hemme1 aGlykou, Aikaterini1 aSchmölcke, Ulrich,1 aAngerbjörn, Anders,1 aOlsen, Morten Tange1 aLidén, Kerstin,0 tHolocene.g2022 June, v. 32, no. 6 p.569-577dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/095968362210807643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03614naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011700167300001600284520171700300592002802017650001002045650001602055650001902071650001902090650000902109650002202118650001402140650002202154650001102176650001402187650001102201650001202212650001502224650001302239650001402252650002802266650002502294650001902319650001302338650001102351653000902362653000702371653000702378653000702385653000702392653000702399653000802406653000802414653000902422653000802431653000702439653000702446653000702453653000802460653000802468653000802476653001002484653001602494653001402510653001102524653003402535700001702569700001602586700001702602700001602619700002102635773009502656856008402751852000902835655001202844IND60612569720221122091524.0190416e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061256972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2017.05.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorrill, J.C.10aPost-extraction algal residue in beef steer finishing diets: I. Nutrient utilization and carcass characteristics  ap. 584-588.  aIn Part I of a two-part study, an experiment was conducted to determine effects of post-extraction algal residue (PEAR) inclusion on nutrient utilization and carcass characteristics in finishing steers. Eighteen Angus×Hereford steers (initial body weight=549±38.8kg) were randomly assigned to one of three treatments for the last 35days prior to harvest: PEAR added to the ration at 1.0kg organic matter (OM)/day (PEAR), or 1.0kg OM/day glucose infused ruminally (GR) or abomasally (GA). The basal diet consisted of a standard finishing ration with additional roughage provided in the diet to prevent sudden changes in intake as a result of infusion treatments. Greater dry matter intake (DMI) was observed for PEAR (13.0kg/d) than GR (10.3kg/d; P<0.05); DMI for steers receiving GA (11.2kg/d) was intermediate and not different from either PEAR or GR (P≥0.14). Intake of digestible energy (DE) was similar among treatments (P=0.45) and averaged 36 Mcal/d as was digestible OM intake which averaged 8.8kg/d (P=0.51). Digestion of gross energy (GE) was 72.9, 82.6, and 80.9% for PEAR, GA, and GR, respectively (P<0.01). Digestion of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) was substantially less (55.7%) for PEAR than GA (75.4%) and GR (75.0%; P<0.01). Steers fed PEAR had greater marbling scores (Mt20) than GA (Sm63) and GR (Sm52; P=0.01). Accordingly, USDA Quality Grade was greater for PEAR than GA and GR (P=0.01; Ch40, Ch21, and Ch17, respectively). There was no difference in USDA Yield Grade or hot carcass weight (HCW) between treatments (P≥0.66). In Part II, flavor and fatty acid composition of beef cuts from carcasses used in this study were assessed, and results are addressed in a separate publication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3abeef cattle 3acarcass weight 3acattle feeding 3adiet 3adigestible energy 3adigestion 3adry matter intake 3aenergy 3afinishing 3aflavor 3aglucose 3aharvesting 3amarbling 3ameat cuts 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anutrient utilization 3aorganic matter 3aroughage 3asteers 0aPEAR 0aCP 0aOM 0aGR 0aGA 0aDM 0aNDF 0aADF 0aFAME 0aDMI 0aGE 0aDE 0aME 0aNEm 0aNEg 0aHCW 0aAlgae 0aBeef cattle 0aDigestion 0aIntake 0aPost-extraction algal residue1 aSawyer, J.E.1 aSmith, S.B.1 aMiller, R.K.1 aBaber, J.R.1 aWickersham, T.A.0 tAlgal research.g2017 July, v. 25 p.584-588dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2017.05.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008900166300002000255520145900275592002801734650001501762650001501777650002001792650001101812650003101823650001501854650001601869650001501885650002501900700002201925700002501947700002401972700002301996700003102019700001802050773016902068856008102237852000902318655001202327IND60597834320221123044217.0180627e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059783432DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-1869-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Andreia10aApplication of vermiculite-derived sustainable adsorbents for removal of venlafaxine  ap. 17066-17076.  aRemoval of emerging pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, from wastewater is a challenge. Adsorption is a simple and efficient process that can be applied. Clays, which are natural and low-cost materials, have been investigated as adsorbent. In this work, raw vermiculite and its three modified forms (expanded, base, and acid/base treated) were tested for removal of a widely used antidepressant, venlafaxine. Adsorption kinetics followed Elovich’s model for raw vermiculite while the pseudo-2nd order model was a better fit in the case of other materials. Equilibrium followed Langmuir’s model for the raw and the acid/base-treated vermiculite, while Redlich-Peterson’s model fitted better the expanded and the base-treated materials. The adsorption capacity of vermiculite was significantly influenced by the changes in the physical and chemical properties of the materials caused by the treatments. The base-treated, raw, and expanded vermiculites showed lower maximum adsorption capacities (i.e., 6.3 ± 0.5, 5.8 ± 0.7, 3.9 ± 0.2 mg g⁻¹, respectively) than the acid/base-treated material (33 ± 4 mg g⁻¹). The acid/base-treated vermiculite exhibited good properties as a potential adsorbent for tertiary treatment of wastewater in treatment plants, in particular for cationic species as venlafaxine due to facilitation of diffusion of the species to the interlayer gallery upon such treatment.

Selection Potentialities and Determinants of Leadership in Canarian Dromedary Camels  aSeveral idiosyncratic and genetically correlated traits are known to extensively influence leadership in both domestic and wild species. For minor livestock such as camels, however, this type of behavior remains loosely defined and approached only for sex-mixed herds. The interest in knowing those animal-dependent variables that make an individual more likely to emerge as a leader in a single-sex camel herd has its basis in the sex-separated breeding of Canarian dromedary camels for utilitarian purposes. By means of an ordinal logistic regression, it was found that younger, gelded animals may perform better when eliciting the joining of mates, assuming that they were castrated just before reaching sexual maturity and once they were initiated in the pertinent domestication protocol for their lifetime functionality. The higher the body weight, the significantly (p < 0.05) higher the score in the hierarchical rank when leading group movements, although this relationship appeared to be inverse for the other considered zoometric indexes. Camels with darker and substantially depigmented coats were also significantly (p < 0.05) found to be the main initiators. Routine intraherd management and leisure tourism will be thus improved in efficiency and security through the identification and selection of the best leader camels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamelus dromedarius 3abody weight 3acamels 3adomestication 3aherds 3aleadership 3aprotocols 3aregression analysis 3asexual maturity 3atourism1 aNavas González, Francisco Javier1 aCiani, Elena 1 aArando Arbulu, Ander 1 aDelgado Bermejo, Juan Vicente0 tAnimals.g2021 Oct. 03, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111028863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245009700166300001400263520114700277592002801424650001501452650002501467650001301492650002101505650001301526650002101539650001101560650001101571650001201582650001701594650002001611700001801631700001801649700001601667773009501683856008601778852000901864655001201873IND60095613120221117225142.0141104e20110615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009561312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2010.10.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Mo10aSolidified liquid layer model makes quartz crystal microbalance a convenient molecular ruler  ap. 92-96.  aThe applications of quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) in biointerfaces are limited by its quantitative ambiguities caused by viscoelasticity and solution effects. Although many studies clearly indicated that the quantitative interpretation of QCM data needed caution, none of those studies provided a practical solution that enabled general and quantitative interpretation of QCM data. Recently we proposed a “solidified liquid layer” model that enabled QCM to be used as a biomolecular ruler. Here we applied five kinds of proteins with significant differences in their sizes and shapes to further validate this model. The effective thickness (Tₑff) of surface immobilized, hydrated proteins were 10.2, 4.7, 1.8 and 4.8nm for rabbit IgG, streptavidin, lysozyme, and bovine serum albumin, respectively. The critical number of stakes needed for the formation of a solidified liquid layer was found to be protein dependent. We believed this “solidified liquid layer” model will facilitate the popularization of QCM as a valuable tool in biointerface studies, such as protein adsorption process or the conformational change on surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abovine serum albumin 3acolloids 3aimmunoglobulin G 3alysozyme 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aquartz 3arabbits 3astreptavidin 3aviscoelasticity1 aHe, Jian’an1 aGan, Jianhong1 aMa, Hongwei0 tColloids and surfaces.g2011 June 15, v. 85, no. 1 p.92-96dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2010.10.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02149naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245010500179300001400284520108500298592002801383650002601411650001401437650001601451650001301467650002401480650001501504650001401519650002201533700002901555700002101584773011501605856008201720852000901802655001201811IND60764765220221117195718.0220422e20170221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076476522DNAL7 a10.17221/134/2015-hortsci2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManuel Sánchez Díaz, Juan12aA screening test for the determination of cut flower longevity and ethylene sensitivity of carnation  ap. 14-20.  aStrategies to prevent postharvest losses include the use of genotypes that have a longer life. The objective of this study was to develop a screening test for the estimation of cut flower postharvest life and the response to exogenous ethylene of different carnation cultivars at an early stage of plant growth. Ethylene sensitivity and production in different cut flower cultivars was evaluated, and a similar response in the vegetative stage was studied. Also, the possible relationship between the morphological parameters of cuttings and flower postharvest life was studied. Ethylene production of cuttings may be a useful tool for estimating ethylene production of cut flowers. There is a strong relationship between cut flower vase life and the root length of cuttings, as well as cut flower ethylene sensitivity and the number of internodes the cuttings have. Applications of exogenous ethylene to cutting cultivars have an effect on the growth parameters of the cuttings, but the response to ethylene in cut flowers does not behave in the same way in the vegetative stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDianthus caryophyllus 3acultivars 3acut flowers 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3ashelf life 3avase life 3avegetative growth1 aJiménez Becker, Silvia,1 aJamilena, Manuel0 tZahradnictví.g, v. 44, no. 1 p.14-20dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21417x0862-867X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/134/2015-hortsci3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245020400164300001600368520116800384592002801552650001501580650001501595650002501610650002701635650001501662650001201677650000901689650002101698650001301719650001101732650002201743650001801765650004401783700001801827700001701845700001301862700001301875700001901888700002001907700002201927773011201949856004802061852000902109655001202118IND50068516020221122192048.0130814e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006851602DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-013-1996-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dong-Mei10aExtraction, structural characterization and antioxidant activity of polyhydroxylated 1,4-naphthoquinone pigments from spines of sea urchin Glyptocidaris crenularis and Strongylocentrotus intermedius   ap. 331-339.  aIn the present study, the effects of operational parameters on adsorption and desorption capacity of polyhydroxylated 1,4-naphthoquinone (PHNQ) pigments on macroporous resin in static mode were evaluated. On this basis, a suitable operating condition was selected which recovered 83.96 ± 0.71 and 80.58 ± 1.48 % of PHNQ pigments from Glyptocidaris crenularis and Strongylocentrotus intermedius spines, respectively. Based on accurate molecular mass and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectral data acquired by ultra-performance liquid chromatography hybrid quadrupole orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer (UPLC Q-TOFMS), spinochrome E, spinochrome D and spinochrome B were tentatively identified in the pigment extract prepared from G. crenularis. In contrast, only spinochrome B was identified in the pigment extract from S. intermedius. Between the two extracts, the one from G. crenularis showed stronger DPPH radical scavenging ability and ferrous ion chelating capacity. In our opinion, the different PHNQ compounds existing in the two extracts resulted in the difference in antioxidant activity. ©Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinoidea 3aadsorption 3aantioxidant activity 3aattitudes and opinions 3adesorption 3ahybrids 3aions 3amolecular weight 3apigments 3aresins 3aspectral analysis 3aspectrometers 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aZhou, Da-Yong1 aZhu, Bei-Wei1 aMiao, Li1 aQin, Lei1 aDong, Xiu-Ping1 aWang, Xiaodong,1 aMurata, Yoshiyuki0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2013 Sept., v. 237, no. 3 p.331-339dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-013-1996-8  aDNAL 7aarticle01924naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245025100158300001800409520056500427592002800992650002401020650002201044650002101066650002201087650000901109650001001118650001301128650003301141650001401174653003201188653003101220653001801251653001501269700001501284773015301299856007701452852000901529655001201538IND60521604820221121225404.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052160482DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1980-11062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPreetz, W.10aDarstellung und Charakterisierung der Tetrabutylammoniumsalze der Tetrahalogenooxotechnetate(V), [TcOCl4]- und [TcOBr4]- / Preparation and Characterization of the Tetrabutylammonium Salts of the Tetrahalooxotechnetates(V), [TcOCl4]- and [TcOBr4]-  ap. 1355-1358.  aThe treatment of (TBA)TcO₄ with conc.

The coupling of B₁ with the first overtone of νTcO gives more intense difference than combination bands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aaqueous solutions 3ahydrobromic acid 3ahydrochloric acid 3aions 3asalts 3asolvents 3atetrabutylammonium compounds 3avibration 0aTetrachlorooxotechnetate(V) 0aTetrabromooxotechnetate(V) 0aRaman Spectra 0aIR Spectra1 aPeters, G.0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 35, no. 11 p.1355-1358dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1980-11063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03357naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245017200129300001800301520183100319592002802150650002702178650001302205650002502218650003002243650000902273650003102282650001302313650001202326650002102338650001102359650001102370650002202381650001602403650002302419650001302442650001402455650002402469650001302493651001602506653002302522653001302545653002102558653002002579653001402599653002402613653002302637700002102660773014902681852000902830655001202839IND60595940720221118234908.0180608e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059594072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Kajal10aFunctional and numerical responses of Amblydromalus limonicus and Neoseiulus cucumeris to eggs and first instar nymph of tomato/potato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli)  ap. 1476-1488.  aThe tomato/potato psyllid (TPP), Bactericera cockerelli, is a serious pest of some agricultural and ornamental plants, especially of the Solanaceae family. It has been an invasive species in New Zealand since 2006, heavily impacting the potato and tomato industry. The functional and numerical responses of the phytoseiid predators Amblydromalus limonicus and Neoseiulus cucumeris were examined by offering a range of prey densities (two, four, eight, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 28 TPP eggs or 1ˢᵗ instar nymphs) and compared on a capsicum leaf disc under 25 ± 1ºC, 85% ± 5% RH and a 14:10 h light: dark (L:D) photoperiod. Both species displayed a type 2 functional response when fed on eggs or 1ˢᵗ instar nymphs of TPP, indicating an increase in the number of prey killed with an increase in prey population density. The results were analysed by using a logistic regression and Holling disc equation. A. limonicus had a higher attack rate for both eggs (0.05 ± 0.01) and 1ˢᵗ instar nymphs (0.06 ± 0.01) than N. cucumeris, which had an attack rate of (0.03 ± 0.01) for eggs and (0.02 ± 0.01) for 1ˢᵗ instar nymphs of TPP. N. cucumeris had a longer handling time for both eggs (3.68 ± 0.67 hrs) and 1ˢᵗ instar nymphs (2.50 ± 0.79 hrs) compared with A. limonicus, with a handling time of (1.74 ± 0.23 hrs) for eggs and (1.15 ± 0.15 hrs) for 1ˢᵗ instar nymphs. A. limonicus consistently produced significantly more eggs than N. cucumeris across all densities when fed on either eggs or 1ˢᵗ instar nymphs of TPP. However, the results showed the lack of numerical response of both predator species to prey density. The stronger functional response of A. limonicus to TPP eggs and 1ˢᵗ instar nymphs indicates that this species can potentially be a more effective biocontrol agent of TPP than N. cucumeris.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBactericera cockerelli 3aCapsicum 3aNeoseiulus cucumeris 3abiological control agents 3aeggs 3afunctional response models 3aindustry 3ainstars 3ainvasive species 3aleaves 3anymphs 3aornamental plants 3aphotoperiod 3apopulation density 3apotatoes 3apredators 3aregression analysis 3atomatoes 3aNew Zealand 0aBiological control 0apsyllids 0ainvasive insects 0apredatory mites 0apredation 0afunctional response 0anumerical response1 aZhang, Zhi-Qiang0 tSystematic and applied acarology.g2017 Aug., v. 22, no. 9 p.1476-1488dSystematic and Applied Acarology SocietywJournal:23061x1362-19717nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005500149245011800204300001800322520131700340592002801657650001101685650001401696650002301710650001001733650001201743650001401755650001101769700006001780700007101840700005601911700005801967773012202025856008302147852000902230655001202239IND60634967720190422000000.0190327e20190228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063496772DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b005372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatheu, Roc1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8601-521910aSeven Coordinated Molecular Ruthenium–Water Oxidation Catalysts: A Coordination Chemistry JourneybFocus Review  ap. 3453-3471.  aMolecular water oxidation catalysis is a field that has experienced an impressive development over the past decade mainly fueled by the promise of generation of a sustainable carbon neutral fuel society, based on water splitting. Most of these advancements have been possible thanks to the detailed understanding of the reactions and intermediates involved in the catalytic cycles. Today’s best molecular water oxidation catalysts reach turnover frequencies that are orders of magnitude higher than that of the natural oxygen evolving center in photosystem II. These catalysts are based on Ru complexes where at some stage, the first coordination sphere of the metal center becomes seven coordinated. The key for this achievement is largely based on the use of adaptative ligands that adjust their coordination mode depending on the structural and electronic demands of the metal center at different oxidation states accessed within the catalytic cycle. This Review covers the latest and most significant developments on Ru complexes that behave as powerful water oxidation catalysts and where at some stage the Ru metal attains coordination number 7. Further it provides a comprehensive and rational understanding of the different structural and electronic factors that govern the behavior of these catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3afuels 3aligands 3aoxidation 3aoxygen1 aErtem, Mehmed Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1994-90241 aGimbert-Suriñach, Carolina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4412-76071 aSala, Xavier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7779-63131 aLlobet, Antoni1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6176-52720 tChemical reviews.g2019 Feb. 28, v. 119, no. 6 p.3453-3471dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23337x1520-68907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b005373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245015700169300001600326520172600342592002802068650001502096650001302111650001102124650000902135650002102144650001302165650001202178650001202190650002502202650001002227650002102237650002602258650000902284650002102293650001902314650002002333650001602353650001502369650001502384651001002399653003702409653001202446653001402458653002502472653003202497700001902529773008902548856008402637852000902721655001202730IND60559627220221120110726.0170606e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055962722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sedgeo.2016.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatano, Nozomi10aSedimentary environment and paleosols of middle Miocene fluvial and lacustrine sediments in central Japan: Implications for paleoclimate interpretations  ap. 117-129.  aSedimentary facies analysis and description of paleosols were carried out for the middle Miocene Tokiguchi Porcelain Clay Formation (PCF) in central Japan in order to interpret the soil-forming environments during a long hiatus in the Japanese Islands. The sedimentary facies suggests that deposition occurred mainly in a lacustrine environment, with minor channel-fill and debris-flow deposits associated with alluvial fan environments. The coarse-grained sediments, which are inferred to have been deposited in channel-bar and debris-flow deposits, are present only in the marginal area of the sedimentary basin. Mature paleosols are identified in the Tokiguchi PCF, characterized by illuviated clay, identifiable soil horizons including Bt horizons and many in situ plant fossils, and are then similar to Ultisols. Most tree trunk fossils, however, were preserved by burial beneath debris-flow deposits. Most of paleosols formed on lacustrine deposits and were covered by lacustrine clay and silt deposits, without intervening coarse-grained deposits, such as flood-flow deposits. This change of sedimentary facies indicates a dramatic change of hydrologic environment, from stagnant water to entirely desiccated conditions, promoting weathering and soil formation. The relationship between sedimentary facies and Pedotypes, consequently, implies the repetition of specific events, i.e., submergence and emergence of lake bottom, most likely due to formation and drainage of a dammed lake. These isolated events and development of mature paleosols might suggest specific characteristics of middle Miocene weathering conditions, such as seasonally heavy rainfall and/or warm climatic conditions in the Japanese Islands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB horizons 3aUltisols 3abasins 3aclay 3aclimatic factors 3adrainage 3afossils 3aislands 3alacustrine sediments 3alakes 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleosolic soil types 3arain 3asilty clay soils 3asoil formation 3asoil weathering 3asubmergence 3atree trunk 3aweathering 3aJapan 0aFluvial and lacustrine sediments 0aMiocene 0aPaleosols 0aWeathering condition 0aSedimentary facies analysis1 aYoshida, Kohki0 tSedimentary geology.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 347 p.117-129dElsevier B.V.x0037-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2016.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02080naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002600141245011600167520087000283592002801153650002901181650001601210650001901226650001101245650000901256650002301265650002601288650001501314650001201329650001301341650001801354650000901372700002201381700002701403700002301430700002301453773012101476856007601597852000901673655001201682IND60754125420221119064532.0211023e20211004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075412542DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111028922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaskinova, Milyausha 14aThe Current State of the Protected Apis mellifera mellifera Population in Russia: Hybridization and Nosematosis  aThe Southern Urals of Russia are the habitat of one of the surviving populations of the dark forest bee—the Burzyan population of Apis mellifera mellifera. In this study, we present the results of the subspecies identification of bee colonies in the Altyn-Solok Nature Reserve in the Southern Ural Mountains using the intergenic mtDNA COI-COII locus and the assessment of the prevalence of nosematosis. Analysis of the mtDNA COI-COII intergenic locus in the studied sample showed that 30.4% of the colonies belong to the lineage C. The PCR diagnostics of nosematosis in 92 colonies selected from different sectors of the Altyn-Solok Nature Reserve showed that about half of the analyzed colonies were infected with Nosema apis. Nosema ceranae was found in eight colonies. Both of these factors can lead to the extinction of this population of the dark forest bee.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera mellifera 3aNosema apis 3aNosema ceranae 3aRussia 3abees 3aconservation areas 3adiagnostic techniques 3aextinction 3aforests 3ahabitats 3ahybridization 3aloci1 aSaltykova, Elena 1 aPoskryakov, Alexander 1 aNikolenko, Alexey 1 aGaifullina, Luisa 0 tAnimals.g2021 Oct. 04, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111028923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01669naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009000168300001800258520071000276592002800986650001301014650002301027650001201050700005901062700005601121773012201177856008301299852000901382655001201391IND60634967820221117230747.0190327e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063496782DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b005682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoh, Sang Weon10aTransition Metal Vinylidene- and Allenylidene-Mediated Catalysis in Organic Synthesis  ap. 4293-4356.  aWith their mechanistic novelty and various modalities of reactivity, transition metal unsaturated carbene (alkenylidene) complexes have emerged as versatile intermediates for new reaction discovery.

In this study, bioaccumulation of five heavy metals (HMs) in internal tissues of an urban bird (Pica pica) collected from Aran-O-Bidgol City, Central Iran and their related soil were investigated. A total of 15 magpie specimens were collected in autumn 2013 and then their internal tissues were digested using a mixture of HNO₃ and H₂O₂, and finally, concentrations of HMs were detected by ICP-OES. In addition, in order to show level of HM exposure risk to magpie, an exposure risk assessment was modeled. Results indicated that HMs were accumulated as follows: liver > kidney > muscle. Zn and Cu were significantly higher in magpie’s tissues collected from agricultural site; on the other hand, Pb and Cd were significantly higher in industrial site (p < 0.05). Level of Cd in male’s livers (2.11 μg/g dw) was significantly higher than in females (1.85 μg/g dw) (p < 0.05). Levels of Cd, Pb, and Ni in liver, muscle, and kidney, respectively, were significantly higher in adults than in subadults (p < 0.05). Soil exposure doses of all HMs were lower than tolerable daily intake (Zn 4.35, Cu 1.34, Ni 5.65, Pb 0.35, and Cd 0.53). The calculated hazard quotations (HQs) for HMs were as follows: Pb > Zn > Cu > Ni > Cd and for all HMs were at no risk level (HQ < 1). The amounts of hazard index for three sites were as follows: urban (1.032) > agriculture (0.943) ≥ industry (0.941) and only for urban area was at low risk (1 < HQ < 2). It seemed that birds living in a safe environment and/or HM contaminations in soil separately had no negative effects on magpies. We can also suggest that low levels of HMs in magpie’s tissues can be due to low levels of HMs in soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPica pica 3aacceptable daily intake 3aadults 3aautumn 3abioaccumulation 3abirds 3acadmium 3acopper 3afemales 3aheavy metals 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aindustrial sites 3aindustry 3aingestion 3akidneys 3alead 3aliver 3amales 3amuscles 3anickel 3anitric acid 3aoral exposure 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asoil 3atissue distribution 3atissues 3aurban areas 3awildlife 3azinc 3aIran1 aMirzaei, Rouhollah1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8294-22150 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 June, v. 25, no. 17 p.17118-17127dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-1642-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245010300163300001600266520132200282592002801604650003601632650002501668650001301693650001301706650001701719650003201736650002501768650001101793650001401804650001801818650001401836650002201850650001401872650001001886650001701896650001401913650002101927651001001948653002501958653002201983653003502005653003002040653002102070653001402091700001802105700001502123700001702138700001802155700001902173773011102192856007902303852000902382655001202391IND60603826520221123044847.0190405e20180705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060382652DNAL7 a10.1515/biol-2018-00262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChe, Yongliang10aCharacterization of Haemophilus parasuis Serovar 2 CL120103, a Moderately Virulent Strain in China  ap. 217-226.  aHaemophilus parasuis is an important bacterium affecting pigs, causing Glässer’s disease. To further characterize this species, we determined the complete genomic sequence of H. parasuis CL120103, which was isolated from diseased pigs. The strain H. parasuis CL120103 was identified as serovar 2. The size of the largest scaffold is 2,326,318 bp and contains 145 large contigs, with the N50 contig being 20,573 bp in length. The complete genome of H. parasuis CL120103 is 2,305,354 bp in length with 39.97% GC content and contains 2227 protein-coding genes, 19 ribosomal rRNA operons and 60 tRNA genes. Sequence similarity of the genome of H. parasuis CL120103 to the previously sequenced genome of H. parasuis was up to 96% and query cover to 86%. Annotation of the genome of H. parasuis CL120103 identified a number of genes encoding potential virulence factors. These virulence factors are involved in metabolism, adhesion, secretion and LPS biosynthesis. These related genes pave the way to better understand mechanisms underlying metabolic capabilities. The comprehensive genetic and phylogenetic analysis shows that H. parasuis is closely related to Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and provides a foundation for future experimental confirmation of the virulence and pathogen-host interactions in H. parasuis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacillus pleuropneumoniae 3aHaemophilus parasuis 3aadhesion 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3anucleotide sequences 3aoperon 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asecretion 3asequence homology 3aserotypes 3aswine 3atransfer RNA 3avirulence 3avirulent strains 3aChina 0aHaemophilus parasuis 0agenome sequencing 0acomprehensive genetic analysis 0avirulence-associated gene 0aLPS biosynthesis 0avirulence1 aWang, Longbai1 aWu, Xuemin1 aChen, Rujing1 aWang, Chenyan1 aZhou, Lunjiang0 tOpen life sciences.g2018 July 05, v. 13, no. 1 p.217-226dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23145x2391-54127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biol-2018-00263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02191naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245004300169300001800212520123800230592002801468650002201496650001901518650001601537650001701553700002901570700002201599700005401621773012201675856008301797852000901880655001201889IND60634967920221117230752.0190327e20190205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063496792DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b005722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyata, Kiyoshi10aTriplet Pair States in Singlet Fission  ap. 4261-4292.  aThis account aims at providing an understanding of singlet fission, i.e., the photophysical process of a singlet state (S₁) splitting into two triplet states (2 × T₁) in molecular chromophores. Since its discovery 50 years ago, the field of singlet fission has enjoyed rapid expansion in the past 8 years. However, there have been lingering confusion and debates on the nature of the all-important triplet pair intermediate states and the definition of singlet fission rates. Here we clarify the confusion from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. We distinguish the triplet pair state that maintains electronic coherence between the two constituent triplets, ¹(TT), from one which does not, ¹(T···T). Only the rate of formation of ¹(T···T) is defined as that of singlet fission. We present distinct experimental evidence for ¹(TT), whose formation may occur via incoherent and/or vibronic coherent mechanisms. We discuss the challenges in treating singlet fission beyond the dimer approximation, in understanding the often neglected roles of delocalization on singlet fission rates, and in realizing the much lauded goal of increasing solar energy conversion efficiencies with singlet fission chromophores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy conversion 3asemiconductors 3asolar cells 3asolar energy1 aConrad-Burton, Felisa S.1 aGeyer, Florian L.1 aZhu, X.-Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2090-84840 tChemical reviews.g2019 Feb. 05, v. 119, no. 6 p.4261-4292dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23337x1520-68907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b005723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002500141245009600166520149200262592002801754650000801782650001701790650001301807650002101820650001201841650001501853650001001868650001201878650001301890650002301903650002401926650001601950650001101966700002201977700002501999700001902024773012102043856007602164852000902240655001202249IND60754125520221119064600.0211023e20211004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075412552DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111028912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz-Bustos, Teresa 10aSexual Development in Non-Human Parasitic Apicomplexa: Just Biology or Targets for Control?  aThe phylum Apicomplexa is a major group of protozoan parasites including gregarines, coccidia, haemogregarines, haemosporidia and piroplasms, with more than 6000 named species. Three of these subgroups, the coccidia, hemosporidia, and piroplasms, contain parasites that cause important diseases of humans and animals worldwide. All of them have complex life cycles involving a switch between asexual and sexual reproduction, which is key to their development. Fertilization (i.e., fusion of female and male cells) results in the formation of a zygote that undergoes meiosis, forming a new generation of asexual stages. In eukaryotes, sexual reproduction is the predominant mode of recombination and segregation of DNA. Sex is well documented in many protist groups, and together with meiosis, is frequently linked with transmission to new hosts. Apicomplexan sexual stages constitute a bottleneck in the life cycle of these parasites, as they are obligatory for the development of new transmissible stages. Consequently, the sexual stages represent attractive targets for vaccination. Detailed understanding of apicomplexan sexual biology will pave the way for the design and implementation of effective transmission-blocking strategies for parasite control. This article reviews the current knowledge on the sexual development of Apicomplexa and the progress in transmission-blocking vaccines for their control, their advantages and limitations and outstanding questions for the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPiroplasmida 3aProtozoa 3aeukaryotic cells 3afemales 3agregarines 3amales 3ameiosis 3aprotists 3asexual development 3asexual reproduction 3avaccination 3azygote1 aFeix, Anna Sophia1 aRuttkowski, Bärbel 1 aJoachim, Anja 0 tAnimals.g2021 Oct. 04, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111028913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05147naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245010200163300001300265520350900278592002803787650001503815650000803830650002303838650002103861650000903882650002403891650000903915650001503924650002103939650001503960650001703975650001103992650001104003650001004014650001504024650002204039650001204061650001304073650001304086650003304099650001304132650001804145650001404163650001504177650001504192650001704207650001404224650001004238650001004248651001104258700001904269700002104288700001904309773011304328856008304441852000904524655001204533IND60549178220221119152926.0160907e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054917822DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-02-13-0154-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, M.10aFirst Report of Stagonosporiopsis cucurbitacearum Causing Fruit Rot of Luffa cylindrica in Brazil  ap. 1120.  aLuffa cylindrica (Cucurbitaceae) is an Asian vine widely known as the source of loofah (4). In Brazil (local name bucha), it is cultivated by small scale producers as a cash crop. In January 2012, samples of fruits were collected in three areas in the municipality of Cipotânea, state of Minas Gerais (Brazil) bearing rot symptoms. These had large necrotic areas with a grayish epidermis and slightly sunken tissue. Internally, the fibrous parts were necrosed, darkened, and unmarketable. Isolations by surface sterilization of necrotic tissue with 10% bleach and plating onto potato dextrose agar yielded colonies with consistent morphology. A representative culture was deposited in the culture collection of the Universidade Federal de Viçosa (UFV) as COAD1119. Inoculations of seven healthy-appearing L. cylindrica fruits were performed with culture disks obtained from 4-day-old cultures grown on PDA, which were placed onto two points on the epidermis of each of seven fruits. Each point was either intact or previously injured with a sterile needle. Controls consisted of two fruits treated equally but with tap water agar disks in place of fungal inoculum. Fruits were then placed on trays with water-soaked cotton and the trays were wrapped in plastic bags and left over a bench at room temperature for 2 days. The plastic bags were then removed. After 5 days, necrosis was evident and fungal fruit bodies appeared at points with injury. No symptoms appeared on controls. Isolation from diseased tissue yielded colonies identical to those of the inoculated fungus. A dried sample was deposited in the local herbarium at UFV (VIC 32053). Slides were mounted in lactophenol and observed. The fungus had subepidermal perithecia, globose to subglobose, from 75.5 to 134 μm diam.; asci bitunicate, cylindrical, 8-spored; pseudoparaphyses filiform; ascospores fusoid to ellipsoidal, from 26 to 45 μm long and 8 to 11.5 μm wide, one septate, and hyaline. This morphology is consistent with Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum (syn. Didymella bryoniae) (3), a broad spectrum pathogen of cucurbits. Genomic DNA was extracted from the isolate growing in pure culture and ITS and LSU sequences were generated and deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers KC582022 and KC582021, respectively. Sequences were compared in BLASTn with other entries in GenBank, and the closest match for each region were S. cucurbitacearum strain CAP14C and D. bryoniae strain CBS 133.96 (JQ936326 and GU456335) with 100% of nucleotide homology for ITS and 100% of nucleotide homology for LSU. Cercospora citrullina and C. cucurbitae have been reported in Brazil on L. cylindrica and mistakenly indicated as synonyms of D. bryoniae (2). To our knowledge, this is the first valid report of S. cucurbitacearum causing fruit rot of loofah in Brazil and the first time pathogenicity to this host has been demonstrated. Losses due to the disease on the crop were reported to be high by growers and management to be difficult since there are no fungicides registered for this crop in Brazil.References: (1) M. M.

Few studies have examined the role of secondary compounds (e.g. polyphenols and volatile organic compounds) in mixed litter in Mediterranean ecosystems. Here, we ask whether the natural mixing of Aleppo pine and Holm oak litter decreases the inhibitory effect of secondary compounds and increases microbial activities involved in C cycling. In situ N fertilisation was used to demonstrate the limiting role of N to soil microbial activities, particularly in pure pine stands, and we hypothesised that these inhibitory effects would be alleviated in mixed litter. We examined the concentrations, structure and diversity of biochemical compounds in litter from single-species or mixed stands of pine and oak, along with associated microbial activities (i.e. net ammonification and nitrification, cellulase, fluorescein diacetate hydrolase (FDAse) and phenol oxidase activities). We tested the relationships between biochemical compounds and microbial activities with co-inertia analyses. Pine litter clearly shaped the biochemical composition of mixed litter in the organic litter horizon, and this mixed litter was dominated by high molecular weight compounds (total phenols, sesqui- and diterpenes). In contrast, oak litter was dominated by small compounds such as monoterpenes and hydro-soluble phenols. Pine litter clearly affected microbial activities (i.e. antagonistic effect) in unfertilised mixed litter. We demonstrated by co-inertia analysis that this antagonistic effect was related to N availability. Mixed litter had the highest VOC (volatile organic compounds) richness and evenness, along with the highest enzyme activities (i.e. synergistic effect), and N availability did not constrain microbial activities. However, an apparent nitrification limitation suggested greater microbial specialisation and efficiency of N recovery in mixed litter.

Through a scholarly narrative review of interdisciplinary sources an in-depth understanding of climate change vulnerability is gained and its importance in successful adaptation planning demonstrated. The urgency and complexity of climate change requires overcoming socio-political barriers within the existing adaptation paradigm, balancing technocratic methods with a collaborative approach focusing on the social, economic and ethical components of vulnerability to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental science 3aethics 3aissues and policy 3asocioeconomics 0aAdaptive capacity 0aResilience 0aSocial stressors 0aVulnerable communities 0aUrban planning and policy1 aBirchall, S.

The wide range of available feedstocks for biodiesel production represents one of the most significant factors for producing biodiesel. The current research work is carried out on fuel properties of biodiesel prepared from the non-edible oils of Ceiba pentandra, Nigella sativa and their mixture. N. sativa is believed to be investigated for the first time as a biodiesel feedstock while C. pentandra has been reported recently in few studies. Owing to higher acid value, acid-esterification and alkali-transesterification processes have been carried out for biodiesel production. The fuel properties of C. pentandra methyl ester (CPME), N. sativa methyl ester (NSME) and their feedstock mixture (NSME/CPME) are determined. It has been found that the produced biodiesel from respective feedstocks matches the properties set by ASTM 6751 standards. However, the fuel properties of the C. pentandra biodiesel exhibited better calorific value, viscosity and flash point while N. sativa exhibited excellent cold flow properties and oxidation stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeiba pentandra 3aNigella sativa 3aacid value 3abiodiesel 3acrops 3afeedstocks 3afluid mechanics 3afuel production 3aoils 3aoxidative stability 3aviscosity 0aBiodiesel feedstocks 0aCeiba pentandra 0aNigella sativa 0aBlending1 aAtabani, A.E.1 aBadruddin, Irfan Anjum1 aAnkalgi, R.F.1 aMainuddin Khan, T.K.1 aBadarudin, Ahmad0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2015 Mar., v. 65 p.367-373dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03375naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010200172300001600274520186200290592002802152650001702180650002002197650002602217650001102243650001402254650001402268650001602282650001702298651001602315653001602331653001502347653002302362653002402385653002102409653002602430700006102456700002502517700002002542700002402562700005902586700002202645700002102667773011102688856008502799852000902884655001202893IND60746721320221117160250.0210918e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074672132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2021.07.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoffels, Rick J.10aMultiple framings of uncertainty shape adoption of reference states during reform of water policy  ap. 496-505.  aThere is growing recognition that multiple forms of uncertainty influence policy reform, but we need case studies illustrating how uncertainties influence reform, and strategies used to manage uncertainties in practice. We present a case study of how science was generated and incorporated into national water policy. We estimated turbidity (suspended fine sediment) reference states throughout the river network of New Zealand. A key decision-problem was: how region-specific should reference states be? We developed classifications of the national river network that grouped rivers with similar turbidity regimes into classes at four spatial resolutions. Choosing a classification was complicated by ontological uncertainties. Scientific actors framed these ontological uncertainties in different ways, introducing framing uncertainties (‘ambiguities’) into the decision-making process. Well-established statistical techniques were employed to objectively identify the most parsimonious classification, but those techniques had little impact on decision-making. Reframing ontological uncertainties in terms of risks to management objectives was required to reconcile divergent frames, and showed that the classification with the highest resolution was the most credible option. Nonetheless, local governments highlighted that the most credible classification was not the most relevant or legitimate one in light of implementation constraints. The final decision was made against a backdrop of ambiguities, was partially subjective, and balanced trade-offs among credibility, relevance and legitimacy. Looking ahead, ambiguities could be reduced by framing decision problems in terms of risks to management objectives. A barrier to doing this is the short duration of policy windows, so translational science must take place when such windows are shut.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aenvironmental science 3arivers 3asediments 3aturbidity 3auncertainty 3awater policy 3aNew Zealand 0aCredibility 0aLegitimacy 0aPolicy development 0aReference condition 0aScience adoption 0aTranslational ecology1 aFranklin, Paul A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7800-72591 aFragaszy, Stephen R.1 aBooker, Doug J.1 aClapcott, Joanne E.1 aSnelder, Ton H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2330-45631 aWagenhoff, Annika1 aHickey, Chris W.0 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2021 Oct., v. 124 p.496-505dElsevier LtdwJournal:12413x1462-90117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2021.07.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014500164300002000309520136500329592002801694650005001722650002201772650001201794650001401806650002201820650001701842650002301859650001301882650002101895650001101916650003501927650001001962650001701972650001401989650000902003650002002012650001702032650002802049650001202077650001102089651001002100700001502110700001502125700001502140700001602155700002002171700001402191700005402205773016902259856008102428852000902509655001202518IND60597835120221123020853.0180627e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059783512DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-1802-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Mingxing10aAssessment of the inhalation risks associated with working in printing rooms: a study on the staff of eight printing rooms in Beijing, China  ap. 17137-17143.  aThe concentration of pollution directly determines the occupational health risk, and the exposure time is an important influencing factor. We evaluated the inhalation risks of working in a printing room. Eight units with centralized printing rooms were randomly selected. Formaldehyde, ozone, benzene, toluene, xylene, and fine particulate matter were detected by spectrophotometry, gas chromatography, and direct reading instruments, respectively. The U.S. EPA inhalation risk assessment model was used to assess cancer and non-cancer risks. The formaldehyde inhalation cancer risk value was 1.35–3.45 × 10⁻⁶, which is greater than the limit of 1 × 10⁻⁶, suggesting a risk of squamous cell carcinoma. The benzene inhalation cancer risk in five of the rooms was 1.09–4.65 × 10⁻⁶, which is greater than the limit of 1 × 10⁻⁶, suggesting a risk of leukemia. In terms of non-cancer risk, in five of the rooms, the hazard quotient (HQ) was > 1 (range 1.99–4.69) due to benzene pollution, suggesting a risk of reduced lymphocyte count. In one room, due to benzene and xylene pollution, the HQ was > 1, suggesting a risk of lymphocyte count drop and motor coordination impairment. Collectively, the study concludes that staff members of printing rooms are exposed to both cancer and non-cancer occupational health risks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aataxia (disorder) 3abenzene 3abreathing 3aexposure duration 3aformaldehyde 3agas chromatography 3aleukemia 3alymphocyte count 3amodels 3aoccupational health and safety 3aozone 3aparticulates 3apollution 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aspectroscopy 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3atoluene 3axylene 3aChina1 aSun, Rubao1 aZhang, Xun1 aWang, Shen1 aZhang, Ping1 aYuan, Zhengquan1 aLiu, Chao1 aWang, Qiang1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4392-08890 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 June, v. 25, no. 17 p.17137-17143dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-1802-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02061naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245012700170520076100297592002801058650002101086650001401107650003401121650002801155650001501183650001701198650001801215650000701233650002001240650001601260650001501276653001701291653002401308653001901332653001101351700001901362700001901381700001601400773013001416856008401546852000901630655001201639IND60746721420221117160239.0210904e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074672142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2021.1027862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarvishi, Hosain10aEffect of ohmic heating on electrochemical-thermal parameters and inactivation of Escherichia coli of well water drinkable  aThe effect of voltage gradient (15–30 V/cm) and holding time (45–150 s) were evaluated on electrode corrosion, energy consumption, thermal performance, pH change, electrical conductivity and inactivation of Escherichia coli in the well water during ohmic heating process.

The studied problem consists of determining the optimal routes for a given set of aircraft used for chemical treatment of arable agricultural land divided into parcels. This NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) problem is represented on a graph and a mixed integer mathematical programming model of the problem is formulated. This mathematical model is a specific variant of the multi-depot vehicle routing problem where a min-cost plan for the transportation of a homogeneous product (chemicals used for land treatment) from different supply locations (airfields) to different demand locations (agricultural parcels) should be generated. Some specifics of the agricultural land chemical treatment are described in the paper and the following specific conditions are taken into consideration: each parcel is treated only by one way of treatment and one aircraft; for each aircraft its chemical and fuel reservoir capacities are sufficient to serve its route. The complexity of the problem and the impossibility to obtain exact solutions for larger dimensions of the problem led to the formulation of a special heuristics which is presented in this paper. Numerical experiments are successfully conducted for larger problem dimensions and results are presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aaircraft 3aaviation 3achemical treatment 3amathematical models 3atransportation1 aStanojevic, Milan1 aCangalovic, Mirjana0 tZemědělská ekonomika.g, v. 65, no. 12 p.569-578dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:22848x0139-570X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/134/2019-agricecon3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245016600165300001400331520157800345592002801923650001601951650001901967650000901986650001301995650002002008650001302028650001102041650001302052650001602065700001902081700001402100773009402114856008102208990002302289852000902312655001202321IND60093803520221122203531.0141104e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009380352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2012.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemirezen, S.10aTwo diodes model and illumination effect on the forward and reverse bias I–V and C–V characteristics of Au/PVA (Bi-doped)/n-Si photodiode at room temperature  ap. 53-59.  aThe forward and reverse bias current–voltage (I–V), capacitance/conductance–voltage (C/G–V) characteristics of the fabricated Au/PVA (Bi-doped)/n-Si photodiode have been investigated both in dark and under 250 W illumination intensity at room temperature. The energy density distribution profile of Nₛₛ was extracted from the forward bias I–V measurements by taking the voltage dependence of effective barrier height (Φₑ) and Rₛ for photodiode both in dark and under 250 W illumination cases. The exponential growth of the Nₛₛ from midgap toward the bottom of the conductance band is very apparent for two cases. The obtained high value of n and Rₛ were attributed to the particular distribution of Nₛₛ at metal/PVA interface, surface and fabrication processes, barrier inhomogeneity of interfacial polymer layer and the form of barrier height at M/S interface. While the values of C and G/w increase Rₛ and Rₛₕ decrease under illumination, due to the illumination induced electron–hole pairs in depletion region. The voltage dependent Nₛₛ profile was also obtained from the dark and illumination capacitance at 1 MHz and these values of Nₛₛ are in good agreement. In addition, the fill factor (FF) under 250 W illumination level was found as 28.5% and this value of FF may be accepted sufficiently high. Thus, the fabricated Au/PVA (Bi-doped)/n-Si structures are more sensitive to light, proposing them as a good candidate as a photodiode or capacitance sensor for optoelectronic applications in modern electronic industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3aenergy density 3agold 3aindustry 3alight intensity 3alighting 3amodels 3apolymers 3atemperature1 aAltındal, Ş.1 aUslu, İ.0 tCurrent applied physics.g2013 Jan., v. 13, no. 1 p.53-59dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2012.06.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01943naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012500167300001400292520089700306592002801203650002201231650002601253650001901279650002301298650001301321650001801334650001501352650001401367700001701381773009401398856008101492990002301573852000901596655001201605IND60093803620221122170050.0141104e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009380362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2012.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsay, Chien-Yie10aEffect of dopants on the structural, optical and electrical properties of sol–gel derived ZnO semiconductor thin films  ap. 60-65.  aUndoped, Ga-, In-, Zr-, and Sn-doped ZnO transparent semiconductor thin films were deposited on alkali-free glasses by sol–gel method. 2-methoxyethanol (2-ME) and diethanolamine (DEA) were chosen as a solvent and a stabilizer, respectively. The doping concentration was maintained at 2 at.% in the impurity doping precursor solutions. The effects of different dopants on the structural, optical, and electrical properties of ZnO thin films were investigated. XRD results show that all annealed ZnO-based thin films had a hexagonal (wurtzite) structure. ZnO thin films doped with impurity elements obviously improved the surface flatness and enhanced the optical transmittance. All impurity doped ZnO thin films showed high transparency in the visible range (>91%). The Ga- and In- doped ZnO thin films exhibited higher Hall mobility and lower resistivity than did the undoped ZnO thin film.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aelectrical properties 3asemiconductors 3asol-gel processing 3asolvents 3atransmittance 3azinc oxide 3azirconium1 aLee, Wen-Che0 tCurrent applied physics.g2013 Jan., v. 13, no. 1 p.60-65dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2012.06.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003600144245012100180300001400301520175400315592002802069650001502097650000902112650002402121650001802145650001402163650001102177650001202188650001002200650002302210650002502233650002102258650002002279650001602299650001102315650001002326700003502336700004102371700002602412700003702438700002602475700003002501773013302531856007902664852000902743655001202752IND60764766320221117191321.0220409e20210125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076476632DNAL7 a10.17221/134/2020-cjas2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarixara Sousa da Silva, Júlia10aEffect of protease supplementation on the digestibility of amino acids in animal-origin meals for broiler diets  ap. 29-37.  aEnzymes benefit digestion and absorption of the ingredients and their addition to an animal-origin meal (AOM) can improve its nutritional quality. This research aimed to evaluate the effect of protease on nutrient digestibility, amino acids, and metabolism of AOM energy for broilers. Four hundred and eighty broiler chickens were distributed in a completely randomized design (4 × 2 factorial scheme), eight treatments, six replicates containing 10 birds/replicate. Treatments consisted of poultry viscera meal, swine viscera meal (SVM), bovine meat and bone meal, and basal diet; with and without protease addition. Two tests were performed. In the first test, the total excreta collection method was used with birds at 13 to 20 days of age and 25% of the reference feed was replaced by AOM. In the second test, a protein-free diet was administered to birds at 21 to 24 days of age and AOM replaced 25% of the starch. The inclusion of protease increased the apparent metabolizable energy corrected for nitrogen balance of SVM by 15.99% and the apparent metabolizable crude energy by 5.7%, and it also raised the coefficient of true ileal digestibility of the amino acids in the AOMs by 5.67% on average. The inclusion of protease improved the apparent metabolizable crude energy of AOMs, apparent metabolizable dry matter of bovine meat and bone meal, coefficient of true ileal digestibility of essential amino acids, and apparent metabolizable energy corrected for nitrogen balance of SVM. Dietary supplementation of protease may be a potential strategy to improve the digestibility of amino acids for broilers, a possibility of using animal-origin meals as a protein source of diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abeef 3adietary supplements 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3aenergy 3aexcreta 3aileum 3ameat and bone meal 3ametabolizable energy 3anitrogen balance 3aprotein sources 3aproteinases 3astarch 3aswine1 aRodrigues de Oliveira, Nayanne1 aBatista Vieira Silva Gouveia, Alison1 aAlves Vieira, Rodolfo1 aOmar Fernandes dos Santos, Ronan1 aSilva Minafra, Cibele1 aRamos dos Santos, Fabiana0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 66, no. 1 p.29-37dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/134/2020-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03824naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011800167300001600285520155700301592002801858650001601886650002001902650002001922650002101942650000901963650002001972650002001992650001902012650003802031650001602069650001902085650002702104650001002131650001002141650001802151650001802169650002702187650001502214650001702229650004102246650001502287650001102302650001302313650001602326650002202342650002102364650001802385650001402403653001302417653002602430653001502456653002002471653001102491653000802502653001002510653000702520653001102527653001002538653001002548700002402558700002102582700001802603700001502621700002102636700001702657700001202674700001602686700002302702700001802725700002402743700001902767773011302786856008602899852000902985655001202994IND60542880920221121003929.0190408e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054288092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.11.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jinjie10aField production, purification and analysis of high-oleic acetyl-triacylglycerols from transgenic Camelina sativa  ap. 259-268.  aA diacylglycerol acetyltransferase, EaDAcT, from Euonymus alatus, synthesizes sn-3 acetyl triacylglycerols (acetyl-TAG) when expressed in Arabidopsis, Camelina and soybean. Compared to most vegetable oils, acetyl-TAGs have reduced viscosity and improved cold temperature properties that confer advantages in applications as biodegradable lubricants, food emulsifiers, plasticizers, and ‘drop-in’ fuels for some diesel engines. A high-oleic Camelina line was engineered to express the EaDAcT gene in order to produce acetyl-TAG oils with fatty acid compositions and physiochemical properties complementary to wild-type acetyl-TAG. The accumulation of acetyl-TAGs at 70mol% of seed TAG in field-grown high-oleic Camelina had minor or no effect on seed weight, oil content, harvest index and seed yield. The total moles of TAG increased up to 27% reflecting the ability to synthesize more acetyl-TAG from the same supply of long-chain fatty acid. Acetyl-TAG could be separated from long-chain TAG by silica column or by reverse phase chromatography. The predominant acetyl-TAG molecular species produced in high-oleic Camelina was acetyl-dioleoyl-glycerol. The crystallization temperature of high-oleic acetyl-TAG (by differential scanning calorimetry at 1.0°C/min) was reduced by 30°C compared to control TAG. The viscosity of high-oleic acetyl-TAG was 27% lower than TAG from the high-oleic control and the caloric content was reduced by 5%. Field production of T4 and T5 transgenic plants yielded over 250kg seeds for oil extraction and analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aCamelina sativa 3aEuonymus alatus 3abiodegradability 3acold 3acrystallization 3adiacylglycerols 3adiesel engines 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aemulsifiers 3aenergy content 3afatty acid composition 3afuels 3agenes 3aharvest index 3alipid content 3along chain fatty acids 3alubricants 3aplasticizers 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3aseed yield 3asilica 3asoybeans 3atemperature 3atransgenic plants 3atriacylglycerols 3avegetable oil 3aviscosity 0aCamelina 0aMetabolic engineering 0aEmulsifier 0aAcetylglyceride 0aACETEM 0aDAG 0aDGAT1 0aDW 0aEaDAcT 0aLcTAG 0aPDAT11 aTjellström, Henrik1 aMcGlew, Kathleen1 aShaw, Vincent1 aRice, Adam1 aSimpson, Jeffrey1 aKosma, Dylan1 aMa, Wei1 aYang, Weili1 aStrawsine, Merissa1 aCahoon, Edgar1 aDurrett, Timothy P.1 aOhlrogge, John0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2015 Mar., v. 65 p.259-268dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002600141245019400167520193500361592002802296650002202324650001802346650001602364650001602380650000902396650001902405650001602424650002002440650001602460650001202476650002502488650002002513650001002533650001702543700001902560700002102579700002502600700003002625773012102655856007602776852000902852655001202861IND60754126220221119064340.0211023e20211005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075412622DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111028982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStruţi, Dănuţ Ioan14aThe Influence of Dehulling on the Nutritional Quality of Lupine Seeds (Lupinus albus L.) and the Effect of Their Use in the Feed of Laying Quails on the Live Performance and Quality of Eggs  aLupinus albus seeds from low-alkaloid varieties are a valuable alternative source of protein for reducing the dependence on soybean meal for the feeding of monogastric animals. Therefore, the aim of this research was to evaluate the dehulling influence of lupine seeds (L. albus, cv. Amiga) and the effect of their use in the laying quails feed on live performance and egg quality. A total of 200 laying quails (Coturnix japonica), with an age of 10 weeks, were randomly assigned to five experimental groups (five replicates/group). Each group was randomly assigned to one of five dietary treatments: the control group (C) diet was based on soybean meal, while the experimental groups received either 200 g/kg (WLS₂₀) or 250 g/kg (WLS₂₅) of whole lupine seeds in their diets, or 200 g/kg (DLS₂₀) or 250 g/kg (DLS₂₅) of dehulled lupine seeds in their diets. The results show that by dehulling the lupine seeds, the nutritional value of the seeds increased. The use of dehulled lupine seeds in the diet of laying quails did not affect the live performance (egg production, feed intake, feed conversion ratio), yolk cholesterol content, and physico-chemical quality indices of the eggs, compared with control. The presence of dehulled lupine seeds in the diet improved the nutritional quality of the yolk lipids because of the increase in the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Thus, the lipid quality indices of the yolk became more favorable to consumer health because of an increase in the h/H ratio (hypocholesterolemic/Hypercholesterolemic FA) and a decrease in the atherogenic index and thrombogenic index values. The higher content in carotenoids also contributed to the higher nutritional quality of the eggs obtained by lupine utilization. In conclusion, dehulling of lupine seeds had a positive influence on the nutritional quality of the seeds, the live performance of quails, and the quality of eggs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoturnix japonica 3aLupinus albus 3acarotenoids 3acholesterol 3adiet 3aegg production 3aegg quality 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3ahulling 3ahypercholesterolemia 3anutritive value 3aseeds 3asoybean meal1 aBunea, Andrea 1 aPop, Ioan Mircea1 aPăpuc, Tudor Andrei1 aMierliţă, Daniel Pantea0 tAnimals.g2021 Oct. 05, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111028983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010100163300001800264520114900282592002801431650002801459650001101487650001101498650001901509650001901528650001301547650000901560650002101569650001501590650002301605650001101628650001101639650001101650650001701661651001101678700001401689700001701703700002101720700002001741773013101761856008201892852000901974655001201983IND60549178920221119152703.0160907e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054917892DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-10-12-0942-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObasa, Ken10aEffect of Cultivation and Timing of Nitrogen Fertilization on Large Patch Disease of Zoysiagrass  ap. 1075-1081.  aLarge patch of zoysiagrass (Zoysia spp.) is caused by Rhizoctonia solani anastomosis group 2-2 LP. The effects of summer cultivation (core-aerification, verticutting, and sand topdressing) and spring and fall versus summer nitrogen (N) fertilization on large patch in fairway height ‘Meyer’ zoysiagrass were investigated from 2008 to 2011 in Manhattan, Haysville, and Olathe, KS. Disease was assessed by measuring patch diameters or analyzing digital images of affected plot areas to determine the percentage of non-green turfgrass within patches. Cultivation did not affect thatch temperature, soil temperature, soil water content, or turf recovery from large patch in early summer. Furthermore, cultivation did not result in overall significant reductions in patch diameters or average weekly rate of patch diameter increase among plots at the three experimental locations. In some site–year combinations, spring and fall N fertility was associated with lower percentages of non-green turf within affected plot areas in Manhattan and Haysville. In some cases, applications of N during spring and fall may alleviate large patch symptoms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3aZoysia 3aautumn 3adigital images 3alawns and turf 3anitrogen 3asand 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3aspring 3asummer 3athatch 3aturf grasses 3aKansas1 aFry, Jack1 aBremer, Dale1 aJohn, Rodney St.1 aKennelly, Megan0 tPlant disease.g2013 Aug., v. 97, no. 8 p.1075-1081dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-10-12-0942-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01270naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245009000152300001800242520025600260592002800516650001200544650002300556650002600579650002200605650001400627650001300641700001200654700001600666700001400682700001800696700001600714773010600730856007500836852000900911655001200920IND60578577720221118055314.0170813e20130816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057857772DNAL7 a10.1021/ol401812h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Wen10aAsymmetric Epoxidation of Alkenes Catalyzed by a Porphyrin-Inspired Manganese Complex  ap. 4138-4141.  aA novel strategy for catalytic asymmetric epoxidation of a wide variety of olefins by a porphyrin-inspired chiral manganese complex using H₂O₂ as a terminal oxidant in excellent yield with up to greater than 99% ee has been successfully developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkenes 3achemical structure 3aepoxidation reactions 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amanganese 3aoxidants1 aLi, Jun1 aLi, Guosong1 aYang, Hua1 aWang, Lianyue1 aGao, Shuang0 tOrganic letters.g2013 Aug. 16, v. 15, no. 16 p.4138-4141dAmerican Chemical Societyx1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fol401812h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001900169245012500188300002000313520097200333592002801305650001501333650001201348650002701360650001201387650001401399650001101413650001801424650002101442650001501463650001501478650001701493650003401510650003801544650001201582650003001594650002401624650001301648650003201661650001301693650003901706650004801745650003101793650001301824650002601837650005701863650005001920700001501970773010001985856008602085852000902171655001202180IND4465597920221119161142.0141110e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446559792DNAL7 a219585232pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2011.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Seung Joo12aA kinetic analysis and experimental validation of an integrated system of anaerobic filter and biological aerated filter  ap. 10371-10376.  aAn anaerobic/aerobic filter (AF/BAF) system was developed treating dairy wastewater. The influent was blended with recirculated effluent to allow for pre-denitrification in the AF followed by nitrification in the BAF. The recirculation ratio ranged 100–300%. The average chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was 79.8–86.8% in the AF and the average total nitrogen removal efficiency was 50.5–80.8% in the AF/BAF system. Steady-state mass balances on the AF were used to analyze removal kinetics in the AF. The kinetic model values for effluent COD in the AF were overestimated as compared with experimental data. The integrated suspended and attached biomass growth rates in the AF were estimated. The specific growth rate of the integrated biomass at each recirculation ratios was 0.6213, 0.6647, and 1.20831/day, respectively. The increase in specific growth rate corresponded to increases in biomass sloughing as the recirculation ratio increased.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilters 3abiomass 3achemical oxygen demand 3adairies 3aeffluents 3amixing 3anitrification 3anitrogen content 3awastewater 2aAerobiosis 2aAnaerobiosis 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiological Oxygen Demand Analysis 2aBiomass 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aComputer Simulation 2aDairying 2aFiltrationxinstrumentation 2aKinetics 2aNitrogenxisolation & purification 2aOrganic Chemicalsxisolation & purification 2aReproducibility of Results 2aRheology 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxisolation & purification 2aWater Purificationxinstrumentationxmethods.1 aFox, Peter0 tBioresource technology.g2011 Nov., v. 102, no. 22 p.10371-10376dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2011.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01706naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245010400131300001600235520064300251592002800894650001500922650001000937650001000947650001000957650001600967650001200983650001000995651002201005651001001027653002301037653003201060653001001092653000901102653001301111653002101124700002401145773014201169852000901311655001201320IND60595941920221118235043.0180608s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059594192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaumann, Julia10aNew species and reports of scutacarid mites from Andalusia, Spain, (Heterostigmatina, Scutacaridae)  ap. 145-160.  aKnowledge about the fauna of scutacarid mites (Heterostigmatina, Pygmephoroidea, Scutacaridae) on the Iberian Peninsula is very scarce.

Here, we report a heterogeneous single atom Ir–La/AC catalyst to produce methyl acetate in a fixed-bed reactor. A high TOF of 2200h–¹ and high selectivity over 90% for methyl acetate with space time yield of 8200 g/(kgcₐₜ h) were achieved over the Ir–La/AC catalyst. Furthermore, the effects of reaction temperature, partial pressure of CO and CH₃OH, weight ratio of CH₃I/CH₃OH, total LHSV as well as the role of La on the catalytic performance of Ir/AC were tested in this paper. In addition, we proposed a reasonable mechanism for heterogeneous methanol carbonylation over La stabilized single atom Ir/AC catalyst. Our work provides a reference for the further scale-up of the process and a stable, supported, single-atom system as a substitution for other homogeneous catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aacetic acid 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aleaching 3amethanol 3aprocess design 3atemperature1 aSong, Xiangen1 aRen, Zhou1 aDing, Yunjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8894-96480 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Mar. 07, v. 58, no. 12 p.4755-4763dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b054023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01387naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245016400161300001800325520030900343592002800652650001100680650002300691650002800714650002300742650001400765700003000779700002100809700002200830700001900852773010600871856007500977852000901052655001201061IND60578577820221118055254.0170813e20130816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057857782DNAL7 a10.1021/ol401817q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakizawa, Shinobu10aOrganocatalyzed Formal [2 + 2] Cycloaddition of Ketimines with Allenoates: Facile Access to Azetidines with a Chiral Tetrasubstituted Carbon Stereogenic Center  ap. 4142-4145.  aAn enantioselective organocatalyzed aza-MBH-type reaction of ketimines and allenoates has been developed.

A greenhouse pot experiment was carried out using an edible plant species Eruca vesicaria L. Cavalieri grown on an artificially contaminated soil with Zn (665 mg kg(-1)). In this study, the effect of compost at 20 t ha(-1) (C20) and at 60 t ha(-1) (C60), manure at 10 t ha(-1) (M10) and at 30 t ha(-1) (M30), and chemical fertilizers (NPK) on Zn fate in a soil-plant system was evaluated. At the end of the experiment, the main growth parameters and Zn content in plants were determined. In addition, Zn speciation in the soil was assessed using the original Community Bureau of Reference sequential extraction and diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid extraction. Zinc, though an essential element for plant growth, caused toxicity effects in plants grown on control and manure treatments, while in the compost treatments, plants showed no visual toxicity symptoms. The concentrations of Zn in roots were similar for all treatments, while significant differences were observed for shoots. In fact, in the compost treatments, plants showed the lowest Zn concentration in shoots. Zinc speciation seems not to be affected by the applied treatments. Indeed, Zn plant content and translocation to shoots seems to be affected. Compost amendments significantly reduced Zn content and translocation in comparison to other treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEruca vesicaria 3acomposts 3aheavy metals 3aplant growth 3apolluted soils 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil organic matter 3azinc 2aBiological Availability 2aBrassicaceaexmetabolism 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFertilizersxanalysis 2aManurexanalysis 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysis 2aPlant Rootsxmetabolism 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 2aZincxanalysis1 aCavoski, Ivana1 aMondelli, Donato1 aMiano, Teodoro0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2013 July, v. 20, no. 7 p.4766-4776dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-012-1439-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03504naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245012300164520219800287592002802485650003602513650002502549650002202574650001902596650001102615650002202626650002202648651001002670653000802680653000802688653001202696653003002708653004402738653003702782653005002819700001702869700001202886773010102898856008602999852000903085655001203094IND60746722220221122224335.0211017e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074672222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1080022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Man10aImpact of environmental regulation policy on ecological efficiency in four major urban agglomerations in eastern China  aRapid economic development of any country will usually lead to negative environmental impacts. A free market economy cannot fundamentally solve this issue, which requires the guidance and control of the government. The environmental policies of governments can effectively improve the ecological conditions in a region. This study quantifies environmental regulation policies and takes four urban agglomerations in eastern China as the research object to explore the influence of environmental regulation on regional ecological efficiency. First, policies can be divided into policy control, pollution control, ecological protection, and social adjustment by building a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model of a policy text library to measure differences in urban policy bias. Next, a slack-based measure (SBM) model was used to measure urban ecological efficiency. Finally, using the qualitative comparison analysis method, the time effect was considered and the ecological efficiency configuration of the entire region was obtained. In addition, contrast analysis was conducted for different path configurations and the reasons of the statuses of the four urban agglomerations were obtained. The results show that policy control, pollution control, ecological protection, and other mandatory policies can significantly reduce the negative environmental effects, especially when the policy controls involve an explicit form of punishment, which is a necessary condition for achieving a high level of ecological efficiency. However, social adjustment means having higher requirements for regional total factor development, which requires improving the environmental awareness of residents and improving corporate social responsibility. Regional differences will mean that areas with a lower level of economic development have a higher intensity of policy control, and the means of policy control should be matched with the level of economic development. In addition, this study proposes some policy suggestions, such as strengthening policy control and pollution prevention, strengthening social regulation, and promulgating environmental laws and regulations according to local conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorporate social responsibility 3aeconomic development 3aenvironmental law 3amarket economy 3amodels 3apollution control 3asocial adjustment 3aChina 0aLDA 0aQCA 0aSBM-DEA 0aEco-efficiency evaluation 0aLatent Dirichlet Allocation topic model 0aQualitative comparative analysis 0aSlack-based Measure Data envelopment analysis1 aSun, Mingxue1 aLi, Jun0 tEcological indicators.g2021 Nov., v. 130 p.108002-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1080023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245011000161300001800271520120500289592002801494650001501522650001501537650001201552650001201564650001101576650001401587650001301601650001301614650001301627650001701640650001901657700001601676700001801692700001801710773010301728856004801831852000901879655001201888IND4483991420221117202313.0120715e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448399142DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-009-0305-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jing10aTrace element and rare earth element of cap carbonate in Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation in Yangtze Gorges  ap. 3295-3302.  aFor the Doushantuo cap carbonate at the Jiulongwan section in the Yangtze Gorges, its concentrations of redox sensitive elements suggest two distinct enrichments in stratigraphy. These enrichments occur at about 0.8 m and 3.3 m above the bottom of cap carbonate, respectively. They are interpreted as the temporary anoxic depositional conditions due to the oxidation of seeped methane. REE+Y patterns of the cap carbonate are classified into three types with different styles: (1) from the bottom to 2.45 m, representing the behaviors of freshwater and suggesting that massive meltwater swarmed into surface oceans during the deglaciation; (2) from 2.45 m to 3.3 m, indicating the pattern of ancient seawater possibly due to upwelling of deep water; and (3) from 3.3 m to the top, showing âMREE bulgeâ pattern with HREE-depletion as a result of diagenesis. The three-stage REE+Y patterns represent the transformations of shallow water in the wake of the Marinoan glaciation in this region: the fresh meltwater was dominant first, and then it interfused into the oceanic basin by the transgression and upwelling. Bloom of plankton further introduced anoxia near the water-sediment interface.  aPublisher supplied data 3afreshwater 3aglaciation 3ahypoxia 3amethane 3aoceans 3aoxidation 3aplankton 3aseawater 3asnowmelt 3astratigraphy 3atrace elements1 aChu, XueLei1 aChang, HuaJin1 aFeng, LianJun0 tChinese science bulletin.g2009 Sept., v. 54, no. 18 p.3295-3302dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-009-0305-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245010300173300001600276520139200292592002801684650001601712650002601728650001501754650001701769650001401786650001001800650002201810650001701832650001601849700002901865700002601894700002401920773009601944856008102040990002302121852000902144655001202153IND60093804220221122170026.0141104e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009380422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2012.06.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSretenović, Goran B.10aPulsed corona discharge driven by Marx generator: Diagnostics and optimization for NOₓ treatment  ap. 121-129.  aA compact, repetitive Marx generator with an external trigger is constructed and coupled with a wire-to-plate corona reactor for a positive pulsed corona discharge studies. The reactor resistance and capacitance behavior during the pulse was observed. It was found that the reactor's capacitance increases three times during the pulse due to the streamer propagation from anode to grounded electrode. Using the time development of the capacitance and resistance during the pulse and the reactor inter-electrode distance, the streamer velocity has been calculated to be 1 × 10⁶ m/s, for system arrangement presented in this work. As an indicator of chemical activity of pulsed corona, ozone production was measured. Emission spectroscopy measurements in the UV region were performed to detect species that appear in the discharge and to determine vibrational and rotational temperatures, which are found to be 3200 K and 340 K respectively. As a measure of pollution control potential of the constructed pulsed corona system, NO oxidation efficiency was investigated and compared with results presented in literature. It was shown that pulsed corona systems with significantly longer pulse durations are competitive with several times shorter pulse duration systems, which implies that chemical efficiency of secondary streamers is comparable with efficiency of primary streamers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3adiagnostic techniques 3aelectrodes 3anitric oxide 3aoxidation 3aozone 3apollution control 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature1 aObradović, Bratislav M.1 aKovačević, Vesna V.1 aKuraica, Milorad M.0 tCurrent applied physics.g2013 Jan., v. 13, no. 1 p.121-129dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2012.06.0263Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100004900147245010700196300002000303520152000323592002801843650002201871650001901893650001101912650001701923650002201940650002501962650001401987650002002001650001902021650002202040650001302062650001502075650001802090650001102108650002502119650001202144650002202156700001902178700001802197700001802215700001402233773016902247856008102416852000902497655001202506IND60597836020221122071410.0180627e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059783602DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-2160-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Ke1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5279-584312aA scientometric review of emerging trends and new developments in agricultural ecological compensation  ap. 16522-16532.  aAgricultural ecological compensation has drawn an increasingly broad range of interest since early 1990s. In recent years, the volume of the literature grows rapidly. As a result, a systematic review of the diverse research field and its current trends becomes essential. This paper surveys the literature of agricultural ecological compensation between 1990 and 2016. Specifically, by employing CiteSpace information visualization software, we firstly identified the research hotspots and evolution path and then illustrated the frontier and developing trend of the domain in core and broader perspectives. It is found that the focus of the academic community has always been researches on the theoretical policy and application of the payment for agro-ecosystem services, agricultural ecological compensation based on contingent valuation method, and ecological compensation of farmland landscape and organic food production as well as willingness to accept/pay for land use and ecological protection. Meanwhile, we also found that, in recent years, qualitative research has received more and more attention in the field of agricultural ecological compensation, since global warming, agricultural carbon emissions, and other emerging environmental issues have aroused widespread concern of the people around the world. Moreover, we believed that more and more scholars will employ case study methodology to analyze agricultural ecological compensation in specific systems, regions, or circumstances in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagroecosystems 3acarbon 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3acontingent valuation 3aemissions 3afood production 3aglobal warming 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3alandscapes 3aorganic foods 3apeople 3aqualitative analysis 3asurveys 3asystematic review1 aZhang, Junbiao1 aWang, Xueting1 aZeng, Yangmei1 aZhang, Lu0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 June, v. 25, no. 17 p.16522-16532dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-2160-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100007200144245012900216520112200345592002801467650001801495650001701513650001601530650002601546650001301572650001401585650001001599650001801609650001501627650001101642650001201653650002001665650001801685650002501703653002501728653002601753653001901779653002101798653001001819700002701829700001701856700001901873773012001892856007802012852000902090655001202099IND60603827820221123022213.0180716e20180703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060382782DNAL7 a10.1515/ijfe-2017-02052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPongpichaiudom, Aujcharaporn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0635-453410aModeling of Dielectric and Thermal Properties of Protein-Enriched Instant Noodles as a Function of Food Chemical Composition  aDielectric property measurement instruments are expensive and not readily available. Hence, models of the dielectric and thermal properties of protein-enriched instant noodles (PEIN) were developed as a function of the product moisture, protein, ash, fat, carbohydrate, and crude fiber contents. The chicken meat, egg yolk, and seaweed in PEIN varied from 0 to 30, 0 to 15, and 0 to 6 g/100 g flour, respectively. Results revealed that protein, fat, and ash contents of PEIN increased by chicken meat, egg yolk, and seaweed supplementation. Regression equations indicated that the moisture and protein contents significantly (P ≤ 0.05) increased, while the fat content decreased the dielectric and thermal properties. The R² values of the dielectric constant and loss factor, thermal conductivity, and specific heat equations were 0.75, 0.87, 0.78, and 0.98, respectively. Finally, no significant differences (P > 0.05) between the properties values predicted from the model equations and the experimental data (not included in the development of model equations) was observed which indicated a good model fit.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbohydrates 3achicken meat 3acrude fiber 3adielectric properties 3aegg yolk 3aequations 3aflour 3alipid content 3amacroalgae 3amodels 3anoodles 3aprotein content 3aspecific heat 3athermal conductivity 0achemical composition 0adielectric properties 0ainstant noodle 0amicrowave drying 0amodel1 aSongsermpong, Sirichai1 aTang, Juming1 aSablani, Shyam0 tInternational journal of food engineering.g2018 July 03, v. 14, no. 5-6dDe GruyterwJournal:2183x1556-37587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ijfe-2017-02053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245017100174300001600345520139600361592002801757650001601785650001701801650001601818650001601834650001001850650000801860650001301868650001901881650001201900650001501912650001401927650001301941650001001954650001301964650001601977650003401993650003302027651000902060700002002069700001702089700002002106700003002126773009602156856008602252852000902338655001202347IND60095614920221117225118.0141104e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009561492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2011.02.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuiamet, Patricia10aBiofouling and biodeterioration in materials stored at the Historical Archive of the Museum of La Plata, Argentine and at the National Archive of the Republic of Cuba  ap. 229-234.  aThe aims of this paper were to study the biofouling and biodeterioration of photos and maps stored at Historical Archive of the Museum of La Plata (HAMP), Argentine, and two repositories of the National Archive of Cuba Republic (NARC) and to carry out the physiological characterization of the isolated fungi and bacteria. The role of the environmental microbiota in the biofouling formation was also studied. Microbial assemblages in the air were sampled by sedimentation technique while those on documents were sampled by swabbering. Biofilm formation and biofouling were monitored by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Large microbial assemblages were found at NARC archives with the prevalence of genera Aspergillus, Cladosporium and Penicillium, whereas at HAMP these values were lower, Penicillium was the only fungal genus detected. Most of the fungi degraded cellulose and produced pigments and acids, and all of the isolated bacteria had proteolytic and/or cellulolytic activity. In all cases, a higher concentration of viable bacteria than of fungi was isolated from documents. These results correlated with bacterial values detected in air at NARC repositories. However, this correlation cannot be observed at HAMP where Aspergillus, Penicillium and Talaromyces helicus (teleomorph of Penicillium) were isolated. It is the first time that the last genus is reported in documents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aCladosporium 3aPenicillium 3aTalaromyces 3aacids 3aair 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3abiofouling 3acellulose 3acolloids 3afungi 3apigments 3aproteolysis 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aCuba1 aBorrego, Sofía1 aLavin, Paola1 aPerdomo, Ivette1 aSaravia, Sandra Gómez de0 tColloids and surfaces.g2011 July 1, v. 85, no. 2 p.229-234dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2011.02.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02141naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245016100166300001800327520088500345592002801230650002401258650001201282650002001294650001801314650001301332650001501345650001201360650001101372650002101383650001601404653002001420653001401440653001201454700001501466700003601481773014001517856007701657852000901734655001201743IND60521606420221122005622.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052160642DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1980-11222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaihub, Abdussalam10aStudies on Vitamin B12 and Related Compounds, 51 [1] Direct Syntheses of Alkylcobalamins from Alkanes and Vitamin B12r under "Oxidizing-Reducing" Conditions  ap. 1435-1438.  aSyntheses of methylcobalamin from methane, and of n-alkylcobalamins from n-alkanes (C₂→C₁₀) and vitamin B₁₂ᵣ are described. The compounds are formed under "oxidizing-reducing" conditions: Oxygen radicals (O₂-, HOO·, and HO·) are generated from the reaction of O₂ with reducing metal ions, notably V⁺³ (aq) and abstract hydrogen from the alkane substrates. The resulting alkyl radicals are captured by vitamin Bj2r with high efficiency to yield alkylcobalamins. The reactions take place at room temperature in mildly alkaline or acidic solutions.

Braconidae)  ap. 976-985.  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: The moulting accelerating compounds (MACs) or ecdysteroid agonists represent a selective group of insecticides acting upon binding to the ecdysteroid receptor (EcR) and leading to lethal premature moulting in larval stages and aborted reproduction in adults. Psyttalia concolor Szèpl. is a useful parasitic wasp attacking important tephritid pests such as the medfly and olive fruit fly. RESULTS: Contact and oral exposure in the laboratory of female parasitic wasps to the dibenzoylhydrazine‐based methoxyfenozide, tebufenozide and RH‐5849 did not provoke negative effects. No mortality and no reduction in beneficial capacity were observed. The ligand‐binding domain (LBD) of the EcR of P. concolor was sequenced, and a homology protein model was constructed which confirmed a cavity structure with 12 α‐helices, harbouring the natural insect moulting hormone 20‐hydroxyecdysone. However, a steric clash occurred for the MAC insecticides owing to a restricted extent of the ligand‐binding cavity of the PcLBD‐EcR, while they did dock well in that of susceptible insects. CONCLUSIONS: The insect toxicity assays demonstrated that MACs are selective for P. concolor. The modelling/docking experiments are indications that these insecticides do not bind with the LBD‐EcR of P. concolor and support the theory that they show no biological effects in the parasitic wasp. These data may help in explaining the compatible use of MACs together with parasitic wasps in IPM programmes.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainsect hormones 3atoxicity 3areproduction 3amodels 3aPsyttalia 3areceptors 3adietary exposure 3amortality 3aBactrocera oleae 3aintegrated pest management 3amolting 3alarvae 3apests 3aCeratitis capitata 3atebufenozide 3ainsects 3amethoxyfenozide 3aadults 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aEcdysteroidsxagonists 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aHydrazinesxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aInsect Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aInsecticidesxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aLigands 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMoltingxdrug effects 2aOvaryxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aReceptors, Steroidxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aWaspsxmetabolismxphysiology. 0aproteins 0aagonists1 aChristiaens, Olivier1 aAmor, Fermín1 aViñuela, Elisa1 aRougé, Pierre1 aMedina, Pilar1 aSmagghe, Guy0 tPest management science.g2012 July, v. 68, no. 7 p.976-985dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.3274  aDNAL 7aarticle04003naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003700151245012200188520259300310592002802903650002402931650001102955650002202966650001202988650002303000650001603023650001303039651001103052653002503063653001003088653002203098653002803120653002703148653002503175700002703200700002203227700003203249700002703281700003003308700002303338773010103361856008603462852000903548655001203557IND60746722420221122224242.0211017e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074672242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1080252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrautenmüller, Jonathan William10aRegression estimators for aboveground biomass and its constituent parts of trees in native southern Brazilian forests  aThe mathematical models used applying the Nonlinear Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (NSUR) or Weighted Nonlinear Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (WNSUR) methodologies can contribute to generate acceptable and reliable estimates of total aboveground biomass and its constituent parts, which are needed to implement forest management strategies to maintain desirable and sustainable carbon stocks. The aim of this study was: 1) to fit the sample data with independent nonlinear regression models and present the results obtained from the respective statistical estimates for total biomass aboveground and the constituent parts of trees in native forest trees. 2) To fit the sample data with regression models simultaneously, that is, whose models are composed of appropriate combinations of their coefficients, in order to obtain additivity of the estimates and present better results for the total aboveground biomass and the constituent parts of the trees. 3) To apply weighting procedures to the variances of the fitted models. 4) To evaluate the error due to the regression function on forest biomass estimation. The data came from eight sites located in the states of Parana and Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and information was collected on diameter at 1.30 m aboveground (DBH), total height, biomasses of the trunk components (branches and leaves) and total aboveground biomass. Non-linear functions were independently and simultaneously fitted, using DBH and total height as independent variables in the regression models. Independent fitting of equations was performed using generalized nonlinear least squares (ENGLS) and simultaneous fitting of equations was obtained by means of NSUR. Weighting, by applying a variance structure in the two procedures, was done to solve the issue of heteroscedasticity. Numerically, the equations fitted simultaneously performed better and were more efficient than the independently fitted models, which resulted in biological inconsistency, that is, non-additivity of the biomass of constituent parts of the trees and the total biomass. Simultaneous fitting generated superior statistical and biological properties to obtain tree estimates of the of constituent parts of the trees and total aboveground biomass in native forests of southern Brazil. The smaller error due to the regression function used in the forest biomass inventory was obtained by simultaneous fitting. With these results, the procedure using simultaneous and weighted fitting of equations (WNSUR) is recommended to fit biomass equations for native forests in southern Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3acarbon 3aforest management 3aforests 3aheteroskedasticity 3ainventories 3avariance 3aBrazil 0aSimultaneous fitting 0aWNSUR 0aModel performance 0aEfficiency of estimates 0aBiological consistency 0aDestructive sampling1 aPéllico Netto, Sylvio1 aBalbinot, Rafaelo1 aWatzlawick, Luciano Farinha1 aDalla Corte, Ana Paula1 aSanquetta, Carlos Roberto1 aBehling, Alexandre0 tEcological indicators.g2021 Nov., v. 130 p.108025-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1080253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245008400164520136400248592002801612650001901640650001101659650001101670700002101681700002101702700002001723700001801743700002101761700001801782700001801800700001801818773012101836856007601957852000902033655001202042IND60754126820221119225104.0211023e20211007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075412682DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111029042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEerdekens, Anniek 10aHorse Jumping and Dressage Training Activity Detection Using Accelerometer Data  aEquine training activity detection will help to track and enhance the performance and fitness level of riders and their horses. Currently, the equestrian world is eager for a simple solution that goes beyond detecting basic gaits, yet current technologies fall short on the level of user friendliness and detection of main horse training activities. To this end, we collected leg accelerometer data of 14 well-trained horses during jumping and dressage trainings. For the first time, 6 jumping training and 25 advanced horse dressage activities are classified using specifically developed models based on a neural network. A jumping training could be classified with a high accuracy of 100 %, while a dressage training could be classified with an accuracy of 96.29%. Assigning the dressage movements to 11, 6 or 4 superclasses results in higher accuracies of 98.87%, 99.10% and 100%, respectively. Furthermore, during dressage training, the side of movement could be identified with an accuracy of 97.08%. In addition, a velocity estimation model was developed based on the measured velocities of seven horses performing the collected, working, and extended gaits during a dressage training. For the walk, trot, and canter paces, the velocities could be estimated accurately with a low root mean square error of 0.07 m/s, 0.14 m/s, and 0.42 m/s, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccelerometers 3ahorses 3amodels1 aDeruyck, Margot 1 aFontaine, Jaron 1 aDamiaans, Bert 1 aMartens, Luc 1 aDe Poorter, Eli 1 aGovaere, Jan 1 aPlets, David 1 aJoseph, Wout 0 tAnimals.g2021 Oct. 07, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111029043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245021500166300001600381520141300397592002801810650003501838650002501873650001401898650002101912650001301933650001001946650002001956650001701976650004301993650002202036650001102058650001502069700002302084700002502107700002002132773011202152856004802264852000902312655001202321IND50068516220221122215534.0130814e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006851622DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-013-1998-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaiser, Andrea10aEvaluation of the effects of thermal treatments on color, polyphenol stability, enzyme activities and antioxidant capacities of innovative pasty celeriac (Apium graveolens L. var. rapaceum (Mill.) DC.) products  ap. 353-365.  aInitial heating was applied as the first processing step in the production of innovative pasty celeriac products. For this purpose, celeriac was converted into a paste and subsequently heated at 90 and 100 °C for 5-10 min. Alternatively, the fresh plant material was blanched prior to mincing. For the first time, phenolic compounds in celeriac were characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MSn). Among the 14 phenolics detected, several caffeic, ferulic and quinic acid derivatives as well as malonylated and acetylated flavonoid derivatives were newly identified. Upon thermal treatment, the antioxidant capacities (TEAC assay) and the total phenolic contents remained virtually unchanged. The antioxidant capacities of heated samples determined by the FRAP assay were even higher than those of the unheated control. The contents of the main phenolic compound apiin decreased upon heat treatment, whereas the levels of the minor compounds malonylapiin A and B increased. Only by extended steam- and water-blanching at 100 °C, respectively, complete inactivation of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase was achieved. The obtained celeriac products were characterized by their bright white color. Consequently, blanching is recommended as the initial operation in the processing of celeriac into novel pasty products. ©Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApium graveolens var. rapaceum 3aantioxidant activity 3ablanching 3acatechol oxidase 3aceleriac 3acolor 3aenzyme activity 3aferulic acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3apastes 3aperoxidase1 aHartmann, Katja I.1 aKammerer, Dietmar R.1 aCarle, Reinhold0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2013 Sept., v. 237, no. 3 p.353-365dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-013-1998-6  aDNAL 7aarticle01984naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005300151245005500204500002200259520070100281592002800982650002701010650002901037650001101066653002901077653003401106653003401140653001401174653001701188700005501205700005801260700006201318700006101380773008601441856008601527852000901613655001201622IND60786243120221119113204.0220830s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078624312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tplants.2022.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9040-031X10aSparking a sulfur war between plants and pathogens  aPre-press version  aThe biochemical versatility of sulfur (S) lends itself to myriad roles in plant–pathogen interactions.

As red meat is the main source of heme iron, which is in turn a major determinant of increased iron load, adverse cardiometabolic effects of meat consumption could be mediated by increased iron load. The object of the study was to assess whether associations between red meat consumption and CVD risk are mediated by iron load in a population-based human study. We evaluated relations between red meat consumption, iron load (plasma ferritin), and risk of CVD in the prospective EPIC-Heidelberg Study using a case-cohort sample including a random subcohort (n = 2738) and incident cases of myocardial infarction (MI, n = 555), stroke (n = 513), and CVD mortality (n = 381). Following a 4-step mediation analysis, associations between red meat consumption and iron load, red meat consumption and CVD risk, and iron load and CVD risk were assessed by multivariable regression models before finally testing to which degree associations between red meat consumption and CVD risk were attenuated by adjustment for iron status. Red meat consumption was significantly positively associated with ferritin concentrations and MI risk [HR per 50 g daily intake: 1.18 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.33)], but no significant associations with stroke risk and CVD mortality were observed. While direct associations between ferritin concentrations and MI risk as well as CVD mortality were significant in age- and sex-adjusted Cox regression models, these associations were substantially attenuated and no longer significant after multivariable adjustment for classical CVD risk factors. Strikingly, ferritin concentrations were positively associated with a majority of classical CVD risk factors (age, male sex, alcohol intake, obesity, inflammation, and lower education). Increased ferritin concentrations may be a marker of an overall unfavorable risk factor profile rather than a mediator of greater CVD risk due to meat consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohol drinking 3aferritin 3aheme iron 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3amales 3ameat consumption 3amortality 3amyocardial infarction 3aobesity 3ared meat 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3astroke 0airon status 0aferritin 0ared meat 0amyocardial infarction 0acardiovascular disease 0astroke1 aSookthai, Disorn1 aWittenbecher, Clemens1 aGraf, Mirja E1 aSchübel, Ruth1 aJohnson, Theron1 aKatzke, Verena1 aJakszyn, Paula1 aKaaks, Rudolf1 aKuhn, Tilman,0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 107, no. 1 p.113-119dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl45206x1938-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqx0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04146naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245011100210506011700321506007600438520200600514592002802520506003702548650002102585650001602606650001602622650001902638650001402657650001302671650001102684650001602695650002102711650001702732650001502749650001802764650001302782650002102795650001102816650002802827650003002855650001102885650002102896650001102917650001502928650001502943650004302958650000903001653003003010653001503040653001803055653001903073653003203092653004103124700002203165700006003187700002003247700002303267773011103290856008603401852000903487655001203496IND60732460420221207093952.0220606e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073246042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1103262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurakami, Ryuta1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1059-168710aGrowth-promoting effect of alginate on Faecalibacterium prausnitzii through cross-feeding with Bacteroides  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFaecalibacterium prausnitzii is a commensal gut bacterium that is thought to provide protection against inflammatory diseases. However, this bacterium is extremely oxygen sensitive, which limits its industrial application as a probiotic. The use of prebiotics to increase the abundance of this bacterium in the gut is an alternative strategy to achieve its possible health-promoting effect. We evaluated nine substances as candidate prebiotics for F. prausnitzii using a pH-controlled single-batch fermenter as a human gut microbiota model. Of them, alginate markedly increased the relative abundance of F. prausnitzii, as determined by the significant increase in the number of 16S rRNA sequences corresponding to this bacterial taxon in the fecal fermentation samples detected by real-time PCR. However, F. prausnitzii strains were incapable of utilizing alginate in monoculture, implying that an interaction with another gut microbe was required. There was a positive correlation between the relative abundance of F. prausnitzii and that of Bacteroides when cultured in medium containing alginate as the sole carbon source, indicative of cross-feeding between these bacteria. Interestingly, the ratio of acetic acid, a known substrate for F. prausnitzii, produced by Bacteroides was significantly higher in the alginate-containing medium than in media containing other prebiotic candidates. Bacterially degraded alginate oligosaccharides (AOS) remained in the medium after Bacteroides monoculture, and an isolate of F. prausnitzii was able to utilize a portion of them. Genomic sequencing revealed that the strain that consumed the AOS contained an ATP-binding cassette transporter, an alginate lyase, and AlgQ1/2 homologs encoding solute-binding proteins. Furthermore, in real-time PCR analyses, AlgQ1/2 homologs were detected in fecal samples collected from 309 of 452 (68.4%) Japanese subjects. Thus, the products of alginate assimilation by Bacteroides may promote the growth of F. prausnitzii.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aABC transporters 3aBacteroides 3aacetic acid 3aalginate lyase 3aalginates 3abacteria 3acarbon 3acorrelation 3adigestive system 3afermentation 3afermenters 3afood research 3agenomics 3ahealth promotion 3ahumans 3aindustrial applications 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amodels 3aoligosaccharides 3aoxygen 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asole 0aAlginate oligosaccharides 0aPrebiotics 0aCross-feeding 0aGut microbiota 0aButyrate-producing-bacteria 0apH-controlled single-batch fermenter1 aHashikura, Nanami1 aYoshida, Keisuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4903-76081 aXiao, Jin-zhong1 aOdamaki, Toshitaka0 tFood research international.g2021 June, v. 144 p.110326-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1103263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02020naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245006400172500002200236520088800258592002801146650001501174650001101189650001801200650001301218650002101231650002001252653001901272653001701291653001601308653001701324653001801341653001401359700002301373700005701396773008601453856008601539852000901625655001201634IND60786243220221119113423.0220824s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078624322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tplants.2022.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerburger, Klaus10aBricks out of the wall: polysaccharide extramural functions  aPre-press version  aPlant polysaccharides are components of plant cell walls and/or store energy. However, this oversimplified classification neglects the fact that some cell wall polysaccharides and glycoproteins can localize outside the relatively sharp boundaries of the apoplastic moiety, where they adopt functions not directly related to the cell wall. Such polysaccharide multifunctionality (or ‘moonlighting’) is overlooked in current research, and in most cases the underlying mechanisms that give rise to unconventional ex muro trafficking, targeting, and functions of polysaccharides and glycoproteins remain elusive. This review highlights major examples of the extramural occurrence of various glycan cell wall components, discusses the possible significance and implications of these phenomena for plant physiology, and lists exciting open questions to be addressed by future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell walls 3aenergy 3aglycoproteins 3amoieties 3aplant physiology 3apolysaccharides 0apolysaccharide 0aglycoprotein 0atrafficking 0amoonlighting 0aintracellular 0aex planta1 aGłazowska, Sylwia1 aMravec, Jozef1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0331-33040 tTrends in plant science.g2022, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl53669x1360-13857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2022.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001900161245008200180300001600262500000900278520111900287592002801406650000901434650001301443650001901456650001601475650001001491650002001501650001601521650000901537650001801546650001801564700001901582700002101601700001801622773014801640856009601788852000901884655001201893IND60668351220221117233135.0191125e196707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066835122DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1967.03615995003100040021x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJackson, N.

Fungal and bacterial plus actinomycetal counts were made by plating soil suspensions on rose bengal-streptomycin agar and egg albumin agar, respectively. Plates were incubated for 4 to 8 days before counting. The numbers of fungal and bacterial units reflected differences in survival among the microbial populations from soil samples taken at three horizons within field profiles. Microbial counts in the soils at 30% water content (by weight) were generally reduced to zero at lower radiation doses than those in the air-dry soils. One million rads were required to kill all fungi, but 2 to 3 million rads were required to kill all bacteria in a 30-g soil sample. At a given water content, samples with the higher initial microbial populations required greater radiation doses for sterilization than samples with lower populations. For small soil samples, exposure to gamma radiation proved a rapid and efficient method of sterilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagar 3abacteria 3aculture dishes 3aegg albumen 3afungi 3agamma radiation 3airradiation 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3awater content1 aCorey, John C.1 aFrederick, L.

It is important to mitigate nitrogen and heavy metal pollution for the water body. The nitrogen and heavy metal transformation in the rice field surface water was studied by applied combined organic and inorganic nitrogen fertilizer plus the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) in the sandy loam paddy soil and blue clayey paddy soil. The results showed that, the application of DMPP in the rice field in organic and inorganic fertilizer combined application models decreased the heavy metal average concentration of total Cu, Zn, and Cd by 22.1 to 30.2, 33.1 to 36.9, and 10.9 to 17.5% in surface water, respectively. Furthermore, in the sandy loam paddy soil and blue clayey paddy soil, the nitrate, nitrite, and total inorganic nitrogen concentrations decreased by 44.4 and 59.6, 90.3 and 88.6, and 14.2 and 25.4% in the rice field surface water with the DMPP addition, in the organic and inorganic fertilizer combined application models in the rice field, respectively. DMPP could be used as an effective nitrification inhibitor to decline the potential nitrogen and heavy metals runoff loss in the combined application models of organic and inorganic fertilizers in some rice fields, minimizing the nitrogen and heavy metal transformation risk from agricultural fields to the water body and being beneficial for protecting the ecological environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3aintensive farming 3amodels 3anitrates 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apaddies 3apaddy soils 3aphosphates 3apollution 3arisk 3arunoff 3asandy loam soils 3asurface water 3azinc1 aMa, Junwei1 aSun, Wanchun1 aLin, Hui1 aWang, Qiang1 aFu, Jianrong0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2017 Apr., v. 228, no. 4 p.162-162dSpringer International Publishingx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-017-3352-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02151naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009500157300002000252520115300272592002801425650001101453650002301464650001901487650002401506650001101530650001801541700001301559700001601572700001601588773013701604856007501741852000901816655001201825IND60753865320221119071055.0211020e20211018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075386532DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cs00039j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Longfei10aEmerging heterogeneous catalysts for biomass conversion: studies of the reaction mechanism  ap. 11270-11292.  aThe development of efficient catalysts to break down and convert woody biomass will be a paradigm shift in delivering the global target of sustainable economy and environment via the use of cheap, highly abundant, and renewable carbon resources. However, such development is extremely challenging due to the complexity of lignocellulose, and today most biomass is treated simply as waste. The solution lies in the design of multifunctional catalysts that can place effective control on substrate activation and product selectivity. This is, however, severely hindered by the lack of fundamental understanding of (i) the precise role of active sites, and (ii) the catalyst–substrate chemistry that underpins the catalytic activity. Moreover, active sites alone often cannot deliver the desired selectivity of products, and full understanding of the microenvironment of the active sites is urgently needed. Here, we review key recent advances in the study of reaction mechanisms of biomass conversion over emerging heterogeneous catalysts. These insights will inform the design of future catalytic systems showing improved activity and selectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3alignocellulose 3areaction mechanisms 3awastes 3awoody biomass1 aHan, Xue1 aHan, Buxing1 aYang, Sihai0 tChemical Society reviews.g2021 Oct. 18, v. 50, no. 20 p.11270-11292dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1cs00039j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01315naa a2200217 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245004700173300001600220520059700236592002800833650001400861773011900875856008200994852000901076655001201085IND60620418320221120115035.0181108e197305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062041832DNAL7 a10.1177/0002764273016005042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcClelland, Peter D.10aModel-Building in the New Economic History  ap. 631-651.  aOf all varieties of history the economic is the most fundamental.

While studies focus on the interactions with activated flocculent sludge, investigations on the detailed distribution of ENP in other types of biomass, such as granulated sludge, are needed to assess their potential environmental pollution. This study employed engineered magnetic nanoparticles (EMNP) coated with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as model nanoparticles to trace their fate in granular sludge from WWT. For the first time, magnetic susceptibility was used as a simple approach for the in-situ quantification of EMNP with a high precision (error <2%). Compared to other analytical methods, the magnetic susceptibility requires no sample preparation and enabled direct quantification of EMNP in both the aqueous phase and the granular sludge. In batch experiments granular sludge was exposed to EMNP suspensions for 18h. The results revealed that the removal of EMNP from the water phase (5–35%) and biosorption in the granular sludge were rather low. Less than 2.4% of the initially added EMNP were associated with the biomass. Loosely bounded to the granular sludge, desorption of EMNP occurred. Consequently, the removal of EMNP was mainly driven by physical co-sedimentation with the biomass instead of sorption processes. A mass balance elucidated that the majority of EMNP were stabilized by particulate organic matter in the water phase and can therefore likely be transported further. The magnetic susceptibility enabled tracing EMNP in complex matrices and thus improves the understanding of the general distribution of ENP in technical as well as environmental systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3abiological treatment 3abiomass 3abiosorption 3adesorption 3ananoparticles 3aparticulate organic matter 3apollution 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3asludge 3awastewater treatment 0aEngineered magnetic nanoparticles 0aGranular biomass 0aWastewater treatment 0aMagnetic susceptibility 0aMass balance1 aFetsch, Katharina L.1 aDelay, Markus1 aBlauert, Florian1 aWagner, Michael1 aFranzreb, Matthias1 aHorn, Harald1 aLackner, Susanne0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 537 p.43-50dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.07.1613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245017000213506011700383506007600500520111000576592002801686506003701714650002201751650001501773650001201788650000901800650002401809650001701833650002101850650001501871650002801886650001601914651001201930653001901942653002101961653002001982653002302002700001802025700002702043700001802070773011502088856008602203852000902289655001202298IND60786243520221207104421.0220906e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078624352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2022.1054662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhafarian, Fatemeh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6403-446X10aApplication of extreme gradient boosting and Shapley Additive explanations to predict temperature regimes inside forests from standard open-field meteorological data  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aForest microclimate can buffer biotic responses to summer heat waves, which are expected to become more extreme under climate warming. Prediction of forest microclimate is limited because meteorological observation standards seldom include situations inside forests. We use eXtreme Gradient Boosting ‒ a Machine Learning technique ‒ to predict the microclimate of forest sites in Brandenburg, Germany, using seasonal data comprising weather features. The analysis was amended by applying a SHapley Additive explanation to show the interaction effect of variables and individualised feature attributions. We evaluate model performance in comparison to artificial neural networks, random forest, support vector machine, and multi-linear regression. After implementing a feature selection, an ensemble approach was applied to combine individual models for each forest and improve robustness over a given single prediction model. The resulting model can be applied to translate climate change scenarios into temperatures inside forests to assess temperature-related ecosystem services provided by forests.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomputer software 3aecosystems 3aforests 3aheat 3ameteorological data 3amicroclimate 3amodel validation 3aprediction 3asupport vector machines 3atemperature 3aGermany 0aCooling effect 0aMachine learning 0aEnsemble method 0aEcosystem services1 aWieland, Ralf1 aLüttschwager, Dietmar1 aNendel, Claas0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2022 Oct., v. 156 p.105466-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2022.1054663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01849naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245010600176300001600282500002000298520084900318592002801167650001301195650001601208650001101224650001201235650001001247700001901257773017201276856009001448852000901538655001201547IND60737971020221120232735.0210520e198011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073797102DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1699-0463.1980.tb00112.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWESENBERG, FINN10aIgG AND OTHER PROTEINS ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN CARCINOMAS AND CANCER‐FREE TISSUE FROM THE SAME ORGANS  ap. 309-312.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEluates of different tissues were prepared at 56°C using a continuous flow technique.

While nationwide awareness about MAP infection is improving, current level of awareness among beef producers and veterinarians is largely unknown. This study compares the perceptions of beef producers and veterinarians on the burden of MAP infection in cow-calf herds and on measures to control new infections. Questionnaires were mailed to 989 US beef producers through state Designated Johne’s Coordinators and to 1080 bovine veterinarians belonging to a US nationwide professional association. RESULTS: Twenty-two percent (34/155) of producers reported having infected animals in their herds. The mean (minimum, median, maximum) prevalence reported by producers was 0.8% (0, 0, 10). Twenty-seven percent (27/100) of producers had at least one clinical animal during the previous year. Compared to the small herds (<50 head), the mean test-positive percentages and estimated prevalences were higher in medium (50–149) and highest in large (≥150) herds. Seedstock herds had a lower prevalence and these producers were more likely to enroll in Johne’s disease (JD) control programs and test their herds. Veterinarians reported a mean overall animal level prevalence in their client herds of 5% (0, 2, 60). Similarly, 26% (0, 10, 100) of client herds had at least one infected animal. Mean percentage of infected cows within infected herds was 9% (0.01, 5, 80). Producers generally performed activities to control MAP transmission more frequently than perceived by veterinarians. Compared to veterinarians’ opinions, producers were less likely to cull cows with signs consistent with JD (P < 0.01), but more likely to test purchased additions (P < 0.01). Testing recommendations by veterinarians (n = 277) for beef cow-calf herds were bacterial culture of feces (3%), PCR (14%), ELISA (35%) and a combination of these tests (47%). Seventy-nine percent of veterinarians recommended a 12-month interval between testing. CONCLUSIONS: Seedstock producers who had had JD risk assessments performed on their farms were more supportive of JD control programs and had a correspondingly lower prevalence. It is important to increase educational activities to provide relevant information to veterinarians and producers for better management and control of JD. Educational programs should target larger herds to maximize the impact.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium avium 3aattitudes and opinions 3abeef 3acontrol methods 3acow-calf operations 3acows 3adisease prevalence 3aeducation programs 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afarms 3afeces 3ahead 3aherds 3aparatuberculosis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquestionnaires 3arisk assessment 3aveterinarians 2aAnimal Husbandryxeconomics 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aData Collection 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aParatuberculosisxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aPerception 2aPrevalence 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aVeterinarians 3aUnited States 0aUnited Statesxepidemiology.1 aFosgate, Geoffrey T1 aOsterstock, Jason B1 aPark, Seong C1 aRoussel, Allen J.,0 tBMC veterinary research.g2014 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.27-27dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-10-273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001800161245015000179300001600329500000900345520177400354592002802128650003102156650003102187650002902218650002602247650002202273650001902295650001502314650000902329650002002338650002102358650003702379700001802416700002202434773014802456856009602604852000902700655001202709IND60668351520221117233051.0191125e198803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066835152DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1988.03615995005200020021x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedina, O.

Siratro in nonpasteurized soil with applied P levels of 2.5, 10, 20, and 40 mg kg⁻¹ was studied under greenhouse conditions. At 2.5 mg kg⁻¹ of applied P, there was no difference in the shoot dry and root fresh weights between inoculated and control plants. At all but 2.5 mg kg⁻¹ of applied P, plants inoculated with either G. etunicatum or G. intraradices had higher shoot dry and root fresh weights than the control. The increase of shoot dry weight was greater for plants inoculated with G. etunicatum than for G. intraradices. Plants inoculated with G. etunicatum in pasteurized soil had significantly greater total P and N than control plants at low and intermediate levels of applied P, but not at the highest level. Overall, inoculated plants had significantly greater plant P concentration than control plants. For both fungi, increasing P above 2.5 mg kg⁻¹ increased the percentage and total root length colonized by VAM fungi. There was a significant correlation between shoot dry weight and mycorrhizal root colonization of Siratro, expressed as either percentage or total root length colonized, for all inoculated treatments. We conclude that inoculation with effective VAM fungal species can significantly increase the growth of Siratro over a practical range of P in soils that have an ineffective indigenous population of VAM fungi under amended soil conditions.

Here we report the impact of ionic liquid pretreatment on the chemistry and enzymatic digestibility of Pinus radiata compression wood and opposite wood. Samples were pretreated using 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate at 120 °C and 155 °C for 3 h. Hemicelluloses were preferentially extracted during the pretreatment and the recovered biomass was enriched in cellulose and lignin. The pretreatment caused structural modifications to the lignin and polysaccharides that included loss of ether linkages and formation of condensed structures in the lignin, reduced cellulose crystallinity and possible depolymerisation of polysaccharide chains. The enzymatic digestibility of the cellulose was significantly enhanced in both wood types after pretreatment. Approximately 90% of the glucan was converted to glucose after enzyme treatment for 24 h following pretreatment at 120 °C compared to only 3–8% in untreated samples. Because the ionic liquid pretreatment was equally effective on both compression wood and opposite wood the outcome of the saccharification was largely determined by the original chemical composition of the two wood types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus radiata 3aacetates 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acellulose 3achemical composition 3acompression wood 3acrystal structure 3adepolymerization 3aenzymatic reactions 3aenzymatic treatment 3aglucose 3agreen chemistry 3ahemicellulose 3aionic liquids 3asaccharification 3asoftwood1 aLove, Karen T.1 aÇetinkol, Özgül P.1 aDonaldson, Lloyd A.1 aGeorge, Anthe1 aHolmes, Bradley M.1 aSimmons, Blake A.0 tGreen chemistry.g2012 Jan. 3, v. 14, no. 3 p.778-787dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2gc16362d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03480naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245014500167300001400312520192000326592002802246650002002274650002902294650002302323650001802346650001402364650004302378650001102421650001902432650001502451650001502466650001102481650001802492650002102510650001302531650002602544653003302570653001402603653001502617653002802632700005302660700001402713700002002727700001602747700001502763773010002778856008702878852000902965655001202974IND60545772820221123043715.0170719e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054577282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVione, D.14aThe role of direct photolysis and indirect photochemistry in the environmental fate of ethylhexyl methoxy cinnamate (EHMC) in surface waters  ap. 58-68.  aThe aquatic environmental fate of ethylhexyl methoxy cinnamate (EHMC), one of the most used UVB filters worldwide, was studied by assessing its environmental persistence and photoinduced transformations. The role of direct and indirect photolysis was evaluated. Direct photolysis was shown to play a key role, and this process is expected to be the main attenuation route of EHMC in sunlit surface waters. In contrast, the reaction with OH radicals would be negligible and that with 3CDOM* would at most be a secondary process.The measurement of the quantum yield of direct photolysis and of the rate constants of reaction with photogenerated transient species (or, sometimes, the use of reasonable values for the latter) allowed the prediction of the EHMC half-life time in surface waters, by means of a validated photochemical model. The predicted EHMC lifetime is of the order of hours to a few days in fair-weather summertime, and the main factors controlling the EHMC phototransformation in sunlit surface waters would be the water depth and the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content.The formation of transformation products (TPs) was followed as well via HPLC/HRMS. Three TPs were detected in the samples exposed to UVA radiation, while one additional TP was detected in the samples exposed to UVB radiation. The detected TPs comprised 4-methoxybenzaldehyde, a hydroxylated derivative and dimeric species. Through the use of heterogeneous photocatalysis with TiO2, seven additional TPs were identified, most of them resulting from the further degradation of primary TPs formed through direct photolysis and that might be detected in aquatic systems as well. The photodegradation of EHMC in the presence of TiO2 yielded more toxic TPs than the parent compound (as determined with the Vibrio fischeri Microtox assay). The increased toxicity is partially accounted for by the formation of 4-methoxybenzaldehyde.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio fischeri 3adissolved organic carbon 3aenvironmental fate 3afree radicals 3ahalf life 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amodels 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotolysis 3aprediction 3asummer 3asurface water 3atitanium dioxide 3atoxicity 3aultraviolet radiation 0aEthylhexyl methoxy cinnamate 0aSunscreen 0aPhotolysis 0aTransformation products1 aCalza, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5165-929X1 aGalli, F.1 aFabbri, Donata,1 aSantoro, V.1 aMedana, C.0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 537 p.58-68dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245014700163300001600310520122900326592002801555596008101583596008101664650002101745650001501766650001401781650001601795650001201811650001401823650002101837650001801858650001001876650001301886650002001899650002301919650001501942650003301957650002201990650001402012653003202026653002902058653001102087700001702098700001702115700001602132700005902148700001602207773013102223856008302354852000902437655001202446IND60773502720221117185157.0220415e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077350272DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-06-21-0271-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Huilin14aThe Autophagy Genes ChATG4 and ChATG8 Are Required for Reproductive Development, Virulence, and Septin Assembly in Cochliobolus heterostrophus  ap. 830-841.  aAutophagy is a highly conserved degrading process that is crucial for cell growth and development in eukaryotes, especially when they face starvation and stressful conditions. To evaluate the functions of Atg4 and Atg8 in mycelial growth, asexual and sexual development, and virulence in Cochliobolus heterostrophus, ΔChatg4 and ΔChatg8 mutants were generated by gene replacement. Strains deleted for ChATG4 and ChATG8 genes showed significant changes in vegetative growth and development of conidia and ascospores compared with the wild-type strain. The autophagy process was blocked and virulence was reduced dramatically in ΔChatg4 and ΔChatg8 mutants. In addition, deletion of ChATG4 and ChATG8 disordered Cdc10 subcellular localization and formation of septin rings. The direct physical interaction between ChAtg4 and ChAtg8 was detected by yeast two-hybrid assay, and ChAtg4-GFP was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, although GFP-ChAtg8 appeared as punctate structures. All phenotypes were restored in complemented strains. Taken together, these findings indicate that ChATG4 and ChATG8 are crucial for autophagy to regulate fungal growth, development, virulence, and localization of septin in C. heterostrophus.  aPublisher supplied data  a20210402035GHcProject of international collaboration plan in Jilin province  a2016YFD0300704a2017YFD0201802cThirteenth National Key R&D Program of China 3aBipolaris maydis 3aascospores 3aautophagy 3acell growth 3aconidia 3acytoplasm 3aeukaryotic cells 3afungal growth 3agenes 3amycelium 3aplant pathology 3asexual development 3astarvation 3atwo hybrid system techniques 3avegetative growth 3avirulence 0aCochliobolus heterostrophus 0areproductive development 0aseptin1 aJia, Wantong1 aXiao, Kunqin1 aJiao, Wenli1 aZhang, Xianghui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8206-466X1 aPan, Hongyu0 tPhytopathology.g2022 Apr., v. 112, no. 4 p.830-841dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-06-21-0271-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01300naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011300157300001600270520021300286592002800499650001100527650001400538650002300552650001400575650002000589650001700609700001600626700002000642700001800662700002000680700001800700700001500718773012200733856007400855852000900929655001200938IND60662645320221116212917.0190906e20120103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066264532DNAL7 a10.1039/c2gc16364k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Jifeng10aCatalytic conversion of cellulose to hexitols with mesoporous carbon supported Ni-based bimetallic catalysts  ap. 614-617.  aRobust and highly active Ni-based bimetallic catalysts supported on mesoporous carbon have been developed for catalytic conversion of cellulose to hexitols, over which the maximum hexitol yield reached 59.8%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acellulose 3agreen chemistry 3aporous media1 aWang, Aiqin1 aZheng, Mingyuan1 aZhang, Yanhua1 aHuang, Yanqiang1 aChen, Xiaowei1 aZhang, Tao0 tGreen chemistry.g2012 Jan. 3, v. 14, no. 3 p.614-617dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2gc16364k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245020600209500001900415520101200434592002801446650001601474650002401490650001101514650002801525650001301553650002101566650002101587650000901608650002701617650002001644650001201664650001501676651001201691653002601703653001101729653003701740653001901777653001501796700001601811700001401827700001601841700001701857700001501874700001701889700001701906700001801923700002201941700001601963773010601979856008802085852000902173655001202182IND60714845920221120075833.0210212e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071484592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.1117342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBersuder, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3538-735910aBaseline survey of marine sediments collected from the Kingdom of Bahrain: PAHs, PCBs, organochlorine pesticides, perfluoroalkyl substances, dioxins, brominated flame retardants and metal contamination  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA baseline survey of sediment contamination was undertaken at 14 locations around the coastline of Bahrain in May 2017, followed by a focused survey of 20 sites, in November 2019. Samples were assessed for industrial pollutants, including metals, PAHs and a suite of organohalogen compounds. The data generated indicated that levels of chemical contaminants were generally low and did not pose a toxicological risk when assessed against commonly applied sediment quality guidelines (SQG). The highest concentrations of PAHs and PCBs were identified in samples collected at coastal sites adjacent to a refinery area known to contain a diverse mix of industry. Tubli Bay, a heavily stressed small bay receiving high loads of sewage effluent, was also identified as an area warranting further investigation with elevated concentrations of BDE209, PFOS and metal contamination. Such data provides a useful baseline assessment of sediment contamination, against which management control measures can be assessed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromination 3achemical pollutants 3acoasts 3adecabromodiphenyl ether 3aindustry 3amarine pollution 3aperfluorocarbons 3arisk 3asediment contamination 3asewage effluent 3asurveys 3atoxicology 3aBahrain 0aArabian Gulf, Bahrain 0aMetals 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aOrganohalogens 0aOrganotins1 aSmith, A.J.1 aHynes, C.1 aWarford, L.1 aBarber, J.L.1 aLosada, S.1 aLimpenny, C.1 aKhamis, A.S.1 aAbdulla, K.H.1 aLe Quesne, W.J.F.1 aLyons, B.P.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2020 Dec., v. 161 p.111734-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.1117343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01388naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002500161245006000186300001800246500000900264520039000273592002800663650001600691650002200707650002100729650001900750650000900769650001800778700002200796773015100818856009600969852000901065655001201074IND60668351820221117233109.0191125e198909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066835182DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1989.03615995005300050055x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalizzi, Fernando A.10aSoil Surface Salty Crusts and Water Loss by Evaporation  ap. 1605-1607.  aepub  aWater evaporation measurements in small soil columns saturated with different salt solutions show that the surface salty crusts affect the water content as well as the water movement in the soils in the order: NaCl < Na₂CO₃ < Na₂SO₄ < MgSO₄.

In autologous mixtures of AVL/TL and PBL a linear increase in thymidine incorporation was obtained with increasing numbers of PBL. The monocyte concentration in cell suspensions obtained from adenoid and tonsil tissue was lower than in cells prepared from blood; addition of autologous monocytes purified from blood to cultures of AVL and TL was followed by a small increase in response to PPD, but not to the level of responsiveness of PBL. Addition of autologous T lymphocytes purified from blood to cultures of AVL and TL was followed by a small increase in thymidine incorporation, of similar proportions in cultures with and without PPD.

This was possible due to the monitoring protocols of the present study, which allowed estimation of the magnitude of anthropogenic changes from changes naturally occurring in nature. Fish were sampled at the end of every growing season (October) for 23 years at five contiguous sites in a stream, before (1979â1988) and after (1989â2001) regulation. In each sample, six successive electrofishing passes were used to calculate the density and mean biomass for assemblage analysis using the Zippin model. During the study, the natural, meandering stream with pools, riffles, and a moderate canopy was modified into a straight stream of uniform width and depth, stripped of all vegetation. The output layer of a self-organizing map (SOM, the artificial neural network algorithm) applied in this study for site similarity analysis was partitioned into six subclusters placed in two main clusters. Subclusters in the upper part of the SOM were occupied chiefly by regulated stream samples and those in the lower part of the SOM by natural stream samples. Subclusters in the middle position, contained both natural (19) and regulated (20) samples in nearly equal proportion. In addition, the SOM contained one subcluster with sites only from the regulated period and another with only natural sites. Differences between subclusters were attributed to differences in climate, with some differences profound. Warming of the local weather, which became most evident in the 1990s, may have resulted in changes in fish assemblages. This is shown in the SOM, in which samples from the 1980s with cold years dominate the bottom of the SOM, whereas those from the 1990s and later are at the top. Subclusters dominated by regulated or natural sites were not always significantly different when the number of species and diversity indices were considered. Clear differences between the regulated and natural samples involved qualitative characteristics and mainly concerned assemblage composition. They were also confirmed by significant IndVal values (indicator species) and neither mixed subcluster contained important species in their assemblages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abiomass 3acanopy 3aclimate 3afish 3agrowing season 3aindicator species 3amodels 3aspecies diversity 3avegetation 3aweather0 tEcological modelling.g2011 July 10, v. 222, no. 13 p.2103-2118dElsevier B.V.x0304-38007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.03.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011500169300001600284520128900300592002801589596011701617650002801734650001401762650001901776650002101795650001801816650001101834650001101845650001201856650001501868650001101883650001501894650001401909650001801923650001401941650002001955650001201975651001101987653001901998653001902017653001302036653001302049653003402062653001602096700001602112700005602128700005802184773013102242856008302373852000902456655001202465IND60773503020221120131429.0220415e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077350302DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-07-21-0304-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVučković, Nina10aDiversity of Botryosphaeriaceae and Diaporthe Species Associated with Postharvest Apple Fruit Decay in Serbia  ap. 929-943.  aFamily Botryosphaeriaceae and the genus Diaporthe (family Diaporthaceae) represent diverse groups of plant pathogens, which include causal agents of leaf spot, shoot blight, branch and stem cankers, dieback, and pre- and postharvest apple fruit decay. Apple fruit with symptoms of light to dark brown decay were collected during and after harvest from 2016 to 2018. Thirty selected isolates, on which pathogenicity was confirmed, were identified and characterized based on multilocus phylogeny and morphology. Five species from the family Botryosphaeriaceae and two from the genus Diaporthe (fam. Diaporthaceae) were discovered. The most commonly isolated was Diplodia seriata followed by Botryosphaeria dothidea. In this work, Diaporthe rudis is described as a new postharvest pathogen of apple fruit. Diplodia bulgarica, Diplodia sapinea, Neofusicoccum yunnanense, and Diaporthe eres are initially described as postharvest apple and D. sapinea as postharvest quince and medlar fruit pathogens in Serbia. Because species of the family Botryosphaeriaceae and the genus Diaporthe are known to cause other diseases on their hosts, have an endophytic nature, and have a wide host range, findings from this study imply that they may become a new challenge for successful fruit production.  aPublisher supplied data  a451-03-9/2021-14/200116cMinistry of Education, Science, and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia 3aBotryosphaeria dothidea 3aDiaporthe 3aDiplodia pinea 3aDiplodia seriata 3aNeofusicoccum 3aapples 3ablight 3adieback 3aendophytes 3afruits 3ahost range 3aleaf spot 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3aplant pathology 3aquinces 3aSerbia 0aBotryosphaeria 0aDiaporthe eres 0aD. rudis 0aDiplodia 0amultilocus sequence phylogeny 0apostharvest1 aVico, Ivana1 aDuduk, Bojan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8109-74001 aDuduk, Nataša1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7490-10340 tPhytopathology.g2022 Apr., v. 112, no. 4 p.929-943dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-07-21-0304-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003400140245007500174300001800249520187400267592002802141650001802169650001602187650002002203650003002223650002402253650002202277650002002299650002102319650001102340650002002351650001502371650001102386650002402397650001102421650003102432650001602463650001502479700001802494700002402512700002102536700002102557700002402578773012402602856007402726852000902800655001202809IND60662645620221116212908.0190906e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066264562DNAL7 a10.1039/c2gc16385c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoutchkova-Kostal, Adelina M.10aTowards rational molecular design for reduced chronic aquatic toxicity  ap. 1001-1008.  aThe routine rational design of commercial chemicals with minimal toxicological hazard to humans and the environment is a key goal of green chemistry. The development of such a design strategy requires an understanding of the interrelationships between physical–chemical properties, structure, mechanisms and modes of action. This study develops property-based guidelines for the design of chemicals with reduced chronic aquatic toxicity to multiple standardized species and endpoints by exploring properties associated with bioavailability, narcotic toxicity and reactive modes of action, such as electrophilic interactions. Two simple properties emerge as key parameters that distinguish chemicals in the Low EPA level of concern to three aquatic species from those in the High level of concern – octanol–water partition coefficient, (log Pₒ–w) and ΔE (LUMO–HOMO energy gap). Physicochemical properties were predicted using Schrodinger's QikProp, while frontier orbital energies were determined based on AM1 and DFT calculations using Gaussian03. Experimental toxicity data used consisted of chronic toxicity thresholds (NOEC) for Daphnia magna reproduction (317 compounds, 504 h-assay) and Oryzias latipes (Japanese medaka, 122 compounds in 336, 504 and 672 h assays) survival, and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, a green algae model (392 compounds). Results indicate that 92% of compounds of Low chronic concern have log Pₒ–w values < 2 and ΔE > 9 eV. Chronically safe compounds to P. subcapitata meet similar criteria – 80% have log Pₒ–w values < 3 and ΔE greater than 9 eV. Our work proposes design guidelines that can be used to significantly increase the probability that a chemical will have low chronic toxicity, based on the endpoints evaluated, to the three diverse aquatic species studied, and potentially to other aquatic species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aLewis acids 3aOryzias latipes 3aSelenastrum capricornutum 3aanimal reproduction 3aaquatic organisms 3abioavailability 3achronic toxicity 3aenergy 3agreen chemistry 3aguidelines 3ahumans 3amechanism of action 3amodels 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprobability 3atoxicology1 aKostal, Jakub1 aConnors, Kristin A.1 aBrooks, Bryan W.1 aAnastas, Paul T.1 aZimmerman, Julie B.0 tGreen chemistry.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 14, no. 4 p.1001-1008dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2gc16385c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008000164506010400244506007600348520094400424592002801368506003701396650002601433650001601459650002201475650001601497650001501513650001701528650002901545650001401574650001601588650001801604650001201622651001101634700002001645700002501665773011101690856008201801852000901883655001201892IND60786244220221207104412.0220914e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078624422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2022.1021932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWard, Kurt E10aPlasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapies  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMultidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum parasites are a major threat to public health in intertropical regions. Understanding the mechanistic basis, origins, and spread of resistance can inform strategies to mitigate its impact and reduce the global burden of malaria. The recent emergence in Africa of partial resistance to artemisinins, the core component of first-line combination therapies, is particularly concerning. Here, we review recent advances in elucidating the mechanistic basis of artemisinin resistance, driven primarily by point mutations in P. falciparum Kelch13, a key regulator of hemoglobin endocytosis and parasite response to artemisinin-induced stress. We also review resistance to partner drugs, including piperaquine and mefloquine, highlighting a key role for plasmepsins 2/3 and the drug and solute transporters P. falciparum chloroquine-resistance transporter and P. falciparum multidrug-resistance protein-1.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aartemisinin 3aburden of disease 3aendocytosis 3ahemoglobin 3amicrobiology 3amultiple drug resistance 3aparasites 3apiperaquine 3apublic health 3asolutes 3aAfrica1 aFidock, David A1 aBridgford, Jessica L0 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2022 Oct., v. 69 p.102193-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12432x1369-52747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2022.1021933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003700132024001100169040001800180100003800198245006700236300001800303500000900321506017300330520144800503592002801951650001401979650001101993650002402004650002402028650001702052650001902069650001902088650001502107650002202122650001002144700002302154700003502177773013402212856011202346856008402458956013002542961000902672852000902681655001202690IND60006243620221214225839.0191122e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000624362DNAL7 a2920532aris7 a10113/624362hdl7 a10.2135/cropsci2013.03.01432doi8 ans9945  aAGLbengcAGL1 aResende, Rosangela Maria Simeão,10aSelection Methods in Forage Breeding: A Quantitative Appraisal  ap. 1925-1936.  aepub  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aForage breeding can be extraordinarily complex because of the number of species, perenniality, mode of reproduction, mating system, and a variable genetic correlation between spaced plants and sward plots. Aiming to compare eight forage breeding methods for direct selection gain and correlated response, different scenarios of trait heritability and genetic correlation have been evaluated based on deterministic equations of expected (theoretical) breeding accuracy applied to half-sib progenies evaluated in spaced-plant trails, sward-plot trials, or both. Relative efficiency for each method is given in relation to individual selection. Methods differ most when heritability is lower than 0.3, which coincides with the majority of the situations met by forage breeders. Genetic gain of best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP)-based methods is superior to all other methods for trait heritability lower than 0.3, independent of field-trail plot methods, except for parental selection. Methods based on BLUP have also shown higher efficiency when the genetic correlation between spaced-plant and sward-plot trials evaluations of a trait is lower than 0.7 and indirect-trait heritability is lower than 0.3. The choice of forage breeding method should include consideration of the mode of reproduction and the target-trait heritability. The benefits of BLUP-based selection methods should receive more serious consideration by forage breeders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3aforage 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic improvement 3aheritability 3amating systems 3aplant breeding 3aprediction 3aselection methods 3asward1 aCasler, Michael D.1 aVilela de Resende, Marcos Deon0 tCrop science.g2013 Sept., v. 53, no. 5 p.1925-1936dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/624363Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2013.03.01433Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Selection%20Methods%20in%20Forage%20Breeding_292053.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02065naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245005500176300001600231500002000247520093400267592002801201650001001229650002501239650001601264650003501280650003501315650001701350650002501367650001801392700001801410700001601428773017201444856009001616852000901706655001201715IND60737971920221122032132.0210520e198011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073797192DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1699-0463.1980.tb00085.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aANDERSEN, IRENE10aSmooth‐muscle antibodies in rheumatoid arthritis  ap. 131-136.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSmooth‐muscle antibodies (SMA) detected by the indirect immunofluorescence method were found more often in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients (15.3%) than in normal controls (7.6%) (0.02 > p > 0.01).

To investigate changes in the protein composition of FF during ovulation, we conducted a prospective cohort study including 25 women undergoing fertility treatment. Follicular fluid was aspirated either before or 12, 17, 32 or 36 h after induction of ovulation (five patients per time point). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to identify and quantify FF proteins. In total, 400 proteins were identified and the levels of 40 proteins changed significantly across ovulation evaluated by analysis of covariance (adjusted p < 0.05) and on-off expression patterns. The majority peaked after 12–17 h, e.g., AREG (p < 0.0001), TNFAIP6 (p < 0.0001), and LDHB (p = 0.0316), while some increased to peak after 36 h e.g., ACPP (p < 0.0001), TIMP1 (p < 0.0001) and SERPINE1 (p = 0.0002). Collectively, this study highlights proteins and pathways of importance for ovulation and oocyte competence in humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of covariance 3acohort studies 3afollicular fluid 3ahumans 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aoocytes 3aovulation 3apatients 3aprotein composition 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3asomatic cells 3awomen 0aProteome 0aOocyte maturation 0aHuman1 aPla, Indira1 aSanchez, Aniel1 aGrøndahl, Marie Louise1 aMarko-Varga, György1 aAndersen, Claus Yding1 aMikkelsen Englund, Anne Lis1 aMalm, Johan0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2019 July 24,  p.110522-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2019.1105223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01886naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002100167245006800188300001600256520032800272592002800600650002400628650001300652650001300665650001100678650001500689650002500704650001800729650001200747650002700759650002900786650005800815650005000873650001400923650004700937650003400984650002701018700001301045700001601058700002001074700001301094700001601107700001601123700001601139700002001155773010001175856008401275852000901359655001201368IND4470634220221123020648.0141111e20120504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447063422DNAL7 a221767612pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Changguang10aFirst reported fatal Morganella morganii infections in chickens  ap. 452-455.  aMorganella morganii, a Gram-negative rod commonly found in the intestines of humans and other animals, is here confirmed to cause a fatal infection in chickens by isolation and identification of the bacteria, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and experimental infection.

In this study, different oleaginous yeast strains were tested to grow in hydrolyzed food waste, and growths of Cryptococcus curvatus, Yarrowia lipolytica, and Rhodotorula glutinis in this condition were at same level as in glucose culture as control. These strains were further tested to grow in municipal primary wastewater. C. curvatus and R. glutinis had higher production than Y. lipolytica in media made from primary wastewater, both with and without glucose supplemented. Finally, a process was tested to grow C. curvatus and R. glutinis in media made from food waste and municipal wastewater, and the effluents from these processes were further treated with yeast culture and phototrophic algae culture; 1.1 g/L C. curvatus and 1.5 g/L R. glutinis biomass were further produced in second-step yeast cultures, as well as 1.53 and 0.58 g/L Chlorella sorokiniana biomass in phototrophic cultures. The residual nitrogen concentrations in final effluents were 33 mg/L and 34 mg/L, respectively, and the residual phosphorus concentrations were 1.5 and 0.6 mg/L, respectively.

A primary challenge is the optimization of product flux, within a much larger and complex metabolic network. While simple gene deletion methods can be used in the case of non-essential byproduct pathways, more sophisticated approaches are required when competitive fluxes are essential to host cellular functions. Engineering essential metabolic networks has been traditionally off-limits to metabolic engineers. Newer approaches to be reviewed include the rebalancing or rewiring of the metabolic network by tuning the levels of essential enzymes and the use of dynamic metabolic control strategies to conditionally reduce essential competitive fluxes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiotechnology 3abyproducts 3aenzymes 3afeedstocks 3agene deletion 3ametabolic engineering 3asynthetic biology0 tCurrent opinion in biotechnology.g2016 Apr., v. 38 p.106-111dElsevier LtdwJournal:11964x0958-16697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2016.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01974naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245012000135300001600255520091600271592002801187650001901215650001901234650001601253651001201269651001301281653002101294653001901315653001501334653001601349653003001365653001501395653001601410653001501426653002001441773014201461852000901603655001201612IND60595939020221120224625.0180608s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059593902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErmilov, Sergey G.10aNew faunistic and taxonomical findings of oribatid mites (Acari, Oribatida) of the family Otocepheidae from Myanmar  ap. 948-961.  aThe first data on the oribatid mites of Myanmar are presented and these belong to the family Otocepheidae.

Sparingly-soluble phosphate minerals (phosphate rock, PR, and hydroxyapatite, HA) and soluble Hoagland solution (HS, containing ammonium phosphate) were chosen as phosphate sources. Arsenic content in the residual nutrient solutions was analyzed to acquire the phytoextraction effect. The results showed that As concentrations in the nutrient solutions treated with sparingly-soluble P decreased more rapidly than that treated with soluble P. For treatment with sparingly-soluble PR, P. vittata reduced As concentration more rapidly than that in HA treatment and HS control. Nitrate and P concentrations in the residual solutions were also monitored to check eutrophication pollution. Phosphorus in the residual solutions in PR or HA treatment was not detected and 0.5 μg L⁻¹, respectively, much lower than HS control. These results indicated that sparingly-soluble PR could be an ideal P source to facilitate As removal from contaminated groundwater by P. vittata and ensure the nutrient quality of the residual water after phytoremediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPteris vittata 3aammonium phosphates 3aarsenic 3aenvironmental technology 3aeutrophication 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3ahydroponics 3ahydroxyapatite 3anitrates 3anutrient solutions 3aphosphorus 3aphytoremediation 3arock phosphate 0aArsenic 0aPhosphate minerals 0aPhytoremediation 0aGroundwater 0aPteris vittata1 aZhu, Ling-Jia1 aSantos, Jorge A.G.1 aChen, Yanshan1 aLi, Gang1 aGuan, Dong-Xing0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2017 Nov., v. 8 p.366-372dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2017.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01392naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009600160300001800256520047300274592002800747650001300775650001400788650002100802650002300823650001600846650001500862700002300877773010600900856007501006852000901081655001201090IND60578576120221118055241.0170813e20130816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057857612DNAL7 a10.1021/ol401597t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParija, Abhishek10aMechanism of Catalytic Functionalization of Primary C–H Bonds Using a Silylation Strategy  ap. 4066-4069.  aThe mechanism of Ir-catalyzed γ-functionalization of a primary sp³(C–H) bond in 2-methyl cyclohexanol is examined using the density functional theory (M06).

However, these relationships are much more complex and nuanced, as more recent studies have begun to emphasize. In our study, we contribute to this evolving re-orientation in land tenure theory by showing the varying ways women landowners manage their renter relationship. Using qualitative interview data from 56 women agricultural landowners in the Midwestern U.S., we add detail to the nuances that exist in the landowner-renter relationship, helping to re-orient land tenure theory by increasing the understanding of the power dynamics at play within the patriarchal structure of U.S. agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3adecision making 3ahumans 3aland tenure 3aMidwestern United States1 aPetrzelka, Peggy0 tAgriculture and human values.g2022 Sept., v. 39, no. 3 p.997-1006dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl35543x0889-048X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10460-022-10300-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03699naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245015400168506007600322520185800398592002802256506003702284650001002321650003402331650001202365650002602377650001602403650003502419650001402454650002202468650001702490650001002507650002502517650001702542650002602559650000902585650001702594653003102611653003302642653004002675653005102715653002402766653003702790700003102827700002702858700002802885700002802913700002802941773009702969856008203066852000903148655001203157IND60728307020221207130234.0220606e20210501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072830702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1192232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPernomian, Laena10aC-type natriuretic peptide-induced relaxation through cGMP-dependent protein kinase and SERCA activation is impaired in two kidney-one clip rat aorta  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHypertension underlies endothelial dysfunction, and activation of vasorelaxation signaling with low dependence on nitric oxide (NO) represents a good alternative for vascular modulation. C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) causes relaxation by increasing cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cGMP) or Gi-protein activation through its natriuretic peptide receptor-B or -C, respectively. We have hypothesized that CNP could exerts its effects and could overcome endothelial dysfunction in two kidney-one clip (2K-1C) hypertensive rat aorta. Here, we investigate the intracellular signaling involved in CNP effects in hypertension. The 2K-1C hypertension was induced in male Wistar rats (200 g). CNP-induced vascular relaxation and cGMP production were investigated in rat thoracic aortas. The natriuretic peptide receptor-B and -C localization was evaluated by immunofluorescence. Calcium mobilization was assessed in endothelial cells from rat aortas. CNP induced similar relaxation in normotensive and 2K-1C hypertensive rat aortas, which increased after endothelium removal. CNP-induced relaxation involved natriuretic peptide receptor-B and -C activation in 2K-1C rats. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) counter-regulated CNP-particulate GC (pGC) activation in aortas. CNP reduced endothelial calcium and increased cGMP production, which was lower in 2K-1C. CNP-induced cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) and sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA) activation was impaired in 2K-1C rat aorta. Our results indicated CNP triggered relaxation through its natriuretic peptide receptor-B and -C in 2K-1C rat aortas, and that CNP-induced relaxation overcomes endothelial dysfunction in hypertension. In addition, NOS and sGC activities counter-regulate CNP-pGC activation to induce vascular relaxation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaorta 3acGMP-dependent protein kinase 3acalcium 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aendothelium 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aguanosine 3aguanylate cyclase 3ahypertension 3amales 3anatriuretic peptides 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3arats 3avasodilation 0aC-type natriuretic peptide 0aParticulate guanylyl cyclase 0aCyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase 0aSarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 0aVascular relaxation 0aTwo kidney-one clip hypertension1 ado Prado, Alejandro Ferraz1 aSilva, Bruno Rodrigues1 ade Paula, Tiago Dal-Cin1 aGrando, Marcella Daruge1 aBendhack, Lusiane Maria0 tLife sciences.g2021 May 01, v. 272 p.119223-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1192233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01102naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245009700162300001600259520019500275592002800470650000800498650002300506650002600529650001100555650001100566700002800577773012600605856007200731852000900803655001200812IND60657233620221118073637.0190816e20020411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065723362DNAL7 a10.1039/b201442d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamilton, Barton H.14aThe structures of Cu(i) and Ag(i) coordination polymers using the tricyanofluoroborate anion  ap. 842-843.  aThe anion BF(CN)₃⁻ forms isomorphous network polymers with Cu(i) and Ag(i) that exhibit one-dimensional channels along the b axis and demonstrate stability to air and light respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3achemical reactions 3acoordination polymers 3acopper 3asilver1 aZiegler, Christopher J.0 tChemical communications.g2002 Apr. 11, , no. 8 p.842-843dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b201442d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245016000204300001800364506007600382520177700458592002802235506003702263650001702300650001502317650002702332650002702359650001102386650001902397650001002416650001002426650001202436650001002448650001802458650001402476650001802490650001702508651001402525700002202539700002802561700002402589773013702613856008002750852000902830655001202839IND4468236020221207125918.0120326e20111015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446823602DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.05575-112doi7 aPMC31948512pmcid7 a218734892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValster, Rinske M.10aRelationships between Free-Living Protozoa, Cultivable Legionella spp., and Water Quality Characteristics in Three Drinking Water Supplies in the Caribbean  ap. 7321-7328.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe study whose results are presented here aimed at identifying free-living protozoa (FLP) and conditions favoring the growth of these organisms and cultivable Legionella spp. in drinking water supplies in a tropical region. Treated and distributed water (±30°C) of the water supplies of three Caribbean islands were sampled and investigated with molecular techniques, based on the 18S rRNA gene. The protozoan host Hartmannella vermiformis and cultivable Legionella pneumophila were observed in all three supplies. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with the highest similarity to the potential or candidate hosts Acanthamoeba spp., Echinamoeba exundans, E. thermarum, and an Neoparamoeba sp. were detected as well. In total, 59 OTUs of FLP were identified. The estimated protozoan richness did not differ significantly between the three supplies. In supply CA-1, the concentration of H. vermiformis correlated with the concentration of Legionella spp. and clones related to Amoebozoa predominated (82%) in the protozoan community. These observations, the low turbidity (<0.2 nephelometric turbidity units [NTU]), and the varying ATP concentrations (1 to 12 ng liter–1) suggest that biofilms promoted protozoan growth in this supply. Ciliophora represented 25% of the protozoan OTUs in supply CA-2 with elevated ATP concentrations (maximum, 55 ng liter–1) correlating with turbidity (maximum, 62 NTU) caused by corroding iron pipes. Cercozoan types represented 70% of the protozoan clones in supply CA-3 with ATP concentrations of <1 ng liter–1 and turbidity of <0.5 NTU in most samples of distributed water. The absence of H. vermiformis in most samples from supply CA-3 suggests that growth of this protozoan is limited at ATP concentrations of <1 ng liter–1.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcanthamoeba 3aCiliophora 3aLegionella pneumophila 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aclones 3adrinking water 3agenes 3ahosts 3aislands 3apipes 3aribosomal RNA 3aturbidity 3awater quality 3awater supply 3aCaribbean1 aWullings, Bart A.1 avan den Berg, Riemsdijk1 avan der Kooij, Dick0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 77, no. 20 p.7321-7328dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.05575-113Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03700naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001700189245010900206300001400315500001500329506007600344520172600420592002802146506003702174650001302211650001902224650006602243650001502309650002202324650001702346650001902363650002602382650002402408650002602432650001102458650002102469650001602490650001902506650002202525650001202547650002002559650002302579650002802602650001102630653001402641653001302655653002202668653002302690653002002713653002402733700001902757700002402776700002602800700002202826773012202848856008302970852000903053655001203062IND60526793320221207145102.0190410e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052679332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.11.0012doi7 aPMC47071392pmcid7 a266172872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurz, Simone14aThe fucomic potential of mosquitoes: Fucosylated N-glycan epitopes and their cognate fucosyltransferases  ap. 52-63.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFucoconjugates are key mediators of protein-glycan interactions in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. As examples, N-glycans modified with the non-mammalian core α1,3-linked fucose have been detected in various organisms ranging from plants to insects and are immunogenic in mammals. The rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against plant horseradish peroxidase (anti-HRP) is able to recognize the α1,3-linked fucose epitope and is also known to specifically stain neural tissues in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In this study, we have detected and localized the anti-HRP cross-reactivity in another insect species, the malaria mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae. We were able to identify and structurally elucidate fucosylated N-glycans including core mono- and difucosylated structures (responsible for anti-HRP cross reactivity) as well as a Lewis-type antennal modification on mosquito anionic N-glycans by applying enzymatic and chemical treatments. The three mosquito fucosyltransferase open reading frames (FucT6, FucTA and FucTC) required for the in vivo biosynthesis of the fucosylated N-glycan epitopes were identified in the Anopheles gambiae genome, cloned and recombinantly expressed in Pichia pastoris. Using a robust MALDI-TOF MS approach, we characterised the activity of the three recombinant fucosyltransferases in vitro and demonstrate that they share similar enzymatic properties as compared to their homologues from D. melanogaster and Apis mellifera. Thus, not only do we confirm the neural reactivity of anti-HRP in a mosquito species, but also demonstrate enzymatic activity for all its α1,3- and α1,6-fucosyltransferase homologues, whose specificity matches the results of glycomic analyses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aepitopes 3across reaction 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3aperoxidase 3aprokaryotic cells 3abiosynthesis 3aApis mellifera 3aKomagataella pastoris 3aopen reading frames 3apolyclonal antibodies 3agenome 3aeukaryotic cells 3afruit flies 3ainsect vectors 3aAnopheles gambiae 3arabbits 3aenzyme activity 3achemical treatment 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3afucose 0aN-glycans 0aAnti-HRP 0aMass spectrometry 0aImmunofluorescence 0aPichia pastoris 0aFucosyltransferases1 aKing, Jonas G.1 aDinglasan, Rhoel R.1 aPaschinger, Katharina1 aWilson, Iain B.H.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2016 Jan., v. 68 p.52-63dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48131x0965-17487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01354naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013400160300001800294520042700312592002800739650002700767650001300794650001400807700002000821700001800841773013400859856007400993852000901067655001201076IND60727820420221118192925.0210212e20210211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072782042DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc07490j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKouno, Masahiro10aInterconversion between square-planar palladium(ii) and octahedral palladium(iv) centres in a sulfur-bridged trinuclear structure  ap. 1336-1339.  aTreatment of fac-[Rh(apt)₃] (apt = 3-aminopropanethiolate) with Pd²⁺ gives an S-bridged trinuclear complex, [Pd{Rh(apt)₃}₂]⁴⁺ ([1]⁴⁺), which is interconvertible with [Pd{Rh(apt)₃}₂]²⁺ ([2]²⁺).

To date, the link between social living and intelligence has been mainly supported by studies on primates, and far fewer tests connecting sociality to cognitive abilities have used other taxa. Here, we present the first comparative study in fishes that examines whether complex social living is associated with better performance on a cognitively demanding spatial task. Using three cooperative, group-living cichlid fish species and three of their non-cooperative, more solitary close relatives, we studied maze learning and employed a new statistical extension for the ‘lme4’ and ‘glmmTMB’ packages in R that allows phylogeny to be included as a random effect term. Across trials, the three cooperative and the three non-cooperative species completed the maze faster, made fewer mistakes, and improved their inhibitory control. Although fish improved their performance, we did not detect any differences in the extent of improvement between cooperative and non-cooperative species. Both the cooperative species and the non-cooperative species took similar amounts of time to complete the maze, had comparable numbers of mistakes, and exhibited similar inhibitory control while in the maze. Our results suggest that living and breeding in complex social groups does not necessarily imply enhancement of other forms of cognition nor, more specifically, an enhanced spatial learning capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCichlidae 3acognition 3acomparative study 3afish 3aphylogeny 3asocial behavior 0aSpatial navigation 0aMaze learning 0aSpatial cognition 0aCooperation 0aGroup-living 0aLake Tanganyika1 aSingh, Angad1 aWeller, Olivia1 aFang, Xiang Xiang1 aBalshine, S.q(Sigal),0 tBehavioural processes.g2022 Jan., v. 194 p.104550-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11891x0376-63577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2021.1045503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02120naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245023300166300001600399520075500415592002801170650002001198650001801218650001401236650001401250650001701264650001101281650003201292650002301324650002701347650002001374700001701394700001701411700001901428700001601447700001801463773011501481856008201596990002301678852000901701655001201710IND60091009320221120135311.0141103e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009100932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.12.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Cho Rong10aInduction of microtubule-damage, mitotic arrest, Bcl-2 phosphorylation, Bak activation, and mitochondria-dependent caspase cascade is involved in human Jurkat T-cell apoptosis by aruncin B from Aruncus dioicus var. kamtschaticus  ap. 945-953.  aExposure of human Jurkat T cells to aruncin B, purified from Aruncus dioicus, caused apoptosis along with microtubule damage, G₂/M-arrest, Bcl-2 phosphorylation, Bak activation, mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) loss, cytochrome c release, activation of multiple caspases, and PARP degradation.

These models can be employed in urban policymaking or analyses of development scenarios. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of urban growth models, including the evolution of urban models and associated theories and the common framework of different models and their applications. Three typical classes of urban growth models, namely, the land use/transportation model, the cellular automata (CA) model and the agent-based model, were introduced. Their relationships were explained, considering their modelling mechanisms, data requirements and application scales. Based on the extensively utilized urban CA models, we proposed four perspectives for improvements, including the adjustment of the basic spatial unit, the incorporation of temporal contexts, public platforms to support model comparison, and scenario analyses. New opportunities (e.g., open social data and integrated assessment models) have emerged to assist model development and application.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrowth models 3aland use 3asystematic review 3atransportation 3aurbanization 0aLand use transportation models 0aCellular automata 0aAgent based models1 aGong, Peng0 tScience bulletin.g2016 Nov., v. 61 p.1637-1650dElsevier B.V.x2095-92737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-016-1111-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04269naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009600173520328800269592002803557650001503585650001503600650001003615653002103625653003303646653002803679653001903707653001503726653001703741773010303758856008503861852000903946655001203955IND60758163820221123011601.0220103e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075816382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beproc.2021.1045592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÇakmakçı, Cihan10aSheep's coping style can be identified by unsupervised machine learning from unlabeled data  aThe objective of this study was to define coping style of sheep by using unsupervised machine learning approaches. A total of 105 Norduz sheep (age 3–5 years) were subjected to a 5-minute arena test. Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (HCA) was performed on scores of selected principal components retained from Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on arena behaviors to identify sheep coping style. Initially, the variables retained for the PCA were determined with Bartlett’s test for sphericity and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sample adequacy. Seven behavioral variables with KMO values greater than 0.5 were used for final PCA: the average distance to group sheep (DTG), the average distance to stimulus (DTS), the duration of locomotion (LOC), the total number of zone boundaries crossed during the test (CRS), the total number of times that tested sheep sniffed stimulus (NSS), latency to the first sniff the stimulus (LSS), and subjective scores (SCR) scored by an observer on a scale from 1 to 5 (1: extremely calm, 5: extremely restless). The first two components, which were the only ones with an eigenvalue greater than one, accounted for 70.32% of the total variation and were used for clustering analysis. Clustering tendency showed that the scores for the first two components were suitable for clustering (Hopkins' H = 0.852). Several cluster validity indexes were used to obtain aggregated results to determine the most appropriate clustering method and number of clusters. Five different clustering methods: k-means and hierarchical clustering with Ward, average, single and complete linkage were compared. Bootstrap resampling was used to evaluate the stability of a given cluster using the Jaccard coefficient. The clustering method and number of clusters corresponding to the highest rank aggregation score from the bootstrap resampling indicate that the hierarchical clustering method with average linkage and 5 clusters is the most suggested clustering method. However, Ward's algorithm identified the strongest clustering structure for hierarchical clustering, as it had the highest agglomerative coefficient value (0.98). When both Jaccard and aggregation scores are considered together, Ward’s method with 3 clusters was selected as the most appropriate method. Sheep were classified into three coping styles (CS) based on HCA results as reactive (Cluster 1, n = 71), intermediate (Cluster 2, n = 22) or proactive (Cluster 3, n = 12). Coping style had significant effect on behavioral variables, DTG, DTS, LOC, CRS and NSS (P < 0.05). The individuals that have proactive coping style had the highest mean values for the variables DTG, DTS and LOC and SCR (P < 0.0001). This indicates that proactive sheep are more active then reactive sheep. The CRS, LOC and NSS mean values were higher for intermediate sheep compared to reactive sheep (P < 0.05). The NSS values were higher for intermediate sheep compare to proactive sheep (P < 0.0001). The findings of the current study show that distinct coping styles in sheep may be identified based on behaviors recorded in an arena test. The findings also revealed that sheep's coping style can be objectively identified by unsupervised machine learning from unlabeled behavioral data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3alocomotion 3asheep 0aMachine learning 0aPrincipal component analysis 0aHierarchical clustering 0aSheep behavior 0aArena test 0aCoping style0 tBehavioural processes.g2022 Jan., v. 194 p.104559-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11891x0376-63577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2021.1045593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245015600211300001600367520098200383592002801365650003501393650002601428650001801454650001101472650001601483650000901499650002401508653000901532653002401541653001001565653002801575653003701603653005101640700001801691700002101709700002301730700002101753773017201774856008501946852000902031655001202040IND60625249020221117214827.0190523e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062524902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2018.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamada, Yoshihiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0568-575310aAnalyzing the relationship between the inorganic element profile of sake dilution water and dimethyl trisulfide formation using multi-element profiling  ap. 710-713.  aDimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) is the main component of hineka, an off-flavor generated in sake during storage.

We now provide a mechanistic basis for these observations. We show that discrimination of termini occurs during initial binding. Without ATP, dmDcr-2 binds 3’ overhanging, but not blunt, termini. By contrast, with ATP, dmDcr-2 binds both types of termini, with highest affinity binding observed with blunt dsRNA. In the presence of ATP, binding, cleavage, and ATP hydrolysis are optimal with BLT termini compared to 3’ovr termini. Limited proteolysis experiments suggest the optimal reactivity of BLT dsRNA is mediated by a conformational change that is dependent on ATP and the helicase domain. We find that dmDcr-2’s partner protein, Loquacious-PD, alters termini dependence, enabling dmDcr-2 to cleave substrates normally refractory to cleavage, such as dsRNA with blocked, structured or frayed ends.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3aadenosine triphosphate 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aenzymes 3ahydrolysis 3aproteolysis1 aTrettin, Kyle D.1 aAruscavage, P.

However, we report that the 3’ETS of the glyW-cysT-leuZ polycistronic tRNA precursor is highly and specifically enriched by co-purification with at least two different small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs), RyhB and RybB. Both sRNAs are shown to base pair with the same region in the 3’ETS of leuZ (3’ETSˡᵉᵘZ). Disrupting the pairing by mutating 3’ETSˡᵉᵘZ strongly increased the activity of sRNAs, even under non-inducing conditions. Our results indicate that 3’ETSˡᵉᵘZ prevents sRNA-dependent remodeling of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle fluxes and decreases antibiotic sensitivity when sRNAs are transcriptionally repressed. This suggests that 3’ETSˡᵉᵘZ functions as a sponge to absorb transcriptional noise from repressed sRNAs. Additional data showing RybB and MicF sRNAs are co-purified with ITSᵐᵉᵗZ⁻ᵐᵉᵗᵂ and ITSᵐᵉᵗᵂ⁻ᵐᵉᵗⱽ strongly suggests a wide distribution of this phenomenon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA precursors 3aantibiotics 3abyproducts 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransfer RNA 3atricarboxylic acid cycle1 aCarrier, Marie-Claude1 aSemsey, Szabolcs1 aBrouard, Jean-Simon1 aWang, Jing1 aWade, Joseph T.1 aMassé, Eric0 tMolecular cell.g2015, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2015.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02112naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245009300177300001600270520081900286592002801105650002101133650001401154650001301168650001601181650001901197650001601216653001301232653002201245653002201267653003301289700002201322700002301344700002201367700002101389700006801410700002801478773010001506856008701606852000901693655001201702IND60542265920221118022355.0190402e20141115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054226592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.04.1172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarreira, João C.M.10aPhenolic profiling of Veronica spp. grown in mountain, urban and sandy soil environments  ap. 275-283.  aVeronica (Plantaginaceae) genus is widely distributed in different habitats.

In the first stage, the effect of organic loading rate (OLR) and stirring speed on volumetric hydrogen production rate (VHPR) was evaluated in a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR); by controlling the homoacetogenesis with the agitation speed and maintaining an OLR of 44 g COD/L-d, it was possible to reach a VHPR of 6 L H₂/L-d, equivalent to 1.34 kJ/g bagasse. In the second stage, the effluent from CSTR was used as substrate to feed a UASB reactor for CH₄ production. Volumetric methane production rate (VMPR) of 6.4 L CH₄/L-d was achieved with a high OLR (20 g COD/L-d) and short hydraulic retention time (HRT, 14 h), producing 225 mL CH₄/g-bagasse equivalent to 7.88 kJ/g bagasse.

Rainfall variables and indicators from rainfall readings at 42 stations in Malawi, excluding Lake Malawi, were analysed at monthly, seasonal and annual scales. In the study, the data were firstly subjected to quality checks through the cumulative deviations test and the standard normal homogeneity test. Spatial rainfall variability was investigated using the spatial correlation function. Temporal trends were analysed using Mann–Kendall and linear regression methods. Heterogeneity of monthly rainfall was investigated using the precipitation concentration index (PCI). Finally, inter-annual and intra-annual rainfall variability were tested using normalized precipitation anomaly series of annual rainfall series (|AR|) and the PCI (|APCI|), respectively. The results showed that (1) most stations revealed statistically non-significant decreasing rainfall trends for annual, seasonal, monthly and the individual months from March to December at the 5% significance level. The months of January and February (the highest rainfall months), however, had overall positive but statistically non-significant trends countrywide, suggesting more concentration of the seasonal rainfall around these months. (2) Spatial analysis results showed a complex rainfall pattern countrywide with annual mean of 1,095 mm centred to the south of the country and mean inter-annual variability of 26%. (3) Spatial correlation amongst stations was highest only within the first 20 km, typical of areas with strong small-scale climatic influence. (4) The country was further characterised by unstable monthly rainfall regimes, with all PCIs more than 10. (5) An increase in inter-annual rainfall variability was found.  aPublisher supplied data 3alinear models 3arain 3aregression analysis 3aLake Malawi 3aMalawi1 aXu, Chong-Yu1 aGottschalk, Lars1 aAlemaw, Berhanu0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2011 Nov., v. 106, no. 1-2 p.79-93dSpringer-Verlagx0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-011-0413-0  aDNAL 7aarticle01730naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010200157300002000259520059600279592002800875650001300903650001300916650001700929650002100946650000900967650001500976650001400991650001101005650001801016650001401034700001501048700001501063700001801078700001601096700001301112773012401125856007401249852000901323655001201332IND60664845920221123013106.0190912e20140220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066484592DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra47635a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yongqian12aA near infrared fluorescent dye for trivalent ions sensing and working as a molecular keypad lock  ap. 11634-11639.  aA near infrared fluorescent dye (DNSA-SQ) with internal charge transfer (ICT) properties is presented for selectively screening trivalent ions (Al³⁺/Fe³⁺/Cr³⁺) with a ratiometric fluorescence change over other metal ions.

Using a synergistic effect, DNSA-SQ also behaves as a molecular keypad lock with sequential chemical inputs of BSA and Ag⁺ ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3achromium 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3airon 3ametal ions 3ascreening 3asilver 3astoichiometry 3asynergism1 aZhang, Dan1 aLi, Benhao1 aZhang, Yunfei1 aSun, Shiguo1 aPang, Yi0 tRSC advances.g2014 Feb. 20, v. 4, no. 23 p.11634-11639dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra47635a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010400163300002000267520122200287592002801509650001901537650001401556650002301570650001901593650001201612650001601624650002101640650001901661650001301680650000701693650001701700650001501717650002301732650001601755700002101771773012401792856007401916852000901990655001201999IND60664846020221122065456.0190912e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066484602DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra47638c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVafaeezadeh, Majid12aA study on the catalytic activity and theoretical modeling of a novel dual acidic mesoporous silica  ap. 16647-16654.  aA novel mesoporous silica-functionalized dual Brønsted acidic species has been introduced as an efficient catalyst for solvent-free esterification of fatty acids with ethanol. The structure of the catalyst has been characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), TEM and N₂ adsorption–desorption. TGA of catalyst 1 showed no weight loss before 200 °C, indicating a high degree of hydrophobicity of the surface of the mesoporous silica. TEM images and nitrogen adsorption–desorption showed no noticeable changes to the structure of the catalyst before and after acid treatment. pH metric analysis was performed for the catalyst to determine the loading of the acidic sites. The structure of the catalyst was modeled by mimicking the surface of functionalized silica gel in the form of a cage-like cluster. Various conformers from the proposed structures were selected and optimized at the B3LYP/6-311++G** level of calculation. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis was performed to investigate the nature of hydrogen bonding of the catalyst in more detail. Based on the data gained from the optimized structures of the catalyst, a mechanism was proposed for the esterification reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid treatment 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aesterification 3aethanol 3afatty acids 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3anitrogen 3apH 3aporous media 3asilica gel 3atheoretical models 3aweight loss1 aFattahi, Alireza0 tRSC advances.g2014 Apr. 03, v. 4, no. 32 p.16647-16654dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra47638c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094024004000137040001800177100001600195245010800211506007600319506003100395520092500426592002801351596004501379506003701424650001801461650001401479650001901493650001601512650002101528650001901549650001101568650002001579650001201599650001401611653002101625653002301646653002201669653002001691653002601711700001501737700001701752700001801769700002901787773010001816856008701916852000902003655001202012IND60742264720221207064138.0220929e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074226472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1304392chorus7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1304392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Hualu10aDigestibility and gastrointestinal fate of meat versus plant-based meat analogs: An in vitro comparison  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aPlant-based meat analogs are likely to have different gastrointestinal fates than real meat products due to differences in their compositions and structures. Here, we compared the gastrointestinal fate of ground beef and ground beef analogs using the INFOGEST in vitro digestion model, focusing on differences in microstructure, physicochemical properties, lipid digestion, and protein digestion in different regions of the model gut. The presence of dietary fibers in the beef analogs increased their apparent shear viscosity in the gastrointestinal fluids, which may have inhibited lipid digestion in the small intestine. The proteins in the beef analogs were digested more rapidly in the stomach but less rapidly in the small intestine, which may have been due to differences in protein type (globular soy versus fibrous beef proteins), structural organization, and the presence of dietary fibers in the meat analogs.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3afood chemistry 3aground beef 3alipid metabolism 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3asmall intestine 3astomach 3aviscosity 0aPlant-based beef 0aIn vitro digestion 0aProtein digestion 0aLipid digestion 0aGastrointestinal fate1 aHu, Yuying1 aTan, Yunbing1 aZhang, Zhiyun1 aMcClements, David Julian0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 364 p.130439-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1304393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03668naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006100155245009800216300001600314520197700330592002802307650001402335650002502349650001102374650001602385650001002401650000902411650001102420650000902431650001002440650002202450650001402472650001202486650001002498650001802508650001002526650002002536650001602556650001502572650001302587650002102600650001402621650001102635650001202646650001102658650001202669653002802681653001802709653002202727653002502749653001002774700002302784700002002807700002002827773010802847856009002955852000903045655001203054IND60557222120221121041741.0190405e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055722212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2016.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabbioni, Alberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2141-666810aAllometric coefficients for body measures and morphometric indexes in a meat-type sheep breed  ap. 248-254.  aWith the aim to find indirect parameters for meat production that potentially could be used for selective purposes in Cornigliese sheep breed, 368 animals were weighed and measured (16 linear measures) during two years in 4 flocks with pasture and open range management from spring to autumn and closed facilities during winter. An amount of 0.2–0.4kg/head/day of the same concentrate was provided to growing lambs from weaning to slaughter and to lactating ewes. Thirteen morphologic indexes were then calculated from body weight (BW) and linear measures. Analysis of variance on the basis of general linear model procedure was conducted with sex, age-class, year of birth, flock, type of lambing and interaction of sex*age-class as fixed factors and individual as a random factor. The allometric function was applied to body measures and indexes in relation to BW. A positive allometry was recorded for croup width between the trochanters (CrW1: 0.381), at ileum (CrW2: 0.452) and at ischium (CrW3: 0.615), indicating that this region has the fastest growth in relation to BW. All other body measures showed isometry or negative allometry, indicating a slower development in relation to BW. The lowest common allometric coefficient was recorded for front shank circumference (FSC) (0.131) followed by head width (0.200). Among indexes, the lowest growth was recorded by dactyl-thoracic index, due to the slow development of FSC. Sex related differences in allometric coefficients were noted for height at withers and head length (P<0.05), FSC and forehead width (P<0.01) with males earlier than females, and for chest width, chest depth, CrW1 (P<0.05), CrW3 and ear width (P<0.01) with females earlier than males. In conclusion the study of the allometric function applied to body measures and indexes was able to assess the importance of the croup width, not only in females (functional to an early and easy lambing) but also in males (functional to meat production).  aPublisher supplied data 3aallometry 3aanalysis of variance 3aautumn 3abody weight 3achest 3aears 3aflocks 3ahead 3aileum 3alactating females 3alactation 3alambing 3alambs 3alinear models 3amales 3ameat production 3amorphometry 3aopen range 3apastures 3arange management 3aslaughter 3aspring 3aweaning 3awinter 3awithers 0aAllometric coefficients 0aBody measures 0aCornigliese breed 0aMorphometric indexes 0aSheep1 aBeretti, Valentino1 aRighi, Federico1 aSuperchi, Paola0 tSmall ruminant research.g2016 Nov., v. 144 p.248-254dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2016.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03497naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245024900156300001600405500002000421520183700441592002802278650002202306650001702328650002102345650003602366650003402402650001802436650001102454650001502465650004302480650001102523650002102534650001202555650002302567650001002590650002602600650001302626650001102639650002502650650002602675651001102701700002202712700002202734700001802756700002002774773010402794856007202898852000902970655001202979IND60583605720221119052720.0171019e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058360572DNAL7 a10.1002/pca.27062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaller, Julia10aIsolation of Three Triterpene Saponins, Including Two New Oleanane Derivatives, from Soldanella alpina and Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography–Evaporative Light Scattering Detection of these Three Saponins in Four Soldenella Species  ap. 567-574.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aINTRODUCTION: The genus Soldanella is one of the few endemic to Europe. Some of its species have relevance in local traditional medicine. Earlier work has indicated the possible presence of saponins in S. alpina. OBJECTIVE: To investigate S. alpina and other related species for the occurrence of saponins. METHODS: Following sequential extraction with n‐hexane, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate the subsequent methanolic extract of S. alpina roots was fractionated after solvent precipitation using fast centrifugal partition chromatography and column chromatography. Structures were elucidated by LC‐MSⁿ, high‐resolution MS, hydrolysis experiments and one‐dimensional (1D)‐ and two‐dimensional (2D)‐NMR. A hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography method was developed to quantitate saponins in the leaves and roots of four Soldanella species. RESULTS: Three triterpene saponins, two of them new natural products, were isolated from S. alpina. Based on an epoxyoleanal aglycone substituted with four sugar units, they were analytically quantitated using a Kinetex 2.6 μm hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) column together with a mobile phase comprising of ammonium acetate, water and acetonitrile. Method validation confirmed that the assay meets all requirements in respect to linearity, accuracy, sensitivity and precision. All four Soldanella species investigated contained the three saponins. The lowest total level of the three saponins (1.09%) was observed in S. montana leaves while the highest saponin content (5.14%) was determined in S. alpina roots. CONCLUSION: The detection of saponins within the genus Soldanella is an indication that further phytochemical examination of this genus may reveal more secondary metabolites of interest.

Phylogenetic reconstructions derived from sequenced transcripts provided evidence that at least four distinct classes exist (IâIV) and that diversification among these classes occurred early in Angiosperms, prior to the divergence of Monocots/Eudicots. The four previously described classes served as probes to select and further sequence six BAC clones from a genomic library of cultivar R570. A total of 579,352 sugarcane base pairs were produced from these âMutator systemâ BAC containing regions for further characterization. The analyzed genomic regions confirmed that the predicted structure and organization of the Mutator system in sugarcane is composed of two true transposon lineages, each containing a specific terminal inverted repeat and two transposase lineages considered to be domesticated. Each Mutator transposase class displayed a particular molecular structure supporting lineage specific evolution. MUSTANG, previously described domesticated genes, are located in syntenic regions across Sacharineae and, as expected for a host functional gene, posses the same gene structure as in other Poaceae. Two sequenced BACs correspond to hom(eo)logous locus with specific retrotransposon insertions that discriminate sugarcane haplotypes. The comparative studies presented, add information to the Mutator systems previously identified in the maize and rice genomes by describing lineage specific molecular structure and genomic distribution pattern in the sugarcane genome.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPoaceae 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3achemical structure 3aclones 3acorn 3acultivars 3agenes 3agenomic libraries 3ahaplotypes 3aloci 3aphylogeny 3aretrotransposons 3arice 3asugarcane 3aterminal repeat sequences 3atranscriptome 3atransposons1 aRossi, M.1 aCruz, G.

Temperature and social disturbances both influence crop production, yet distinguishing their relative impacts is difficult due to a lack of reliable, high-resolution historical climatic records before the very recent period. Here we present the first tree-ring based warm-season temperature reconstruction for southeastern China, a core region of the East Asian monsoon, for the past 227years. The reconstruction target was April-July mean temperature, and our model explained 60.6% of the observed temperature variance during 1953–2012. Spatial correlation analysis showed that the reconstruction is representative of April-July temperature change over most of eastern China. The reconstructed temperature series agrees well with China-scale (heavily weighted in eastern China) agricultural production index values quite well at decadal timescales. The impacts of social upheavals on food production, such as those in the period 1920–1949, were confirmed after climatic influences were excluded. Our study should help distinguish the influence of social disturbance and warm-season temperature on grain productivity in the core agricultural region of China during the past two centuries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acrop production 3afood production 3agrowth rings 3amodels 3amonsoon season 3asocial impact 3atemperature 3atraditional farming 3avariance 3awarm season 3aChina 0aTemperature 0aGrain productivity 0aSocial disturbance 0aChina 0aTree-rings1 aLi, Jinbao1 aZhang, David D.1 aZheng, Jingyun1 aShi, Shiyuan1 aGe, Quansheng1 aLee, Harry F.1 aZhao, Yesi1 aZhang, Jie1 aLu, Huayu0 tScience bulletin.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 62 p.40-45dElsevier B.V.aScience China Pressx2095-92737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scib.2016.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245007400172300001200246520130800258592002801566650003901594650001401633650001801647650000901665650001901674650002401693650001601717650001701733650000701750650001801757650002001775650002101795650001601816650001901832653001901851653001301870653000901883653001401892653001601906700001601922700001101938700002601949700001701975700001801992773009602010856008702106852000902193655001202202IND60542266220221118022500.0190402e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054226622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSukhotu, Rujira10aAggregation behaviour and stability of maize germ oil body suspension  ap. 1-6.  aTo utilize maize germ oil bodies as ingredients in the food industry, zeta potential determination and particle diameter analysis were used in this study as indicators of the stability of maize germ oil body suspensions. The stability and aggregation properties of maize germ oil body suspensions were studied at different pH and ion strength conditions, and different thermal treatments. Zeta potential measurement, mean particle size determination, and confocal laser scanning microscopy were also performed. The zeta potential and mean particle diameter of the oil bodies were easily affected by salt (7.05mV and d32=1.43μm at 100mM NaCl) and pH (23.30, 15.00, −16.43mV and d32=1.02, 2.55, and 0.95μm at pH 3, pH 4, and pH 7, respectively). Results demonstrated that aggregation and instability of the oil bodies were promoted by high salt concentrations and acidic pH but not by heating. The association between oil bodies and surfactant properties resulted in the disruption of hydrophobic interactions among oil body surface proteins because of the smaller mean particle sizes and the reduced negative charges (−75.73mV and d32=0.46μm at pH 3). Thus, the oil body aggregation behavior and stability of proteins are based on hydrophobic interactions present on the surface of the oil bodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3acorn germ 3afood industry 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3ahydrophobic bonding 3aingredients 3alipid bodies 3apH 3aparticle size 3asodium chloride 3asurface proteins 3asurfactants 3azeta potential 0aLipid droplets 0aEmulsion 0aCorn 0aDetergent 0aAggregation1 aShi, Xiaodi1 aHu, Qi1 aNishinari, Katsuyoshi1 aFang, Yapeng1 aGuo, Shuntang0 tFood chemistry.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 164 p.1-6dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01781naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011900161300002000280520089000300592002801190650001401218700002601232700001701258700002201275773013401297856007501431852000901506655001201515IND60540413920170629000000.0160819e20141119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054041392DNAL7 a10.1021/ja508963v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGońka, Elżbieta10aExpanded Hexapyrrolohexaazacoronenes.

The introduction of peripheral bridges provides access to nonplanar, sterically crowded systems that display complex reactivity patterns, involving stereospecific aromatization of bridges and nucleophile additions. Despite the interrupted conjugation on the periphery, the new azacoronenes have easily accessible higher oxidation levels, and a quadruply charged species was chemically generated by reaction with SbCl₅. These oxidized species show extensive π-electron conjugation and are efficient UV–vis–NIR absorbers, active up to ca. 2400 nm. Interruption of peripheral conjugation is shown to induce a tendency toward biradicaloid electron configurations in doubly oxidized species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aoxidation1 aChmielewski, Piotr J.1 aLis, Tadeusz1 aStępień, Marcin0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Nov. 19, v. 136, no. 46 p.16399-16410dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja508963v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02312naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245011300166300002000279520127000299592002801569650001501597650001201612650002001624650000901644650002401653650001301677650001101690700002601701700001901727700002201746773012301768856007401891852000901965655001201974IND60664846320221122065504.0190912e20140501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066484632DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra47642a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemirkol, Dilek Odaci10aEnzyme immobilization in biosensor constructions: self-assembled monolayers of calixarenes containing thiols  ap. 19900-19907.  aHerein, an amperometric glucose oxidase (GOx) biosensor is presented using calixarenes as an immobilization matrix of the biomolecule. Firstly, thiol-containing calixarenes (Calix-SH) were synthesized, then self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of Calix-SH on a gold surface were formed and hydroxyl groups of Calix-SH were activated using 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) chemistry. To test the usability of Calix-SH modified surfaces as a biosensor, glucose oxidase was used as a model biological component. After optimization of preparation and working conditions, our results indicate that the Calix-SH/GOx biosensor has a linear range in the range 0.1–1.0 mM (LOD: 0.015 mM) for glucose with a 25 s response time. Finally, the application of the biosensor was examined to detect glucose in real samples. The glucose amounts were calculated as 19.460 ± 0.521 and 31.647 ± 2.125 mM in coke and fizzy drink (with orange), respectively. To confirm the reliability of the Calix-SH/GOx biosensor, the calculated glucose concentrations which were analyzed by the Calix-SH/GOx biosensor were compared to conventional spectrophotometric glucose kits. The glucose amounts in coke and fizzy drink were calculated as 18.509 ± 0.732 mM and 31.579 ± 4.466 mM, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3agold 3aimmobilized enzymes 3amoieties 3athiols1 aYildiz, Huseyin Bekir1 aSayın, Serkan1 aYılmaz, Mustafa,0 tRSC advances.g2014 May 01, v. 4, no. 38 p.19900-19907dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra47642a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02242naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245011000176520105900286592002801345650001101373650001901384650002601403650001201429650002101441650001501462650001601477653001701493653002701510653002601537653002001563700002101583700002001604700001901624700001701643773010001660856008701760852000901847655001201856IND60742264920221119010239.0220103e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074226492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1304422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez-Guaita, David10aFrom bench to worktop: Rapid evaluation of nutritional parameters in liquid foodstuffs by IR spectroscopy  aWe evaluated the use of attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy for simultaneous in situ quantification of the nutritional composition of liquid food stuffs in the industrial kitchen context. Different methodologies were compared, including dry and wet acquisition along with instrument parameters and measurement times of 4 and 60 s. The most effective technique was 1-minute measurement, with prediction errors of 2.6, 0.7, 1.0, 2.2, 0.8, 2.4 g/100 mL and 150 Kcal, for carbohydrates, proteins, fat, sugars, saturated fat, water and energy values, respectively.The 4-second method resulted in larger errors but was more applicable for inline measurements. Dry measurements successfully predicted the fractions of proteins, fat, carbohydrates, and sugars, relative to total solids. An app was created to facilitate implementation in a kitchen environment. Compared with other techniques recommended by the FAO, the approach offered a simple alternative for simultaneous prediction of nutritional parameters in an industrial kitchen set-up.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3afood chemistry 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aliquids 3anutrient content 3aprediction 3areflectance 0aChemometrics 0aNutritional parameters 0aPartial least squares 0aRecipe analysis1 aRichardson, Zack1 aRajendra, Amrut1 aByrne, Hugh J.1 aWood, Bayden0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 365 p.130442-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1304423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03541naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100002300172245014300195300001600338520136000354592002801714650001001742650001001752650000901762650002201771650002501793650001901818650002801837650001001865650003001875650001001905650001201915650001001927650001701937650001301954650001301967650001501980650001001995650001602005650002202021650002002043650002802063650000902091650002702100650002902127650003602156650001102192650004102203650001102244650001102255650000902266650001602275650002202291650003702313650001602350650001202366650001702378651001402395651001402409653000802423653001502431653001902446653001002465653001402475700002802489700002102517700001902538773010602557856008702663852000902750655001202759IND50066042620221119181447.0160902e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006604262DNAL7 a235626822pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.03.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBjerregaard, Peter10aPopulation surveys in Greenland 1993–2009: Temporal trend of PCBs and pesticides in the general Inuit population by age and urbanisation  ap. 283-288.  aThe purpose of the study was to analyse temporal trends (1993–2009) of the concentrations of organochlorine contaminants (14 congeners of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and 11 pesticides) in the blood of Greenland Inuit according to age and urbanisation. Statistical determinants for the contaminant concentrations included (for PCB congener 153) age (Δr2=0.35), marine diet (Δr2=0.10), smoking (Δr2=0.02), and sex (Δr2=0.01) with comparable results for other organochlorine contaminants. After adjustment for age, diet, smoking, and sex a significant decreasing trend was present for all contaminants ranging from 41% for mirex to 56% for hexachlorobenzene. The temporal trend was most pronounced among participants below the age of 65years. The decrease started later in villages than in towns. The decrease was present in all age groups and in the capital, other towns, and villages. The decrease is probably due to a combination of reduced concentrations of the contaminants in the wildlife and a slight temporal reduction in the consumption of marine mammals. The significant downwards trend of legacy POPs shows that the legislation works but it must be kept in mind that according to the cumulated scientific evidence there are a multitude of non-regulated persistent organic contaminants in the diet as well as high levels of methylmercury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInuit 3ablood 3adiet 3ahexachlorobenzene 3alaws and regulations 3amarine mammals 3amethylmercury compounds 3amirex 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3asmoke 3asurveys 3atowns 3aurbanization 3avillages 3awildlife 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aAged, 80 and over 2aBody Mass Index 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiet 2aEnvironmental Exposure 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxblood 2aFemale 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aHumans 2aInuit. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPesticidesxblood 2aPolychlorinated Biphenylsxblood 2aSex Factors 2aSmoking 2aUrbanization 3aGreenland 0aGreenland 0aPCB 0aPesticides 0aTemporal trend 0aInuit 0aGreenland1 aPedersen, Henning Sloth1 aNielsen, Nina O.1 aDewailly, Eric0 tScience of the total environment.g2013 June 01, v. 454-455 p.283-288dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.03.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245015400163300001600317500002000333520148000353592002801833596005301861650001801914650001901932650001301951650001101964650001201975650003001987650002002017650001102037650002202048650001502070650001102085650000902096651001002105700006002115700002002175700001702195700005902212700006302271700002702334773012602361856007402487852000902561655001202570IND60756692020221123021049.0211117e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075669202DNAL7 a10.1111/aje.129142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVihotogbé, Romaric10aAbundance and effects of climate change on geographical distribution of Mondia whitei (Hook.f.)

Mondia whitei, one of these plants, is threatened by over‐exploitation, climate change and unsustainable land use management. Detailed knowledge is lacking regarding the species' conservation—driving forces and preservation of its ecological niche within fragile ecological regions. This study assessed the influence of the land use types on the abundance of M. whitei and the spatio‐temporal evolution of its ecological niche in the Dahomey Gap. The abundance of the species was evaluated in different land use systems. Available bioclimatic and soil layers were used for the distribution modelling. Results showed that M. whitei was mainly found in three land use systems: cropland, fallow and forests. Density of adults averaged 281.5 ± 99.1, 323.2 ± 93.9 and 305.9 ± 154 individuals/ha in fallow, forest and cropland, respectively. For juveniles, density was on average of 222.2 ± 205.7 individuals/ha in cropland vs 59.3 ± 71.8 and 57.4 ± 94.1 individuals/ha in forest and fallow, respectively. The majority of the species distribution will possibly remain stable with some expansion under future climates. Persistence of the species' niche in the Dahomey Gap under climate change indicates its potential as a contributor to future livelihood improvement, via local health care and the strengthening of local economy.  aPublisher supplied data  aJ/4672‐2cInternational Foundation for Science 3aMondia whitei 3aclimate change 3acropland 3afallow 3aforests 3ageographical distribution 3ahealth services 3aincome 3aland use planning 3alivelihood 3aniches 3asoil 3aBenin1 aIdohou, Rodrigue1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2641-68321 aVianou, Aldrich1 aSpies, Paula1 aSalako, Valère1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7817-36871 aAssogbadjo, Achille1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5985-88001 aGlèlè Kakaï, Romain0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2021 Dec., v. 59, no. 4 p.924-933dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl31087x0141-67077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.129143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002800142245011900170300001800289520124200307592002801549650001401577650001601591650001301607650001201620650002401632650002301656650002901679650002501708650001201733650001301745651001801758700001901776700002201795700002201817773013601839856008201975852000902057655001202066IND6037260220221118200330.0120501e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603726022DNAL7 a10.1093/icesjms/fsr1392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetitgas, P.q(Pierre),10aSpatially explicit estimation of fish length histograms, with application to anchovy habitats in the Bay of Biscay  ap. 2086-2095.  aFish length frequency histograms from research surveys are of prime importance for identifying habitats of different life stages, as well as for stock assessment. However, no method has thus far been available for mapping these histograms as spatially varying curves. Here, a procedure is applied to map spatially connected curves, and detail is given on how it can be applied to map the length frequency histograms. At each sample location, a fish length frequency histogram is given as a vector of non-independent values. The histogram is first modelled as a polynomial expansion on the basis of orthogonal polynomials. Then, the polynomial coefficients are mapped by co-kriging, after fitting a model of co-regionalization. The length frequency map is finally derived by linearly combining maps of polynomial coefficients. An estimation variance associated with the map is also derived. Maps of anchovy length distributions are produced by applying the method to midwater trawl length data from the PELGAS acoustic surveys in the Bay of Biscay. This novel approach extends the application of kriging techniques to curves or functions, opening new perspectives for mapping more complex information than just the values of fish density.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanchovies 3abody length 3ahabitats 3akriging 3amathematical models 3apopulation density 3aprobability distribution 3aspatial distribution 3asurveys 3avariance 3aBay of Biscay1 aDoray, Mathieu1 aMassÃ©, Jacques1 aGrellier, Patrick0 tICES journal of marine science.g2011 Nov., v. 68, no. 10 p.2086-2095dOxford University PresswJournal:J000001344x1054-31397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsr1393Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02102naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245006200163300001800225500001900243520125400262592002801516650001201544650002401556650001401580650001301594773013401607856007401741852000901815655001201824IND60727821420221118193416.0210212e20210211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072782142DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc08053e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerlino, Antonello10aRecent advances in protein metalation: structural studies  ap. 1295-1307.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aProtein metalation is a process that determines the formation of adducts upon reaction of metal compounds with proteins. Protein metalation plays a crucial role in different fields, determining the mechanism of action and toxicity of metal-based drugs and the basis for the rational design of artificial metalloenzymes and protein-based metallodrug-delivery systems. Recent advances in structural studies unveiling the basis of the metal compounds/protein recognition process are briefly discussed here. The analysis of the structures of Pt, Au, Ru, Re, Pd, Ir, Os, Rh and Pt–As/protein adducts reveals that metal compounds (i) can bind proteins via non-covalent interactions or via coordination to selected residue side chains upon the release of labile ligands; (ii) can undergo reduction/oxidation processes upon protein binding that in turn can lead to changes in the metal coordination sphere and breakdown of the metal compound; (iii) can bind different protein recognition sites with a preference for selected side chains that is governed by hard and soft acids and bases, and with the number and type of binding sites changing over time; and (iv) can retain a certain degree of flexibility and reactivity in the final metal/protein adduct.  aPublisher supplied data 3aligands 3amechanism of action 3aoxidation 3atoxicity0 tChemical communications.g2021 Feb. 11, v. 57, no. 11 p.1295-1307dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0cc08053e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245007500165520096500240592002801205650001501233650001101248650000901259650001101268650001201279650001001291650001401301650001301315650001301328700002301341700002301364700002401387700002101411700002301432773012301455856007401578852000901652655001201661IND60790876120221117172052.0220826e20220820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079087612DNAL7 a10.3390/d140806852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKokaeva, Lyudmila Yu.10aPhylogenetic Study of Alternaria Potato and Tomato Pathogens in Russia  aEarly blight (EB) is a destructive disease affecting potato and tomato plants in Russia, caused by a heterogeneous group of plant pathogenic Alternaria fungi. The current species delimitation in Alternaria sect. Porri with medium to large conidia and a long (filamentous) beak is based on molecular data. In this study, the ITS, GAPDH, RPB2, TEF1, and Alt a 1 gene regions were analyzed in 41 large-spored Alternaria isolates obtained from diseased potato and tomato plants collected from 13 regions in Russia. Our data revealed five pathogenic species (A. alternariacida, A. grandis, A. linariae, A. protenta, and A. solani). Two species (A. solani and A. linariae) were found to be associated with early blight of tomato. Alternaria linariae and A. protenta were confirmed as the major causal agents of tomato and potato early blight, respectively. There were no phylogenetic groupings among tested Russian Alternaria isolates associated with their locality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria 3aRussia 3abeak 3ablight 3aconidia 3agenes 3aphylogeny 3apotatoes 3atomatoes1 aYarmeeva, Maria M.1 aKokaeva, Zarema G.1 aChudinova, Elena M.1 aBalabko, Petr N.1 aElansky, Sergey N.0 tDiversity.g2022 Aug. 20, v. 14, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d140806853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03351naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245005100159300001600210500002000226520201800246592002802264650001402292650001402306650001102320650003602331650001902367650001602386650002702402650004602429650006602475650002102541650004402562650001902606650002002625700002302645700002002668700002502688700001902713773010402732856007202836852000902908655001202917IND60583606120221119052809.0171019e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058360612DNAL7 a10.1002/pca.26972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVissers, Anne M.10aPhlorotannin Composition of Laminaria digitata  ap. 487-495.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aINTRODUCTION: Phlorotannins are complex mixtures of phloroglucinol oligomers connected via C‐C (fucols) or C‐O‐C (phlorethols) linkages. Their uniformity in subunits and large molecular weight hamper their structural analysis. Despite its commercial relevance for alginate extraction, phlorotannins in Laminaria digitata have not been studied. OBJECTIVE: To obtain quantitative and structural information on phlorotannins in a methanolic extract from L. digitata. METHODOLOGY: The combined use of ¹³C and ¹H NMR spectroscopy allowed characterisation of linkage types and extract purity. The purity determined was used to calibrate the responses obtained with the colorimetric 2,4‐dimethoxybenzaldehyde (DMBA) and Folin–Ciocalteu (FC) assays. Using NP‐flash chromatography, phlorotannin fractions separated on oligomer size were obtained and enabled structural and molecular weight characterisation using ESI‐MS and MALDI‐TOF‐MS. RESULTS: The fucol‐to‐phlorethol linkage ratio was 1:26 and the extract was 60.1% pure, determined by NMR spectroscopy. For DMBA, the response of the extract was 12 times lower than that of phloroglucinol, whereas there was no difference for FC. By accounting for differences in response, the colorimetric assays were applicable for quantification using phloroglucinol as a standard. The phlorotannin content was around 4.5% DM. Fucol‐ and phlorethol‐linkage types were annotated based on characteristic MSⁿ fragmentations. Structural isomers of phlorotannins up to a degree of polymerisation of 18 (DP18) were annotated and identification of several isomers hinted at branched phloroglucinol oligomers. With MALDI‐TOF‐MS phlorotannins up to DP27 were annotated. CONCLUSION: By combining several analytical techniques, phlorotannins in L. digitata were quantified and characterised with respect to fucol‐to‐phlorethol linkage ratio, molecular weight (distribution), and occurrence of structural isomers.

However, low baseline respiration rates under normocapnic conditions (i.e., “floor” effect) can render the measurement of respiratory decreases challenging. We assessed hypercapnia-induced increases in respiration as a strategy to assess opioid-induced decreases in respiration in rats.WBP was used to assess respiration frequency, tidal volume and minute volume in the presence of normocapnic and hypercapnic (8% CO₂) conditions in rats during the rat diurnal period of the light cycle. The mu-opioid receptor agonist fentanyl was administered intravenously, and the hot plate test was used to assess acute antinociception.Hypercapnia-induced increases in respiratory parameters (frequency, minute volume, and tidal volume) were decreased by fentanyl at doses that did not decrease the same parameters under the normocapnic conditions. These findings show that hypercapnia increases sensitivity to respiratory depressant effects of fentanyl, as compared with assessments during the rat diurnal period when activity and breathing rate are generally low, i.e., there is a floor effect. The current approach is highly sensitive to opioid-induced respiratory depression, and therefore provides a useful method for assessment in a pre-clinical setting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3acarbon dioxide 3adeath 3afentanyl 3ahot plate test 3ahypercapnia 3aintravenous injection 3anarcotics 3aoverdose 3aphotoperiod 3aplethysmography 3arats 3atidal volume 3atoxicology 0aAntinociception 0aFrequency 0aHotplate 0aHypercapnic 0aMethods 0aMinute volume 0aOpioids 0aPotency ratio 0aSafety window 0aRespiration 0aAUC 0aAAALAC 0aANOVA 0aCO2 0aCI 0aED50 0ai.v. 0aLD50 0aMOR 0aMPE 0aMv 0aSEM 0aTv 0aWBP1 aRestrepo, Luis F.1 aGamez-Jimenez, Lea R.1 aPatel, Avi1 aBraun, Tobias1 aPallares, Victoria L.C.1 aHo, Nicholas P.1 aReeves, Morgan E.1 aMcCurdy, Christopher R.1 aMcMahon, Lance R.1 aHiranita, Takato0 tJournal of pharmacological and toxicological methods.g2021 Sept.,  Oct., v. 111 p.107101-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12003x1056-87197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vascn.2021.1071013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01667naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245015800172300001800330520053800348592002800886650002600914650002500940650001700965650001200982650001400994650001301008700003001021700003001051700001801081773011601099856008201215990002301297852000901320655001201329IND60091010420221123040833.0141103e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009101042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.12.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArumugam, Natarajan13aAn efficient synthesis of highly functionalized novel chromeno[4,3-b]pyrroles and indolizino[6,7-b]indoles as potent antimicrobial and antioxidant agents  ap. 1375-1379.  aA facile and efficient synthesis of novel chromeno[4,3-b]pyrroles has been accomplished by intramolecular 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition which on subsequent Pictet–Spengler cyclisation in presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid yielded indolizino[6,7-b]indoles.

The conceptual discussions are based on the consideration of calcite and dolomite AMD buffering hydrogeochemical processes. Using theoretical chemical reaction stoichiometry, predictions are made for molar ratios of associated AMD – calcite and dolomite buffering reaction products (SO42−, Ca2+ and Mg2+). Comparison is made between stoichiometrically predicted molar ratios of SO42−/Ca2+, SO42−/Mg2+, Ca2+/Mg2+ and field data from previous studies in South Africa. There is a close match between stoichiometrically predicted molar ratios of the calcite and dolomite AMD neutralisation reaction products and field data. The results provide basis to improve the conceptual understanding of hydrogeochemical processes associated with dolomite and calcite AMD neutralisation which is important for field investigations related to mine-water quality, water management, remediation and overall environmental protection. Results further demonstrates the potential usefulness of relating ion concentration molar ratios of field measurements to stoichiometric predictions as a tool to identify hydrogeochemical processes controlling the evolution of groundwater chemistry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid mine drainage 3acalcite 3acalcium 3adolomite 3agroundwater 3ahydrogeochemistry 3amagnesium 3aneutralization 3aprediction 3aremediation 3astoichiometry 3asulfates 3awater management 3aSouth Africa 0aAcid mine drainage 0aCalcite 0aDolomite 0aGroundwater chemistry 0aHydrogeochemical processes 0aNeutralisation0 tWater Science.g2018 Oct., v. 32, no. 2 p.355-361dElsevier B.V.aNational Water Research CenterwJournal:23327x1110-49297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wsj.2018.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02060naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014000168520097500308592002801283650002401311650003201335650000901367650001701376650002401393653002001417653002201437653001401459653001601473653002501489653001801514773009501532856008601627852000901713655001201722IND60742265320221119005811.0210723e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074226532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2021.1086102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstévez, M.10aCritical overview of the use of plant antioxidants in the meat industry: Opportunities, innovative applications and future perspectives  aThe number of articles devoted to study the effect of “natural antioxidants” on meat systems has remarkably increased in the last 10 years. Yet, a critical review of literature reveals recurrent flaws in regards to the rationale of the application, the experimental design, the characterisation of the plant sources, the discussion of the molecular mechanisms and of the potential benefits. The selection of the appropriate source of these antioxidants and the identification of their bioactive constituents, are essential to understand their mode of action and set effective and safe doses. The methodological approach should also be planned with care as the recorded effects and main conclusions largely depend on the accuracy and specificity of the methods. This article aims to critically review the recent advances in the application of plant antioxidants in meat and meat products and briefly covers current trends of innovative application and future trends.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexperimental design 3alivestock and meat industry 3ameat 3ameat science 3amechanism of action 0aLipid oxidation 0aProtein oxidation 0aPhenolics 0aBioactivity 0aNatural antioxidants 0aMeat products0 tMeat science.g2021 Nov., v. 181 p.108610-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2021.1086103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245013100176300001600307520090200323592002801225650002901253650002301282650002001305650001901325650002401344650002401368650002001392650001901412650001101431650001201442650001401454650001901468650002301487650002601510650002201536653002801558653002001586653002901606653001801635653003101653700002001684700001701704700001601721700001801737700001601755773010601771856008701877852000901964655001201973IND60583999120221121092151.0200509e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058399912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.10.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEcem Öner, Büşra10aBioaugmentation with Clostridium thermocellum to enhance the anaerobic biodegradation of lignocellulosic agricultural residues  ap. 620-625.  aThis study aimed to improve biomethane production from lignocellulosic biomass by assessing the impact of bioaugmentation with Clostridium thermocellum on the performance of anaerobic digesters at different inoculation ratios. The outputs of the digestion experiments revealed that bioaugmentation strategies with C. thermocellum increased the methane yield up to 39%. The sequencing analysis indicated that the indigenous microbial community was modified by the bioaugmentation. During the process of bioaugmentation, in the digester that was inoculated at the ratio of 20% (v:v), an increase in the abundance of Ruminococcaceae family led to a decrease in the Bacteroidaceae and Synergistaceae families. Furthermore, the metabolic products of the bioaugmented strains greatly influenced the diversity of the archaeal community and an increase in the abundance of Methanomicrobiales was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium thermocellum 3aMethanomicrobiales 3aRuminococcaceae 3aSynergistaceae 3aagricultural wastes 3aanaerobic digesters 3abioaugmentation 3abiodegradation 3abiogas 3abiomass 3adigestion 3alignocellulose 3amethane production 3amicrobial communities 3asequence analysis 0aLignocellulosic biomass 0aBioaugmentation 0aClostridium thermocellum 0aMethane yield 0aNext-generation sequencing1 aAkyol, Çağrı1 aBozan, Mahir1 aInce, Orhan1 aAydin, Sevcan1 aInce, Bahar0 tBioresource technology.g2018 Feb., v. 249 p.620-625dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.10.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010000163300001400263520161400277592002801891650002301919650001201942650002201954650001101976650002401987650001302011650001202024650001202036650000902048650001102057650001002068650001602078650001702094650001202111650001802123650002902141650002602170650001002196653001002206653002102216653002602237653002202263653001102285700001302296700001302309700002002322700001902342773012202361856008302483852000902566655001202575IND60526794520221118190223.0190410e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052679452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Xinda10aFOXO links wing form polyphenism and wound healing in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens  ap. 24-31.  aPolyphenisms such as wing dimorphisms and caste determination are important in allowing animals to adapt to changing environments. The brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, one of the most serious insect agricultural pests, includes two wing forms, the long wing form (macropterous) and the short wing form (brachypterous). Long wings are specialized for migration, while short wings are found in individuals specialized for reproduction. While studying wing form polyphenism in the brown planthopper, we excised single wing pads from 4th instar nymphs in order to preserve transcriptional records to correlate with adult wing form. Surprisingly, we found that excision of one wing pad from a pair of the forewings changed the wing morph of the other wing after development to the adult, resulting in the short wing morph. Further experiments showed that not only excision or slicing of the wing pad, but also needle punctures in the abdomen all caused a significant increase in the proportion of nymphs developing into short winged adults. Thus wounding appears to cause a shift to short wing development. We then tested the transcriptional expression in N. lugens of the transcription factor FOXO, which has been shown to help mediate both wing polyphenism in brown planthoppers and wound healing in mice, after excision of the wing pad. Both NlFOXO and its downstream target Nl4EBP increased significantly after wing pad excision. These results indicate that FOXO mediates both wing development and wound healing in N. lugens, which results in an interesting linkage of these two physiological processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNilaparvata lugens 3aabdomen 3aadult development 3aadults 3acaste determination 3aexcision 3ainsects 3ainstars 3amice 3anymphs 3apests 3apolyphenism 3areproduction 3aslicing 3atissue repair 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3awings 0aWound 0aWing polyphenism 0aPhenotypic plasticity 0aBrown planthopper 0aNlFOXO1 aYao, Yun1 aWang, Bo1 aLavine, Mark D.1 aLavine, Laura,0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2016 Mar., v. 70 p.24-31dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48131x0965-17487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010400167520134400271592002801615650002401643650001201667650000901679650001301688650001901701650001101720650001201731650001701743650001301760650001201773650002301785650001101808650001701819653002901836653001401865653003201879700002801911700002201939773011601961856008302077852000902160655001202169IND60744346220221121233113.0210729e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074434622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2021.1057142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpencer, Sarah10aHypoxia and chronic kidney disease: Possible mechanisms, therapeutic targets, and relevance to cats  aThere is mounting evidence that kidney ischaemia/hypoxia plays an important role in feline chronic kidney disease (CKD) development and progression, as well as in human disease and laboratory animal models. Ischaemic acute kidney injury is widely accepted as a cause of CKD in people and data from laboratory species has identified some of the pathways underlying this continuum. Experimental kidney ischaemia in cats results in morphological changes, namely chronic tubulointerstitial inflammation, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy, akin to those observed in naturally-occurring CKD. Multiple situations are envisaged that could result in acute or chronic episodes of kidney hypoxia in cats, while risk factors identified in epidemiological studies provide further support that kidney hypoxia contributes to spontaneously occurring feline CKD. This review evaluates the evidence for the role of kidney ischaemia/hypoxia in feline CKD and the proposed mechanisms and consequences of kidney hypoxia. As no effective treatments exist that substantially slow or prevent feline CKD progression, there is a need for novel therapeutic strategies. Targeting kidney hypoxia is one such promising approach, with therapies including those that attenuate the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway already being utilised in human CKD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute kidney injury 3aatrophy 3acats 3afibrosis 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3ahypoxia 3ainflammation 3aischemia 3akidneys 3alaboratory animals 3apeople 3atherapeutics 0aHypoxia-inducible factor 0aIschaemia 0aTubulointerstitial fibrosis1 aWheeler-Jones, Caroline1 aElliott, Jonathan0 tveterinary journal.g2021 Aug., v. 274 p.105714-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2021.1057143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245009500174300001400269520097400283592002801257650001401285650002901299650001401328650002501342650001301367650002001380650001601400650001401416650001701430650002101447650001401468650001401482650001601496650002601512653003201538653001701570653001601587653002601603653002201629653001401651653001401665700002601679700002101705700002701726700002001753700002201773700003501795700002301830700003601853773009801889856008701987852000902074655001202083IND60542266620221118022335.0190402e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054226662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgnjenović, Jana10aInteractions of epigallo-catechin 3-gallate and ovalbumin, the major allergen of egg white  ap. 36-43.  aPolyphenols, the potent plant secondary metabolites, have beneficial effects on human health, but the mechanism(s) by which these effects are exerted is not well understood. Here, we present the detailed analysis of the interactions between the major green tea catechin, epigallo-catechin 3-gallate (EGCG), and the major dietary protein and allergen, ovalbumin (OVA). We show that EGCG binds to the pocket that partly overlaps with the previously identified IgE-binding region in OVA, and that this interaction induces structural changes in the allergen. Moreover, our ex vivo studies reveal that OVA binds IgE and stimulates degranulation of basophils, and that its uptake by monocytes proceeds at a slower rate in the presence of EGCG. This study provides further evidence in support of the proposed mechanism by which EGCG interactions with the food allergens contribute to its diverse biological activities and may impair antigen uptake by antigen-presenting cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergens 3aantigen-presenting cells 3abasophils 3abioactive properties 3acatechin 3adietary protein 3aegg albumen 3agreen tea 3ahuman health 3aimmunoglobulin E 3amonocytes 3aovalbumin 3apolyphenols 3asecondary metabolites 0aEpigallo-catechin 3-gallate 0aFood allergy 0aIgE binding 0aFluorophore quenching 0aMolecular docking 0aMonocytes 0aOvalbumin1 aStojadinović, Marija1 aMilčić, Miloš1 aApostolović, Danijela1 aVesić, Jelena,1 aStambolić, Ivan,1 aAtanasković-Marković, Marina1 aSimonović, Miljan1 aVeličković, Tanja Ćirković,0 tFood chemistry.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 164 p.36-43dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009700158300002000255520161900275592002801894650002001922650001201942650001901954650001601973650002601989650001702015650001602032650002202048650001802070650001402088650001702102650001202119650001602131700001802147700001702165700001302182773012402195856007402319852000902393655001202402IND60664846920221122144158.0190912e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066484692DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra47654e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Xiaoqin10aHollow periodic mesoporous organosilicas for highly efficient HIFU-based synergistic therapy  ap. 17950-17958.  aNano-biotechnology provides a promising therapeutic strategy for the development of novel cancer therapeutic modalities. In this work, molecularly organic–inorganic hybrid hollow periodic mesoporous organosilicas (HPMOs) were elaborately designed and fabricated by a silica-etching strategy for concurrent high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)-based synergistic therapy and combined HIFU-triggered chemotherapy. Due to the unique hollow nanostructures and well-defined spherical morphology, HPMOs themselves have been demonstrated as an efficient synergistic agent to enhance the HIFU ablation efficiency. The well-defined mesoporous shell and large hollow interior can function as the reservoirs for anticancer agents, and the drug (doxorubicin)-releasing exhibits the intelligent on demand profiles under HIFU irradiation due to the specific framework-induced π–π supramolecular stacking between benzene group-bridged framework and doxorubicin molecules. Combined with HIFU ablation and chemotherapy, HPMOs-based intelligent drug delivery nanosystems have demonstrated in vivo that anticancer drug-loaded HPMOs can significantly enhance the HIFU therapeutic outcomes due to the combined effects of concurrent enhancement of HIFU ablation and HIFU-triggered chemotherapy. This report gives the first evidence that mesoporous material-based drug delivery nanosystems (e.g., HPMOs) can improve the efficiency of focused ultrasound for cancer surgery, which can be further extended for the development of novel HIFU-based therapeutic modalities for more efficient cancer therapy with mitigated side-effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abenzene 3acancer therapy 3adoxorubicin 3adrug delivery systems 3adrug therapy 3airradiation 3ananobiotechnology 3ananomaterials 3aneoplasms 3aporous media 3asurgery 3aultrasonics1 aWang, Wenping1 aKong, Wentao1 aChen, Yu0 tRSC advances.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 4, no. 34 p.17950-17958dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra47654e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011500160300001800275520109000293592002801383650001401411650002101425650001401446650002101460650001901481650001101500650001301511650001801524650001301542650001101555650001101566650001401577650001301591650001601604700001701620700001801637700001801655773012201673856007401795852000901869655001201878IND60664847020221121141422.0190912e20140205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066484702DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra47657j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHizartzidis, L.10aChemoselective flow hydrogenation approaches to isoindole-7-carboxylic acids and 7-oxa-bicyclio[2.2.1]heptanes  ap. 9709-9722.  aTwo libraries of highly decorated norcantharidin analogues were accessed via a series of sequential chemoselective flow hydrogenations and solvent-free transformations. Utilising a 10% Pd/C catalyst, modifications to reaction parameters (H₂ pressure, temperature and flow rate conditions) allowed facile access to effect selective direct reductive aminations and olefin reductions in the presence of furan, benzyl and nitrile moieties were established. The use of 20% Pd(OH)₂/C; Pd tetrakis; 5% Pt/C (sulfided) gave mixtures of furan and olefin (both reduced) and olefin reduced products. RuO₂; 0.5% Re/C and Re₂O₇ resulted in no reduction. Concurrent olefin and nitrile reduction was achieved in the presence of furan moieties by employing a RANEY® nickel catalyst. In total, 31 reaction conditions were examined using less than 200 mg of reagents allowing optimised conditions to be efficiently determined. These optimised hydrogenation conditions afforded desired analogues in near quantitative yields thus removing the requirements of reaction workup and chromatography.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamination 3acarboxylic acids 3acatalysts 3achemoselectivity 3achromatography 3afurans 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3amoieties 3anickel 3aolefin 3apalladium 3aplatinum 3atemperature1 aTarleton, M.1 aGordon, C.

After optimisation of the homogenisation procedure, stable emulsions were prepared and stored for up to eight weeks. The development of six secondary lipid oxidation products: propanal, 1-penten-3-one, 1-penten-3-ol, hexanal, (E,E)-2,4-heptadienal and (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal, was monitored via headspace gas chromatography after solid-phase microextraction. Sensory evaluation of the emulsions was performed by a trained panel. PD already showed masking properties for propanal, 1-penten-3-one, hexanal and (E,E)-2,4-heptadienal during validation of the gas chromatographic analysis, but not for 1-penten-3-ol or (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal. During storage, the course of lipid oxidation was similar in all emulsions as concluded from the hydroperoxide value. Results from the sensory evaluation confirmed a masking of rancid off-flavour. In conclusion, pea dextrin is suitable for masking off-flavour resulting from early stages of lipid oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aemulsions 3agas chromatography 3aheadspace analysis 3ahomogenization 3alipid peroxidation 3amaltodextrins 3aoff flavors 3apeas 3aperoxide value 3asensory evaluation 3asolid phase microextraction 0aEmulsion 0aVolatiles 0aSensory evaluation 0aGas chromatography 0aCyclodextrin1 aSteinhäuser, U.1 aDrusch, S.0 tFood chemistry.g2015 Feb. 15, v. 169 p.492-498dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011200169520167300281592002801954650001601982650002101998650003002019650002402049650001902073650002002092650002902112650001802141650001202159650002602171650001802197650002002215650001702235650001902252650001602271651001902287653001702306653001702323653003102340653001702371653002602388700002502414700001902439700002302458700001902481700002302500773011602523856008502639852000902724655001202733IND60758165320221123040043.0220214e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075816532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1198732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDick, David L.10aForest floor manipulation effects on the relationship between aggregate stability and ectomycorrhizal fungi  aForest floor and mineral soil manipulations influence the soil biogeochemical properties important for loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) tree growth. The impacts of forest floor manipulations on soil aggregate stability and the presence of ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), was assessed to elucidate the relationship between EMF abundance and aggregate stability. The study site consists of a 14-year-old loblolly pine plantation managed by Weyerhaeuser Company in the Lower Coastal Plain, approximately 8 miles east of New Bern, North Carolina, USA. The soil samples were collected from the top 7.62 cm of each soil treatment which includes three levels of forest floor retention: removed, control, and doubled and two levels of forest floor mixing with the mineral soil: mixed and unmixed. Ectomycorrhizal fungi abundance was evaluated by ester-linked fatty acid methyl ester analysis and microbial community functionality was assessed by acid-phosphatase activity measurement. Aggregate stability was assessed using the aggregate mean weight diameter approach. Results indicate that the forest floor manipulations had no significant impact on aggregate stability and EMF abundance. However, a positive relationship between EMF abundance and aggregate stability was identified. Removing the forest floor resulted in a soil bulk density increase of 0.18 g cm⁻³ compared to doubling the forest floor. Our results demonstrate that some mineral soil properties recover relatively quickly from forest floor manipulations. The study informs forest managers interested in how soil responds to forest floor manipulation and the interaction between EMF and aggregate stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus taeda 3aacid phosphatase 3aadministrative management 3aaggregate stability 3acoastal plains 3aectomycorrhizae 3afatty acid methyl esters 3aforest litter 3aforests 3amicrobial communities 3amineral soils 3asoil aggregates 3asoil density 3asoil treatment 3atree growth 3aNorth Carolina 0aForest soils 0aSoil ecology 0aForest floor manipulations 0aBulk density 0aEctomycorrhizal fungi1 aGardner, Terrence G.1 aFrene, Juan P.1 aHeitman, Joshua L.1 aSucre, Eric B.1 aLeggett, Zakiya H.0 tForest ecology and management.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 505 p.119873-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1198733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001900147245012800166300001600294520130700310592002801617650002501645650002101670650002301691650002001714650001901734650001801753650001101771650001201782650003201794650002501826650001901851650001601870700001701886700001601903700001901919773011901938856008302057852000902140655001202149IND4459999620221119181619.0141111e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445999962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2011.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zhenfeng10aCombination of salicylic acid and ultrasound to control postharvest blue mold caused by Penicillium expansum in peach fruit  ap. 310-314.  aThe effect of ultrasound (40kHz, 10min) and salicylic acid (SA, 0.05mM) either separately, or combined on blue mold caused by Penicillium expansum in peach fruit was investigated. The results showed that the application of SA alone could reduce blue mold, while the use of ultrasound had no effect. Our results also revealed that SA combined with ultrasound treatment was more effective in inhibiting fungal decay during storage than the SA treatment alone. The combined treatment increased the activities of defense enzymes such as chitinase, β-1,3-glucanase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase, which were associated with higher disease resistance induced by the combined treatment. Furthermore, the combined treatment did not impair the quality parameters of peach fruit after 6days of storage at 20°C. These results suggested that the combination of ultrasound and SA treatment may be a useful technique to reduce blue mold in peach fruit. INDUSTRIAL RELEVANCE: This paper investigates the effect of ultrasound combined with SA on decay incidence of peach fruit. The results presented demonstrate that the effect of the combined treatment on the disease resistance and fruit quality should be considered by processors prior to its adoption as a preservation technique.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPenicillium expansum 3acatechol oxidase 3adisease resistance 3aenzyme activity 3afruit diseases 3afruit quality 3afruits 3apeaches 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3apostharvest diseases 3asalicylic acid 3aultrasonics1 aCao, Shifeng1 aCai, Yuting1 aZheng, Yonghua0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2011 July, v. 12, no. 3 p.310-314dElsevier Ltdx1466-85647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2011.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245011400160520148100274592002801755650002101783650001601804650001401820650001101834650002501845650002201870650001901892650002401911650002501935650001401960650001201974700002501986700002002011700001702031700002102048700002302069700002202092700002002114773012302134856007402257852000902331655001202340IND60790876720221123041434.0220826e20220821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079087672DNAL7 a10.3390/d140806912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCopus, Joshua M.10aPhylogeography of Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems: Squirrelfish and Soldierfish (Holocentriformes: Holocentridae)  aMesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs: ~30 to 100+ m depth) may be older and more stable than shallow coral ecosystems that are more prone to disturbances in both the long term (glacial sea level cycles) and short term (heavy weather and anthropogenic activities). Here, we assess the phylogeography of two MCE fishes, the soldierfish Myripristis chryseres (N = 85) and the squirrelfish Neoniphon aurolineatus (N = 74), with mtDNA cytochrome oxidase C subunit I. Our goal is to resolve population genetic diversity across the Central and West Pacific and compare these patterns to three shallow-reef species in the same taxonomic family (Holocentridae). Significant population structure (ΦST = 0.148, p = 0.01) was observed in N. aurolineatus, while no structure was detected in M. chryseres (ΦST = −0.031, p = 0.83), a finding that matches the shallow-water congener M. berndti (ΦST = −0.007, p = 0.63) across the same range. Nucleotide diversity in the MCE fishes was low (π = 0.0024–0.0028) compared to shallow counterparts (π = 0.003–0.006). Coalescence times calculated for M. chryseres (~272,000 years) and N. aurolineatus (~284,000 years) are more recent or comparable to the shallow-water holocentrids (~220,000–916,000 years). We conclude that the shallow genetic coalescence characteristic of shallow-water marine fishes cannot be attributed to frequent disturbance. We see no evidence from holocentrid species that MCEs are older or more stable habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocentriformes 3aMyripristis 3aNeoniphon 3acorals 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenetic variation 3aphylogeography 3apopulation genetics 3apopulation structure 3asea level 3aweather1 aWalsh, Cameron A.

Elgon region of Uganda. Three distance categories from the NAV, that is (i) 0–250 m; (ii) 250–1000 m and (iii) 1000–1500 m, were used to demarcate farms in the first stage of selection, and within each distance category, three levels of shading, that is (i) no shade, (ii) moderate shade and (iii) full shade, were used for final selection of coffee farms for the study. A total of 90 individually owned coffee fields were studied; 30 for each distance category, of which 10 represented each shading level. In two separate rounds, inventories of scale insects (Coccus spp.), antestia bugs (Antestiopsis spp.), root mealybugs (Planococcus spp.) and aphids (Toxoptera aurantii) on coffee plants were made for the hemipteran herbivores, whereas ants (Formicidae) and spiders (Araneae) were recorded for the predatory taxa. The results showed that the interaction between distance from the NAV and shading level consistently influenced the occurrence of the insects in both functional groups. For scale insects, root mealybugs and ants, it was closest to the NAV that shading‐level effects were most discernible and generally limiting. To the contrary, the occurrence of aphids and spiders increased with the increase in the level of shading for plants furthest from the NAV. These results indicate that if inclusion of shade trees is to be a strategy in ecological pest management, the level of shading should be determined basing on the insect taxa as well as other pertinent factors in the landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAntestiopsis 3apest management 3ashade trees 3alandscapes 3afarmers 3ascale insects 3afarms 3aCoffea arabica 3aherbivores 3apredators 3aPseudococcidae 3ashade 3aCoccus 3aAraneae 3aFormicidae 3aToxoptera aurantii 3avegetation 3aUganda 0aHemiptera1 aNambi, N.1 aIjala, A.

These compounds reach wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) through sewerage system and are not sufficiently removed by using conventional treatment process. Psychiatric drugs released with WWTP effluent may cause possible risks to the receiving aquatic environment. Also, two antidepressants have been included in the “watch list” in 2020. Therefore, simple and relatively cost effective removal of psychiatric drugs from wastewaters becomes important. Magnetite red mud nanoparticles (RM-NPs) synthesized was applied for the removal of psychiatric drugs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, carbamazepine, diazepam, and lorazepam) in WWTP effluent first time in this study. The adsorption of carbamazepine as a model compound was fitted well with pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The Freundlich isotherm model better represented the sorption data than the Langmuir model. High adsorption capacity (90.5 mg/g) was reached at 30 min contact time at pH 6.5–7.0 at 25 °C. The adsorption rate was described by the pseudo second order model and its rate control mechanism was controlled by film diffusion. The magnetite RM-NPs were efficiently used for the removal of carbamazepine from real WWTP effluents. The adsorption capacity and the magnetic separability of the regenerated magnetite RM-NPs were unaffected five cycles. Due to its simple application, low cost and high adsorption capacity, magnetite RM-NPs can be recommended as a better adsorbent comparing to commercial adsorbents to remove psychiatric drugs from WWTP effluents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaquatic environment 3acost effectiveness 3adiazepam 3afluoxetine 3akinetics 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3amodels 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aMagnetic nanoparticles 0aPsychiatric pharmaceuticals 0aRed mud 0aWastewater1 aBedük, Fatma1 aUlvi, Arzu1 aAydın, Mehmet Emin0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Aug. 25, v. 784 p.147174-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1471743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02170naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245020200164300001100366520100000377592002801377650001501405650001601420650001901436650001401455650002501469650001601494700001501510700001201525700001201537700001401549700001801563773014801581856008201729852000901811655001201820IND60715696520221118044130.0210511e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071569652DNAL7 a10.1007/s11783-020-1360-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Xiaojie10aSignificant increase of assimilable organic carbon (AOC) levels in MBR effluents followed by coagulation, ozonation and combined treatments: Implications for biostability control of reclaimed water  ap. 68.  aAs water reuse development has increased, biological stability issues associated with reclaimed water have gained attention. This study evaluated assimilable organic carbon (AOC) in effluents from a full-scale membrane biological reactor (MBR) plant and found that they were generally stable over one year (125-216 µg/L), with slight increases in warmer seasons. After additional tertiary treatments, the largest increases in absolute and specific AOCs were detected during ozonation, followed by coagulation-ozonation and coagulation. Moreover, UV₂₅₄ absorbance is known to be an effective surrogate to predict the AOC changes during ozonation. Applying coagulation prior to ozonation of MBR effluents for removal of large molecules was found to reduce the AOC formation compared with ozonation treatment alone. Finally, the results revealed that attention should be paid to seasonal variations in influent and organic fraction changes during treatment to enable sustainable water reuse.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3acoagulation 3aorganic carbon 3aozonation 3awastewater treatment 3awater reuse1 aChen, Zhuo1 aLu, Yun1 aShi, Qi1 aWu, Yinhu1 aHu, Hong-Ying0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2021 Aug., v. 15, no. 4 p.68-68dHigher Education PresswJournal:J000001686x2095-22017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-020-1360-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01504naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002900138245010300167300001800270520042500288592002800713650002300741650002300764650001900787650001800806650001300824700002500837700002200862700001900884700002400903700002800927773012900955856007301084852000901157655001201166IND60658242820221120111715.0190816e20080611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065824282DNAL7 a10.1039/b804179b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuerrero-Sanchez, Carlos10aControlled thermoreversible transfer of poly(oxazoline) micelles between an ionic liquid and water  ap. 2753-2755.  aPoly(2-nonyl-2-oxazoline-block-2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) block copolymer micelles were investigated as an alternative system to the approach proposed by He and Lodge (Y.

This has spurred interest in developing methods to efficiently increase capture volume to reduce N loads in larger watersheds. The objective of this study was to maximize treatment volume by locating a wall where a large groundwatershed was funneled toward seepage slope headwaters. Nitrogen concentration and load were measured before and after wall installation in paired treatment and control streams. Beginning 2 d after installation, nitrogen concentration in the treatment stream declined from 6.7 ± 1.2 to 3.9 ± 0.78 mg L⁻¹ and total N loading rate declined by 65% (391 kg yr⁻¹) with no corresponding decline in the control watershed. This wall, which only comprised 10 to 11% of the edge of field area that contributed to the treatment watershed, treated approximately 60% of the stream discharge, which confirmed the targeted approach. The total load reduction measured in the stream 155 m downstream from the wall (340 kg yr⁻¹) was higher than that found in another study that measured load reductions in groundwater wells immediately around the wall (228 kg yr⁻¹). This indicated the possibility of an extended impact on denitrification from carbon exported beyond the wall. This extended impact was inauspiciously confirmed when oxygen levels at the stream headwaters temporarily declined for 50 d. This research indicates that targeting walls adjacent to streams can effectively reduce N loading in receiving waters, although with a potentially short‐term impact on water quality.  aPublisher supplied data  cFlorida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP)  cFlorida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services 3acarbon 3adenitrification 3aedge effects 3agroundwater 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aoxygen 3aseepage 3astreams 3asurface water 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3awells1 aClark, Mark W.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2012 May, v. 41, no. 3 p.724-731dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2011.03313Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02281naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010500166300001600271520121400287592002801501650001501529650003001544650000901574650000901583650002101592650000901613650002001622700001701642700001701659700001701676700002501693700001901718773009101737856008201828852000901910655001201919IND60083606620221116193611.0141101e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008360662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2012.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrydges, N.M.10aClinical assessments of increased sensory sensitivity in dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture  ap. 545-550.  aDogs with chronic pain have a compromised quality of life. Repeatable and accurate sensory assessments form a means by which the hypersensitivity likely to reflect chronic pain may be quantified. These assessments can be applied to individuals to identify those that may benefit from improved analgesic relief. In this study four sensory assessments were evaluated in dogs presenting with a naturally occurring chronic painful condition (cranial cruciate ligament rupture, CCLR) and were compared with healthy control animals of similar age and weight. Inter-digital von Frey filament and thermal sensitivity tests revealed that the affected hind limb of dogs with CCLR was significantly more sensitive than the opposing limb. Static weight bearing and gait parameter scores were also reduced in the affected hind limb compared to the opposing hind limb of dogs with CCLR; no such differences were found between the hind limbs of healthy (control) dogs. The quantitative sensory tests permitted the differentiation of limbs affected by CCLR from healthy limbs. Dogs presenting with CCLR demonstrate objectively quantitative sensory sensitivities, which may require additional consideration in case management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalgesics 3acranial cruciate ligament 3adogs 3agait 3ahypersensitivity 3apain 3aquality of life1 aArgyle, D.J.1 aMosley, J.R.1 aDuncan, J.C.1 aFleetwood-Walker, S.1 aClements, D.N.0 tveterinary journal.g2012 Aug., v. 193, no. 2 p.545-550dElsevier Ltdx1090-02337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2012.01.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010200157300001600259520103800275592002801313650002101341650002001362650001001382650002201392650001501414650001501429650001801444650002301462650001001485651001601495651001201511700001701523700001701540700001501557700001501572773009801587856007301685852000901758655001201767IND60441839220221120071704.0151027e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044183922DNAL7 a10.1111/jen.122072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLacković, N.10aGenetic split between coastal and continental populations of gypsy moth separated by Dinaric Alps  ap. 721-726.  aThe gypsy moth, a polyphagous herbivore species, infests mainly deciduous trees in the northern hemisphere, being invasive in North America. In Croatia, gypsy moth is infesting both continental and coastal forests, with the Dinaric Alps posing a physical migratory barrier between two regions. During outbreaks, caterpillars cause severe damages in both regions, though with different outbreak dynamics, which suggests genetic differences between populations. Representative populations from these two regions were screened by sequencing a region of the mitochondrial COI gene. Ninety‐nine sequences resulted in seventeen haplotypes, and analyses revealed a significant genetic differentiation between coastal and continental populations, quite likely attributed to geographic isolation and post‐glacial history. This differentiation arises from significantly higher genetic variability in Mediterranean population, indicating their higher adaptability, an intriguing fact in case of possible northward range shift of gypsy moth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLymantria dispar 3acoastal forests 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3aherbivores 3ainsect larvae 3amigratory behavior 3atrees 3aAlps region 3aCroatia1 aBertheau, C.1 aStauffer, C.1 aPernek, M.1 aAvtzis, D.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2015 Nov., v. 139, no. 9 p.721-726dP.

Using this method, dewatering and solidification/stabilization can be carried out simultaneously such that the treatment time can be significantly shortened and the treatment efficacy can be significantly improved. A series of model tests was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results indicated that the proposed PHDVPSS method showed superior performance compared to the conventional S/S method that uses Portland cement (PC) directly without prior dewatering. The 56-day unconfined compressive strength of DCS treated by the proposed method with GGBS-MgO as the binder is 12–17 times higher than that by the conventional S/S method. DCS treated by the PHDVPSS method exhibited continuous decrease in leaching concentration of Zn with increasing curing age. The reduction of Zn leachability is more obvious when using GGBS-MgO as the binder than when using PC, because GGBS-MgO increased the residual fraction and decreased the acid soluble fraction of Zn. The microstructure analysis reveals the formation of hydrotalcite in GGBS-MgO binder, which resulted in higher mechanical strength and higher Zn stabilization efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3acement 3acompression strength 3adewatering 3ahydrotalcite 3amicrostructure 3asediment contamination 3asolidification 3astrength (mechanics) 3awater content1 aMastoi, Aamir Khan1 aChen, Xunlong1 aSong, Dingbao1 aQiu, Jinwei1 aYang, Peng0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2021 Aug., v. 15, no. 4 p.67-67dHigher Education PresswJournal:J000001686x2095-22017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-020-1359-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245017700174520152200351592002801873650001901901650002201920650001501942650001701957650001201974650002701986650001202013650002102025650002302046650001602069650001302085650001502098650001802113650000902131650001302140650001702153650001302170650001502183650001802198650002002216653001502236653002402251653002902275653001502304653001602319700001802335700002402353700001802377700002002395700002102415700001802436700002702454700002102481773012002502856008802622852000902710655001202719IND60734827920221119083224.0220103e20210910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073482792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1471762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenriques, Bruno10aCan the recycling of europium from contaminated waters be achieved through living macroalgae? Study on accumulation and toxicological impacts under realistic concentrations  aEuropium (Eu) strategic importance for the manufacturing industry, high economic value and high supply risk, categorizes it as critical raw material. Due to anthropogenic contamination, Eu levels in ecosystems have been growing, which opens opportunities for innovation: its recovery and recycling from contaminated water as element source – circular economy. In this pioneering study, six widely available living marine macroalgae (Ulva intestinalis, Ulva lactuca, Gracilaria sp., Osmundea pinnatifida, Fucus vesiculosus and Fucus spiralis) were characterized (water content and specific surface area) and evaluated in the pre-concentration and recovery of Eu from contaminated seawater, under different relevant contamination scenarios (10, 152 and 500 μg L⁻¹). U. lactuca and Gracilaria sp. (3 g L⁻¹, fresh weight) proved to be the most effective in removing Eu, reaching up to 85% in 72 h, while the highest Eu enrichment was observed in U. intestinalis biomass, up to 827 μg g⁻¹ (bioconcentration factor of 1800), which is higher than Eu levels in common apatite ores. The effect of Eu exposure on macroalgae growth rate and organism biochemical performance (LPO, SOD, GPx and GSTs) was also evaluated for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Although no cellular damage was recorded, findings revealed toxicity and defence mechanisms activation, emphasizing the need of further studies on the potential risks associated with the presence of this emerging contaminant in aquatic ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFucus spiralis 3aFucus vesiculosus 3aGracilaria 3aUlva lactuca 3aapatite 3abioaccumulation factor 3abiomass 3acircular economy 3aeconomic valuation 3aenvironment 3aeuropium 3amacroalgae 3araw materials 3arisk 3aseawater 3asurface area 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3awater content 3awater pollution 0aWastewater 0aRare earth elements 0aBioconcentration factors 0aBiomarkers 0aGrowth rate1 aMorais, Tiago1 aCardoso, Celso E.D.1 aFreitas, Rosa1 aViana, Thainara1 aFerreira, Nicole1 aFabre, Elaine1 aPinheiro-Torres, José1 aPereira, Eduarda0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Sept. 10, v. 786 p.147176-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1471763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009900176300001600275520201400291592002802305650001302333650001202346650001302358650001602371650002702387650002402414650002302438650001402461650001802475651001202493653002302505653001702528653003002545700002002575700002502595773012602620856008602746852000902832655001202841IND60789211620221121064645.0220819e20220703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078921162DNAL7 a10.1080/07011784.2022.20902812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunroe, Elizabeth A.10aPostmortem analysis of safe-yield estimation of a heterogeneous aquifer for rural water supply  ap. 154-168.  aSustainable groundwater management is founded on the sound understanding of the effects of water extraction on the aquifer water level and the springs and streams receiving groundwater discharge. Pumping test data are commonly used in extraction licence applications to evaluate aquifer properties and assess the magnitude of storage depletion resulting from pumping. However, a short duration (eg 48 hours) pumping test can fail to detect the presence of aquifer boundaries, as the cone of depression is not large enough to reach the boundaries. This may cause an underestimation of long-term drawdown and an overestimation of permissible extraction rate (ie safe yield). In the rural town of Irricana in Alberta, groundwater extraction licences for municipal water supply wells were issued in the early 1980s based on the analysis of 48-hour pumping tests. Actual water extraction rates were substantially below the licensed rates, but the unanticipated and excessive drawdown in the aquifer forced the town to discontinue pumping and switch to surface water supply after 25 years. To examine the cause of overallocation, a new 48-hour pumping test was conducted in the same aquifer, which included an extended drawdown analysis using 26 days of recovery data. Geological formation logs for existing wells in the area surrounding Irricana were used to infer the extent of sandstone aquifer units within the heterogeneous bedrock formation. The new data analysis showed that the aquifer is semi-closed, contrary to the infinite-aquifer assumption used in the original pumping test, which caused additional drawdown due to the aquifer boundary effects. This study suggests an improved procedure for estimation of storage depletion using standard hydrogeological methods and readily available data. The new procedure provides a useful tool as part of adaptive groundwater management, in which water levels and other relevant variables are monitored and licensed extraction rates are adjusted accordingly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abedrock 3adrawdown 3agroundwater 3agroundwater extraction 3apublic water supply 3arural water supply 3asandstone 3asurface water 3aAlberta 0aaquifer evaluation 0apumping test 0awater resource management1 aHayashi, Masaki1 aBentley, Laurence R.0 tCanadian water resources journal.g2022 July 3, v. 47, no. 2-3 p.154-168dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2043x1918-18177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07011784.2022.20902813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03136naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008500169300001600254520167100270592002801941650005001969650002702019650001402046650001502060650001702075650001702092650002902109650001002138650001502148650001702163650001202180650001902192650000902211650001302220650001002233650001002243651001502253653001702268653001202285653002402297653002802321653000902349653001002358700001802368700002302386700002202409773008202431856008402513852000902597655001202606IND60545173720221121081905.0160901e20140801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054517372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2014.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jun-Jian10aTrihalomethanes in marine mammal aquaria: Occurrences, sources, and health risks  ap. 219-228.  aDisinfecting water containing the high levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) commonly generated during pinniped husbandry may cause the formation of carcinogenic disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Little information is available on DBP levels, sources, and health risks in marine mammal aquaria. Using the commonly observed trihalomethanes (THMs) as a DBP indicator, we monitored concentrations for seven months at The Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, California, one of the largest pinniped rehabilitation facilities in the world. Concentrations of THMs ranged 1.1–144.2 μg/L in pool waters and generally increased with number of animals housed (P < 0.05). To identify the sources of THM precursors in marine mammal aquaria, we intensively monitored the mass flows of potential THM precursors (i.e. food and wastes) in an isolated system with nine individual California sea lions to evaluate the sources and reactivity of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for 2–5 weeks. The common frozen foods used in feeding pinnipeds, including herring, sardine, and squid, produced an average of 22–34 mg-DOC/g-food in water and 836–1066 μg-THM/g-food after chlorination, whereas the fecal materials, including fresh scat, decomposed scat, and urine, produced 2–16 mg-DOC/g-waste and 116–768 μg-THM/g-waste. Food not eaten by animals could cause a sharp increase of DOC and DBP production and therefore should be removed rapidly from pools. Marine mammal husbandry staff and trainers are at risk (5.16 × 10−4 to 1.30 × 10−3) through exposure of THMs, exceeding the negligible risk level (10−6) defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aZalophus californianus 3aaquariums 3abyproducts 3achlorination 3adisinfection 3adissolved organic carbon 3afeces 3afood waste 3afrozen foods 3aherring 3amarine mammals 3arisk 3asardines 3asquid 3aurine 3aCalifornia 0aChlorination 0aBromide 0aCalifornia sea lion 0aDisinfection byproducts 0aFood 0aWaste1 aChow, Alex T.1 aSweeney, Joelle M.1 aMazet, Jonna A.K.0 tWater research.g2014 Aug. 01, v. 59 p.219-228dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2014.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245011600160300001600276520151700292592002801809650001401837650000901851650001801860650002601878650001501904650001101919650001601930700002001946773010901966856007802075852000902153655001202162IND60124298020221118034144.0151025e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012429802DNAL7 a10.3377/004.048.01142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPretorius, C.10aPatterns of Egg Deposition and Egg Development in the Catsharks Poroderma pantherinum and Haploblepharus pictus  ap. 115-124.  aPatterns of egg deposition and rates of egg development were examined for two endemic South African scyliorhinid shark species: Poroderma pantherinum, the leopard catshark, and Haploblepharus pictus, the dark shy shark. P. pantherinum laid their eggs at an average depth of 18.95 m (min: 7.4 m; max: : 26.8 m) preferentially attaching their eggs singly onto sea fans Leptogorgia palma, Eunicella papillosa and Eunicella tricoronata. H. pictus laid their eggs at an average depth 3 m (min: 1 m; max: 30.7 m) and attached their eggs, predominantly in pairs, to the seaweed Bifurcariopis capensis. The average temperature at which eggs were found were similar (15°C) and eggs were laid year-round. Embryo development was observed in the laboratory under constant controlled environmental conditions of 14 and 17°C. Embryo length-age relationships were linear for both species and there were significant differences in growth rate at the two temperatures. For P. pantherinum average growth rate was 0.37 mm/day at 14°C and 0.79 mm/day at 17°C. The average incubation period was 266 days at 14°C and 125 days at 17°C. Embryos thus grew two times faster and development time was 53% shorter when the temperature was raised by only 3°C. For H. pictus, the average growth rate was 0.49 mm/day at 14°C and 0.78 mm/day at 17°C. The incubation period was 242 days at 14°C and 190 days at 17°C. The embryos thus grew 1.6 times faster and incubation time was 21.5% shorter when temperature was raised by only 3°C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoroderma 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3aenvironmental factors 3amacroalgae 3asharks 3atemperature1 aGriffiths, C.L.0 tAfrican zoology.g2013 Apr., v. 48, no. 1 p.115-124dZoological Society of South Africax1562-70207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3377%2F004.048.01143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02399naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245016200171300001400333520089800347592002801245650001901273650002001292650001501312650001101327650001601338650000901354650001401363650001401377650002001391650002101411650001201432650002301444653001901467653003301486653002901519653004601548700002301594700002701617700002801644700001901672700002301691773008701714856008401801990002301885852000901908655001201917IND60697600820221119071538.0201209e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069760082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2019.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViarisio, Daniele10aCancer susceptibility of beta HPV49 E6 and E7 transgenic mice to 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide treatment correlates with mutational signatures of tobacco exposure  ap. 53-60.  aWe have previously showed that a transgenic (Tg) mouse model with cytokeratin 14 promoter (K14)-driven expression of E6 and E7 from beta-3 HPV49 in the basal layer of the epidermis and of the mucosal epithelia of the digestive tract (K14 HPV49 E6/E7 Tg mice) are highly susceptible to upper digestive tract carcinogenesis upon exposure to 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO). Using whole-exome sequencing, we show that in K14 HPV49 E6/E7 Tg mice, development of 4NQO-induced cancers tightly correlates with the accumulation of somatic mutations in cancer-related genes. The mutational signature in 4NQO-treated mice was similar to the signature observed in humans exposed to tobacco smoking and tobacco chewing. Similar results were obtained with K14 Tg animals expressing mucosal high-risk HPV16 E6 and E7 oncogenes. Thus, beta-3 HPV49 share some functional similarities with HPV16 in Tg animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenesis 3adigestive tract 3aepithelium 3ahumans 3amastication 3amice 3aneoplasms 3aoncogenes 3asmoking (habit) 3asomatic mutation 3atobacco 3atransgenic animals 0aBeta HPV types 0aUpper-digestive tract cancer 0a4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide 0aMutational signatures of tobacco exposure1 aRobitaille, Alexis1 aMüller-Decker, Karin,1 aFlechtenmacher, Christa1 aGissmann, Lutz1 aTommasino, Massimo0 tVirology.g2019 Dec., v. 538 p.53-60dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2019.09.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245010900173520139500282592002801677650001601705650001601721650000901737650001601746650002301762650002201785650001101807650002101818650001201839653003301851653005101884653002501935653002101960700001901981700002802000700002202028700001602050700001902066700001902085700001802104773011902122856008802241852000902329655001202338IND60734828020221119083458.0220103e20210825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073482802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1471772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoun, Jong-Sang10aQuantification of tire wear particles in road dust from industrial and residential areas in Seoul, Korea  aIn this study, we examined tire and road wear microparticles (TRWMPs) in road dust along the Seoul metropolitan area, from industrial and residential areas. The road dust samples were collected via vacuum sweep methods and then filtered to obtain particles with diameters less than 75 μm. To quantify the TRWMPs in road dust, we used the raw materials of tire components, natural rubber (NR), and styrene–butadiene rubber (SBR), as standard materials. We evaluated the usability of the pyrolyzer-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry py-GC/MS method introduced in ISO/TS 20593 by confirming the decomposition temperatures of the NR and SBR by thermogravimetric (TG) and evolved gas analysis (EGA)-MS. The average of TRWMPs in industrial and residential area road dust were 22,581 and 9818 μg/g, respectively, indicating that the industrial area has 2.5 times higher TRWMPs concentration. Further, the NR, the main component of truck bus radial, to SBR, the main component of passenger car radial, ratio was slightly higher in the industrial area than in the residential area. This presumably means that the high traffic volume, including heavy duty vehicles in industrial areas, affected the higher concentration of TRWMPs. This study reveals the growing evidence of the importance of TRWMPs in road dust and how TRWMPs quantity can impact the air quality of the Seoul metropolitan area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aautomobiles 3adust 3aenvironment 3ametropolitan areas 3aresidential areas 3arubber 3athermogravimetry 3atraffic 0aTire and road wear particles 0aPyrolyzer-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry 0aPassenger car radial 0aTruck bus radial1 aKim, Young-Min1 aSiddiqui, Muhammad Zain1 aWatanabe, Atsushi1 aHan, Sehyun1 aJeong, Sangmin1 aJung, Yong-Won1 aJeon, Ki-Joon0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Aug. 25, v. 784 p.147177-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1471773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02097naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245003400172520112500206592002801331650002101359650001401380650001801394653001901412653001301431653001301444653001401457653001301471653001901484700002201503700003301525773010401558856008801662852000901750655001201759IND60783294820221116204346.0220929e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078329482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.1041282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNance, Damian,10aPannotia: To be or not to be?  aFollowing a decade during which its presence was widely accepted, the existence of the putative Ediacaran supercontinent Pannotia has come into question since the turn of the millenium, largely due to the geochronology of Ediacaran-Cambrian orogens, which suggests that the supposed landmass had begun to break up well before it was fully assembled. Paleomagnetic data from this time interval have been used to both support and refute the existence of Pannotia, but are notoriously equivocal. Proxy signals for Ediacaran-Cambrian supercontinent assembly and breakup, although collectively compelling, can be individually challenged, and efforts to detect the mantle legacy expected of supercontinent amalgamation, while promising, are inconclusive. Yet the existence of Pannotia is central to the nature, duration and evolution of the supercontinent cycle, and dictates the cycle’s geodynamic pathway from the breakup of Rodinia to the assembly of Pangea.

Adsorption of Ponceau 4R by the prepared adsorbent was achieved under different initial Ponceau 4R concentrations, fish scale adsorbent doses, temperatures and pH conditions. The Freundlich isotherm model represented the experimental data very well. Kinetic studies indicated that the adsorption process followed the pseudo-second-order model and the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity of the fish scale adsorbent was 134.40 mg g⁻¹.

However, neutrophil trapping in CGD patients in response to calcium ionophores has been previously described in one of the authors' studies. Some researches have shown that NADPH-oxidase-deficient neutrophils are not only incapable of generating ROS but also have major disturbances in the influx of extracellular Ca²⁺ due to the absence of the electrogenic function of the enzyme and the membrane depolarization during the activation and consequently multiple abnormalities in the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines. In this study, it has been shown that the formation of NETs by neutrophils deficient in NADPH oxidase in response to calcium ionophore A23187 is accompanied by excessive accumulation of intracellular Ca²⁺. We propose that this violation is because of the absence of the electrogenic function in mutant NADPH oxidase that normally induces depolarization of the plasma membrane. The results have indicated the important role of phagocytic NADPH oxidase as a modulator of extracellular Ca²⁺ transport and that it can be used to find the cure for CGD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3acalcium 3acalcium ionophores 3acytokines 3afungi 3aimmunosuppression 3amutants 3aneutrophils 3aphagocytosis 3aphenotype 3aplasma membrane 3areactive oxygen species1 aChernyak, B.

On the one hand a rapid granulation is desired, on the other hand good biological nutrient removal capacities have to be maintained. So far, several operation parameters have been studied separately, which makes it difficult to compare their impacts. We investigated seven operation parameters in parallel by applying a Plackett-Burman experimental design approach with the aim to propose an optimized startup strategy. Five out of the seven tested parameters had a significant impact on the startup duration. The conditions identified to allow a rapid startup of AGS-SBRs with good nutrient removal performances were (i) alternation of high and low dissolved oxygen phases during aeration, (ii) a settling strategy avoiding too high biomass washout during the first weeks of reactor operation, (iii) adaptation of the contaminant load in the early stage of the startup in order to ensure that all soluble COD was consumed before the beginning of the aeration phase, (iv) a temperature of 20 °C, and (v) a neutral pH. Under such conditions, it took less than 30 days to produce granular sludge with high removal performances for COD, N, and P. A control run using this optimized startup strategy produced again AGS with good nutrient removal performances within four weeks and the system was stable during the additional operation period of more than 50 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3abiomass 3acarbon 3achemical oxygen demand 3adissolved oxygen 3aexperimental design 3anitrogen 3apH 3aphosphorus 3asludge 3atemperature 0aAerobic granular biofilms 0aGranulation 0aNutrient removal 0aOperation conditions 0aReactor startup1 aHolliger, Christof0 tWater research.g2014 Aug. 01, v. 59 p.58-70dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2014.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03517naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245017100169300001100340520185200351592002802203596004302231596006602274650002802340650002202368650002402390650001902414650001302433650001302446650001802459650002102477650001502498650000902513650001402522650002602536650001202562650001602574650001302590650001402603650001202617651001002629700002002639700001702659700001702676700001702693700001702710700006002727773010802787856008302895852000902978655001202987IND60735847120221121151539.0220130e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073584712DNAL7 a10.1186/s12985-021-01540-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoharam, Ibrahim10aMonoclonal antibodies specific for the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein define neutralizing epitopes specific for Newcastle disease virus genotype 2.VII from Egypt  ap. 86.  aBACKGROUND: Newcastle disease is a devastating disease in poultry caused by virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV), a paramyxovirus endemic in many regions of the world despite intensive vaccination. Phylogenetic analyses reveal ongoing evolution of the predominant circulating genotype 2.VII, and the relevance of potential antigenic drift is under discussion. To investigate variation within neutralization-sensitive epitopes within the protein responsible for receptor binding, i.e. the Hemagglutinin-Neuraminidase (HN) spike protein, we were interested in establishing genotype-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). METHODS: An HN-enriched fraction of a gradient-purified NDV genotype 2.VII was prepared and successfully employed to induce antibodies in BalbC mice that recognize conformationally intact sites reactive by haemagglutination inhibition (HI). For subsequent screening of mouse hybridoma cultures, an NDV-ELISA was established that utilizes Concanavalin A (ConA-ELISA) coupled glycoproteins proven to present conformation-dependent epitopes. RESULTS: Six out of nine selected MAbs were able to block receptor binding as demonstrated by HI activity. One MAb recognized an epitope only present in the homologue virus, while four other MAbs showed weak reactivity to selected other genotypes. On the other hand, one broadly cross-reacting MAb reacted with all genotypes tested and resembled the reactivity profile of genotype-specific polyclonal antibody preparations that point to minor antigenic differences between tested NDV genotpyes. CONCLUSIONS: These results point to the concurrent presence of variable and conserved epitopes within the HN molecule of NDV. The described protocol should help to generate MAbs against a variety of NDV strains and to enable in depth analysis of the antigenic profiles of different genotypes.  aPublisher supplied data  a20-09-06cMinistry of Higher Education  a2017-20cBundesministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3aNewcastle disease 3aantigenic variation 3aconcanavalin A 3aepitopes 3agenotype 3aglycoproteins 3ahemagglutination 3ahybridomas 3amice 3aphylogeny 3apolyclonal antibodies 3apoultry 3avaccination 3avirology 3avirulence 3aviruses 3aEgypt1 aAsala, Olayinka1 aReiche, Sven1 aHafez, Hafez1 aBeer, Martin1 aHarder, Timm1 aGrund, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3328-21930 tVirology journal.g2021 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.86-86dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-021-01540-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245009400135300001500229500001400244520089900258592002801157650001501185650002301200650001801223650001501241650001501256650002501271650001701296650001601313650001401329650001701343650001301360650002101373650001801394650002401412650001201436650003001448650001401478653001001492653001301502653000901515653001801524700001501542700001601557700001401573773013401587852000901721655001201730IND60723714720221122035028.0210117e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072371472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarmā, Gāyatrī,10aMobility of OP Pesticides in Soil as Affected by Physico Chemical Characteristics of Soil  ap. 97-103.  aNAL-light  aThe mobility (Rf) of the OP pesticides malathion, phosphamidon, dichlorvos, dimethoate and thiometon was studied in soil by using soil thin layer chromatography (s-TLC). The effect of soil organic matter (OM) and its fractions i.e. humic (HA) and fulvic acids (FA), clay content, soil pH and exchangeable cations were investigated. The pesticides mobility followed the order thiometon>dimethoate>.phosphamidon>malathion> dichlorvos in both soils while malathion was more mobile than phosphamidon in Agra sandy loam soil. The OM, HA, FA, clay content, pH and exchangeable cations were found to decrease the pesticide mobility in soils except for malathion and phosphamidon which showed an increase in mobility on addition of humic acid to soil.

Experiments were carried out over the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), the ECE–15 segments, the period from 0 to 49 s within the NEDC procedure (FSE) and the Extra Urban Driving Cycle segment. Exhaust particles were characterized in terms of the particle number, surface area, volume and size distributions between 30nm and 1μm. Under the NEDC, the GDI car had particle emissions weighted by particle number, surface area and volume that were 56–2 739% higher than the emissions from the PFI car in the range of particle size measured, and the particle number, volume and surface area emissions per km for the GDI car are respectively 5.3, 9.0 and 14.6 times higher than those for the PFI car. Among the testing conditions employed, the highest concentrations of average particle number, surface area and volume were found in the FSE, and the particle number, surface area and volume for the GDI car were respectively 9.5, 33.2 and 39.8 times higher than those for the PFI car. Moreover, the peak of the particle size distributions for the PFI car was toward a smaller size, while that for the GDI was toward a larger size, indicating that particles emitted by the PFI car are much smaller than those emitted by the GDI car.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3agasoline 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3aparticulate emissions 3asurface area 0aGasoline direct injection car 0amultipoint port fuel injection car 0aparticle number distribution 0aparticle surface area distribution 0aparticle volume distribution1 aSong, Chong–lin1 aPan, Suo–zhu1 aGao, Jun–hua1 aCao, Xiao–feng0 tAtmospheric Pollution Research.g2014 Oct., v. 5 p.753-758dElsevier B.V.x1309-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5094/APR.2014.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245012300172300001200295500001500307520108400322592002801406650002901434650002101463650001301484650001401497650001801511650001501529650001901544650001201563650001501575650002601590650001201616650001501628650001301643650001401656650001001670653002501680700001901705700002101724700002201745700002201767773010201789856008101891852000901972655001201981IND60440453420221117045355.0151030e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044045342DNAL7 a10.1007/s12230-014-9405-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnett, Brittany A.10aSite and Clone Effects on the Potato Root-Associated Core Microbiome and its Relationship to Tuber Yield and Nutrients  ap. 1-9.  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this study was to describe the variability in the root-associated bacterial community due to location and clone, and to determine whether an underlying core bacterial community exists that might benefit the quality of the potato crop. Root-associated bacterial communities from one growing season were examined with 454 sequencing. Variance analysis using perMANOVA attributed 45.4 % and 24.1 % of the community variability to site and clone effects, respectively. A total of 123 bacterial operational taxonomic units were correlated with tuber yield and/or tuber nutrient content, a majority belong to the order Rhizobiales. Rhizobiales bacteria are recognized contributors to crop nitrogen needs for many legumes; however, no known symbiotic relationship between potato roots and nitrogen fixing bacteria exists. Within the Rhizobiales order, the genus Devosia is a major contributor to both the presence/absence core “bacteriome” and the sparse partial least squares core “bacteriome,” thus further exploration into this unknown relationship is warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3anutrient content 3anitrogen 3asymbiosis 3aleast squares 3acrop yield 3agrowing season 3aDevosia 3amicrobiome 3abacterial communities 3alegumes 3abacteriome 3apotatoes 3anutrients 3aroots 0aanalysis of variance1 aHolm, David G.1 aKoym, Jeffery W.1 aWilson, Robert G.1 aManter, Daniel K.0 tAmerican journal of potato research.g2015 Feb., v. 92, no. 1 p.1-9dSpringer USx1099-209X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12230-014-9405-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002500141245008000166520127200246592002801518650001901546650001401565650002501579650001401604650001201618650001201630650001001642650001701652650001401669650001401683650001701697700002501714700002701739700002301766700002401789773012001813856007501933852000902008655001202017IND60745365820221119223209.0210723e20210720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074536582DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110721522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWojnarowski, Konrad 10aImpact of Estrogens Present in Environment on Health and Welfare of Animals  aNowadays, there is a growing interest in environmental pollution; however, knowledge about this aspect is growing at an insufficient pace. There are many potential sources of environmental contamination, including sex hormones—especially estrogens. The analyzed literature shows that estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), and synthetic ethinyloestradiol (EE2) are the most significant in terms of environmental impact. Potential sources of contamination are, among others, livestock farms, slaughterhouses, and large urban agglomerations. Estrogens occurring in the environment can negatively affect the organisms, such as animals, through phenomena such as feminization, dysregulation of natural processes related to reproduction, lowering the physiological condition of the organisms, disturbances in the regulation of both proapoptotic and anti-apoptotic processes, and even the occurrence of neoplastic processes thus drastically decreasing animal welfare. Unfortunately, the amount of research conducted on the negative consequences of their impact on animal organisms is many times smaller than that of humans, despite the great richness and diversity of the fauna. Therefore, there is a need for further research to help fill the gaps in our knowledge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3aapoptosis 3aenvironmental impact 3aestradiol 3aestriol 3aestrone 3afauna 3afeminization 3alivestock 3apollution 3areproduction1 aPodobiński, Paweł 1 aCholewińska, Paulina 1 aSmoliński, Jakub 1 aDorobisz, Karolina 0 tAnimals.g2021 July 20, v. 11, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110721523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245010400177300001600281520137800297592002801675650002301703650001001726650001201736650002401748650001101772650001001783651001001793653002101803653002201824653002801846653003201874653003101906653001701937700002101954700001801975773012301993856008602116852000902202655001202211IND60789212320221121064623.0220819e20220703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078921232DNAL7 a10.1080/14728028.2022.20790072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEwusi Koomson, Joshua10aContract farming scheme for rubber production in Western region of Ghana: why do farmers side sell?  ap. 139-152.  aContract farming guarantees smallholder farmers a reliable market, allow them to access inputs and technical support, and thus improve their welfare. However, side selling is a major threat to the promotion and development of contract farming in Sub-Saharan Africa, including in Ghana. While there is growing interest in addressing this issue for food crops and other tree crops, particularly coffee, there is limited literature on this subject for rubber. Against this background, our paper contributes to filling this knowledge gap by answering the research question “Why do smallholder farmers engage in side selling?” using primary data from 370 rubber farmers participating in an outgrower scheme in Western region of Ghana. A binary Probit regression model is applied in the empirical analysis. We find that 20% of the rubber farmers engaged in contract farming are involved in side selling. The results show that contractor’s delays in payment, delays in weighing latex and farmers’ difficulty in getting truck to transport latex to sale point are positively correlated with side selling behaviour while farmers’ age and access to extension services decrease their likelihood of engaging in side selling. To curb side selling behaviour among rubber farmers, it is important that the contractor addresses the transaction related challenges faced by farmers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aempirical research 3alatex 3amarkets 3aregression analysis 3arubber 3atrees 3aGhana 0aContract farming 0arubber production 0atransaction cost theory 0anew institutional economics 0atransaction cost economics 0aside selling1 aDonkor, Emmanuel1 aOwusu, Victor0 tForests, trees and livelihoods.g2022 July 03, v. 31, no. 3 p.139-152dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2169x2164-30757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14728028.2022.20790073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01217naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245009900155300001800254520022700272592002800499650002400527650002000551650001400571650001300585650001400598700001600612700001900628700002000647700001500667773012800682856007200810852000900882655001200891IND60658243620221120152426.0190816e20080701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065824362DNAL7 a10.1039/b804362k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaoyan10aAu–Cu Alloy nanoparticles confined in SBA-15 as a highly efficient catalyst for CO oxidation  ap. 3187-3189.  aAu–Cu Alloy nanoparticles with sizes of ∼3 nm were prepared in the confined space of SBA-15 and showed much better performance than monometallic particles in catalyzing CO oxidation even with the rich presence of H₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloy nanoparticles 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3ahydrogen 3aoxidation1 aWang, Aiqin1 aWang, Xiaodong1 aMou, Chung-Yuan1 aZhang, Tao0 tChemical communications.g2008 July 1, , no. 27 p.3187-3189dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b804362k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01610naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245010600165300002000271520067400291592002800965650002400993650001901017650002001036650001701056650001701073700002301090773012401113856007401237852000901311655001201320IND60664642120221120180801.0190912e20131016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066464212DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra43823f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPallikonda, Gangaram10aTriflic acid mediated functionalization of α-hydroxyphosphonates: route for sulfonamide phosphonates  ap. 20503-20511.  aAn operationally simple synthetic method for (±)-α-aryl/methylsulfonamidomethylphosphonates and new (±)-γ-aryl/methyl sulfonamidomethylvinylphosphonates has been developed through straightforward reactions of (±)-α-hydroxyphosphonates with sulfonamides in the presence of triflic acid (TfOH) at room temperature in a vessel open to air.

In order to assess the prevalence of this infection in cattle in Ireland, serum samples (100 herds, 20 samples/herd) collected for statutory screening for brucellosis were examined by soluble chlamydial antigen indirect ELISA. The assay detects antibodies to the two most common Chlamydiaceae spp. affecting cattle, namely Chlamydia abortus and Chlamydia pecorum. A total of 95 samples from 57 herds were seropositive, representing an observed prevalence rate of 4.75%. The parametric bootstrap estimate of the mean disease prevalence in the population was 6.04% (95%, CI 4.70–7.50). The results suggest the prevalence of chlamydial infection is low in cattle in Ireland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydia 3aChlamydophila pecorum 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3abrucellosis 3acattle 3adisease prevalence 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aherds 3ascreening 3aseroprevalence 3aIreland1 aSammin, Donal1 aHarmeyer, Silke1 aNath, Mintu1 aLivingstone, Morag1 aLongbottom, David0 tveterinary journal.g2012 Aug., v. 193, no. 2 p.583-585dElsevier Ltdx1090-02337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2011.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03672naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245009800171520182300269592002802092650002802120650001602148650001602164650001602180650001602196650001502212650001602227650001602243650001602259650001902275650002402294650002002318653000802338653000802346653000802354653001102362653000702373653000802380653000702388653001502395653000902410653000802419653000702427653000702434653000802441653000802449653000602457653000702463653000802470653001102478653001602489653002102505653001502526653001902541653002002560700001402580700001502594700001802609700001902627700001302646700001502659700001502674700001702689700001602706773011902722856008802841852000902929655001202938IND60734828720221119083454.0220103e20210825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073482872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1471842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Fei-Peng10aUrinary bisphenol A and its alternatives among pregnant women: Predictors and risk assessment  aExposure to bisphenol A (BPA) has been associated with various adverse health outcomes. Recently, an increasing concern on its alternatives such as bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) has been aroused due to the restriction use of BPA. Few studies have identified predictors of exposure to BPA alternatives and assessed their health risks.The aim of this study was to identify predictors of BPA and its alternatives and to assess their health risks among pregnant women.We detected first morning urinary concentrations of BPA and its alternatives (BPS and BPF) among 1097 pregnant women from an established Chinese cohort. A questionnaire was conducted to obtain demographic characteristics, dietary habits, and lifestyles. We examined the predictors of creatinine-adjusted urinary BPA and its alternatives concentrations using multivariable linear regression. Risk assessment of exposure to BPA and its alternatives was calculated based on the estimated of daily intake (EDI).Geometric means of creatinine-adjusted urinary BPA, BPF, and BPS were 0.92, 0.12, and 0.08 μg/g creatinine, respectively. Pregnant women from Wuhan had lower concentrations of BPA, BPF, and ∑BPs (sum of BPA, BPF, and BPS) than those from Xiaogan. Intake of fried food was related to higher concentrations of BPA, and intake of pickled food was associated with higher concentrations of BPF and ∑BPs. The maximum EDI values for exposure to BPA, BPF, BPS, and ∑BPs ranged from 5.6428 to 13.3356 nmol/kg body weight/day, which were below the tolerable daily intake (TDI) for BPA defined by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) (18 nmol/kg body weight/day). The maximum hazard index (HI) value was 0.7409.Several predictors identified in this study may inform public recommendations to reduce exposure to BPA and its alternatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacceptable daily intake 3abisphenol A 3abisphenol F 3abisphenol S 3abody weight 3acreatinine 3aenvironment 3afood safety 3afried foods 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3arisk assessment 0aBPA 0aBPS 0aBPF 0a∑BPs 0aBW 0aBMI 0aCI 0aCEsmoothed 0aEFSA 0aEDI 0aHQ 0aHI 0aIOM 0aLOD 0aM 0aSE 0aTDI 0aUCcrea 0aBisphenol A 0aBPA alternatives 0aPredictors 0aPregnant women 0aRisk assessment1 aYang, Pan1 aLiu, Chong1 aChen, Pan-Pan1 aDeng, Yan-Ling1 aMiao, Yu1 aLuo, Qiong1 aZhang, Min1 aLu, Wen-Qing1 aZeng, Qiang0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Aug. 25, v. 784 p.147184-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1471843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013600164520139000300592002801690650001901718650002601737650002701763650002701790650001001817650002301827650002801850650001301878650001001891650000701901650001401908650002401922653006401946653001802010653002602028653001902054700001902073700001602092700001702108700001702125700001602142700001602158700005502174773012102229856008202350852000902432655001202441IND60728305220221121080231.0220606e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072830522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1111282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeo, Ye Seul10aEffect of inkjet-printed flexible dielectric barrier discharge plasma on reduction of pathogen and quality changes on sliced cheese  aThe objective of this study was to investigate pathogen reduction and quality changes in sliced cheddar cheese treated with inkjet-printed flexible dielectric barrier discharge (FXDBD) plasma. The samples were treated with plasma for 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min. The surviving populations of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes were significantly reduced by 2.65, 2.80, and 2.03 log CFU/g, respectively, after 20 min. The main reactive species that could be involved in bacterial inactivation were ozone (O₃) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which were produced at concentrations of 298.19 and 28.08 ppm, respectively, after 20 min plasma treatment. The pH of the plasma-treated sample was lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05), whereas there was no significant difference among treatment times. With increasing plasma treatment time, the L* value decreased, while the b*, total color difference, and 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances values increased (P < 0.05) while the redness (a*) value remained unchanged. These results indicate that inkjet-printed FXDBD plasma can effectively inactivate pathogens in cheese; however, it causes an increase in lipid oxidation. Plasma treatment with newly developed inkjet-printed FXDBD showed improved microbiological safety with minimal effects to the physicochemical quality of cheese.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCheddar cheese 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3acolor 3alipid peroxidation 3amicrobiological quality 3anitrogen 3aozone 3apH 3apathogens 3athiobarbituric acid 0aInkjet-printed flexible dielectric barrier discharge plasma 0aSliced cheese 0aPathogen inactivation 0aQuality change1 aYim, Dong Gyun1 aBaek, Ki Ho1 aKang, Taemin1 aLee, Yee Eun1 aKim, Jinwoo1 aChoe, Wonho1 aJo, Cheorun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2109-37980 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 May, v. 143 p.111128-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1111283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01224naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245009800155300001800253520022600271592002800497650001200525650001100537650001100548650002800559650001400587700003600601700003000637700003300667773012800700856007300828852000900901655001200910IND60658243820221120152356.0190816e20080520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065824382DNAL7 a10.1039/b804393k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIehl, Julien10aClick chemistry for the efficient preparation of functionalized [60]fullerene hexakis-adducts  ap. 2450-2452.  aA Tₕ-symmetrical C₆₀ hexakis-adduct bearing 12 peripheral azide groups has been prepared and used to produce functionalized derivatives by the copper mediated Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azides and alkynes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3aazides 3acopper 3acycloaddition reactions 3afullerene1 aPereira de Freitas, Rossimiriam1 aDelavaux-Nicot, Béatrice1 aNierengarten, Jean-Francois,0 tChemical communications.g2008 May 20, , no. 21 p.2450-2452dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b804393k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02530naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245016400165300001600329520127600345592002801621650003601649650002701685650001001712650000901722650000901731650001601740650001001756650001101766651001701777653001401794653001801808653001901826653001701845653001701862700002301879700002201902773010901924856007802033852000902111655001202120IND60124299120221118035110.0151025e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012429912DNAL7 a10.3377/004.048.02032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDicken, Matthew L.10aWhite Shark (Carcharodon carcharias)-Inflicted Bite Wounds Observed on Cape Fur Seals (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus) at Black Rocks, Algoa Bay, South Africa  ap. 418-426.  aThis paper presents the first quantitative study on the seasonal occurrence and body location of white shark (Carcharodon carcharias)-inflicted injuries on Cape fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus) at Black Rocks, in Algoa Bay. Between January 2010 and October 2011, 22 boat trips were made to Black Rocks to chum for white sharks. On 19 of the trips a series of overlapping photographs were taken of the northern side of Black Rocks and the percentage of seals, which exhibited fresh white shark bite wounds recorded. A total of 53 sharks and 28 fresh shark-inflicted injuries were recorded on seals over the course of the study period. The maximum number of sharks sighted per hour (1.2) was in July and the highest percentage of shark bitten seals in November (0.6%). There was no significant relationship between the monthly sighting rate of sharks and the percentage of shark bitten seals (P = 0.40). The percentage of shark-inflicted injuries observed on seals increased with seal size. Most injuries were observed in the forebody (37.5%) and lower body regions (37.5%). Very few injuries (6.3%) were observed in the head and neck region. The low number of bite-inflicted injuries observed suggests that white sharks attack seals infrequently at Black Rocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArctocephalus pusillus pusillus 3aCarcharodon carcharias 3aboats 3ahead 3aneck 3aphotographs 3aseals 3asharks 3aSouth Africa 0aAlgoa Bay 0abite injuries 0aCape fur seals 0awhite sharks 0aSouth Africa1 aBradshaw, Michelle1 aSmale, Malcolm J.0 tAfrican zoology.g2013 Oct., v. 48, no. 2 p.418-426dZoological Society of South Africax1562-70207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3377%2F004.048.02033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100003100140245011300171300001600284500002000300500000900320500001500329520171000344592002802054596006702082596005902149650002102208650002202229650001502251650001502266650002702281650001502308650004402323650002902367650001502396650000702411650002302418650001502441700003202456700002502488700003402513773021602547852000902763856007702772655001202849IND4464072420221120213835.0220330e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446407242DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2011.04372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarín‐Benito, Jesús M.10aAssessment of Spent Mushroom Substrate as Sorbent of Fungicides: Influence of Sorbent and Sorbate Properties  ap. 814-822.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  a2019-12-05  aThe capacity of spent mushroom substrate (SMS) as a sorbent of fungicides was evaluated for its possible use in regulating pesticide mobility in the environment. The sorption studies involved four different SMS types in terms of nature and treatment and eight fungicides selected as representative compounds from different chemical groups. Nonlinear sorption isotherms were observed for all SMS–fungicide combinations. The highest sorption was obtained by composted SMS from Agaricus bisporus cultivation. A significant negative and positive correlation was obtained between the Kₒc sorption constants and the polarity index values of sorbents and the Kₒw of fungicides, respectively. The statistic R² revealed that more than 77% of the variability in the Kₒc could be explained considering these properties jointly. The other properties of both the sorbent (total carbon, dissolved organic carbon, or pH) and the sorbate (water solubility) were nonsignificant. The hysteresis values for cyprodinil (log Kₒw = 4) were for all the sorbents much higher (>3) than for other fungicides. This was consistent with the remaining sorption after desorption considered as an indicator of the sorption efficiency of SMS for fungicides. Changes in the absorption bands of fungicides sorbed by SMS observed by FTIR permitted establishing the interaction mechanism of fungicides with SMS. The findings of this work provide evidence for the potential capacity of SMS as a sorbent of fungicides and the low desorption observed especially for some fungicides, although they suggest that more stabilized or humified organic substrates should be produced to enhance their efficiency in environmental applications.  aPublisher supplied data  aAGL2007‐61674/AGRcSpanish Ministry of Education and Science  cEuropean and Structural and Social Funds (FEDER‐FSE) 3awater solubility 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aabsorption 3acyprodinil 3aspent mushroom compost 3aadsorbents 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3adissolved organic carbon 3ahysteresis 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3adesorption1 aRodríguez‐Cruz, M.

V.14aThe Effect of Gossypol on the Structure of Nucleosomes  ap. 142-146.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGossypol is a highly active compound with antiviral, antioxidant, antimicrobial, antimalarial, and antitumor properties. It is known that the antitumor effect of gossypol is associated with genotoxicity; however, gossypol interaction with chromatin was not studied. In this work, using the method of single particle microscopy based on the Förster resonant energy transfer, it was found that gossypol at concentrations of 10 μM and higher causes significant structural changes in the conformation of nucleosomal DNA on the histone octamer. These changes affect at least 35 bp of nucleosomal DNA, increase the distance between neighboring superhelical gyres of nucleosomal DNA in this region to 9 nm or more, and are caused by unwrapping of nucleosomal DNA. The presence of linker DNA regions slightly increases the resistance of nucleosomes to the gossypol action compared with core nucleosomes. At the concentration of 30 μM and higher, gossypol completely disrupts the structure of nucleosomes, causing dissociation of histones from DNA. The obtained data indicate that gossypol genotoxicity observed in vivo could be associated with a direct effect of gossypol on chromatin, leading to disruption of the nucleosome structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aactive ingredients 3aantimalarials 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantioxidants 3adissociation 3aenergy transfer 3agenotoxicity 3agossypol 3ahistones 3amicroscopy 3anucleosomes1 aKoshkina, D.

Cucumber accessions CSL0067 and CSL0139 were selected to generate 315 F₂ populations. The genetic linkage map based on 66 polymorphic SSR markers was constructed. It composed of eight linkage groups (LGs) spanning 474.4 cM. Downy mildew disease reaction was evaluated in cotyledons, first and second true leaf on 7, 10, and 14 day after inoculation. The results showed that downy mildew resistance was controlled by multiple recessive genes. The susceptible to resistant ratio of F₂ progenies fit 9:7 susceptible/resistant segregation types corresponding to duplicate recessive epistasis. Fourteen QTLs were detected. The phenotypic variance ranged from 5.0 to 12.5%, while LOD values ranged from 3.538 to 9.165. Two major QTLs and two QTL hotspots were identified. Moreover, the additive effects data explained that these QTL reduced downy mildew susceptibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3achromosome mapping 3acucumbers 3adowny mildew 3aepistasis 3ahomozygosity 3aleaves 3aphenotypic variation1 aPANYANITIKOON, HADSAYA1 aKHANOBDEE, CHANULAK1 aSAMIPAK, SOMPID1 aJANTASURIYARAT, CHATCHAWAN1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7278-97040 tJournal of genetics.g2020 Dec., v. 99, no. 1 p.81-81dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16319x0022-13337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12041-020-01242-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01891naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012200156300001800278520066900296592002800965650001800993650001401011650002301025650002501048650001901073650001801092650001901110650001901129650001401148650001901162650002101181700001601202700001301218700001201231700001601243700001801259773012101277856007401398852000901472655001201481IND60664642620221120180658.0190912e20131202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066464262DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra43829e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Liang10aTransfer hydrogenation of acetophenone in an organic-aqueous biphasic system containing double long-chain surfactants  ap. 1567-1569.  aTransfer hydrogenation of acetophenone catalyzed by a water-soluble ruthenium complex, RuCl₂(TPPTS)₂ [TPPTS: P(m-C₆H₄SO₃Na)₃], in the presence of surfactants, was studied.

Concomitantly, the higher contents of metal(oid)s are observed in the soil of karst areas in Guizhou Province, and there are few reports to study the inner relationship between local soil and metal(oid)s in the here. Hence, the present study mainly aimed to understand the adsorption and desorption characteristics of metal(oid)s in yellow soils of a typical karst area using kinetics and adsorption isotherms. The effects of temperature, pH and electrolytes on adsorption were also examined. The risk of metal(oid)s in soil was also evaluated by geoaccumulation and tomlinson pollution load indexes. The results showed that the pH value of yellow soil collected from Guizhou Province was 6.41, making it a weakly acidic soil, and the average concentrations of organic matter and CaCO₃ were approximately 1.12% and 0.88%, respectively. The adsorption of metal(oid)s did not significantly vary with an increase in the CaCO₃ concentration in the yellow soil. The metal(oid)s adsorption of the yellow soil improved with an increasing clay content. The Hg content in the yellow soil far exceeded the standard value (GB 15618–2018), with a corresponding cumulative evaluation of grade 1 according to the geoaccumulation index. Tomlinson pollution load indexes exhibited that the comprehensive score of the selected metal(oid)s in the yellow soil was 0.60, corresponding to no pollution. The adsorption behavior of As onto the yellow soil can be interpreted through pseudo-second-order kinetics and the Langmuir model, where the maximum adsorption was observed at 1318 mg/kg. The adsorption of most metal(oid)s increased with increasing temperature. The adsorption of Pb, Cr, Cu, Zn and As did not obviously fluctuate with an increasing NaNO₃ concentration. Notably, local related departments should take measures to decrease the Hg content in this soil.  aThis work was financially supported by the Guizhou science and technology support plan project (No. [2021] 491,[2019] 2840, [2017] 1176); the basic condition platform construction project of Guizhou science and Technology Department [2019] 5701;the Guizhou science and technology support plan project (No. [2021] 491, [2019] 2840, [2017] 1176); the basic condition platform construction project of Guizhou science and Technology Department [2019] 5701; Guizhou Province excellent young scientific and technological talents project (No. Qiankehe [2021]5631); the Planing Project of Guiyang City (No. Zhukehe [2021] 3-04, No. Zhukehe [2021] 3-27); the Growth Project of Young Scientific and Technological Talents in Universities of Guizhou Province (No.[2021] 302).”  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. [2021] 491a[2019] 2840 3aacid soils 3aadsorption 3aclay fraction 3adesorption 3airon oxides 3akarsts 3aorganic matter 3apH 3apollution load 3arisk 3asediment contamination 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3aChina 0aYellow soil 0akarst areas 0ametal(oid)s 0akinetics 0aadsorption isotherms1 aZhang, Zhenming1 aHuang, Xianfei1 aCui, Mingyang1 aWu, Xianliang1 aLiu, Huijuan0 tSoil & sediment contamination.g2022 Oct. 03, v. 31, no. 7 p.834-854dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000152x1549-78877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15320383.2021.20166053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245010100156300001600257520177100273592002802044650002702072650002602099650001202125650001302137650001302150650001902163650002202182650001302204650001802217650002202235700001902257700002002276700002102296773010202317856007302419852000902492655001202501IND60441840520221121183659.0151027e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044184052DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.122712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrman, Emily10aDispersal and establishment filters influence the assembly of restored prairie plant communities  ap. 892-899.  aCommunity assembly filters, which in theory determine the suite of species that arrive at and establish in a community, have tremendous conceptual relevance to restoration. However, the concept has remained largely theoretical, with a paucity of empirical tests. As such, the applicability of assembly filters theory to ecological restoration remains incompletely known. We tested the relative strengths of dispersal and establishment filters by comparing the plant species composition, measured by species' presence/absence, in 29 restored prairies with the seed mixes used to restore each prairie. We found that both establishment and dispersal filters limited prairie similarity to the seed mix. Sown species responded differentially to filters, with a few species limited only by dispersal (seed density), many others limited only by establishment conditions (i.e. organic matter and sand content of soils, land use history, and fire frequency), and others limited by both dispersal and establishment filters. A few species, typically those sown most often, were not restricted by dispersal or establishment filters, likely because they were sown in high enough densities and all sites had suitable environmental conditions. Finally, one group of species established poorly, but we could not attribute this to either dispersal or establishment filters. This information can help land managers select species likely to establish in restorations when sown at sufficient densities. These results illustrate that dispersal and establishment filters limit the establishment of species in restored communities and these filters are species‐dependent. Identifying the most limiting filter(s) for species will inform strategies to increase their establishment success.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological restoration 3aenvironmental factors 3afilters 3aland use 3amanagers 3aorganic matter 3aplant communities 3aprairies 3asand fraction 3aspecies diversity1 aBassett, Tyler1 aZirbel, Chad R.1 aBrudvig, Lars A.0 tRestoration ecology.g2015 Nov., v. 23, no. 6 p.892-899dWiley Periodicals, Inc.x1061-29717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.122713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245019000173520151300363592002801876650003001904650001801934650002501952650001601977650002001993650001902013650003402032650002202066650001802088650001402106650003302120650002502153650001802178653002102196653003602217653003502253653003202288653002902320700006002349700005602409773012102465856008202586852000902668655001202677IND60728305520221121164509.0220606e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072830552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1111312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Thi Minh Chau10aEffects of ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), high voltage electric field (HVEF), high pressure processing (HPP), and combined methods (HVEF+UAE and HPP+UAE) on Gac leaves extraction  aEmerging processing technologies and their combinations might be promising approaches to overcome the limitations of the conventional extraction method (CEM). In this study, ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE, 150 W, 20 min), high voltage electric field (HVEF, 4000 kV m⁻¹ min), and high-pressure processing (HPP, 300 MPa, 3 min) were used in comparison with the CEM to extract Gac leaves (Momordica cochinchinensis Spreng). Besides, two innovative combined methods, i.e., HVU (HVEF+UAE) and HPU (HPP+UAE), were proposed and investigated. Total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), total chlorophyll content (TCC), SOD-like capacity, and carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzyme inhibition of the extracts were measured. Also, polyphenolic compounds were identified by HPLC and the most contributors in the dataset were assessed by principal component analysis (PCA). Gac leaves extract was found to be a source of valuable bioactive compounds with antioxidant activity and hypoglycemic effects that can help with postprandial hyperglycemia management. Vanillic acid and myricetin had the most contributions to α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibition ability. Combined emerging technologies (HVU and HPU) were superior to other methods due to the highest values of TPC (5200 mg GAE/100 g DW), TFC (620 mg QE/100 g DW), SOD-like activity (12,100 U/g DW), and inhibitory effects of α-glucosidase (38%, IC₅₀ value of 20.5 mg/mL) and α-amylase (42%, IC₅₀ value of 16.5 mg/mL).  aPublisher supplied data 3aMomordica cochinchinensis 3aalpha-amylase 3aantioxidant activity 3achlorophyll 3adata collection 3aelectric field 3aelectric potential difference 3aenzyme inhibition 3ahyperglycemia 3amyricetin 3aprincipal component analysis 3aultrasonic treatment 3avanillic acid 0aCombined methods 0aGac (Momordica cochinchinensis) 0aUltrasonic-assisted extraction 0aHigh voltage electric field 0aHigh-pressure processing1 aGavahian, Mohsen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4904-05191 aTsai, Pi-Jen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0889-10900 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 May, v. 143 p.111131-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1111313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01359naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245009400161300001800255520024200273592002800515650001800543650002300561650002000584650004600604650001000650650001300660650001300673700001700686700002300703700001900726700002200745700002100767773012800788856007200916852000900988655001200997IND60658244220221122232436.0190816e20080605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065824422DNAL7 a10.1039/b804413a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKauppila, Tiina J.10aCarbohydrate and steroid analysis by desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry  ap. 2674-2676.  aDesorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) is applied to the analysis of carbohydrates and steroids; the detection limits are significantly improved by the addition of low concentrations of salts to the spray solvent.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbohydrates 3achemical reactions 3adetection limit 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3asalts 3asolvents 3asteroids1 aTalaty, Nari1 aJackson, Ayanna U.1 aKotiaho, Tapio1 aKostiainen, Risto1 aCooks, R.

The objective of the present study was to understand the molecular features that contribute to bitter, sweet and licorice sensation of licorice roots, and whether individual compounds elicit more than one of these sensations. Therefore, a sensomics approach was conducted, followed by purification of the compounds with highest sensory impact, and by synthesis as well as full characterization via HRESIMS, ESIMS/MS and 1D/2D-NMR experiments. This led to the discovery and structure determination of 28 sweet, bitter and licorice tasting key phytochemicals, including two unknown compounds. A combination of sensorial, cell-based and computational analysis revealed distinct structural features, such as spatial arrangement of functional groups in the triterpenoid E-ring, driving to different taste sensations and sweet receptor hTAS1R2/R3 stimulation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGlycyrrhiza glabra 3afood chemistry 3alicorice 3aphytochemicals 3asaponins 3ataste 3atriterpenoids 0aSaponin 0aGlycyrrhizin 0aSensomics 0aTaste receptor 0aModelling 0aSAR1 aBrockhoff, Anne1 aShoshan-Galeczki, Yaron Ben1 aKranz, Maximilian1 aStark, Timo D.1 aErkaya, Rukiye1 aMeyerhof, Wolfgang1 aNiv, Masha Y.1 aDawid, Corinna1 aHofmann, Thomas0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 364 p.130420-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1304203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245018200174300001600356520103400372592002801406650001001434650002701444650001701471650002301488650001101511650001101522650001301533650002501546650001801571650001201589650000901601650001401610650001701624653001601641653001401657653001801671653002301689653001901712700001501731700001401746700002701760700002201787700002001809773010001829856008701929852000902016655001202025IND60542264320221118022406.0190402e20141115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054226432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.04.1012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarde-Cerdán, T.10aStudy of the effects of proline, phenylalanine, and urea foliar application to Tempranillo vineyards on grape amino acid content.

The nitrogen sources applied to Tempranillo grapevines were proline, phenylalanine, urea, and two commercial nitrogen fertilisers, both without and with amino acids in their formulations. All treatments were applied at veraison and one week later. Proline treatment did not affect the must nitrogen composition. However, phenylalanine and urea foliar application enhanced the plants’ synthesis of most of the amino acids, producing similar effects. In addition, the spray of commercial nitrogen fertilisers over leaves also induced a rise in grape amino acid concentrations regardless of the presence or absence of amino acids in their formulation. The most effective treatments were phenylalanine and urea followed by nitrogen fertilisers. This finding is of oenological interest for improved must nitrogen composition, ensuring better fermentation kinetics and most likely enhancing wine quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis 3aamino acid composition 3afermentation 3afoliar application 3agrapes 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aphenylalanine 3aproline 3aurea 3avineyards 3awine quality 0aAmino acids 0aGrapevine 0aFertilisation 0aFoliar application 0aVitis vinifera1 aLópez, R.1 aPortu, J.1 aGonzález-Arenzana, L.1 aLópez-Alfaro, I.1 aSantamaría, P.0 tFood chemistry.g2014 Nov. 15, v. 163 p.136-141dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.04.1013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04131naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014200169520223800311592002802549650001802577650001902595650001302614650001502627650001602642650001702658650001202675650001802687650001202705650001502717650001102732650001002743650001502753650002202768650001102790650001502801650001402816651001002830653004302840653004302883653006202926653003302988700001803021700005503039700006003094700002203154700001903176700001403195700001403209700005103223700001503274700001403289700001803303700001503321773008703336856008503423852000903508655001203517IND60758162020221123031102.0220103e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075816202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2021.1058922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Naimeng10aVegetation change and human-environment interactions in the Qinghai Lake Basin, northeastern Tibetan Plateau, since the last deglaciation  aThe nature of the interaction between prehistoric humans and their environment, especially the vegetation, has long been of interest. The Qinghai Lake Basin in North China is well-suited to exploring the interactions between prehistoric humans and vegetation in the Tibetan Plateau, because of the comparatively dense distribution of archaeological sites and the ecologically fragile environment. Previous pollen studies of Qinghai Lake have enabled a detailed reconstruction of the regional vegetation, but they have provided relatively little information on vegetation change within the Qinghai Lake watershed. To address the issue we conducted a pollen-based vegetation reconstruction for an archaeological site (YWY), located on the southern shore of Qinghai Lake. We used high temporal-resolution pollen records from the YWY site and from Qinghai Lake, spanning the interval since the last deglaciation (15.3 kyr BP to the present) to quantitatively reconstruct changes in the local and regional vegetation using Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm models. The results show that, since the lateglacial, spruce forest grew at high altitudes in the surrounding mountains, while the lakeshore environment was occupied mainly by shrub-steppe. From the lateglacial to the middle Holocene, coniferous woodland began to expand downslope and reached the YWY site at ∼ 7.1 kyr BP. The living environment of the local small groups of Paleolithic-Epipaleolithic humans (during 15.3–13.1 kyr BP and 9–6.4 kyr BP) changed from shrub-steppe to coniferous forest–steppe. The pollen record shows no evidence of pronounced changes in the vegetation community corresponding to human activity. However, based on a comparison of the local and regional vegetation reconstructions, low values of biodiversity and a significant increase in two indicators of vegetation degradation, Chenopodiaceae and Rosaceae, suggest that prehistoric hunters-gatherers likely disturbed the local vegetation during ∼ 9.0–6.4 kyr BP. Our findings are a preliminary attempt to study human-environment interactions at Paleolithic-Epipaleolithic sites in the region, and they contribute to ongoing environmental archaeology research in the Tibetan Plateau.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthaceae 3aHolocene epoch 3aRosaceae 3aalgorithms 3aarchaeology 3abiodiversity 3acatenas 3aforest steppe 3aforests 3aglaciation 3ahumans 3alakes 3alandscapes 3aplant communities 3apollen 3awatersheds 3awoodlands 3aChina 0aQuantitative vegetation reconstruction 0aLocal and regional vegetation dynamics 0aPaleolithic-Epipaleolithic human-environment interactions 0aNortheastern Tibetan Plateau1 aCao, Xianyong1 aXu, Qinghai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2518-35201 aHuang, Xiaozhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2127-04511 aHerzschuh, Ulrike1 aShen, Zhongwei1 aPeng, Wei1 aLiu, Sisi1 aWu, Duo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5667-81231 aWang, Jian1 aXia, Huan1 aZhang, Dongju1 aChen, Fahu0 tCatena.g2022 Mar., v. 210 p.105892-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.1058923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03278naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245023600160300001600396500001900412520171000431592002802141650002202169650003502191650001902226650002102245650001102266650002002277650001202297650003302309650001802342650000702360650001102367650001702378650002102395650002102416650001302437650001602450650001002466700002302476700003502499700003002534700002302564773012602587856007402713852000902787655001202796IND60727818820221118123255.0210212e20210211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072781882DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ay02264k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorahan, Tülay13aAn accurate and sensitive effervescence-assisted liquid phase microextraction method for the determination of cobalt after a Schiff base complexation by slotted quartz tube-flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry in urine samples  ap. 703-711.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, an accurate analytical method development for cobalt determination in urine samples was described. The method is based on the mass transfer of the target analytes to the organic phase from the aqueous phase by the dispersing extractant throughout the solution with the aid of CO₂ bubbles prior to sample measurement by using a slotted quartz tube flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer. An extractor (1-decanol) dropped effervescent tablet (anhydrous sodium carbonate and sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate mixture) was used in order to separate/preconcentrate cobalt after complexation of cobalt ions in aqueous solution with the Schiff base ligand. The parameters affecting the extraction output such as complexing conditions (pH, ligand concentration, and volume) and extraction conditions (extraction solvent type and volume, extraction temperature, and heating duration, NaOH volume and mixing period) were optimized to lower the detection limit. The limit of detection and quantification values under optimized experimental and instrumental conditions were determined as 3.7 μg L⁻¹ and 12 μg L⁻¹, respectively with high linearity with respect to the dynamic range between 15 and 300 μg L⁻¹. The enhancement factor obtained with the developed method was calculated as 83 fold. The pretreatment process was applied to urine samples in order to test the convenience of the developed method in urine samples for the determination of cobalt at low levels. The high percentage recovery results of 96–97% for four different concentrations of spiked urine samples indicated the proposed method's sufficient sensitivity for analyte determination in such a complex matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical species 3acobalt 3adetection limit 3aligands 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3amass transfer 3apH 3aquartz 3aschiff bases 3asodium carbonate 3asodium phosphate 3asolvents 3atemperature 3aurine1 aZaman, Buse Tuğba1 aArıca Polat, Büşra Sümeyye1 aBakırdere, Emine Gülhan1 aBakırdere, Sezgin0 tAnalytical methods.g2021 Feb. 11, v. 13, no. 5 p.703-711dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ay02264k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001900149245009200168300001600260500001900276520129200295592002801587650001401615650001601629650002401645650001101669650001801680650001801698650001701716650001801733700001901751700002001770773010401790856008501894852000901979655001201988IND6037256920221118195614.0141111e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603725692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2012.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStohl, Andreas14aThe total release of xenon-133 from the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant accident  ap. 155-159.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe accident at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant (FD-NPP) on 11 March 2011 released large amounts of radioactivity into the atmosphere. We determine the total emission of the noble gas xenon-133 (¹³³Xe) using global atmospheric concentration measurements. For estimating the emissions, we used three different methods: (i) using a purely observation-based multi-box model, (ii) comparisons of dispersion model results driven with GFS meteorological data with the observation data, and (iii) such comparisons with the dispersion model driven by ECMWF data. From these three methods, we have obtained total ¹³³Xe releases from FD-NPP of (i) 16.7 ± 1.9 EBq, (ii) 14.2 ± 0.8 EBq, and (iii) 19.0 ± 3.4 EBq, respectively. These values are substantially larger than the entire ¹³³Xe inventory of FD-NPP of about 12.2 EBq derived from calculations of nuclear fuel burn-up. Complete release of the entire ¹³³Xe inventory of FD-NPP and additional release of ¹³³Xe due to the decay of iodine-133 (¹³³I), which can add another 2 EBq to the ¹³³Xe FD-NPP inventory, is required to explain the atmospheric observations. Two of our three methods indicate even higher emissions, but this may not be a robust finding given the differences between our estimates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3ainventories 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3anuclear fuels 3anuclear power 3apower plants 3aradioactivity1 aSeibert, Petra1 aWotawa, Gerhard0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2012 Oct., v. 112 p.155-159dElsevier Ltdx0265-931X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2012.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03278naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245012700172300001600299520181100315592002802126650002102154650001802175650001602193650001102209650002402220650001802244650002002262650001602282650002602298650001102324650002302335650001702358650001302375650002202388650001402410650002102424650001202445650003702457700002302494700001702517700002102534700002102555773012802576856008302704852000902787655001202796IND60769036020221120230217.0220813e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076903602DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-021-05155-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChagnon, Pierre-Luc10aTrait-based and phylogenetic filtering of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities under long-term agricultural practices  ap. 273-287.  aAIMS: We explored how long-term agricultural practices affect arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal traits and community structure. METHODS: We sampled soil and roots from a 26-year-old field experiment comprising 16 replicated treatments, in which we manipulated tillage intensity (moldboard vs. chisel plow), fertilization (organic vs. mineral) and crop rotation (continuous barley vs barley-forage rotations) in a factorial design (N = 64). We measured AM fungal community-aggregated traits, namely the abundance of vesicles, arbuscules, extraradical mycelium (ERM) and spores. We characterized root-borne and soil-borne AM communities using Illumina sequencing. RESULTS: Crop rotation was the main factor controlling AM fungal traits, with more arbuscules and ERM found in forage rotation plots, and more vesicles and spores found in continuous barley plots. Members of the Glomeraceae family were preferentially associated with continuous barley whereas the Gigasporaceae and Diversisporaceae families were overrepresented in the first stage of crop rotation. Trait-based and phylogenic filtering of AM fungal communities allowed us to speculate on different life history strategies among taxonomic families. AM community structure in soil responded to fertilizer type, whereas root-borne communities responded to crop rotation. We found the first evidence of temporal niche partitioning as a potential driver of coexistence among AM fungal taxa, resulting in higher species richness (i.e. storage effects). CONCLUSIONS: Crop rotation scheme strongly influences functional traits and coexistence of AM fungi, more so than soil disturbance intensity or fertilization regime. Future work is required to understand the implications of these shifts in AM fungal community structure for crop productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiversisporaceae 3aGigasporaceae 3aGlomeraceae 3abarley 3acommunity structure 3acrop rotation 3adisturbed soils 3afertilizers 3afield experimentation 3aforage 3afungal communities 3alife history 3amycelium 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aphylogeny 3aspecies richness 3atillage 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aBradley, Robert L.1 aLafond, Jean1 aParé, Maxime C.1 aPenaud, Valentin0 tPlant and soil.g2022 Feb., v. 471, no. 1-2 p.273-287dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-021-05155-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245019100154520203200345592002802377650001802405650001102423650002502434650001402459650001102473650001102484650002002495650002602515651001002541700001802551700001702569700001802586773012702604856007402731852000902805655001202814IND60652361320221118022003.0190712e20180719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065236132DNAL7 a10.3390/su100725352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Yi10aDecomposition Analysis of Carbon Emissions from Energy Consumption in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, China: A Weighted-Combination Model Based on Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index and Shapley Value  aThe Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (B-T-H) region, who captures the national strategic highland in China, has drawn a great deal of attention due to the fog and haze condition and other environmental problems. Further, the high carbon emissions generated by energy consumption has restricted its further coordinated development seriously. In order to accurately analyze the potential influencing factors that contribute to the growth of energy consumption carbon emissions in the B-T-H region, this paper uses the carbon emission coefficient method to measure the carbon emissions of energy consumption in the B-T-H region, using a weighted combination based on Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) and Shapley Value (SV). The effects affecting carbon emissions during 2001&ndash;2013 caused from five aspects, including energy consumption structure, energy consumption intensity, industrial structure, economic development and population size, are quantitatively analyzed. The results indicated that: (1) The carbon emissions had shown a sustained growth trend in the B-T-H region on the whole, while the growth rates varied in the three areas. In detail, Hebei Province got the first place in carbon emissions growth, followed by Tianjin and Beijing; (2) economic development was the main driving force for the carbon emissions growth of energy consumption in B-T-H region. Energy consumption structure, population size and industrial structure promoted carbon emissions growth as well, but their effects weakened in turn and were less obvious than that of economic development; (3) energy consumption intensity had played a significant inhibitory role on the carbon emissions growth; (4) it was of great significance to ease the carbon emission-reduction pressure of the B-T-H region from the four aspects of upgrading industrial structure adjustment, making technological progress, optimizing the energy structure and building long-term carbon-emission-reduction mechanisms, so as to promote the coordinated low-carbon development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3acarbon 3aeconomic development 3aemissions 3aenergy 3amodels 3apopulation size 3aquantitative analysis 3aChina1 aNiu, Dongxiao1 aZhou, Weiwei1 aFan, Yingying0 tSustainability.g2018 July 19, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100725353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02194naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012000162300001600282520083400298592002801132650005501160650000901215650000901224650002501233650001401258650003301272650002201305650001601327650001901343651001101362651000901373700001901382700001601401700002401417700001901441700001801460700001701478773016401495856007501659961001701734852000901751655001201760IND60586054720221120150208.0220904s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058605472DNAL7 a10.13031/aea.122662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArmstrong, Paul R10aDevelopment and Evaluation of a Low-Cost Probe-Type Instrument to Measure the Equilibrium Moisture Content of Grain  ap. 619-627.  aStorage of grain in bags is common in Africa, Asia, and many other less developed countries making a bag probing method well-suited for moisture content (MC) measurement. A low-cost meter was developed under a USAID project to reduce post-harvest loss (PHL). The meter, referred to as the PHL meter, measures the MC of maize and other grains based on relative humidity (RH) and temperature (T) measurements obtained by a small digital sensor located in the tip of a tubular probe that can be inserted into bags of grain or other grain bulks. Measurements are used by equilibrium moisture content (EMC) equations programmed into the meter to predict MC. A handheld reader connected to the probe provides a user interface.

B.10aMethods for testing for texture convergence using abundance data: a randomisation test and a method for comparing the shape of distributions  ap. 57-66.  aTesting the ecological communities of different areas for convergence, in the sense of remarkable similarity in the characteristics of the species present, has a long history in biology. Recently, numerical methods have been developed for comparing community-level convergence to an explicit null model. No valid method has been known for testing the significance of texture convergence when the species are weighted by their abundance. Six combinations of method variants are tested on random datasets. A valid P value (i. e., with P . 0. 05 in no more than 5% of the cases) is obtained so long as for each species the distribution of abundances across sites is retained, and only the assignment of character values is randomised. Further restriction is not necessary for obtaining a valid P value, and can lead to a test with considerably lower power to detect convergence. The power of the test with free matching of character values to species is only moderate with 10 sites, though improved with larger numbers of sites. Previous methods for detecting texture convergence have examined convergence only in the mean value for any character. It is possible that the external environment might be reflected in the community mean of a character, leaving the imprint of convergence on the shape of the distribution, rather than the mean. A method for comparing the shape is described, and it is shown that the null model is valid also for this test statistic.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3adata collection 3amodels 3atexture 0aCharacter distributions 0aCharacter distributions 0aCommunity structure 0aConvergence 0aFunctional characters1 aSmith, B.0 tCommunity ecology.g2001 June 1, v. 2, no. 1 p.57-66dAkadémiai Kiadóx1585-85537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FComEc.2.2001.1.73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245016200164300002000326520132900346592002801675650001501703650001701718650001601735650002501751650001601776650002001792650002201812650001501834650001401849650001501863650002501878650001101903650001801914650001601932650002101948653002001969653002701989653002702016653001702043653002802060700005502088700005702143773014202200856007802342852000902420655001202429IND60650880520221118203859.0190710e20190621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065088052DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b094302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Haoxiang10aExtremely Stretchable and Self-Healable Electrical Skin with Mechanical Adaptability, an Ultrawide Linear Response Range, and Excellent Temperature Tolerance  ap. 24639-24647.  aArtificial electronic skin (e-skin) that imitates the complex functions of human skin is able to transduce external stimuli into electronic signals. However, it remains challenging to fabricate e-skin sensing materials with extreme stretchability, self-healing, mechanical compliance, extreme temperature tolerance, and an ultrawide linear response range. Here, we demonstrate a new e-skin sensor fabricated by introducing polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-capped Ag nanowires into the chemically and physically cross-linked polyacrylamide–PVP double-network ethylene glycol organogel. The resulting organogel e-skin exhibits extreme stretchability (>22 000%), autonomous self-healing, as well as mechanical compliance. Particularly, the sensor is capable of antifreezing and antiheating (−20 to 80 °C) and provides an ultrawide linear response range with a gauge factor of 0.15 for 0–430% tensile strain and 0.71 for 430–18 100% tensile strain, respectively. By dynamically accommodating to a curved surface, the e-skin sensor demonstrates comprehensive applications in real-time and in situ tracking of large body deformations, spatial gesture movements, and physiological signals for motion behaviors and health level evaluation, showing great promise in wearable electronics, biomedical devices, and soft robotics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompliance 3acrosslinking 3adeformation 3aelectronic equipment 3aelectronics 3aethylene glycol 3amedical equipment 3ananosilver 3ananowires 3aorganogels 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3arobots 3askin (animal) 3atemperature 3atensile strength 0aelectronic skin 0aextreme stretchability 0alinear signal response 0aself-healing 0amechanical adaptability1 aNiu, Wenbin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5507-15921 aZhang, Shufen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3390-41990 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 June 21, v. 11, no. 27 p.24639-24647dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b094303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02121naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008300167300001400250520099100264592002801255650001501283650001301298650001201311650001201323650001301335650001501348650003201363700001901395700001501414700002001429700001701449700001801466700001801484700001901502700001701521773009401538856008201632852000901714655001201723IND60091593820221121025354.0141103e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009159382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2012.04.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwak, Yeon Hwa10aFlexible glucose sensor using CVD-grown graphene-based field effect transistor  ap. 82-87.  aA flexible glucose sensor using a CVD-grown graphene-based field-effect-transistor (FET) is demonstrated. The CVD-grown graphene was functionalized with linker molecules in order to immobilize the enzymes that induce the catalytic response of glucose. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was employed as the substrate material to realize a flexible sensor. The fabricated graphene-based FET sensor showed ambipolar transfer characteristics. Through measurements of the Dirac point shift and differential drain-source current, the fabricated FET sensor could detect glucose levels in the range of 3.3–10.9mM, which mostly covers the reference range of medical examination or screen test for diabetes diagnostic.

Pb, a neurotoxic substance, is classified as a possible carcinogen for humans (group 2B) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) under the World Health Organization (WHO). Cd, a substance that causes kidney damage, is classified as a substance that causes human cancer (group 1). In this study, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and a mercury analyzer (MA) were used to identify the concentrations of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Hg) in fishery products and to assess the effects of chronic human exposure to heavy metals via fisheries consumption. Food consumption data were obtained from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES 2010–2015), and the mean exposure concentrations for Pb, Cd, and Hg were 0.0067 μg/kg bw/day, 1.1277 μg/kg bw/month, and 0.0872 μg/kg bw/week, respectively. Exposures to Pb, Cd, and Hg using the 95th percentile of the consumption data were 0.0183 μg/kg bw/day, 4.0230 μg/kg bw/month, and 0.2268 μg/kg bw/week, respectively, corresponding to 3, 16, and 6% of the human exposure safety standard. Safe guidelines for the intake of fishery products are proposed to reduce the exposure to and accumulation of heavy metals in humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aWorld Health Organization 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3acarcinogens 3aexposure assessment 3afisheries 3afood consumption 3ahumans 3akidneys 3amercury 3aneurotoxicity 3apollution 3aresearch 3aSouth Korea1 aKim, Ju Ho1 aLe Kim, Min Dil1 aSuh, Won Duck1 aKim, Ji Eun1 aYeon, Hyun Jun1 aPark, Young Soek1 aKim, Soo-Hwaun1 aOh, Yoon-Hee1 aJo, Gune-Hee0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Sept., v. 27, no. 26 p.33042-33051dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09624-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03429naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010400166300001800270520197400288592002802262650001402290650002102304650001902325650001702344650001802361650001902379650001602398650001802414650001702432650001302449650000902462650001302471650001902484650001302503653003202516653004102548653003102589653002902620653001802649700002402667700002002691700002002711773012402731856008302855852000902938655001202947IND60750814820221120061955.0220214e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075081482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.09.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlejo, Teresa10aHybrid thermoresponsive nanoparticles containing drug nanocrystals for NIR-triggered remote release  ap. 1466-1477.  aThe on-demand administration of anaesthetic drugs can be a promising alternative for chronic pain management. To further improve the efficacy of drug delivery vectors, high drug loadings combined with a spatiotemporal control on the release can not only relief the pain according to patient’s needs, but also improve the drawbacks of conventional burst release delivery systems. In this study, a hybrid nanomaterial was developed by loading bupivacaine nanocrystals (BNCs) into oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (OEGMA)-based thermoresponsive nanogels and coupling them to NIR-absorbing biodegradable copper sulphide nanoparticles (CuS NPs). Those CuS NPs were surface modified with polyelectrolytes using layer-by-layer techniques to be efficiently attached to the surface of nanogels by means of supramolecular interactions. The encapsulation of bupivacaine in the form of nanocrystals allowed to achieve CuS@BNC-nanogels having drug loadings as high as 65.5 wt%. The nanocrystals acted as long-lasting drug reservoirs, leading to an elevated localized drug content, which was useful for their application in prolonged pain relief. The CuS@BNC-nanogels exhibited favorable photothermal transducing properties upon NIR-light irradiation. The photothermal effect granted by the CuS NPs triggered the nano-crystallized drug release to be boosted by the collapse of the thermoresponsive nanogels upon heating. Remote control was achieved for on-demand release at a specific time and place, indicating their potential use as an externally activated triggerable drug-delivery system. Furthermore, cell viability tests and flow cytometry analysis were performed showing satisfactory cytocompatibility in the dose-ranging study having a subcytotoxic concentration of 0.05 mg/mL for CuS@BNC-nanogels. This remotely activated nanoplatform is a promising strategy for long-lasting controlled analgesia and a potential alternative for clinical pain management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalgesia 3abiodegradability 3acell viability 3aelectrolytes 3aencapsulation 3aflow cytometry 3airradiation 3amethyl ethers 3ananocrystals 3ananogels 3apain 3apatients 3aremote control 3asulfides 0aNIR-activated nanoparticles 0aReversible thermoresponsive nanogels 0aOn–off switching release 0aBupivacaine nanocrystals 0aDrug delivery1 aSébastian, Victor,1 aMendoza, Gracia1 aArruebo, Manuel0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Feb., v. 607 p.1466-1477dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.09.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02116naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009100163300001600254520107200270592002801342650001001370650001201380650001501392650002101407650000901428650002201437653001401459653001401473653001901487653002501506653001601531653002001547773009501567856008301662852000901745655001201754IND60479389320221120110143.0160121e20010601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047938932DNAL7 a10.1556/ComEc.2.2001.1.112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalassy, M.10aPossible role of the seed bank in the restoration of open sand grassland in old fields  ap. 101-108.  aThe species composition of the seed bank and aboveground vegetation of an old field was compared to a reference grassland stand. The relative importance of dispersal and recruitment as limiting factors was analysed, and measures for appropriate restoration are proposed. Grassland species were able to re-establish in the old field soon after abandonment of cultivation, with <i>Stipa borysthenica </i>as the dominant species. Five years after abandonment of cultivation, the seed bank was still dominated by weedy annuals while grassland species made a relatively high contribution to the seed bank in the reference site. The results do not support recruitment to be the limiting factor in recently abandoned fields, because grassland species that occurred in the seed bank were also present in the vegetation. A rapid regeneration of the matrix species is predicted due to their good dispersal capacity and the vicinity of the open sand grassland. However, the introduction of subordinate species and the control of invasive plants might require human intervention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStipa 3aannuals 3agrasslands 3ainvasive species 3asand 3aspecies diversity 0aDispersal 0aDispersal 0aDry grasslands 0aOld field succession 0aRecruitment 0aSeed separation0 tCommunity ecology.g2001 June 1, v. 2, no. 1 p.101-108dAkadémiai Kiadóx1585-85537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FComEc.2.2001.1.113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245010000178300001400278520106500292592002801357650002701385650001501412650001701427650002101444650001501465650000901480650002701489650001101516650001501527650002101542650001401563650003501577650002501612700002501637773009401662856008201756852000901838655001201847IND60091594020221123013847.0141103e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009159402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2012.04.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKashefi-Kheyrabadi, Leila10aAptamer-conjugated silver nanoparticles for electrochemical detection of adenosine triphosphate  ap. 94-98.  aThe capability of silver nanoparticles (SNP) as redox tag in the construction of an electrochemical aptasensor for the detection of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is investigated in the present manuscript. To construct the aptasensor, a well-known ATP binding aptamer (ABA) splits into two segments. The first amino-labeled segment of the aptamer was covalently immobilized on 3-mercaptopropionic acid modified gold electrode surface by the formation of carbodiimide bond. The second segment was modified by SNPs and associated with the first segment in the presence of ATP. The direct oxidation signal of SNPs is followed as the analytical signal to detect ATP. The sandwich assay shows a suitable signal gain and importantly, a good response time. The sensor can detect the concentrations of ATP as low as micromolar scales with a desirable stability under optimum conditions. Furthermore, analog nucleotides including GTP, UTP and CTP, do not show serious interferences and this sensor readily detects its target in a complex media such as human blood plasma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abiosensors 3ablood plasma 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agold 3aguanosine triphosphate 3ahumans 3ananosilver 3aoligonucleotides 3aoxidation 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3auridine triphosphate1 aMehrgardi, Masoud A.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2012 , v. 37, no. 1 p.94-98dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2012.04.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245011200189300001800301520136600319592002801685650002301713650001501736650001001751650000901761650001701770650001001787650001501797650004301812650001101855650002401866650001501890650001801905650001601923650001001939650004101949650001101990650003102001650006402032651001002096651001002106653000902116653002402125653001502149653000902164653001202173700001402185700001602199700001402215700001802229700001602247773011502263856005102378852000902429655001202438IND50087203720221119231524.0140412e20110801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008720372DNAL7 a216441192pmid7 a10.1080/19440049.2011.5764372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCano-Sancho, G.10aSphinganine and sphingosine levels and ratio in urine and blood samples from a Catalonian population, Spain  ap. 1055-1065.  aFumonisins occur mainly in maize and they produce alterations on sphingolipid metabolism, unbalancing the sphinganine (Sa)/sphingosine (So) ratio. This alteration has been proposed as a biomarker of fumonisin exposure. The objective of this study was to establish the urinary and plasmatic levels of Sa, So as well as the ratio Sa/So from a sample of the Catalonian (Spain) population exposed to fumonisins at low levels. Firstly, plasma and urinary Sa and So levels and the ratio Sa/So were compared between two population groups, and later urinary Sa and So levels from corn food consumers and a control group were monitored for 2 weeks under controlled intake of corn foods. Sa and So levels were determined in urine and blood samples using validated methods using HPLC with fluorescence detection. Significant differences were not found in urine samples when Sa/So ratios were compared from corn food consumers and non-consumers, while significant differences were found in urine and plasma samples, but evidence of the mechanism of action of fumonisins was not apparent. Through a time-course study we have narrowed down the day in which the maximum alteration of Sa/So ratio should be expected in humans. This paper reports some useful information to improve the design of studies to validate the ratio Sa/So as a possible biomarker of fumonisin exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aat-risk population 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3acorn 3afluorescence 3afoods 3afumonisins 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3amechanism of action 3ametabolism 3asphingolipids 3asphingosine 3aurine 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aHumans 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 2aSphingosinexanalogs & derivativesxanalysisxbloodxurine. 3aSpain 0aSpain 0aHPLC 0aexposure assessment 0afumonisins 0abeer 0acereals1 aMarin, S.1 aSanchis, V.1 aColom, C.1 aCoronel, M.B.1 aRamos, A.J.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2011 Aug. 1, v. 28, no. 8 p.1055-1065dTaylor & Francis Groupx1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2011.576437  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010200168300001400270520162800284592002801912596006501940596005002005650001202055650001602067650001602083650000902099700002402108700002902132700002102161700001602182700001602198700005502214773012602269856008302395852000902478655001202487IND60769036320221120220904.0220813e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076903632DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-021-05100-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Zhao-Feng10aDistinct and dynamic distributions of multiple elements and their species in the rice rhizosphere  ap. 47-60.  aAIMS: The biogeochemical cycles of elements from soils to plants are mainly governed by their rhizosphere processes. Understanding these processes is challenging and remains largely unresolved due to the complex interrelationships among different elements and due to a lack of appropriate techniques for simultaneous spatiotemporal monitoring. METHODS: This study employed an updated In-situ Porewater Iterative (IPI) sampler to collect porewater across the rice rhizosphere at a spatial resolution of 1.7 mm and a time interval of 3–10 days. An IPI sampler array (0–22 mm measurement distance every 1.7 mm) was adopted to capture the in situ spatiotemporal dynamics of ten elements (Fe, Mn, As, P, S, Cr, Co, Zn, Sb and Cd) in the paddy rhizosphere to examine their covarying changes in time and space dimensions, with an emphasis on As and Cd. RESULTS: The findings revealed that the solute-phase concentration of most elements, other than Sb and Cd, increased to a peak after 30 days of paddy soil flooding and then decreased. Additionally, Sb and Cd continuously decreased during flooding. Fe (−52%), Mn (−17%), P (−43%), Co (−11%), and As species (−74%) were substantially immobilized within a 10 mm zone around the roots, while Zn (28%) and Cd (41%) increased. Almost all arsenite-oxidizing genes were significantly promoted in the rhizosphere. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed most sampled elements covaried with Fe both in time and space in the rhizosphere, but the elements are temporally and spatially determined by multiple biogeochemical processes in soils as well as exudates from plant roots.  aPublisher supplied data  a41571305, 41977320cThe National Science Foundation of China  aKSF-A-20cKey Programme Special Fund of XJTLU 3apaddies 3apaddy soils 3arhizosphere 3arice1 aGustave, Williamson1 aAta-Ul-Karim, Syed Tahir1 aBridge, Jonathan1 aSekar, Raju1 aLiu, Fuyuan1 aChen, Zheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1184-36820 tPlant and soil.g2022 Feb., v. 471, no. 1-2 p.47-60dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-021-05100-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013700165300002000302500001900322520136000341592002801701596006801729650001101797650001901808650003201827650001401859650002401873650001301897650001701910651001101927651001001938651001001948651001701958700001401975700005601989700001402045773017002059856008302229852000902312655001202321IND60706991820221118042040.0200819e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070699182DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-09167-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Yinghua14aThe direct and indirect effects of democracy on carbon dioxide emissions in BRICS countries: evidence from panel quantile regression  ap. 33085-33102.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis paper illustrates the direct and indirect effects of democracy on CO₂ emissions in the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) from 1992 to 2018. In view of the distribution heterogeneity of CO₂ emissions, the panel quantile regression model is especially used to explore the nexus among different variables. Furthermore, in order to predict the trends of CO₂ emissions in different countries, we also estimate the kernel density function of CO₂ emissions in the BRICS countries by the quantile-fitted values. The results indicate that the direct impact of democracy on carbon dioxide emissions is significantly negative and great at high-emission countries. Although the indirect effect of democracy is positive in China and negative in Brazil and South Africa, the total effect of democracy on CO₂ emissions remains negative in all BRICS countries. The estimation of kernel density function shows that the distribution of CO₂ emissions in each country is gradually concentrated. Moreover, there is an environmental Kuznets curve depicting the linkage of urbanization and carbon dioxide emissions in Brazil and South Africa. These findings further highlight that the impact of democracy on high-emission and low-emission countries should be taken into account in policymaking to achieve sustainable developments.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019JJ40038cNatural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (CN) 3aRussia 3acarbon dioxide 3aenvironmental Kuznets curve 3apollution 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3aurbanization 3aBrazil 3aChina 3aIndia 3aSouth Africa1 aLiu, Lisi1 aZhu, Huiming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6384-72581 aTang, Rui0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Sept., v. 27, no. 26 p.33085-33102dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09167-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01681naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245009800164300001400262520073200276592002801008650001501036650001001051651001501061653001801076653001801094653001301112653002001125653001101145653001501156773009301171856008201264852000901346655001201355IND60479389420221120110123.0160121e20010601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047938942DNAL7 a10.1556/ComEc.2.2001.1.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDale, Mike B.10aFunctional synonyms and environmental homologues: an empirical approach to guild delimitation  ap. 67-79.  aThis paper presents a procedure for identifying guilds using species-in-stand data. Based on a linguistic analogy relating synonymity with functional equivalence, it develops a dissimilarity coefficient for clustering species which is suitable for measuring strength of synonymity. This coefficient combines two distinct aspects of synonymity - lack of co-occurrence of two species and similarity of context of other species where either species does occur. Synonymity is further restricted through a stand clustering to avoid confounding with environmental heterogeneity. The method is applied to data from Eucalyptus communities from sand dunes on North Stradbroke Island, Queensland.

From a conservation perspective, it is important to know whether tropical farmlands can buffer species loss caused by deforestation and how different functional groups of birds respond to land-use intensification. To test the degree of differentiation between farmland and forest bird communities across feeding guilds, we analyzed stable C and N isotopes in blood and claws of 101 bird species comprising four feeding guilds along a tropical forest-farmland gradient in Kenya. We additionally assessed the importance of farmland insectivores for pest control in C₄ crops by using allometric relationships, C stable isotope ratios and estimates of bird species abundance. Species composition differed strongly between forest and farmland bird communities. Across seasons, forest birds primarily relied on C₃ carbon sources, whereas many farmland birds also assimilated C₄ carbon. While C sources of frugivores and omnivores did not differ between forest and farmland communities, insectivores used more C₄ carbon in the farmland than in the forest. Granivores assimilated more C₄ carbon than all other guilds in the farmland. We estimated that insectivorous farmland birds consumed at least 1,000 kg pest invertebrates km⁻² year⁻¹. We conclude that tropical forest and farmland understory bird communities are strongly separated and that tropical farmlands cannot compensate forest loss for insectivorous forest understory birds. In tropical farmlands, insectivorous bird species provide a quantitatively important contribution to pest control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abirds 3ablood 3acarbon 3aclaws 3acrops 3adeforestation 3aforest communities 3ainsectivores 3ainvertebrates 3alandscapes 3aomnivores 3apest control 3apests 3aspecies diversity 3astable isotopes 3atropical forests 3atropics 3aunderstory 2aAgriculture 2aAnimals 2aBirds 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aDiet 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPest Control 2aSeasons 2aTrees 2aTropical Climate 3aKenya 0aKenya1 aBöhning-Gaese, Katrin1 aWilcke, Wolfgang1 aOelmann, Yvonne1 aSchleuning, Matthias0 tOecologia.g2013 Feb., v. 171, no. 2 p.473-486dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-012-2422-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03729naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245012400200500002000324520190600344592002802250596006702278596006702345596004802412596005602460596004402516650001902560650001702579650001502596650002402611650002002635650001102655650002502666650003202691650001502723700006002738700006802798700006102866700006502927700007202992773013503064856007503199852000903274655001203283IND60782237120221122230939.0220706e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078223712DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.135372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Diana I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5177-687810aEffect of moderate hydrostatic pressures on the enzymatic activity and bioactive composition of pineapple by‐products  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe application of abiotic stresses by moderate hydrostatic pressures (MHP) is still underdeveloped. Abiotic stresses allow activating the enzymatic complexes inducing the synthesis of de novo bioactive compounds. Pineapple by‐products are rich in bromelain and bioactive compounds that can be enhanced through abiotic stresses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of MHP on the enzymatic activity of pineapple by‐products. Pineapple by‐products were submitted to MHP (50–400 MPa between 1 and 15 min) according to a central composite factorial design matrix. Samples were stored at 5 ± 1°C for 24 hr, to allow enzymatic activity to occur. Enzymatic and antioxidant activities and total phenolic compounds (TPC) were quantified. MHP promoted a 262% increase in the phenylalanine ammonia‐lyase activity and 36% increase in TPC, in shell samples. In core the activity of bromelain increased 350%. These results pinpoint the potential to increase the value of pineapple by‐products by enhancing the amounts of bioactive compounds through MHP application. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Abiotic stresses can enhance enzyme activity, inducing the synthesis of bioactive compounds in living tissues. Hydrostatic pressure is an innovative nonthermal process that can be used to stabilize or increase enzymes' activity present in by‐products generated in the minimally processed fruit and vegetables industry. Moderate hydrostatic pressure (MHP) act as abiotic stress inducing de novo phenols synthesis and enhancing bromelain activity. After treatment, enriched material could be stabilized and then blended with foods and beverages to improve nutraceutical properties and help in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. The study demonstrates that MHP (150–250 MPa) applied to the pineapple core and pineapple shell produce a phenolic and bromelain rich product.  aPublisher supplied data  aSFRH/BD/109124/2015cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  aSFRH/BD/137036/2018cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  aUID/AGR/04129/2019cNational funding of FCT  aUID/BIO/04469/2019cCentro de Engenharia Biológica  aUID/QUI/00062/2019cQOPNA research Unit 3aabiotic stress 3aantioxidants 3abromelains 3adietary supplements 3aenzyme activity 3afruits 3ahydrostatic pressure 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3apineapples1 aPinto, Carlos A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5742-706X1 aCorrêa‐Filho, Luiz C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5405-37631 aSaraiva, Jorge A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5536-60561 aVicente, António A.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3593-88781 aMoldão‐Martins, Margarida1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0558-87150 tJournal of food process engineering.g2022 July, v. 45, no. 7 p.e13537-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.135373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03842naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001800188245017700206300001200383506007600395520188900471592002802360596011002388506003702498650002202535650002302557650003402580650002602614650001302640650002502653650001902678650001802697650001402715650001902729650002102748650001002769650001202779650001002791650002102801650001702822650001702839650002002856650002202876650001202898700001602910700001602926700001802942700009402960773013103054856008203185852000903267655001203276IND60601077120221207112013.0191108e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060107712DNAL7 a299731992pmid7 aPMC60308002pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-018-2269-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeem, Jungtae10aExploring the combination and modular characteristics of herbs for alopecia treatment in traditional Chinese medicine: an association rule mining and network analysis study  ap. 204.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Although alopecia affects the quality of life, its pathogenesis is unknown, because cellular interactions in the hair follicle are complex. Several authors have suggested using herbal medicine to treat alopecia, and bioinformatics and network pharmacology may constitute a new research strategy in this regard because herbal medicines contain various chemical components. This study used association rule mining (ARM) and network analysis to analyze the combinations of medicinal herbs used to treat alopecia. METHODS: We searched Chinese, Korean, and English databases for literature about alopecia treatment, extracting the names of each herbal prescription and herb. The meridian tropism and classification category of each herb were also investigated. Using ARM, we identified frequently combined two-herb and three-herb sets. Using network analysis, we divided the herbs into several modules according to prescription pattern. RESULTS: Fifty-six articles and 489 herbal medicines were included—312 internal and 177 external medicines. Among the 312 medicinal herbs used in internal medicine group, the most frequently combined two-herb set was Polygonum multiflorum Thunb. (何首烏) and Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Dlels (當歸). The most frequently used three-herb combination was Polygonum multiflorum Thunb., Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Dlels, and Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. (川芎). In network analysis, three modules were identified. The herbs of Module 1 were related to the liver and kidney meridians, and those of Module 3 were related to the Stomach meridian. CONCLUSIONS: We identified the frequency, characteristics, and functional modules of herb combinations frequently used in alopecia treatment. We confirmed the value of classical medicinal herb theory. This finding will prompt further bioinformatics and network pharmacology research on alopecia.  aPublisher supplied data  a(NRF-2017R1A1A1A05001218)ca National Research Foundation of Korea Grant, funded by the Korean Government0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAngelica sinensis 3aLigusticum sinense 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aReynoutria multiflora 3aalopecia 3aalternative medicine 3abioinformatics 3adata analysis 3adatabases 3ahair follicles 3aherbal medicines 3aherbs 3akidneys 3aliver 3amedicinal plants 3apathogenesis 3apharmacology 3aquality of life 3aresearch planning 3astomach1 aJung, Wonmo1 aKim, Yohwan1 aKim, Bonghyun1 aKim, Kyuseok1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3802-8717 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3802-87170 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2018 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.204-204dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-018-2269-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03756naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009900170300002000269500001900289520213500308592002802443650004402471650001502515650001502530650001402545650002002559650001102579650003702590650001902627650002602646650001902672650001302691650001102704650000702715650001402722650001302736650002302749650001402772650001602786700001602802700006802818700002102886700002302907700002102930700002502951773017002976856008303146852000903229655001203238IND60706992020221118042123.0200819e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070699202DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-09423-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Yii Shiuan10aAdsorption of Cu(II) and Ni(II) ions from wastewater onto bentonite and bentonite/GO composite  ap. 33270-33296.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTwo superior adsorbents, namely bentonite and graphene oxide (GO), were hybridised to study the removal of copper and nickel ions from synthetic and industrial wastewater. The as-synthesised GO, bentonite/GO and bentonite were characterised by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and N₂ adsorption-desorption analysis. The factors influencing the adsorption behaviours including contact time, initial solution pH, ionic strength, initial concentration of metal ions, temperature and adsorbent dosage were systematically investigated by batch equilibrium method. The adsorption equilibrium for copper and nickel onto bentonite was attained in 90 min while equilibrium was reached in 60 min on bentonite/GO. The adsorption of copper and nickel was pH-dependent in the range from pH 2 to pH 7 and from pH 2 to pH 8. Pseudo-first-order kinetic model excellently described the adsorption of copper and nickel onto bentonite and bentonite/GO. The equilibrium adsorption data was well described by the Langmuir isotherm model and the maximum adsorption capacity was 248.9 mg/g, 558.4 mg/g, 215.8 mg/g and 402.5 mg/g for bentonite-copper, bentonite/GO-copper, bentonite-nickel and bentonite/GO-nickel adsorption systems, respectively. The bentonite/GO composite exhibited a higher adsorption capacity of both cations from synthetic wastewater than pure bentonite owning to the synergistic effect between bentonite and GO. In all adsorption studies, copper was more efficiently removed than nickel due to its higher tendency to form bond with adsorbent surfaces. The adsorption of copper and nickel on bentonite/GO was mainly due to cation exchange, intermolecular and electrostatic interactions and physisorption dominated the adsorption processes. The practical application of bentonite/GO on adsorption of copper was investigated using real wastewater and its removal efficiency was beyond 98%. The excellent adsorption performances of composites for the copper and nickel removal from wastewater demonstrated its significant potential for pollution mitigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abentonite 3acation exchange 3acopper 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agraphene oxide 3aindustrial wastewater 3aionic strength 3akinetics 3anickel 3apH 3apollution 3aresearch 3asorption isotherms 3asynergism 3atemperature1 aAu, Pek Ing1 aMubarak, Nabisab Mujawar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7083-25211 aKhalid, Mohammad1 aJagadish, Priyanka1 aWalvekar, Rashmi1 aAbdullah, Ezzat Chan0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Sept., v. 27, no. 26 p.33270-33296dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09423-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03435naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012700170300001600297520165100313592002801964650001401992650001502006650001202021650001602033650001902049650002202068650002302090650001702113650001402130650002402144650002302168650001502191650001902206650001702225650002002242650001902262650001302281650000902294650001502303650001902318650001902337650002502356650003302381650001302414653002302427653002802450653002802478653002402506653002802530653003602558700002502594700001802619773010102637856008602738852000902824655001202833IND60567148420221120184340.0170710e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056714842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.09.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNhien, Le Cao10aNovel heat–integrated and intensified biorefinery process for cellulosic ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass  ap. 367-377.  aBiofuels have the most potential as an alternative to fossil fuels and overcoming global warming, which has become one of the most serious environmental issues over the past few decades. As the world confronts food shortages due to an increase in world population, the development of biofuels from inedible lignocellulosic feedstock may be more sustainable in the long term. Inspired by the NREL conventional process, this paper proposes a novel heat–integrated and intensified biorefinery design for cellulosic ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass. For the preconcentration section, heat pump assisted distillation and double–effect heat integration were evaluated, while a combination of heat–integrated technique and intensified technique, extractive dividing wall column (EDWC), was applied to enhance the process energy and cost efficiency for the purification section. A biosolvent, glycerol, which can be produced from biodiesel production, was used as the extracting solvent in an EDWC to obtain a high degree of integration in a biorefinery context. All configuration alternatives were simulated rigorously using Aspen Plus were based on the energy requirements, total annual costs (TAC), and total carbon dioxide emissions (TCE). In addition, the structure of the EDWC was optimized using the reliable response surface method, which was carried out using Minitab statistical software. The simulation results showed that the proposed heat–integrated and intensified process can save up to 47.6% and 56.9% of the TAC and TCE for the purification section, respectively, compared to the conventional purification process.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3abioethanol 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3acarbon dioxide 3acomputer software 3acost effectiveness 3adistillation 3aemissions 3aenergy requirements 3aethanol production 3afeedstocks 3afood shortages 3afossil fuels 3afuel production 3aglobal warming 3aglycerol 3aheat 3aheat pumps 3alignocellulose 3aprocess energy 3apurification methods 3aresponse surface methodology 3asolvents 0aCellulosic ethanol 0aBiorefinery development 0aLignocellulosic biomass 0aProcess integration 0aProcess intensification 0aExtractive dividing wall column1 aLong, Nguyen Van Duc1 aLee, Moonyong0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2017 June 01, v. 141 p.367-377dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.09.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01607naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245009300155520074100248592002800989650002401017650001101041650001701052650004301069700001901112773012701131856007401258852000901332655001201341IND60652361820221118021917.0190712e20180719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065236182DNAL7 a10.3390/su100725392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Bomi10aDynamic Capability of the Firm as Driver of Green Supply Chain Management Implementation  aEco friendly management has received attention from business as an important competitive source. Thus, an emerging body of studies is interested in the implementation of green supply chain management (GSCM). Previous research in this field has acknowledged the importance of GSCM. However, the capability that enables a firm to successfully adopt GSCM is not well researched. This study empirically examines dynamic capability as an antecedent of GSCM, with the aim of proposing a causal relationship between dynamic capability and GSCM. The result of this study shows that implementing GSCM with dynamic capability enables a firm to achieve successful GSCM practices, and that this in turn leads to enhanced organizational performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness management 3amodels 3asupply chain 3asustainability science and engineering1 aChoi, Donghyun0 tSustainability.g2018 July 19, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100725393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03446naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245009000178300001600268520193000284592002802214650001902242650001902261650002302280650001502303650002502318650001402343650003502357650001102392650001502403650001202418650001302430650001502443650002402458650001802482650002202500650001802522651001202540653000802552653002902560653002902589653001802618700002202636700002302658700002102681700002202702773010702724856008802831852000902919655001202928IND60525818920221121053026.0190319e20161024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052581892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanal-Vergés, Paula10aValidating GIS tool to assess eelgrass potential recovery in the Limfjorden (Denmark)  ap. 135-148.  aEelgrass is a key indicator for the water quality in Europe (WFD, European Union, 2000). However, although water quality has been improved in most Danish water bodies, the eelgrass population does not seem to be recovering. In this study, we validate and further develop a GIS tool designed by Flindt et al. (2016), to evaluate the potential of eelgrass reestablishment in Danish waters. The GIS tool was tested in two large broads of the Limfjorden, Løgstør and Lovns broad (Denmark), where two scenarios are run. The first scenario was set up including modelled data, whereas the second scenario included both monitored and modelled data. All scenarios were validated with monitored data collected over a 5 years period in the two broads. The developed GIS tool highlights areas with eelgrass potential, both for vegetative growth and sexual reproduction, in accordance with those found in situ in the period 2009⿿2013, in the two investigated broads. A combination of modelled and monitored data was found to be optimal to achieve accurate predictions for eelgrass development in the Limfjorden using this GIS tool. In order to implement the current model or to use this GIS tool in other locations, it is needed to have detailed knowledge of the area in focus, especially on the controlling ecosystem parameters and pressures. This eelgrass GIS tool is been proven to be especially beneficial as site selection tool for marine spatial planning e.g. in relation to the implementation of the WFD and the ICZM directives (WFD, ICZM), to help assessing anthropogenic/targeted environmental impacts e.g. assessing mussel fisheries impacts and is as well a powerful tool to optimize monitoring cost efficiency. Finally, the described GIS tool, originally set for Odense fjord (Denmark) by Flindt et al. (2016), has been validated with data from Limfjorden, corroborating the efficiency of the studied tool in Danish waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aZostera marina 3acost effectiveness 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3afisheries 3ageographic information systems 3amodels 3amonitoring 3amussels 3aplanning 3aprediction 3asexual reproduction 3asurface water 3avegetative growth 3awater quality 3aDenmark 0aGIS 0aEelgrass reestablishment 0aEnvironmental conditions 0aWater quality1 aPetersen, Jens K.1 aRasmussen, Erik K.1 aErichsen, Anders1 aFlindt, Mogens R.0 tEcological modelling.g2016 Oct. 24, v. 338 p.135-148dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245016600166300001600332520112500348592002801473650001601501650002101517650002201538650001301560650002701573650001901600650001701619650001601636650001001652650001201662650001601674650002601690700002501716700002201741700002001763700002301783700002001806700001901826773011201845856004801957852000902005655001202014IND4482948420221120101051.0121003e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448294842DNAL7 a10.1134/S00036838120400602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGulevich, A.

It was revealed that when the basic pathways of acetic and lactic acid formation are inactivated due to deletions of the ackA, pta, poxB, and ldhA genes, the efficiency of butyryl-CoA biosynthesis and its reduced product, i.e., 1-butanol, by two types of recombinant stains is comparable. The limiting factor for 1-butanol production by the obtained strains is the low substrate specificity of the basic CoA-dependent alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase AdhE from E. coli to butyryl-CoA. It was concluded that, in order to construct an efficient 1-butanol producer based on a model strain synthesizing butyryl-CoA as a result of reversed action of fatty acid Î²-oxidation enzymes, it is necessary to provide intensive formation of acetyl-CoA and enhanced activity of alternative alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases in the cells of a strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium 3aEscherichia coli 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3aalcohols 3aaldehyde dehydrogenase 3abeta oxidation 3abiosynthesis 3afatty acids 3agenes 3aglucose 3alactic acid 3asubstrate specificity1 aSkorokhodova, A.

Further, mosses host nitrogen (N₂)-fixing bacteria that have been shown to contribute a large part of ‘new‘ N in pristine ecosystems. This study aimed to assess direct and indirect effects of warming on moss-associated N₂ fixation. METHODS: We assessed how N₂ fixation activity at ecosystem- and at moss species-level is affected by direct (warming) and indirect (vegetation shift) climate change using two long-term field manipulation experiments in a subarctic birch forest combined with mesocosm studies from a close-by heath. We linked the abundance of ground covering mosses to N₂ fixation activity and assessed the temperature sensitivity of N₂ fixation in two common feather mosses, Hylocomium splendens and Pleurozium schreberi. RESULTS: Our study shows a steep decline in moss ground cover as well as in associated N₂ fixation in response to 10 years of manipulated field-warming, whereas a shift in dominant shrub species did not impact moss cover or N₂ fixation activity. Interestingly, the moss H. splendens was more sensitive than P. schreberi to warming both in terms of cover and N₂ fixation activity. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that warming affects moss-associated N₂ fixation activity negatively - both indirectly via a decline in moss cover and directly by reducing N₂ fixation activity. This suggests lower N input via moss-associated N₂ fixation in a future climate, which will consequently affect nutrient turnover and ecosystem productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3aHylocomium splendens 3aPleurozium schreberi 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aforests 3amosses and liverworts 3anitrogen fixation 3aplant communities 3ashrubs 3asoil 3atemperature1 aMichelsen, Anders1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9541-86581 aRousk, Kathrin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3140-98640 tPlant and soil.g2022 Feb., v. 471, no. 1-2 p.343-358dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-021-05245-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03485naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245016500171300001600336520182900352592002802181650002102209650002402230650002402254650002402278650003202302650001202334650002302346650001202369650001102381650001102392650001802403650001102421650001802432650002102450650001002471650001402481653002002495653003402515653001802549653002202567653002402589700002202613700002302635700002602658700002302684700002002707700002002727773010102747856008602848852000902934655001202943IND60567148520221120184432.0170710e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056714852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.09.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanke, Leandro10aImproving anaerobic digestion of sugarcane straw for methane production: Combined benefits of mechanical and sodium hydroxide pretreatment for process designing  ap. 378-389.  aSodium hydroxide (NaOH) as an alkaline pretreatment method to enhance the degradation kinetics of sugarcane straw (SCS) for methane production was investigated with a special focus on the benefits for designing the anaerobic digestion process. For that, SCS was previously homogenized by milling in 2mm particle size and pretreated in NaOH solutions at various concentrations (0, 3, 6 and 12gNaOH/100gSCS) and the methane yields were determined in biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests. The obtained experimental data were used to simulate a large-scale semi-continuous process (100tonSCSday−1) according to a first-order reaction model and the main economic indicators were calculated based on cash flows of each pretreatment condition. The BMP tests showed that by increasing the NaOH concentration the conversion of the fibrous fraction of the substrate to methane was not only accelerated (higher α value), but also increased by 11.9% (from 260 to 291mLCH4gVS−1). By using the experimental data to simulate the large-scale process these benefits were translated to a reduction of up to 58% in the size of the anaerobic reactor (and consequently in electricity consumption for stirring), while the methane yield increased up to 28%, if the liquid fraction derived from the pretreatment process is also used for methane production. Although the use of NaOH for substrate pretreatment has considerably increased the operational expenditures (from 0.97 up to 1.97€×106year−1), the pretreatment method was able to increase the profitability of methane production from SCS since a sensitivity analysis by varying the prices of anaerobic reactor, methane and NaOH showed a less attractive payback, net present value and internal rate of return for the control condition (0gNaOH/100gSCS) in all analyzed scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkali treatment 3aanaerobic digesters 3aanaerobic digestion 3aeconomic indicators 3aelectric energy consumption 3amethane 3amethane production 3amilling 3amixing 3amodels 3aparticle size 3aprices 3aprofitability 3asodium hydroxide 3astraw 3asugarcane 0aSugarcane straw 0aSodium hydroxide pretreatment 0aMethane yield 0aProcess designing 0aEconomic assessment1 aWeinrich, Sören,1 aLeite, Athaydes F.1 aTerzariol, Filippi K.1 aNikolausz, Marcell1 aNelles, Michael1 aStinner, Walter0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2017 June 01, v. 141 p.378-389dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.09.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245012900177300001800306520107500324592002801399650001801427650001401445650002801459650001801487650002001505650001401525650001501539650002301554650001301577650000901590650001401599650002601613650002101639650002801660650002501688650001701713700002701730700002101757700003101778700002701809700003301836700001701869700003501886700002901921700002701950700002601977700003902003700003802042700007002080700003702150700003502187700007602222700007702298700002602375773017402401856008402575852000902659655001202668IND60676941020200406000000.0191122e20191111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067694102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b005232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurço, Aimée Obolari10ad-Limonene Ameliorates Myocardial Infarction Injury by Reducing Reactive Oxygen Species and Cell Apoptosis in a Murine Model  ap. 3010-3019.  aMyocardial infarction (MI) leads to high mortality, and pharmacological or percutaneous primary interventions do not significantly inhibit ischemia/reperfusion injuries, particularly those caused by oxidative stress. Recently, research groups have evaluated several naturally occurring antioxidant compounds for possible use as therapeutic alternatives to traditional treatments. Studies have demonstrated that d-limonene (DL), a monoterpene of citrus fruits, possesses antioxidant and cardiovascular properties. Thus, this work sought to elucidate the mechanisms of protection of DL in an isoproterenol-induced murine MI model. It was observed that DL (10 μmol) attenuated 40% of the ST elevation, reduced the infarct area, prevented histological alterations, abolished completely oxidative stress damage, restored superoxide dismutase activity, and suppressed pro-apoptotic enzymes. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that DL produces cardioprotective effects from isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in Swiss mice through suppression of apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3acardioprotective effect 3acitrus fruits 3aenzyme activity 3ahistology 3ainfarction 3alaboratory animals 3alimonene 3amice 3amortality 3amyocardial infarction 3aoxidative stress 3areactive oxygen species 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atherapeutics1 ade Souza, Diego Santos1 aHeimfarth, Luana1 aMiguel-dos-Santos, Rodrigo1 aRabelo, Thallita Kelly1 aOliveira Barreto, Tatiane de1 aRhana, Paula1 aSantos Santana, Michael Nadson1 aBraga, Weslley Fernandes1 aSantos Cruz, Jader dos1 aLauton-Santos, Sandra1 aSantana-Filho, Valter Joviniano de1 aBarreto, Rosana de Souza Siqueira1 aGuimarães, Adriana Gibara1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1643-56421 aAlvarez-Leite, Jacqueline Isaura1 aQuintans Junior, Lucindo Jose,1 aVasconcelos, Carla Maria Lins de1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7197-02611 aSantos, Márcio Roberto Viana dos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9458-03701 aBarreto, André Sales0 tJournal of natural products.g2019 Nov. 11, v. 82, no. 11 p.3010-3019dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b005233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03066naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011600166300001800282520153300300592002801833650002301861650000901884650001101893650001301904650001301917650001201930650001901942650001301961650001101974650001101985650002301996650001302019650001502032650001102047650002702058650001002085653002502095653003202120653002602152653001802178700001602196700002102212700002402233700002002257700001702277700002602294773012402320856008302444852000902527655001202536IND60750815120221120061914.0220214e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075081512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.09.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrajwal, B.P.10aRe-entrant transition as a bridge of broken ergodicity in confined monolayers of hexagonal prisms and cylinders  ap. 1478-1490.  aThe entropy-driven monolayer assembly of hexagonal prisms and cylinders was studied under hard slit confinement. At the conditions investigated, the particles have two distinct and dynamically disconnected rotational states: unflipped and flipped, depending on whether their circular/hexagonal face is parallel or perpendicular to the wall plane. Importantly, these two rotational states cast distinct projection areas over the wall plane that favor either hexagonal or tetragonal packing. Monte Carlo simulations revealed a re-entrant melting transition where an intervening disordered Flipped-Unflipped (FUN) phase is sandwiched between a fourfold tetratic phase at high concentrations and a sixfold triangular solid at intermediate concentrations. The FUN phase contains a mixture of flipped and unflipped particles and is translationally and orientationally disordered. Complementary experiments were conducted with photolithographically fabricated cylindrical microparticles confined in a wedge cell. Both simulations and experiments show the formation of phases with comparable fraction of flipped particles and structure, i.e., the FUN phase, triangular solid, and tetratic phase, indicating that both approaches sample analogous basins of particle-orientation phase-space. The phase behavior of hexagonal prisms in a soft-repulsive wall model was also investigated to exemplify how tunable particle–wall interactions can provide an experimentally viable strategy to dynamically bridge the flipped and unflipped states.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aarea 3abasins 3acolloids 3ajournals 3amelting 3amicroparticles 3amixtures 3amodels 3aprisms 3arotational molding 3asampling 3asandwiches 3asolids 3atranslation (genetics) 3awalls 0aAnisotropic colloids 0aRe-entrant phase transition 0aMonolayer confinement 0aSelf-assembly1 aHuang, Ray,1 aRamaswamy, Meera1 aStroock, Abraham D.1 aHanrath, Tobias1 aKohen, Itai,1 aEscobedo, Fernando A.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Feb., v. 607 p.1478-1490dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.09.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013100168300001800299520156500317536008501882592002801967596001701995650002702012650001302039650001502052650001402067650002102081650001102102650000902113650001002122650000902132650001402141650001402155650001502169650001902184650001202203650001102215653002902226653002002255653003202275653001502307653002202322700001802344773014802362856008602510852000902596655001202605IND60751362520221120085452.0220323e20211113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075136252DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2021.19281732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouri, Bubak10aEfficiency of Sulfur-Bentonite Granules to Improve Uptake of Nutrient Elements by the Crop Plant Cultivated in Calcareous Soil  ap. 2414-2430.  aNutrient deficiencies in calcareous soils are mostly related to high soil pH whereas sulfur supplement could facilitate nutrient element uptake by the crop plants. However, inefficient sulfur oxidation in soils is a limiting factor for this response. Mixing elemental sulfur with bentonite mineral can increase oxidation of sulfur since bentonite provides the sulfur particles with a better dispersion condition following absorption of water. Purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of sulfur-bentonite granules with various proportions of bentonite to improve nutrient element uptake by the crop plants cultivated in calcareous soil. Four treatments of the sulfur-bentonite granules having 10, 20, 30 and 40 percentages of bentonite compared to the controls with no granules were applied to maize crop plants (Zea mays L.) cultivated in pots filled with an inoculated calcareous soil using Thiobacillus thioparus. At the end of the 80 days growth period; the results revealed significant soil pH decrease and growth parameters improvement with increasing bentonite proportion of the granules among the treated pots. Anyway, it appeared that a bentonite proportion of more than 30% in the granules can reverse improving trend of growth parameters in the cultivated plant. It was also confirmed that efficiency of the sulfur-bentonite granules is mostly contributed to increasing uptake of micro-nutrients of iron, manganese and copper alongside macro-nutrients of sulfur and phosphorus by the crop plants cultivated in the studied calcareous soil.  aThis study was funded by Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) (No. 96005184).  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 96005184 3aThiobacillus thioparus 3aZea mays 3aabsorption 3abentonite 3acalcareous soils 3acopper 3acorn 3acrops 3airon 3amanganese 3aoxidation 3aphosphorus 3aplant analysis 3asoil pH 3asulfur 0aSulfur-Bentonite Granule 0aCalcareous soil 0auptake of nutrient elements 0acrop plant 0agrowth parameters1 aSayadi, Zahra0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2021 Nov. 13, v. 52, no. 20 p.2414-2430dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2021.19281733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01676naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007000167300001800237520054000255592002800795650001300823650001200836650001400848650002300862650002300885650001300908650001400921650001300935653001400948653001200962653001300974653002300987653001401010700002501024700002401049773011201073856008401185852000901269655001201278IND60599506920221118104329.0180702e20140806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059950692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.06.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFew, Chip S.10aMagtrieve™: a convenient catalyst for the oxidation of alcohols  ap. 4452-4454.  aWe find that Magtrieve™ (CrO2) catalyzes the oxidation of a wide variety of alcohols with periodic acid as the terminal oxidant.

Rice plants grown under field production conditions are frequently infected with types of pathogenic fungi that produce toxic metabolites (mycotoxins). Paddy (seeds) rice from healthy plants in the field was collected and stored on a farm under humid, poorly ventilated conditions. Samples were milled into four fractions (hulls, brown rice, bran and white rice) and analysed for aflatoxins (B₁, B₂, G₁ and G₂) using a validated method. Rice fractions from healthy plants, which contained low levels of aflatoxins (less than 1 µg kg⁻¹), were used to determine the efficiency of the extraction method. Seeds stored under poor conditions were found to be contaminated with aflatoxins B₁ and B₂ as were the fractions. The sums of AFB₁ and AFB₂ in stored paddy rice, hulls, brown rice, bran and white rice were 141, 39, 158, 367 and 56 µg kg⁻¹, respectively. The ratio of aflatoxin B₁ and B₂ was about 10 : 1. AFG₁ and AFG₂ were less than 1 µg kg⁻¹. Thus, brown rice contained 92.9% of the aflatoxins in paddy rice, whereas white rice contained only 27.9%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaflatoxin B1 3abran 3abrown rice 3afarms 3afungi 3ahulls 3ametabolites 3amilling fractions 3apaddies 3aseeds 3ashelling 3atoxicity 2aAflatoxinsxanalysis 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aOryzaxchemistry. 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 0aHPLC 0aaflatoxins 0amycotoxins 0anatural toxicants 0arice 0acereals1 aAbbas, H.K.1 aWeaver, C.M.1 aShier, W.T.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2011 Aug. 1, v. 28, no. 8 p.1076-1082dTaylor & Francis Groupx1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2011.576441  aDNAL 7aarticle01101naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094024001900140024002400159040001800183100002000201245002600221300001200247506007600259520012100335592002800456506003700484650001100521650001300532650001300545651001400558700002100572773010300593856007000696852000900766655001200775IND50088885420221207084227.0170725e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008888542DNAL7 aPMC4053725 [Available on 04/14/15]2pmcid7 a250010452pmid7 a10.1186/gb41712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHickey, Peter F10aGenomics by the beach  ap. 304.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA report on the 35th Annual Lorne Genome Conference 2014 held in Lorne, Victoria, Australia, February 16–18, 2014.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenome 3agenomics 2aGenomics 3aAustralia1 aRobinson, Mark D0 tGenome biology.g2014 Apr., v. 15, no. 4 p.304-304dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb41713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003400150245014200184300001600326520129700342592002801639650002201667650001801689650001201707650001601719650000901735650001101744650001301755650001701768650001401785650001601799650002301815650002101838650002101859651001001880653001601890653001301906653000901919653002701928653002601955653003101981700003002012700002302042700002002065700002102085700002002106773009502126856008502221852000902306655001202315IND60582534520221122061904.0180831e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058253452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2017.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartín-Lara, María Ángeles10aKinetics of thermal decomposition of some biomasses in an inert environment. An investigation of the effect of lead loaded by biosorption  ap. 101-113.  aThe thermal behavior of some types of raw and lead-polluted biomasses typical in south Spain was studied by non-isothermal thermogravimetry. Experiments were carried out in nitrogen atmosphere at three heating rates (5, 10 and 20°C/min). The results of thermogravimetric tests carried out proved that the presence of lead did not change the main degradation pathways of selected biomass (almond shell (AS) and olive pomace (OP)). However, from a point of view of mass loss, lead-polluted samples showed higher decomposition temperatures and decomposition at higher rate. The determination of activation energies was performed by isoconversional methods of Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO), Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS) and Friedman (FR). In general, lead-polluted samples showed lower activation energies than raw ones. Then, Coast-Redfern method was applied to determine kinetic function. The kinetic function that seems to determine the mechanism of thermal degradation of main components of all samples was nth order reaction. Finally, a model based on three parallel reactions (for three pseudocomponents) that fit to nth order reactions was evaluated. This model was appropriate to predict the pyrolysis behavior of the raw and lead-polluted samples in all pyrolysis conditions studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aalmond shells 3abiomass 3abiosorption 3alead 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aolive pomace 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry 3awaste management 3aSpain 0aBiosorption 0aKinetics 0aLead 0aMetal-polluted biomass 0aThermal decomposition 0aThermogravimetric analysis1 aIáñez-Rodríguez, Irene1 aBlázquez, Gabriel1 aQuesada, Lucia,1 aPérez, Antonio,1 aCalero, Mónica0 tWaste management.g2017 Dec., v. 70 p.101-113dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.09.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011200171300001600283520116700299592002801466650002601494650001201520650001301532650001501545650003101560650001401591650001501605650001601620650001701636653002101653653001401674653001201688653001201700700001401712700002001726700001501746773010101761856008601862852000901948655001201957IND60567148720221120184345.0170710e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056714872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shuping10aEffects of wet torrefaction on the physicochemical properties and pyrolysis product properties of rice husk  ap. 403-409.  aWet torrefaction in the temperature range from 150 to 240°C for 60min was applied on rice husk sample prior to pyrolysis process in this work. Its effects on the physicochemical properties and pyrolysis product properties were evaluated. The analysis results of physicochemical properties of raw and pretreated samples indicated that wet torrefaction not only improved the fuel characteristics but also removed a large amount of alkali and alkaline earth metal species with the dual advantages of dry torrefaction and demineralisation. On the basis of pyrolysis experiment results, it was found that wet torrefaction at the mild reaction condition had a positive impact on bio-oil production, but more severe wet torrefaction condition was not reasonable. The highest relative content of levoglucosan (57.2%) was obtained from pyrolysis of rice husk sample after wet torrefaction at 210°C, which was about 6.2 times higher than that of raw rice husk. The results of biochar analysis suggested that biochar produced from sample after wet torrefaction and pyrolysis seems not a desirable solid fuel, it can be used as the feedstock for preparation of nanosilica.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline earth metals 3abiochar 3abiofuels 3afeedstocks 3aphysicochemical properties 3apyrolysis 3arice hulls 3atemperature 3atorrefaction 0aWet torrefaction 0aPyrolysis 0aBio-oil 0aBiochar1 aChen, Tao1 aXiong, Yuanquan1 aDong, Qing0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2017 June 01, v. 141 p.403-409dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245014200171300001400313520095800327592002801285650001201313650001501325650002701340650001001367650001501377650001101392650001901403650001401422650002101436650001601457650001801473651001001491653001901501653001801520653001601538653002401554700001801578700001701596700005501613773010601668856008801774852000901862655001201871IND60525819220221120215010.0190319e20160910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052581922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Zhiguang10aSimulation of a water ecosystem in a landscape lake in Tianjin with AQUATOX: Sensitivity, calibration, validation and ecosystem prognosis  ap. 54-63.  aThe parameters involved in AQUATOX of the relatively large lakes do not have widespread applicability in landscape lakes.

The results from calibration and validation have revealed that the AQUATOX model did a good simulating for SH. Furthermore, the AQUATOX provided necessary information for management of SH.

They can also provide management decision support under current conditions. A drawback of existing grass models is that they do not take into account the effect of winter stresses, limiting their use for full-year simulations in areas where winter survival is a key factor for yield security. Here, we present a novel full-year PBM for grassland named BASGRA. It was developed by combining the LINGRA grassland model (Van Oijen et al., 2005a) with models for cold hardening and soil physical winter processes. We present the model and show how it was parameterized for timothy (Phleum pratense L.), the most important forage grass in Scandinavia and parts of North America and Asia. Uniquely, BASGRA simulates the processes taking place in the sward during the transition from summer to winter, including growth cessation and gradual cold hardening, and functions for simulating plant injury due to low temperatures, snow and ice affecting regrowth in spring. For the calibration, we used detailed data from five different locations in Norway, covering a wide range of agroclimatic regions, day lengths (latitudes from 59° to 70°N) and soil conditions. The total dataset included 11 variables, notably above-ground dry matter, leaf area index, tiller density, content of C reserves, and frost tolerance. All data were used in the calibration. When BASGRA was run with the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) parameter vector from the single, Bayesian calibration, nearly all measured variables were simulated to an overall normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE)<0.5. For many site×experiment combinations, NRMSE was <0.3. The temporal dynamics were captured well for most variables, as evaluated by comparing simulated time courses versus data for the individual sites. The results may suggest that BASGRA is a reasonably robust model, allowing for simulation of growth and several important underlying processes with acceptable accuracy for a range of agroclimatic conditions. However, the robustness of the model needs to be tested further using independent data from a wide range of growing conditions. Finally we show an example of application of the model, comparing overwintering risks in two climatically different sites, and discuss future model applications. Further development work should include improved simulation of the dynamics of C reserves, and validation of winter tiller dynamics against independent data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhleum pratense 3aagroclimatology 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3afarmers 3aforage grasses 3afrost resistance 3agrasslands 3aice 3alatitude 3aleaf area index 3amodels 3aoverwintering 3aplant breeders 3aplant damage 3aregrowth 3arisk 3aroads 3asnow 3asoil 3aspring 3asummer 3asward 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3aAsia 3aNorth America 3aNorway 3aScandinavia 0aCold hardening 0aFrost injury 0aPhleum pratense L. 0aProcess-based modelling 0aWinter survival 0aYield1 aVan Oijen, Marcel1 aCameron, David1 aPersson, Tomas0 tEcological modelling.g2016 Sept. 10, v. 335 p.1-15dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03460naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245007500173300002000248520236600268592002802634650002002662650000902682650001002691650002302701650001802724650003102742650001702773650001202790650002502802650002502827700001902852700002202871773010702893856008903000852000903089655001203098IND60586055520221120160855.0171116e20171116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058605552DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b011312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeiga, H.

B.10aWax Deposit Thermal Conductivity Measurements under Flowing Conditions  ap. 11532-11547.  aThermal conductivities of wax deposits formed on the cooled wall of a channel were measured under flowing conditions, for different values of the Reynolds number (Re) in laminar flow. To this end, a laboratory-scale experiment was especially designed, employing a rectangular channel flow loop. The thermal conductivities were directly measured for steady-state conditions in deposits formed after 7 h of deposition. The cooled wall on which the deposits were formed was equipped with embedded heat flux and thermocouple sensors. A micrometer-driven temperature probe of small dimensions was installed at the opposite channel wall and could be traversed across the channel, yielding the temperature profile of the deposited wax layer, as well as the liquid/deposit interface temperature. Deposit compositions were obtained by high-temperature gas chromatography. Thickness-averaged deposit thermal conductivities were obtained from the deposit thickness, heat flux, and interface-to-wall temperature measurements. The thermal conductivity results obtained for these well consolidate deposits did not display any sensitivity to the Re values tested, although the deposit wax content was seen to increase with Re. This finding was related to the nonhomogeneous character of the thick deposits studied. Temperature profiles within the wax deposit measured with the traversing temperature probe revealed small deviations from the linear profile expected for a one-dimensional, steady-state solution, considering a constant value for the thermal conductivity across an homogeneous deposit. These deviations were attributed to transverse variations of the deposit thermal conductivity. Local values of the thermal conductivity across the deposit were measured, revealing higher values closer to the deposit/liquid interface region, compared to those observed in the near-wall region. This variation was associated with the higher liquid fraction present in the deposit near the cold wall. The sensitive of the deposit thermal conductivity to the deposit liquid fraction was used as the basis for a novel technique developed to estimate the liquid and solid fraction distribution across the deposit. The technique was able to capture the increase in liquid fraction close to the cold wall, compared to the near-interface region, for the experimental conditions tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3acold 3afuels 3agas chromatography 3aheat transfer 3alaboratory experimentation 3alaminar flow 3aliquids 3atemperature profiles 3athermal conductivity1 aFleming, F.

Here, we describe an atom catalyst (AC) with atomically dispersed zerovalent molybdenum atoms on graphdiyne (Mo⁰/GDY) with a high mass content of Mo atoms (up to 7.5 wt %) that was synthesized via a facile and scalable process. The catalyst shows both excellent selectivity and activity in the electrochemical reduction of nitrogen and in the hydrogen evolution reaction in aqueous solutions at room temperature and pressure. It is noted that this catalyst is the first bifunctional AC for highly efficient and selective ammonia and hydrogen generation. The catalytic process of our catalyst is well understood, the structure is defined, and the performance is excellent, providing a solid foundation for the generation and application of the new generation of catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aammonia 3aaqueous solutions 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amolybdenum 3anitrogen1 aXue, Yurui1 aYu, Huidi1 aLiu, Yuxin1 aFang, Yan1 aXing, Chengyu1 aHuang, Bolong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2526-20021 aLi, Yuliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5279-03990 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 May 31, v. 141, no. 27 p.10677-10683dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b030043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245015800168300001800326520142100344592002801765650001901793650002101812650000701833650001401840650001101854650001601865650001901881653002501900653001801925653003301943653003201976653003102008700002702039700001702066700002102083700002002104700002002124773012402144856008302268852000902351655001202360IND60750815420221120061930.0220214e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075081542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.09.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHidayat, Miftah10aZeta potential of CO2-rich aqueous solutions in contact with intact sandstone sample at temperatures of 23 °C and 40 °C and pressures up to 10.0 MPa  ap. 1226-1238.  aDespite the broad range of interest and applications, controls on the electric surface charge and the zeta potential of silica in contact with aqueous solutions saturated with dissolved CO₂ at conditions relevant to natural systems, remains unreported. There have been no published zeta potential measurements conducted in such systems at equilibrium, hence the effect of composition, pH, temperature and pressure remains unknown. We describe a novel methodology developed for the streaming potential measurements under these conditions, and report zeta potential values for the first time obtained with Fontainebleau sandstone core sample saturated with carbonated NaCl, Na₂SO₄, CaCl₂ and MgCl₂ solutions under equilibrium conditions at pressures up to 10 MPa and temperatures up to 40 °C. The results demonstrate that pH of solutions is the only control on the zeta potential, while temperature, CO₂ pressure and salt type affect pH values. We report three empirical relationships that describe the pH dependence of the zeta potential for: i) dead (partial CO₂ pressure of 10⁻³.⁴⁴ atm) NaCl/Na₂SO₄, ii) dead CaCl₂/MgCl₂ solutions, and iii) for all live (fully saturated with dissolved CO₂) solutions. The proposed new relationships provide essential insights into interfacial electrochemical properties of silica-water systems at conditions relevant to CO₂ geological storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectrochemistry 3apH 3asandstone 3asilica 3atemperature 3azeta potential 0aElevated temperature 0aHigh pressure 0aSupercritical CO2 conditions 0aCarbonated aqueous solution 0aStreaming potential method1 aSarmadivaleh, Mohammad1 aDerksen, Jos1 aVega-Maza, David1 aIglauer, Stefan1 aVinogradov, Jan0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Feb., v. 607 p.1226-1238dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.09.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001500156245013900171300001400310520120000324592002801524650001801552650001501570650002501585650001601610650001901626650001501645650001301660650001401673650001701687650001701704650001801721650002701739650002801766650002601794650000901820650002501829650002701854650001701881650001001898650002001908650001101928650002601939650003701965650002402002650003402026650002402060650001802084650001902102650002802121700002902149700002302178773013002201856004002331852000902371655001202380IND4468667520221122005927.0120727e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446866752DNAL7 a221311872pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.45802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoh, Eunmi10aEffects of industrial tomato paste processing on ascorbic acid, flavonoids and carotenoids and their stability over one‐year storage  ap. 23-28.  aBACKGROUND: The effects of industrial tomato paste processing and long‐term (12 months) ambient storage on the content and stability of quercetin, kaempferol, ascorbic acid (AA), dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA), β‐carotene and lycopene were evaluated in a commercially produced tomato paste. RESULTS: The initial thermal treatment (hot break; 93 °C for 5 min) resulted in significant reductions in quercetin (54%), kaempferol (61%), AA (63%) and β‐carotene (30%), whereas subsequent processing steps (e.g. evaporation and sterilization) did not result in marked changes in these compounds. Lycopene was stable during hot break but decreased by 20% through evaporation and sterilization. The ratio of DHAA:vitamin C increased during hot break to 23%, whereas the ratio of DHAA:vitamin C remained relatively low in subsequent processing steps, indicating that AA was not oxidized. AA decreased with prolonged storage, with only 13% remaining at 12 months. The carotenoids and quercetin remained stable through 12 months of ambient storage. CONCLUSIONS: Tomato pomace contained significant amounts of carotenoids and flavonoids, indicating that it may be an underutilized processing byproduct.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3abyproducts 3adehydroascorbic acid 3aevaporation 3aheat treatment 3akaempferol 3alycopene 3aquercetin 3astorage time 3atomato paste 3atomato pomace 2aAntioxidantsxanalysis 2aAscorbic Acidxanalysis 2aCarotenoidsxanalysis 2aDiet 2aFlavonoidsxanalysis 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Storage 2aFruit 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aKaempferolsxanalysis 2aSolanum lycopersicumxchemistry. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPlant Preparationsxchemistry 2aQuercetinxanalysis 2aSterilization 2aVolatilization 2abeta Carotenexanalysis1 aCharoenprasert, Suthawan1 aMitchell, Alyson E0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 92, no. 1 p.23-28dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.4580  aDNAL 7aarticle01843naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013300170300001800303520067800321592002800999650002301027650002301050650002201073650001601095653003901111653002901150653001901179653002701198700002001225700002001245700002301265773011201288856008401400852000901484655001201493IND60599507220221118111920.0180702e20140806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059950722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.06.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshton, Kate S.12aA general method for the facile synthesis of optically active 2-substituted piperazines via functionalized 2,5-diketopiperazines  ap. 4501-4504.  aUpon utilization of some common methods described in the literature for the synthesis of chiral, 2-substituted 2,5-diketopiperazines, extensive racemization was observed. Further investigation showed that heating in the presence of a mild base racemized the chiral center in the product diketopiperazines. A generalized, readily scalable route was sought and, after investigating the effect of base and temperature, conditions were identified that promoted cyclization without erosion of enantiomeric excess. An array of functionalization was tolerated and this procedure serves as a useful and reliable method for the facile synthesis of this important class of compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3adiketopiperazines 3atemperature 0a2-Substituted 2,5-diketopiperazine 0a2-Substituted piperazine 0aFischer method 0aAmino acid cyclization1 aDenti, Mitchell1 aNorman, Mark H.1 aSt. Jean, David J.0 tTetrahedron letters.g2014 Aug. 06, v. 55, no. 32 p.4501-4504dElsevier LtdwJournal:11745x0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.06.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012300170500002200293520124800315592002801563650001501591650002201606650001201628650001501640650001501655650001301670650001301683653002601696653002601722653001801748653001401766653001701780700002601797700002201823700001901845700002201864700002201886773007301908856008201981852000902063655001202072IND60582534920221120101648.0171006s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058253492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2017.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSöllradl, Thomas10aLabel-free visualization and quantification of single cell activity using metal-clad waveguide (MCWG)-based microscopy  aPre-press version  aLabel-free biosensing methods are very effective for studying cell signaling cascade activation induced by external stimuli. Assays generally involve a large number of cells and rely on the underlying assumption that cell response is homogeneous within a cell population. However, there is an increasing body of evidence showing that cell behavior may vary significantly even among genetically identical cells. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of metal-clad waveguide (MCWG)-based microscopy for label-free real-time monitoring of signaling activity and morphology changes in a small population of cells, with the ability to resolve individual cells. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by quantifying apoptosis-induced intracellular activity in individual cells following exposure to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and by visualizing and quantifying extracellular changes in endothelial cell layer integrity following the activation of the proteinase-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) by thrombin. Results show that averaged signals obtained from a cell population may incorrectly reflect the actual distribution of morphology and kinetics parameters across a cell population by a significant margin.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3aendothelial cells 3aligands 3amicroscopy 3amonitoring 3anecrosis 3athrombin 0alabel-free microscopy 0aCell-based biosensing 0aheterogeneity 0aapoptosis 0apermeability1 aBanville, Frederic A.1 aFröhlich, Ulrike1 aCanva, Michael1 aCharette, Paul G.1 aGrandbois, Michel0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245011400189300001800303520131800321592002801639650002301667650002401690650002001714650001901734650002101753650001801774650002401792650001601816650001101832650001201843650001401855650001201869650000901881650002701890650001101917650001101928650000901939650005501948651001002003651001002013653002602023653002002049653002302069653001502092653001902107653001202126653001002138653001402148653000902162700001802171700001602189700001502205700001602220773013302236856005102369852000902420655001202429IND50087204520221119231740.0140412e20110801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008720452DNAL7 a215981362pmid7 a10.1080/19440049.2011.5764452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCano-Sancho, G.10aQuantitative dietary exposure assessment of the Catalonian population (Spain) to the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol  ap. 1098-1109.  aThe mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) is one of the most common contaminants of cereals worldwide, and its occurrence has been widely reported in raw foods and foodstuffs, around the European region, including Catalonia. In the present work, a stochastic methodology has been applied to accurately assess the exposure of the Catalonian population (Spain) to DON through food consumption. Raw contamination data was provided by a large survey conducted in this region, in addition to the raw consumption data from a nutritional study specifically designed to assess the dietary intake of the main foodstuffs related to DON contamination for all population age groups. Contamination and consumption data were combined by simulation using an essentially parametric (P-P) method. The P-P method draws sampling values from distribution functions fitted to consumption and contamination data sets. Moreover, to quantify the accuracy and reliability of the statistics estimates, we built the related confidence intervals using a pseudo-parametric bootstrap method. Considering the results drawn from the P-P simulation method, the Catalonian population should be expected to be exposed at moderated levels of deoxynivalenol, the infants and individuals with ethnic dietary patterns being the most exposed population groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aat-risk population 3aconfidence interval 3adata collection 3adeoxynivalenol 3adietary exposure 3aeating habits 3aexposure assessment 3afood intake 3agrains 3ainfants 3araw foods 3asurveys 2aDiet 2aEnvironmental Exposure 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aTrichothecenesxadministration & dosagextoxicity. 3aSpain 0aSpain 0aprobability modelling 0arisk assessment 0atotal diet studies 0amycotoxins 0atrichothecenes 0acereals 0abread 0ababy food 0abeer1 aGauchi, J.-P.1 aSanchis, V.1 aMarín, S.1 aRamos, A.J.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2011 Aug. 1, v. 28, no. 8 p.1098-1109dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:jnl35737x1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2011.576445  aDNAL 7aarticle04260naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245016400156300001600320500002000336520195000356592002802306596008802334596008902422596008902511596008802600596006902688596004702757596005902804596005902863596002002922650002002942650002702962650001802989650001903007650003403026650002303060650002103083650001703104650001303121650001103134650001103145650002203156650001403178650003303192700001203225700001703237700001703254700001803271700001603289700001903305700001503324700005503339700005503394773011403449856007403563852000903637655001203646IND60782237820221123000446.0220706e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078223782DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.157902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Lanping14aThe CaPti1–CaERF3 module positively regulates resistance of Capsicum annuum to bacterial wilt disease by coupling enhanced immunity and dehydration tolerance  ap. 250-268.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBacterial wilt, a severe disease involving vascular system blockade, is caused by Ralstonia solanacearum. Although both plant immunity and dehydration tolerance might contribute to disease resistance, whether and how they are related remains unclear. Herein, we showed that immunity against R. solanacearum and dehydration tolerance are coupled and regulated by the CaPti1–CaERF3 module. CaPti1 and CaERF3 are members of the serine/threonine protein kinase and ethylene‐responsive factor families, respectively. Expression profiling revealed that CaPti1 and CaERF3 were upregulated by R. solanacearum inoculation, dehydration stress, and exogenously applied abscisic acid (ABA). They in turn phenocopied each other in promoting resistance of pepper (Capsicum annuum) to bacterial wilt not only by activating salicylic acid‐dependent CaPR1, but also by activating dehydration tolerance‐related CaOSM1 and CaOSR1 and inducing stomatal closure to reduce water loss in an ABA signaling‐dependent manner. Our yeast two hybrid assay showed that CaERF3 interacted with CaPti1, which was confirmed using co‐immunoprecipitation, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and pull‐down assays. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that upon R. solanacearum inoculation, CaPR1, CaOSM1, and CaOSR1 were directly targeted and positively regulated by CaERF3 and potentiated by CaPti1. Additionally, our data indicated that the CaPti1–CaERF3 complex might act downstream of ABA signaling, as exogenously applied ABA did not alter regulation of stomatal aperture by the CaPti1–CaERF3 module. Importantly, the CaPti1–CaERF3 module positively affected pepper growth and the response to dehydration stress. Collectively, the results suggested that immunity and dehydration tolerance are coupled and positively regulated by CaPti1–CaERF3 in pepper plants to enhance resistance against R. solanacearum.  aPublisher supplied data  aCXZX2018114cDevelopment Fund Project of Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University  aCXZX2019024GcDevelopment Fund Project of Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University  aCXZX2020008AcDevelopment Fund Project of Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University  axjq201913cExcellent Youth Foundation of Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University  a2020J01532cNatural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China  cFujian Agriculture and Forestry University  a31501767cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a32172553cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cYale University 3aCapsicum annuum 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3aabscisic acid 3abacterial wilt 3achromatin immunoprecipitation 3adisease resistance 3adisease severity 3afluorescence 3aimmunity 3apepper 3aserine 3astomatal movement 3athreonine 3atwo hybrid system techniques1 aLi, Xia1 aWeng, Yahong1 aCai, Hanyang1 aLiu, Kaisheng1 aXie, Baixue1 aAnsar, Hussain1 aGuan, Deyi1 aHe, Shuilin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5032-75601 aLiu, Zhiqin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5396-870X0 tplant journal.g2022 July, v. 111, no. 1 p.250-268dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.157903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001100152245016600163300001400329520117600343592002801519650001501547650002101562650001901583650002201602650003301624650003001657650001401687650002001701650001101721653002201732653002101754653001401775653003001789653004301819700001501862700001801877700001501895700001701910773013301927856008702060852000902147655001202156IND60776791820221121024336.0220531e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077679182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.04.2272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yi10aLightweight electromagnetic interference shielding poly(L-lactic acid)/poly(D-lactic acid)/carbon nanotubes composite foams prepared by supercritical CO2 foaming  ap. 11-20.  aLightweight and biodegradable polymer composites with efficient electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding performance are of great significance for controlling pollution caused by plastic waste and electromagnetic radiation. Herein, poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composites were prepared through a melt blending method. By adding a small amount of poly(D-lactic acid) to poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA), the EMI shielding performance of the composites was improved because an enhanced viscoelasticity and suitable crystallinity could help to construct fine CNT conductive networks. When the PDLA content was 2 wt%, the EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) of the PLLA-2PDLA-10CNTs reached 27.1 dB at 26.5 GHz. Based on these findings, a green supercritical CO₂ foaming method was employed to prepare lightweight PLLA/PDLA/CNTs composites. For the PLLA-2PDLA-10CNTs foams, when the expansion ratio was 1.24, the EMI SE was 20.1 dB at 26.5 GHz. In addition, the EMI shielding mechanism of the foams was dominated by absorption. This paper provides a facile way to prepare lightweight and environmentally friendly materials for EMI shielding applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abiodegradability 3acarbon dioxide 3acrystal structure 3aelectromagnetic interference 3aelectromagnetic radiation 3apollution 3aviscoelasticity 3awastes 0aPoly(lactic acid) 0aCarbon nanotubes 0aComposite 0aSupercritical CO2 foaming 0aElectromagnetic interference shielding1 aYu, Kesong1 aZhang, Xiaoli1 aHou, Junji1 aChen, Jingbo0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 June 15, v. 210 p.11-20dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.04.2273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002500158245010200183300001600285506002800301520171600329592002802045506003702073650001202110650002502122650001602147650000902163650001202172650001902184650001702203650001702220650001502237650001302252650002302265650001602288650001602304650001702320650002202337653001702359653000902376653001902385653001502404653000902419700002602428773018302454856009302637852000902730655001202739IND60785307120221207105353.0191229e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078530712DNAL7 a10.22363/2312-797X-2019-14-4-319-3282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadran, Antar Mahmud10aInfluence of salinity on vegetative growth and photosynthetic pigments of bitter almond rootstock  ap. 319-328.  aResource is Open Access  aBitter almond rootstock is considered one of the most vital rootstocks for stone fruit species but it is classified as a plant sensitive to salinity. This experiment was carried out to study the effect of salt stress on vegetative growth and photosynthetic pigments of bitter almond rootstock as an attempt to sustain growth and increase its tolerance to high salt concentrations. However, the seeds were soaked in salt solution of NaCl as 1, 3, and 5 dsm-1 for 48 hours before stratification. After that, nuts were sown in perlite and treated with different saline solutions subsequently stratified at 6 ℃ for eight weeks. Sprouted seeds were cultivated in pots with a mixture of peat and perlite and treated only with the highest salt concentration 5 dsm-1. The treatments were arranged in a complete randomized block design with three replications. Vegetative traits and photosynthetic pigments content were estimated. The results revealed that soaking and pre-treating seed of bitter almond rootstock by means of high salt concentration 5dsm-1 during the germination period and subsequently after planting produced stronger transplants that had hardening, adaptation and could avoid the hyperosmotic shock of salt stress after planting. It is obvious throughout; increment of stem diameter, plant height, total number of leaves\plant, fresh and dry weight of leaves, photosynthetic pigments and total carbohydrate content of such transplants. While other coming seedlings from low salt concentrations were exposed to hyperosmotic shock and salt injury therefore inhibit growth rate of such plants, increased falling of leaves and finally reduced photosynthetic pigments content in the resulting seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalmonds 3acarbohydrate content 3agermination 3apeat 3aperlite 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant height 3apretreatment 3arootstocks 3asalinity 3asalt concentration 3asalt injury 3asalt stress 3astone fruits 3avegetative growth 0aion toxicity 0anacl 0astratification 0aadaptation 0anacl1 aSavin, Igor Yuryevich0 tVestnik Rossijskogo universiteta družby narodov.g2019 Dec., v. 14, no. 4 p.319-328dPeoples’ Friendship University of Russia (RUDN University)wJournal:27840x2312-79887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22363/2312-797X-2019-14-4-319-3283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245014800205300001200353520149300365592002801858650002101886650001501907650002001922650001501942650002601957650001401983650003301997650001602030650001102046650002302057650001302080650001502093650001802108651001002126700002202136773015102158856008302309852000902392655001202401IND60744913520221120075137.0211027e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074491352DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-021-09318-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArora, Sameer1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4942-851010aPattern recognition of water quality variance in Yamuna River (India) using hierarchical agglomerative cluster and principal component analyses  ap. 494.  aThe monitoring and assessment of a river system is a complex process and not restricted to urban areas only. The discharge of wastewater drains in the river increases the river system complexity further. The abstraction of freshwater at regular intervals and the discharge of the wastewater from various sources cause significant spatial and temporal variation in water quality. The multivariate statistical analysis is performed to identify water quality parameters’ variability on the 5-year dataset from four monitoring sites. Hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis (HACA) and principal component analysis (PCA) are applied to characterize the water quality parameters and identify the significant pollution sources. The clusters are formed considering the similarities between parameters, and eigenvalues are determined from the covariance of parameters. The box plots are designed to identify the spatial and temporal variations. The highest variability of the first principal component is 60.78% of the total variance at the second sampling location, the ITO bridge. The significant varifactors obtained from the PCA indicate the parameters responsible for the maximum variation in water quality. The study reveals the importance of multivariate statistical techniques in identifying a pattern of variability of parameters and developing management strategies to improve river water quality by identifying dominant parameters causing the maximum degradation in water quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3acluster analysis 3acovariance 3adata collection 3afreshwater 3amultivariate analysis 3apollution 3aprincipal component analysis 3ariver water 3arivers 3atemporal variation 3avariance 3awastewater 3awater quality 3aIndia1 aKeshari, Ashok K.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2021 Aug., v. 193, no. 8 p.494-494dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09318-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012000166300001200286520180500298592002802103653001502131653002202146653001602168653001602184653001002200653002202210700001602232700001602248700001902264700001602283700001802299700001602317700005902333700005402392773009502446856008502541852000902626655001202635IND60674176320221116191840.0200106e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067417632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2019.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMu, Jingmei10aIdentification of sources of resistance in geographically diverse wheat accessions to stripe rust pathogen in China  ap. 1-8.  aStripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most damaging diseases of wheat in the world. China is one of the most important regions of wheat production and stripe rust epidemics. The spread of Yr26-virulent races V26 has threatened wheat production in China. It is urgent to identify new resistance sources for use in breeding programs. A total of 60 accessions from different wheat regions in the world, showing excellent field resistance in previous study were examined in more details at Yangling under artificially inoculation conditions and Tianshui under naturally infection from 2015 to 2017. Seedling tests were also conducted using two Yr26-virulent races and eight Yr26-avirulent races. The combined field and seedling response data and pedigrees of the 60 entries were used to postulate the resistance genes involved. Molecular markers that are linked to some previously reported stripe rust resistance genes were used to validate the postulated genes. Resistance genes in 4 accessions that were resistant in all race tests in the seedling stage and field tests could not be predicted. These 4 accessions with all stage resistance should combine with other Yr genes to obtain durable resistance. Resistance in 24 accessions was attributed, at least in part, to combinations of known genes. Fifty accessions were susceptible to the Yr26-virulent races in the seedling stage, but resistant in the fields of both locations. With at least partial assurance, the genes for effective resistance in the 50 accessions are different from those already widely used in Chinese wheat varieties. Therefore, these 50 accessions should be used in breeding programs to developing new cultivars with effective resistance to the new emerging races and other predominant races.  aPublisher supplied data 0aResistance 0aMolecular markers 0aStripe rust 0aYellow rust 0aWheat 0aTriticum aestivum1 aWang, Qilin1 aWu, Jianhui1 aZeng, Qingdong1 aHuang, Shuo1 aLiu, Shengjie1 aYu, Shizhou1 aKang, Zhensheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7856-23401 aHan, Dejun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6102-88540 tCrop protection.g2019 Aug., v. 122 p.1-8dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2019.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03552naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245010100156500002000257520174500277592002802022596006302050596006602113596006002179650001202239650002402251650001702275650001502292650002002307650002902327650001302356650001902369650003802388650001802426650001302444650001102457651001702468651001602485700006202501700005802563700002002621700001702641700006002658700001802718700002002736700005502756773013702811856007702948852000903025655001203034IND60789754020221118034828.0220822e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078975402DNAL7 a10.1029/2020JC0165012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKo, Eunho10aEffects of Nitrogen Limitation on Phytoplankton Physiology in the Western Arctic Ocean in Summer  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPhytoplankton in the Arctic Ocean are subject to nitrogen limitation in the summer, however, how severely the nitrogen stress affects phytoplankton physiology remains largely unknown. In the summers of 2015–2018, we examined the distribution of phytoplankton photophysiological properties across two contrasting regions of the Arctic Ocean with distinctly different levels of nitrogen availability in the upper water column. We quantified the extent of nitrogen stress using a highly sensitive fluorescence induction and relaxation system to obtain continuous underway measurements and via discrete sample analyses of phytoplankton physiology, as well as nutrient enrichment incubations. The results revealed vast regions in the Chukchi Sea where phytoplankton photosynthesis was severely nitrogen‐stressed. Thereby, the maximum quantum yield of photochemistry in photosystem II showed only a small decrease (12 ± 9%) relative to its nutrient‐replete values, while the maximum photosynthetic electron transport rates under saturating irradiance were impaired to a greater extent (40 ± 17%). This phytoplankton photosynthesis response is indicative of a severe nitrogen limitation, which results in dramatic reduction in growth and net primary production rates. Nutrient enrichment incubations also revealed a marked increase in large‐size phytoplankton growth (>10 μm) after the nitrogen stress was alleviated, suggesting that the larger cells were more susceptible to nitrogen stress. These results are important for understanding how regional nitrogen fluxes control variability in the primary production and phytoplankton community structure and how these processes might change with rapid climate changes in the Arctic Ocean.  aPublisher supplied data  aNNX16AT54GcNASA Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry Program  a80NSSC18K1416cNASA Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry Program  a20160245cMinistry of Oceans and Fisheries (MOF), Korea 3aclimate 3acommunity structure 3afluorescence 3ageophysics 3alight intensity 3anet primary productivity 3anitrogen 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosynthetic electron transport 3aphytoplankton 3aresearch 3asummer 3aArctic Ocean 3aChukchi Sea1 aGorbunov, Maxim Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4229-66151 aJung, Jinyoung1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0284-15191 aJoo, Hyoung Min1 aLee, Youngju1 aCho, Kyoung‐Ho1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5527-58511 aYang, Eun Jin1 aKang, Sung‐Ho1 aPark, Jisoo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0428-83580 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Nov., v. 125, no. 11 p.e2020JC016501-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JC0165013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005500149245011900204300001600323500001900339520127100358592002801629650000901657650001601666650001201682650002601694650001301720650001301733650001801746650001701764650001501781653001801796653003601814653001201850653001101862653001301873700002201886700003201908700005701940700001701997700005602014700002702070700002602097700005802123773014102181856008402322852000902406655001202415IND60727713620221118002450.0210423e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072771362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jssas.2021.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabur, Emre1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1776-301810aStudying soil erosion by evaluating changes in physico-chemical properties of soils under different land-use types  ap. 190-197.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effects of different land-use types on physicochemical properties and erodibility indices in suitable utilization of soil are the most important issue to be investigated. That’s why the current study was carried out to investigate changes in physical, chemical soil properties and erodibility indexes under different land-use types i.e., larch-fir forests, adjacent pasture, and riparian areas. Soil samples were collected from different land use in the Meydan Pond micro-basin. Five subsamples were taken at the 0–10 cm depth at five different sampling spots in each one of the three land-use systems (i.e., forest, pasture, and riparian areas). Results showed that silt content was around 38% higher in the forest soils over pasture and the riparian areas. Dispersion rate (80%) and erosion ratio (11%) were significantly higher in riparian areas over the pasture. In conclusion, pasture soils are resistant to erosion due to the higher amount of clay percentage (95%) and aggregation rate (38%) as compared to riparian areas that are more erodible. It is concluded that the river basin should be arranged according to the land capability classes’ principles to protect the soil's fertile layer from erosion to achieve the maximum productivity of crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3aerodibility 3aforests 3aland capability class 3aland use 3apastures 3asilt fraction 3asoil erosion 3awatersheds 0aLand use type 0aPhysicochemical soil properties 0aPasture 0aForest 0aRiparian1 aSüha Uslu, Ömer1 aLeonardo Battaglia, Martín1 aDiatta, Andre1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4720-97601 aShah, Fahad,1 aDatta, Rahul1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9001-25551 aZafar-ul-Hye, Muhammad1 aSabir Hussain, Ghulam1 aDanish, Subhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6182-62070 tJournal of the Saudi Society of Agricultural Sciences.g2021 Apr., v. 20, no. 3 p.190-197dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23282x1658-077X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jssas.2021.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009500159300002000254520156000274592002801834650001001862650001401872650002001886650002101906700001201927700001601939700001801955700001701973700001401990773012502004856007502129852000902204655001202213IND60757117020221123040925.0211122e20211027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075711702DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra06173a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Fengshan10aMicroscale magnetic field modulation using rapidly patterned soft magnetic microstructures  ap. 34660-34668.  aThe ability to locally modulate the magnetic field distribution is a prerequisite for efficient manipulation in magnetic force-based microfluidic devices. Here, we report a simple, robust, and fast fabrication method of magnetic microstructures for locally modulating magnetic fields. In the proposed method, a photosensitive magnetic composite consisting of carbonyl-iron microparticles in a poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) matrix was utilized to photolithographically fabricate magnetic microstructures. The magnetic behavior of the composite was first evaluated, and then various complicated patterns were fabricated on a glass slide within a few minutes. To demonstrate the capability of magnetic microstructures as a magnetic field concentrator, magnetic microstructures with different orientations to the external magnetic field were designed and fabricated, such as square arrays and grid-like magnetic microstructures. The modulated magnetic fields from such magnetic microstructures were numerically analyzed and then experimentally validated by trapping magnetic hydrogel beads. Further, the magnetically labeled cells were applied to the magnetic microstructures to prove the possibility of cell confinement via magnetic guidance in regions that exhibit enhanced magnetic field gradients. Overall, the proposed approach facilitates simple and fast fabrication of soft magnetic microstructures for microscale modulation of magnetic fields, which exhibits an immense application potential in magnetic force-based microfluidic techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglass 3ahydrogels 3amagnetic fields 3aphotosensitivity1 aYu, Yan1 aLi, Yuexuan1 aFeng, Hongtao1 aWu, Tianzhun1 aChen, Yan0 tRSC advances.g2021 Oct. 27, v. 11, no. 55 p.34660-34668dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra06173a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001100140245008000151300002000231520080000251592002801051650001701079650001401096650001401110650002701124650001801151650002801169650001201197650001701209650001101226650001501237650001901252650002201271650002201293700001401315700001601329700001201345700001701357700001601374700001901390700001301409700001201422700001801434773012501452856007501577852000901652655001201661IND60757117220221123020022.0211122e20211028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075711722DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra06182h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMu, Yu10aOxazolomycins produced by Streptomyces glaucus and their cytotoxic activity  ap. 35011-35019.  aSix oxazolomycins (1–6) were isolated from the fermentation broth of a soil-borne bacterial strain, Streptomyces glaucus.

While S. striolatum has strong positive population trends, declines of S. vulgatum are observed. The aim of this study was to identify possible drivers of these diverging trends. We presumed that differences in egg development may lead to differences in survival until hatching. First, eggs laid in non-permanent or shrinking waterbodies may suffer of increasing drought periods. Second, differences in developement may cause increased size-mediated intraguild predation, a common cause of reduced survival in odonate larvae. Egg development time and hatching rates were recorded of eleven egg clutches of S. vulgatum and ten clutches of S. striolatum under simulated drought vs. water and direct vs. delayed development treatments. Hatching rates were reduced under drought conditions, and particularly so in S. vulgatum. We did not observe obligate winter diapause in any of the egg clutches. But, S. vulgatum varied widely in development between clutches, while the eggs of S. striolatum developed much faster and hatched highly synchronously. This would provide S. striolatum with a temporal advantage that may lead to a size-advantage over most S. vulgatum. We also found that S. vulgatum grew faster. Faster larval growth would only compensate for those S. vulgatum with fast egg development. The current population trends may be partly attributed to lowered survival of S. vulgatum under drought and by phenological and, thus, size benefits of S. striolatum. IMPLICATIONS FOR INSECT CONSERVATION: Our results show that population dynamics of two closely related dragonfly species can be explained by climatically induced changes in their interactions. Understanding the causes and processes of behavioural changes resulting in differing population trends is fundamental for the protection of species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSympetrum 3adiapause 3adrought 3aeggs 3ainsects 3alarval development 3aphenology 3apopulation dynamics 3apredation 3asurface water 3aCentral European region1 aSuhling, Frank1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2922-02610 tJournal of insect conservation.g2022 Aug., v. 26, no. 4 p.571-581dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl3870062x1366-638X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-022-00396-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245010900177500001400286520103100300592002801331650001201359650002501371650001101396650001301407650001601420650001601436650001401452650002001466650001601486650001901502650001101521650001601532650001801548650000801566653002901574653002301603653002901626653003101655700002701686700002401713773010001737856008701837852000901924655001201933IND60700331120221117163020.0200808e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070033112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1273922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel Azeem, Sami M.10aAnalysis of total phenolic compounds in tea and fruits using diazotized aminobenzenes colorimetric spots  aNAL-light  aThe present work describes a novel and rapid approach for evaluating total phenolic compounds (TPCs) in tea and fruits using colorimetric spots and the digital image-based (DIB) method. Colorimetric spots were formed by reacting diazotized aminobenzenes namely sulfanilic acid, sulfanilamide, or aniline with TPCs in the extract to form an azo dye. The limit of detection (LOD) was 6.5, 5.5, or 5.1 mg GAE (gallic acid equivalent) L⁻¹ and the analytical range was 25–500, 20–500, or 18–200 mg GAE L⁻¹, respectively. Correlation with the Folin-Ciocalteu assay was significant (Pearson coefficient, R = 0.970–0.991) while the antioxidant activity assay was moderate to high (R = 0.737–0.977). The method developed was successfully applied to the analysis of tea and fruits and showed RSD (n = 3) not exceeding 9.6, 8.5, and 9.7%, respectively. Ecologically, the DIB method developed could determine the variation of TPCs within cultivars and was found to be strongly dependent on the growing environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaniline 3aantioxidant activity 3aassays 3aazo dyes 3acolorimetry 3acorrelation 3acultivars 3adetection limit 3aenvironment 3afood chemistry 3afruits 3agallic acid 3asulfanilamide 3atea 0aTotal phenolic compounds 0aColorimetric spots 0aDiazotized aminobenzenes 0aDigital image-based method1 aAl Mohesen, Ibrahem A.1 aIbrahim, Ahmed M.H.0 tFood chemistry.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 332 p.127392-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1273923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01738naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012100162300001800283500001400301520034500315592002800660650001500688650002500703650001800728650001500746650001300761650002200774650001100796650001100807653001900818653001700837653002000854700002400874700001800898700002000916700002100936700002400957700002000981700002301001773018601024856007301210852000901283655001201292IND60692455120221120085536.0200502e20091223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069245512DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.905092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMATSUSHITA, Nobuto10aPurification and cDNA Cloning of LaIT2, a Novel Insecticidal Toxin from Venom of the Scorpion Liocheles australasiae  ap. 2769-2772.  aNAL-light  aThe novel insecticidal toxin, LaIT2, was isolated from venom of the scorpion Liocheles australasiae.

The role of γδ T cells during Dengue Viral Infection (DENV) infection is not fully elucidated. Nevertheless, human primary γδ T cells have been shown to kill in vitro DENV-infected cells, thus highlighting their possible antiviral function. The aim of this work was to characterize the phenotype and function of Vδ2 T cells in DENV patients. Fifteen DENV patients were enrolled for this study and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were used to analyze Vδ2-T-cell frequency, differentiation profile, activation/exhaustion status, and functionality by multiparametric flow cytometry. Our data demonstrated that DENV infection was able to significantly reduce Vδ2-T-cell frequency and to increase their activation (CD38 and HLA-DR) and exhaustion markers (PD-1 and TIM-3). Furthermore, Vδ2 T cells showed a reduced capability to produce IFN-γ after phosphoantigenic stimulation that can be associated to TIM-3 expression. Several studies are needed to depict the possible clinical impact of γδ-T-cell impairment on disease severity and to define the antiviral and immunoregulatory activities of γδ T cells in the first phases of infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3adengue 3adisease severity 3aflow cytometry 3ahumans 3aimmunomodulation 3aphenotype1 aGrassi, Germana 1 aBeccacece, Alessia 1 aCasetti, Rita 1 aCastilletti, Concetta 1 aCapobianchi, Maria Rosaria1 aNicastri, Emanuele 1 aAgrati, Chiara 0 tViruses.g2022 Jan. 12, v. 14, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140101303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03391naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004800094040001800142100002100160245009200181300001400273506002800287520215800315592002802473506003702501650001302538650001102551650001502562650000902577650001302586651001402599653001902613653002302632653002102655653001602676653002302692653001902715700001402734773014102748856009502889852000902984655001202993IND60785307820221207104130.0200930e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078530782DNAL7 ahttps://doi.org/10.37833/cord.v29i2.862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaskromo, Ismail10aProductivity of Three Dwarf Kopyor Coconut Varieties from Pati, Central Java, Indonesia  ap. 19-28.  aResource is Open Access  aPati Dwarf Kopyor coconut originated from Pati, Central Java is one of the Kopyor coconut populations from Indonesia. Three varieties of Pati Dwarf Kopyor coconut, namely: Kopyor Green Dwarf, Kopyor Brown Dwarf and Kopyor Yellow Dwarf out of six potential varieties have been officially released as local superior varieties by the Minister of Agriculture, Republic of Indonesia at the end of 2010. The objectives of this research were to evaluate the stability of Kopyor fruit production among provenances of Pati Dwarf Kopyor coconuts. Evaluations were conducted especially for the three recently released varieties of Kopyor coconuts. Observations were carried out in 2011 and the collected data were then compared with Kopyor fruit production data collected in 2009 -2010. In three different locations, representatives of 10 Kopyor coconut provenances for each Kopyor variety were observed; therefore, a total of 90 trees were evaluated in this experiment. Observations were conducted for number of total bunches per palm, number of total fruits/per bunch, and the number of harvested Kopyor coconut fruits/per bunch. Three bunches were selected for each of the evaluated provenance. Results of the observation indicated that the observed yield and yield parameters of three Pati Dwarf Kopyor coconut varieties fluctuated by the year of observations. However, in general the observed yield and yield parameters among three varieties were similar. The average number of total bunches observed among three varieties evaluated ranged from 9.6-12.1 bunches per palm; the average number of fruits/per bunch ranged from 5.3-12.4; and the average number of harvested Kopyor fruits/per bunch ranged from 2.0-3.8. The estimated number of total fruits/palm/year among the three varieties ranged from 53.8-128.1 and the percentage of Kopyor fruit production observed among the three varieties evaluated ranged from 24.8-38.9 %. The estimated number of total harvested Kopyor fruits/palm/year ranged from 20.5-39.2, respectively. Rainfall pattern might affect directly or indirectly toward yield and yield components of three Pati Dwarf Kopyor coconut varieties.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acoconuts 3afruits 3aprovenance 3arain 3aresearch 3aIndonesia 0aexotic coconut 0aendospem abnomally 0anatural mutation 0afruit yield 0akopyor fruit yield 0arainfall yield1 aSudarsono0 tCORD.

Variations in sea ice mass balance reflect these changes and give insight to the environmental forcings which caused them. In this work, the time series results from eight Lagrangian mass balance sites that operated in the Beaufort Sea over the years 1997–2015 are analyzed. Direct measurements from the sites are combined with estimates of ice/ocean heat input to examine the roll of solar heating on ice loss, growth, and melt rates. Comparisons between ice and snow conditions and mass balance event timing, for example, surface and bottom melt onset, melt peak, and melt end, are also made. From the late 1990s to the present, a general increase in bottom melting and solar heat input to the upper ocean was observed. All sites showed a net loss of ice (ranging from 29 to 271 cm), and all but one site saw the majority of this loss from bottom melting. Bottom melt onset occurred within a relatively narrow 13‐day window between 1 and 13 June at all sites. The amount of observed bottom melt was also related to the heat deposited in the ocean available for melting, underscoring the increasingly important role of ocean thermodynamics in determining sea ice mass balance.  aPublisher supplied data  a1560908cNational Science Foundation (NSF) 3ageophysics 3aheat 3aice cover 3aresearch 3asea ice 3asnow 3asummer 3atime series analysis 3aBeaufort Sea1 aPerovich, Donald K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0576-08641 aLight, Bonnie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2640-57380 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Nov., v. 125, no. 11 p.e2019JC015833-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JC0158333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01959naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245006100153300002000214520099500234592002801229650002401257650001301281650000901294650001301303650002101316700001601337700001801353700001201371700001201383700001701395773012501412856007501537852000901612655001201621IND60757117420221122231021.0211122e20211112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075711742DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra06192e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Yuyu10aThin robust Pd membranes for low-temperature application  ap. 36617-36624.  aIt is known that hydrogen embrittlement could result in warping and destruction of pure Pd membranes, which limits the working temperatures to be above 293 °C. This study attempted to investigate the relationship between hydrogen embrittlement resistance and membrane geometry of ultrathin pure Pd membranes of 2.7–6.3 μm thickness. Thin tubular Pd membranes with an o.d. of 4 mm, 6 mm and 12 mm immediately suffered from structural destruction when exposed to H₂ at room temperature. In contrast, thin hollow fiber membranes (outer diameter, 2 mm, thickness < 4 μm) exhibit strong resistance against hydrogen embrittlement at temperatures below 100 °C during repeated heating/cooling cycles at a rate up to 10 °C min⁻¹ under H₂ atmosphere. This is ascribed to reduced lattice strain gradients during α–β phase transition in cylindrical structures and lower residual stresses according to in situ XRD analysis, which shows a great prospect in low temperature applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3ageometry 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3aphase transition1 aWang, Meiyi1 aTang, Chunhua1 aLi, Hui1 aFu, Jie1 aXu, Hengyong0 tRSC advances.g2021 Nov. 12, v. 11, no. 58 p.36617-36624dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra06192e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245009200179520141300271592002801684650001301712650001201725650001001737650001301747650002401760650004801784650000901832650001201841650001401853650003701867650001101904700003101915700003801946700003501984700002702019700002902046773012802075856008702203852000902290655001202299IND60771363220221119194721.0220325e20220321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077136322DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100306692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamdan-Partida, Aída 10aMolecular Characterization of Staphylococcus aureus Strains Isolated from Mobile Phones  aThe widespread use of mobile phones (MP) among healthcare personnel might be considered as an important source of contamination. One of the most pathogenic bacteria to humans is Staphylococcus aureus, which can be transmitted through the constant use of MP. Nevertheless, which specific type of strains are transmitted and which are their sources have not been sufficiently studied. The aim of this study is to determine the source of contamination of MP and characterize the corresponding genotypic and phenotypic properties of the strains found. Nose, pharynx, and MP samples were taken from a group of health science students. We were able to determinate the clonality of the isolated strains by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and spa gene typing (spa-type). Adhesin and toxin genes were detected, and the capacity of biofilm formation was determined. Several of the MP exhibited strains of S. aureus present in the nose and/or pharynx of their owners. methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (HA-MRSA), and community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) strains were found, which indicated a variety of genotypes. This study concludes that MP can be contaminated with the strains of S. aureus present in the nose and/or pharynx of the owners; these strains can be of different types and there is no dominant genotype.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesins 3abiofilm 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahealth care workers 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3anose 3apharynx 3aphenotype 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3atoxins1 aGonzález-García, Samuel 1 aMartínez Ruiz, Francisco Javier,1 aZavala-Sánchez, Miguel Ángel1 aBustos-Hamdan, Anaíd 1 aBustos-Martínez, Jaime 0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 Mar. 21, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100306693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245012200211300001600333520165100349592002802000650002302028650001702051650002802068650001302096650001302109650001902122650001802141650001502159650003302174650001302207700006202220773013602282856008202418852000902500655001202509IND60744914120221119212805.0210721e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074491412DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-021-02072-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarjaminezhad, Reza1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8768-081910aPrediction of the effect of chitosan on cell suspension culture of Azadirachta indica by response surface methodology  ap. 323-337.  aAzadirachta indica is used to insects repellent, control diabetes, and combat with cancer.

Moench], other Sorghum spp., and sorghum–sudangrass hybrids are used extensively for hay on U.S. cropland because of their production potential. Performance evaluations have emphasized yield and other agronomic characteristics but seldom emphasized forage quality. Available hay-type sorghum cultivars released over a period of four decades were grown in five trials over a 21-yr period to evaluate trends in forage yield and nutritive value. First-cut (boot stage to head emergence) forage was harvested for yield and subsampled for one or more quality components. The first trial in 1977 tested forage crude protein (CP), and subsequent trials included more quality traits. In 1993 and 1998, the traits measured included leaf/stem ratio and leaf and stem concentrations of CP, neutral-detergent fiber (NDF), and acid-detergent fiber (ADF). Pearson correlation coefficients by year and correlations pooled across trials by two methods indicated similar relationships between forage characteristics and year of cultivar release. Year of release was positively associated with forage yield in two of the five trials and for the pooled correlations. Forage CP and CP of leaf and stem fractions were negatively correlated with year of cultivar release for the pooled trials and in most individual trials. Leaf NDF and ADF were positively correlated with year of cultivar release in the pooled trials. Yield gains of about 0.5% per year were found, but concomitant relative reductions of 0.1% or more per year in forage CP and leaf NDF run counter to the perceived need for improved hay quality. These findings emphasize the need to locate and incorporate cost-effective sources of germplasm to enhance nutritive value of forage in hay-type Sorghum spp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor subsp. drummondii 3aacid detergent fiber 3aagronomy 3abooting stage 3acost effectiveness 3acropland 3acrude protein 3acultivars 3aforage yield 3agermplasm 3ahay 3aleaves 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anutritive value1 aFritz, J.

However, many questions remain about the role of the protein hydration layers in protein fluctuations and how the dynamics of these layers relate to specific protein properties. The fish eye lens protein γM7-crystallin (γM7) is found in vivo at extremely high concentrations nearing the packing limit, corresponding to only a few water layers between adjacent proteins. In this study, we conducted a site-specific probing of hydration water motions and side-chain dynamics at nine selected sites around the surface of γM7 using a tryptophan scan with femtosecond spectroscopy and NMR nuclear spin relaxation (NSR). We observed correlated fluctuations between hydration water and protein side chains on the time scales of a few picoseconds and hundreds of picoseconds, corresponding to local reorientations and network restructuring, respectively. These motions are heterogeneous over the protein surface and relate to the various steric and chemical properties of the local protein environment. Overall, we found that γM7 has relatively slower water dynamics within the hydration shell than a similar β-sheet protein, which may contribute to the high packing limit of this unique protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprotein structure 3aproteins 3atryptophan1 aMacro, Nicolas1 aKang, Minhee1 aChen, Long1 aYang, Jin1 aWang, Lijuan1 aWu, Zhengrong1 aZhong, Dongping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9381-89920 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Jan. 28, v. 142, no. 8 p.3997-4007dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b135063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245009400161520151700255592002801772650002301800650005201823650002501875650001401900650001601914650001401930650000901944650002201953700001901975700002501994700002202019700002002041700002002061700002302081700002602104700002002130700002302150700002202173700002102195700002502216700002102241700002202262773012102284856007402405852000902479655001202488IND60763595020221117160222.0220120e20220112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076359502DNAL7 a10.3390/v140101322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBestion, Eloïne 10aGNS561 Exhibits Potent Antiviral Activity against SARS-CoV-2 through Autophagy Inhibition  aSince December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has spread quickly worldwide, leading to more than 280 million confirmed cases, including over 5,000,000 deaths. Interestingly, coronaviruses were found to subvert and hijack autophagic process to allow their viral replication. Autophagy-modulating compounds thus rapidly emerged as an attractive strategy to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, including the well-known chloroquine (CQ). Here, we investigated the antiviral activity and associated mechanism of GNS561/Ezurpimtrostat, a small lysosomotropic molecule inhibitor of late-stage autophagy. Interestingly, GNS561 exhibited antiviral activity of 6–40 nM depending on the viral strain considered, currently positioning it as the most powerful molecule investigated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We then showed that GNS561 was located in lysosome-associated-membrane-protein-2-positive (LAMP2-positive) lysosomes, together with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, GNS561 increased LC3-II spot size and caused the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and the presence of multilamellar bodies, suggesting that GNS561 disrupted the autophagy mechanism. To confirm our findings, we used the K18-hACE2 mouse model and highlighted that GNS561 treatment led to a decline in SARS-CoV-2 virions in the lungs associated with a disruption of the autophagy pathway. Overall, our study highlights GNS561 as a powerful drug in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and supports the hypothesis that autophagy blockers could be an alternative strategy for COVID-19.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aantiviral properties 3aautophagy 3achloroquine 3alysosomes 3amice 3avirus replication1 aZandi, Keivan 1 aBelouzard, Sandrine 1 aAndreani, Julien 1 aLepidi, Hubert 1 aNovello, Marie 1 aRouquairol, Clara 1 aBaudoin, Jean-Pierre 1 aRachid, Madani 1 aLa Scola, Bernard 1 aMege, Jean-Louis 1 aDubuisson, Jean 1 aSchinazi, Raymond F.1 aMezouar, Soraya 1 aHalfon, Philippe 0 tViruses.g2022 Jan. 12, v. 14, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140101323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02269naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245008900159300001400248500001900262520092000281592002801201650001801229650001401247650001001261650001501271650001301286650001201299650001101311650001501322650002101337650001101358650001201369650001501381650001001396653000901406653001501415653002901430700002301459700001801482700001801500700001801518773018101536856007301717852000901790655001201799IND60692455720221120074721.0200502e20100123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069245572DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.905352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPARK, Jeung-yil10aCulm in Rice Straw as a New Source for Sugar Recovery via Enzymatic Saccharification  ap. 50-55.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRice straw was manually dissected and two main fractions were recovered: a culm and a leaf sheath/blade fraction, in order to evaluate their potential as feedstocks for the recovery of fermentable sugars. In the case of cv. Koshihikari and Milkyqueen, most soft carbohydrates (SCs: glucose, fructose, sucrose, starch, and β-1,3-1,4-glucan) were present in the culms, reaching 47.9% and 89.2% of total SCs in the two main fractions. The results also indicated that β-glucans (cellulose and β-1,3-1,4-glucan) and xylan in the culms were more susceptible to direct enzymatic attack than those in the leaf sheath/blades. Thus the culm has high potential as a new feedstock for the extraction of fermentable sugars in a concentrated form, as compared to whole rice straw and the leaf sheath/blade. In this study, a novel method of separating a culm from the whole rice straw by means of wind power was also evaluated.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3acellulose 3aculms 3afeedstocks 3afructose 3aglucose 3aleaves 3arice straw 3asaccharification 3astarch 3asucrose 3awind power 3axylan 0aculm 0aseparation 0asoft carbohydrates (SCs)1 aARAKANE, Mitsuhiro1 aSHIROMA, Riki1 aIKE, Masakazu1 aTOKUYASU, Ken0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2010 Jan. 23, v. 74, no. 1 p.50-55dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.905353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245010300199500002000302520157400322592002801896650001601924650000801940650000901948650001201957650001501969650001101984650001301995650001102008650001602019650001102035700005602046700005302102700001402155700005602169773013702225856007702362852000902439655001202448IND60789754820221118034658.0220822e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078975482DNAL7 a10.1029/2019JC0160042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacobs, Z.

This study assesses the extent to which winter surface heat fluxes and wind stress curl can drive interannual variations of the full‐depth GS transport. Intensification of the GS has been observed (e.g., April 1977) immediately after a winter of frequent cold air outbreaks that led to a deepening of the mixed layer and subsequent steepening of meridional temperature gradients to the south of the GS. This forcing process is further investigated here using the ORCA12 hindcast (1978–2010) from the global, eddy‐resolving, ocean‐only Nucleus for European Modeling of the Ocean model in order to understand GS forcing mechanisms. Lagrangian analysis is also undertaken to examine the impact on the southern recirculation gyre. Results show that surface heat fluxes and wind stress curl can act in concert to effect year‐to‐year changes of up to 38% of the spring GS transport at 70°W. However, anomalous heat losses (∼200 Wm‐²) over the western Subtropical Gyre are found to be the dominant cause of peaks in GS transport via two mechanisms: (1) a strengthening of cross‐stream density gradients on the northern flank of the GS from an intense cooling (up to 4°C) in the Slope Water and (2) a westward intensification of the southern recirculation, which can also limit the formation of deeper mixed layers to the south of the GS near 70°W.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGulf Stream 3aair 3acold 3acooling 3ageophysics 3amodels 3aresearch 3aspring 3awind stress 3awinter1 aGrist, J.

However, the transport of substrates is tricky when applying whole-cell biocatalysts for industrial production. In this research, P. pastoris whole-cell biocatalysts were constructed for rebaudioside A synthesis. Sucrose synthase was expressed intracellularly while UDP-glycosyltransferase was displayed on the cell wall surface simultaneously. As an alternative method, a fermentation process is applied to relieve the substrate transport-limitation of P. pastoris whole-cell biocatalysts. This fermentation process was much simpler, more energy-saving, and greener than additional operating after collecting cells to improve the catalytic ability of whole-cell biocatalysts. Compared with the general fermentation process, the protein production capacity of cells did not decrease. Meanwhile, the activity of whole-cell biocatalysts was increased to 262%, which indicates that the permeability and space resistance were improved to relieve the transport-limitations. Furthermore, the induction time was reduced from 60 h to 36 h. The fermentation process offered significant advantages over traditional permeabilizing reagent treatment and ultrasonication treatment based on the high efficiency and simplicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKomagataella pastoris 3acatalytic activity 3acell walls 3aenergy conservation 3afermentation 3apermeability 3aprotein synthesis 3asucrose synthase 3aultrasonic treatment1 aChen, Meiqi1 aZeng, Xin1 aLi, Wenjie1 aLiang, Shuli1 aLin, Ying0 tRSC advances.g2021 Nov. 11, v. 11, no. 57 p.36329-36339dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra06253k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01802naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245015100157300001600308500001900324520047800343592002800821650002400849650001700873650001800890650001600908650001400924650001600938650002600954653000800980653003300988653003601021700001801057700002301075700001901098700002201117773018301139856007301322852000901395655001201404IND60692456320221122151215.0200502e20100223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069245632DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.905452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aASANO, Mamiko10aSynthesis of Anti-Tumor Dimeric Indole Alkaloids in Catharanthus roseus Was Promoted by Irradiation with Near-Ultraviolet Light at Low Temperature  ap. 386-389.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe have found that coupling between catharanthine and vindoline occurs non-enzymatically in the presence of flavin mononucleotide and manganese ions with near-ultraviolet light irradiation in vitro.

In this study, nine putative kstD genes from different origins were selected and overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). These recombinant enzymes catalyzed the Δ¹-desaturation of a variety of steroidal compounds. Among them, the KstD from Propionibacterium sp. (PrKstD) displayed the highest specific activity and broad substrate spectrum. The detailed catalytic characterization of PrKstD showed that it can convert a wide range of 3-ketosteroid compounds with diverse substituents, ranging from substituents at the C9, C10, C11 and C17 position through substrates without C4-C5 double bond, to previously inactive C6-substituted ones such as 11β,17-dihydroxy-6α-methyl-pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione. Reaction conditions were optimized for the biotransformation of hydrocortisone in terms of pH, temperature, co-solvent and electron acceptor. By using 50 g/L wet resting E. coli cells harboring PrKstD enzyme, the conversion of hydrocortisone was about 92.5% within 6 h at the substrate concentration of 80 g/L, much higher than the previously reported results, demonstrating the application potential of this new KstD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aPropionibacterium 3abiotransformation 3acortisol 3aenzymes 3apH 3atemperature1 aZhang, Rui 1 aFeng, Jinhui 1 aWu, Qiaqing 1 aZhu, Dunming 1 aMa, Yanhe 0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 Feb. 25, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100305083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245014700170300001600317500001500333520168500348592002802033650002402061650001602085650001402101650001502115650001102130650002002141650001902161650002402180650001702204650001402221650002202235650001302257650001402270651001702284653001502301700002102316700002302337700002002360773011002380856008202490990002302572852000902595655001202604IND60097664020221119220702.0141104e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009766402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2011.08.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheppard, Jill N.10aWhat role do beds of submerged macrophytes play in structuring estuarine fish assemblages? Lessons from a warm-temperate South African estuary  ap. 145-155.  a2019-12-06  aHabitat variability is one of the factors influencing species richness within estuarine systems, and a loss of habitat can result in a restructuring of the estuarine ichthyofaunal assemblage, particularly if these conditions persist over long time periods. The potential effects of the loss of extensive submerged macrophyte beds (Ruppia cirrhosa and Potamogeton pectinatus) on an estuarine fish assemblage were investigated through an analysis of a long-term seine net catch dataset from the temporarily open/closed East Kleinemonde Estuary, South Africa. Catch data for a 12-year period, encompassing six years of macrophyte presence and six years of macrophyte senescence, indicated that the loss of this habitat did not influence species richness but changes in the relative abundance of certain species were evident. A shift in dominance from vegetation-associated species to those associated with sandy environments (e.g. members of the family Mugilidae) was observed. However, species wholly dependent on macrophytes such as the critically endangered estuarine pipefish Syngnathus watermeyeri were only recorded during years when macrophyte beds were present, while vegetation-associated species such as the sparid Rhabdosargus holubi persisted at lower levels of relative abundance. The reduced abundance of all vegetation-associated fish species during years of macrophyte senescence was probably reflective of declining food resources resulting from the loss of macrophyte beds and/or increased vulnerability to predation. Submerged beds of aquatic plants are therefore important habitats within temporarily open/closed estuaries, South Africa’s dominant estuary type.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahabitat destruction 3amacrophytes 3aMugilidae 3aSyngnathus 3aRuppia 3adata collection 3aestuarine fish 3aStuckenia pectinata 3aRhabdosargus 3apredation 3aspecies diversity 3ahabitats 3aestuaries 3aSouth Africa 0asenescence1 aJames, Nicola C.1 aWhitfield, Alan K.1 aCowley, Paul D.0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2011 Nov. 1, v. 95, no. 1 p.145-155dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2011.08.0293Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245011700203300001600320520149200336592002801828596010001856650001701956650001801973650001501991650001302006650002202019650001202041650001002053650001402063650002202077650002702099650001802126650001602144650001602160700001802176700002002194773013602214856008202350852000902432655001202441IND60744914720221119212629.0210721e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074491472DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-021-02068-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Yongyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7159-547310aIn vitro induction of tetraploid and resulting trait variation in Populus alba × Populus glandulosa clone 84 K  ap. 285-296.  aAs a model plant, poplar 84 K (Populus alba × P. glandulosa) plays a key role in fundamental research in forest molecular biology. Poplar 84 K is a suitable plant for in vitro polyploidy induction and to study the consequent trait variation among perennial trees. In this study, the results indicated that the concentration of NAA (naphthaleneacetic acid) and BA (benzyladenine) has substantial effects on the differentiation rate of adventitious shoots, and media consisting of 0.5 mg L⁻¹ BA and 0.05 mg L⁻¹ NAA yielded the greatest number of shoots per explant. A total of 98 tetraploids were successfully obtained by colchicine treatment on diploid leaves in vitro. The rate of tetraploids was substantially affected by pre-culture duration, colchicine concentration and exposure duration. The highest tetraploid induction efficiency was 37.03%, which was achieved by treating leaves with 50 mg L⁻¹ colchicine for 3 days after 4 days of pre-culture. With increasing ploidy, obvious morphological differences were discovered between tetraploids and diploids. Compared with the diploids, the tetraploids had larger and thicker leaves, larger but sparser stomata, fewer and shorter roots, and larger protoplasts. These tetraploids serve to enrich the polyploid germplasm resources of Populus. Moreover, our study lays an important groundwork for polyploid gene function and is important for exploring trait variation among Populus trees with different ploidy levels.  aPublisher supplied data  a31530012cInnovative Research Group Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aPopulus alba 3abenzyladenine 3acolchicine 3adiploidy 3aexposure duration 3aforests 3agenes 3agermplasm 3amolecular biology 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aorgan culture 3aprotoplasts 3atetraploidy1 aJing, Yanchun1 aKang, Xiangyang0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2021 Aug., v. 146, no. 2 p.285-296dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33513x0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-021-02068-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002700143245008200170300001600252520140000268592002801668650002401696650002401720650002101744650002401765650002001789650001501809650002601824650001901850650001701869651001201886651001501898651001401913653001301927653001401940653001401954653001701968700002101985700002202006700002402028773010202052856008102154852000902235655001202244IND4461649020221121051716.0151127e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446164902DNAL7 a10.1614/WT-D-10-00153.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCullough, Patrick E.10aAminocyclopyrachlor Enhances Fenoxaprop Efficacy for Smooth Crabgrass Control  ap. 506-510.  aFenoxaprop effectively controls crabgrass in tall fescue turf, but antagonism with growth-regulating herbicides reduces potential to apply fenoxaprop in combination with many herbicides registered for broadleaf weed control. Aminocyclopyrachlor is a new broadleaf weed control herbicide that has not been evaluated in combination with fenoxaprop. Field experiments were conducted in Georgia, New Jersey, and Tennessee to investigate tank mixtures of fenoxaprop with aminocyclopyrachlor for smooth crabgrass and white clover control. Fenoxaprop alone exhibited substantial activity on smooth crabgrass but control was greater with fenoxaprop ++ aminocyclopyrachlor treatments. By 4 and 6 wk after treatment (WAT), approximately 22 and 44%% less fenoxaprop was required to achieve 80%% smooth crabgrass control when the herbicide was tank-mixed with aminocyclopyrachlor at 52.5 and 79 g ai ha⁻¹, respectively. Fenoxaprop did not reduce white clover control with aminocyclopyrachlor because 97%% control was achieved by 4 WAT for all aminocyclopyrachlor ++ fenoxaprop treatments. Tall fescue was not injured by any treatment. Results suggest aminocyclopyrachlor enhances fenoxaprop efficacy for smooth crabgrass control in tall fescue.Nomenclature: Smooth crabgrass, Digitaria ischaemum [[Schreb]] Schreb. ex Muhl.; tall fescue, Festuca arundinacea Schreb.; white clover, Trifolium repens L.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDigitaria ischaemum 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aTrifolium repens 3aaminocyclopyrachlor 3abroadleaf weeds 3afenoxaprop 3afield experimentation 3alawns and turf 3aweed control 3aGeorgia 3aNew Jersey 3aTennessee 0aEfficacy 0aherbicide 0aturfgrass 0aweed control1 aHart, Stephen E.1 aBrosnan, James T.1 aBreeden, Gregory K.0 tWeed technology.g2011 , v. 25, no. 3 p.506-510dWeed Science Society of Americax0890-037X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1614%2FWT-D-10-00153.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245019300168300001300361520130500374592002801679650001901707650001701726650002001743650001501763650004301778650001801821650001901839650002001858650001001878650001201888650002001900650001101920650001501931650001801946650000701964650001601971650002501987650002502012650001502037653001502052653001402067653003202081653004302113653001802156700001902174700001302193700001702206773011002223856008402333852000902417655001202426IND60603057420221120185305.0180712e20150522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060305742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2015.03.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmde, Meseret10aNanofluid of zinc oxide nanoparticles in ionic liquid for single drop liquid microextraction of fungicides in environmental waters prior to high performance liquid chromatographic analysis  ap. 7-15.  aUsing a nanofluid obtained by dispersing ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) in 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, new single drop microextraction method was developed for simultaneous extraction of three fungicides (chlorothalonil, kresoxim-methyl and famoxadone) in water samples prior to their analysis by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-VWD). The parameters affecting the extraction efficiency such as amount of ZnO NPs in the nanofluid, solvent volume, extraction time, stirring rate, pH and ionic strength of the sample solution were optimized. Under the optimized conditions, the limits of detection were in the range of 0.13–0.19ng/mL, the precision of the method assessed with intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviations were <4.82% and <7.04%, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied to determine the three fungicides in real water samples including lake water, river water, as well as effluent and influent of wastewater treatment plant, with recoveries in the range of 74.94–96.11% at 5ng/mL spiking level.

Immune-related genes play crucial roles in this association. Nevertheless, until now, identification of these genes on a large scale has not received much attention. To gain insight into the parasitic effects of the endoparasitoid Aulacocentrum confusum (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) on Glyphodes pyloalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) larva, which is a destructive pest of mulberry (Morus alba L.) trees in China, we presented a transcriptome dataset for uncovering immune-related genes in parasitized G. pyloalis larvae. In total, 91,118,138 and 92,778,814 clean reads were obtained from parasitized and healthy host larvae, respectively, and de novo assembly generated 57,122 unigenes. The transcriptional profile of G. pyloalis larvae was remarkably influenced by parasitism. A total of 3259 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in parasitized and nonparasitized G. pyloalis larvae and 55 genes related to immune response were screened from these DEGs. Among the 55 DEGs, 37 genes were significantly upregulated, and 18 genes were downregulated. qRT-PCR validated the sequencing results and revealed that the expression levels of selected immune-related genes depended on the parasitization and duration after parasitization. Knocking down the C type lectin gene (CTL) changed the expression of serine proteinase, serine protease inhibitor, antimicrobial peptide, prophenoloxidase activating enzymes and peroxiredoxin in G. pyloalis larvae, suggesting CTL can modulate the immune response after parasitization by A. confusum females. The present study provides a foundation for revealing the molecular mechanisms of immune response in G. pyloalis larvae when they are parasitized by A. confusum and promotes the development of novel biological control practices for G. pyloalis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBraconidae 3aGlyphodes pyloalis 3aMorus alba 3aPyralidae 3aantimicrobial peptides 3adata collection 3aendoparasitoids 3agene expression regulation 3aimmune response 3alectins 3amulberries 3aparasitism 3aperoxiredoxin 3aprophenoloxidase 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aserine proteinases 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3aunigenes 3aChina 0aAulacocentrum confusum 0aTranscriptome analysis 0aImmune-related genes 0aBiological control1 aWang, Jiao1 aChu, Jie1 aDing, Jianhao1 aLiu, Zhi-xiang1 aJiang, Delei1 aLiang, Xinhao1 aShao, Zuomin1 aWang, Jun1 aWu, Fu-an0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2021 June, v. 38 p.100803-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12415x1744-117X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbd.2021.1008033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02197naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245012900167300002000296520112100316592002801437650002201465650002001487650000901507650002801516650001201544700002601556700002901582700002501611700002601636773012501662856007501787852000901862655001201871IND60757118520221122065916.0211122e20211102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075711852DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra06301d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, T.

The method involves the use of henequen modified fibers as microfluidic channels. The μFIA system proposed offers a simple, rapid, and low-cost alternative for the determination. Capillary and gravitational forces across the modified henequen fibers control the flow rate, eliminating the need for external pumps. This technique requires low reagent consumption and allows portability for in situ measurements. The flow system is described, and the operational variables were studied and optimized using a Taguchi parameters design to increase analytical sensitivity. Under optimal conditions a limit of detection of 1.16 μg kg⁻¹ was achieved with adequate repeatability and reproducibility (expressed as %RSD <5.0%, n = 3, n = 9 respectively) in all cases. The effect of interfering species and the accuracy of the method were also investigated. The proposed methodology was validated and applied to determine LMG in tilapia muscle samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgave fourcroydes 3adetection limit 3afish 3aflow injection analysis 3amuscles1 aGuevara-Lara, Alfredo1 aPaez-Hernandez, M.

As a gymnosperm, P. glauca belongs to a key taxonomic position for an ongoing evolution-function analysis of viridiplantae nucleobase cation symporter 1 proteins (NCS1). Here the solute transport and binding properties for PgNCS1 are determined through heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains deficient in functional NCS1 loci. PgNCS1 displays a broad, yet unique, solute specificity profile –common with other plant NCS1. Yeast containing PgNCS1 transport adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, xanthine and uracil and are sensitive to growth on 8-azaadenine. Neither cytosine nor 5 flourocytosine are transported by PgNCS1 but along with caffeine and uric acid, act as competitive inhibitors of [³H]-adenine and [³H]-hypoxanthine uptake. This transporter displays high affinity for adenine (Kₘ = 2.67 μM), guanine (Kᵢ = 1.71 μM) and hypoxanthine (Kᵢ = 1.82 μM) but lesser affinity for xanthine (Kᵢ = 5.36 μM). Arabidopsis plants that are deficient in their endogenous NCS1, yet carry PgNCS1, show significant uptake of [³H]-adenine. The results support previous studies and together confirm a broad nucleobase transport and binding pattern for plant NCS1 across the viridiplantae.  aPublisher supplied data  aCONH00652cUSDA Hatch Fund 3aArabidopsis 3aPicea glauca 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aadenine 3acaffeine 3acations 3acytosine 3agenome 3aguanine 3aheterologous gene expression 3ahypoxanthine 3aloci 3aorgan culture 3asolutes 3asymporters 3auracil 3auric acid 3axanthine 3ayeasts1 aMack, Laura1 aSchein, Jessica R.1 aHunt, Kevin A.1 aAlexander, Candace R.1 aSchultes, Neil P.1 aMourad, George S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5488-04860 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2021 Aug., v. 146, no. 2 p.237-247dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33513x0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-021-02063-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245018300165300001400348520138800362592002801750650002201778650001701800650002501817650001701842650002001859650001501879650001101894650001301905650001801918650001801936650001901954650000701973650001801980650001701998653001902015653003402034653004402068653003802112653006002150700001302210700001202223700003402235700001402269700001602283700001502299773013302314856008702447852000902534655001202543IND60776793320221121024412.0220531e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077679332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Na10aPreparation, characterization and antioxidant activity of sinapic acid grafted chitosan and its application with casein as a nanoscale delivery system for black rice anthocyanins  ap. 33-43.  aAnthocyanins (ACNs) have attracted considerable research attention because of their excellent health benefits, but their low stability and bioavailability limit their applications. In this study, sinapic acid-grafted-chitosan (SA-g-CS) conjugate was synthesized by grafting SA onto CS via a free radical mediated method. Nanoparticles were prepared using casein (CA) together with SA-g-CS to improve the performance and sustained release of black rice anthocyanins (BRA). The results of UV–Vis, FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra for SA-g-CS conjugates demonstrated the successful grafting of SA onto CS. The results of DPPH, ABTS and ferric ion reducing antioxidant power assays showed that the SA-g-CS conjugates had strong antioxidant capacities, and the higher the pH of the grafting reaction system, the stronger the antioxidant capacity of the conjugates. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analyses showed that the crystallographic property and microstructure of CS were improved by the grafting of SA. Compared with BRA loaded nanoparticles prepared with CA alone or the combination of CS and CA, the BRA loaded nanoparticles constructed by SA-g-CS and CA have smaller particle size, better dispersion, encapsulation efficiency and sustained-release property. These results provided great potential for the application of phenolic acid grafted CS in stabilizing ACNs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abioavailability 3ablack rice 3acasein 3achitosan 3aencapsulation 3afree radicals 3amicrostructure 3apH 3aparticle size 3asinapic acid 0aGrafting ratio 0aSinapic acid-grafted-chitosan 0aFerric reducing antioxidant power assay 0aDiphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical 0a2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid1 aPan, Fei1 aAi, Xin1 aTuersuntuoheti, Tuohetisayipu1 aZhao, Lei1 aZhao, Liang1 aWang, Yong0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 June 15, v. 210 p.33-43dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03372naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245021200169300002000381520160100401592002802002650002302030650000802053650003202061650005202093650001702145650001202162650001302174650003602187650002402223650001002247650001102257650001302268650001202281650002202293650004402315650001602359650002002375650001202395700003202407700003502439700003702474700002402511700002002535700001602555700003002571700003202601773012502633856007502758852000902833655001202842IND60757118620221122051615.0211122e20211101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075711862DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra06309j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAssis, Letícia Cristina10aTheoretical insights into the effect of halogenated substituent on the electronic structure and spectroscopic properties of the favipiravir tautomeric forms and its implications for the treatment of COVID-19  ap. 35228-35244.  aIn this study, we systematically investigated the electronic structure, spectroscopic (nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared, Raman, electron ionization mass spectrometry, UV-Vis, circular dichroism, and emission) properties, and tautomerism of halogenated favipiravir compounds (fluorine, chlorine, and bromine) from a computational perspective. Additionally, the effects of hydration on the proton transfer mechanism of the tautomeric forms of the halogenated favipiravir compounds are discussed. Our results suggest that spectroscopic properties allow for the elucidation of such tautomeric forms. As is well-known, the favipiravir compound has excellent antiviral properties and hence was recently tested for the treatment of new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Through in silico modeling, in the current study, we evaluate the role of such tautomeric forms in order to consider the effect of drug-metabolism in the inhibition process of the main protease (Mᵖʳᵒ) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 virus. According to the molecular docking, all halogenated compounds presented a better interaction energy than the co-crystallized active ligand (−3.5 kcal mol⁻¹) in the viral RdRp, in both wild-type (−6.3 to −6.5 kcal mol⁻¹) and variant (−5.4 to −5.6 kcal mol⁻¹) models. The variant analyzed for RdRp (Y176C) decreases the affinity of the keto form of the compounds in the active site, and prevented the ligands from interacting with RNA. These findings clearly indicated that all these compounds are promising as drug candidates for this molecular target.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aRNA 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aactive sites 3abromine 3achlorine 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acomputer simulation 3adrugs 3aenergy 3afluorine 3aligands 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aproteinases 3atautomerization 3aviruses1 aCastro Alves, Alexandre de,1 ade Jesus, João Paulo Almirão1 ada Cunha, Elaine Fontes Ferreira1 aNepovimova, Eugenie1 aKrejcar, Ondrej1 aKuca, Kamil1 aRamalho, Teodorico Castro1 aLa Porta, Felipe de Almeida0 tRSC advances.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 11, no. 56 p.35228-35244dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra06309j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002800191245010500219300001600324500001500340506007600355520131400431592002801745506003701773650001601810650003701826650002101863650000901884650001801893650001601911650001201927650001201939650001001951650001901961650001601980650002501996650001402021650001902035650002002054650001402074650002402088650001502112650001002127650001502137651001802152653002602170700002402196700002402220700001702244700001902261773010302280856005102383852000902434655001202443IND50076175620221207104702.0140410e20110501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007617562DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2011.5519882doi7 aPMC34270082pmcid7 a215478502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTantamango, Yessenia M.10aFoods and Food Groups Associated With the Incidence of Colorectal Polyps: The Adventist Health Study  ap. 565-572.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aColorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The majority of CRC arise in adenomatous polyps and 25–35% of colon adenoma risk could be avoidable by modifying diet and lifestyle habits. We assessed the association between diet and the risk of self-reported physician-diagnosed colorectal polyps among 2,818 subjects who had undergone colonoscopy. Subjects participated in 2 cohort studies: the AHS-1 in 1976 and the AHS-2 from 2002–2005. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the period risk of incident cases of polyps; 441 cases of colorectal polyps were identified. Multivariate analysis adjusted by age, sex, body mass index, and education showed a protective association with higher frequency of consumption of cooked green vegetables (OR 1 time/d vs. <5/wk = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.59–0.97) and dried fruit (OR 3+ times/wk vs. <1 time/wk = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.58–0.99). Consumption of legumes at least 3 times/wk reduced the risk by 33% after adjusting for meat intake. Consumption of brown rice at least 1 time/wk reduced the risk by 40%. These associations showed a dose-response effect. High frequency of consumption of cooked green vegetables, dried fruit, legumes, and brown rice was associated with a decreased risk of colorectal polyps.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afood groups 3apolyps (pathological conditions) 3ameat consumption 3arisk 3adose response 3acolonoscopy 3alegumes 3aadenoma 3acolon 3acohort studies 3adried fruit 3acolorectal neoplasms 3alifestyle 3arisk reduction 3abody mass index 3aeducation 3aregression analysis 3abrown rice 3adeath 3avegetables 3aUnited States 0amultivariate analysis1 aKnutsen, Synnove F.1 aBeeson, W.

Gas molecules selectively interacting with one metal element induces a dynamic structural change of alloy nanoparticles under reaction conditions and largely controls their catalytic properties. However, such a multicomponent dynamic-interaction-controlled evolution, both structural and chemical, remains far from clear. Herein, by using state-of-the-art environmental TEM, we directly visualize, in situ at the atomic scale, the evolution of a AuCu alloy nanoparticle supported on CeO₂ during CO oxidation. We find that gas molecules can “free” metal atoms on the (010) surface and form highly mobile atom clusters. Remarkably, we discover that CO exposure induces Au segregation and activation on the nanoparticle surface, while O₂ exposure leads to the segregation and oxidation of Cu on the particle surface. The as-formed Cu₂O/AuCu interface may facilitate CO–O interaction corroborated by DFT calculations. These findings provide insights into the atomistic mechanisms on alloy nanoparticles during catalytic CO oxidation reaction and to a broad scope of rational design of alloy nanoparticle catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloy nanoparticles 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aceric oxide 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3acuprous oxide 3aelectrochemistry 3agold 3ananogold 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aChen, Shuyue1 aXu, Qian1 aHe, Yang1 aDong, Zejian1 aZhang, Lifeng1 aZhu, Junfa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0888-42611 aDu, Yingge1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9680-19501 aYang, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6904-66461 aWang, C.q(Chongmin),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3327-09580 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Feb. 04, v. 142, no. 8 p.4022-4027dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b139013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008700167300001600254520165800270592002801928650001101956650001101967650001401978650001501992650001202007650001902019650001102038650002302049650001902072650001402091650001102105650001102116650002702127650001102154651001902165651001402184651001602198651002202214700001502236773011302251856008202364990002302446852000902469655001202478IND60097664420221119220249.0141104e20111210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009766442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2011.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosen, Timothy10aRiverine sediment inflow to Louisiana Chenier Plain in the Northern Gulf of Mexico  ap. 279-288.  aThe Louisiana Chenier Plain is a geomorphologic extension of the Mississippi Deltaic Plain, highly influenced by sediments originating from the Mississippi River. With the Mississippi River unable to avulse closer to the Plain local riverine sediment resources are integral to maintaining the physical and ecological integrity of the estuaries and marshlands. To gain insight into the sediment resources, this study assessed two decades (1990–2009) of discharge and total suspended solids (TSS) of four rivers, Sabine River, Calcasieu River, Mermentau River, and Vermilion River that flow into the Chenier Plain. The study quantified long-term sediment delivery, analyzed seasonal and inter-annual trends of sediment transport, and investigated the effect of hydrometeorological conditions on sediment yields. Total sediment delivery from the rivers over the 20-year period was 6.86 × 10⁶ tonnes, with the Sabine River contributing 62% of the sediment load. The Sabine River also showed a significant decreasing trend (p = 0.03) in annual sediment yield. Long-term trends of sediment loads in all the rivers were influenced by their discharge, not their TSS concentrations. Annual mean sediment load was 342,950 tonnes with higher sediment loading during the winter and spring months and lower during the summer and fall months. Annual sediment inflow has the capacity to create 2.3 × 10⁷ m² of land to the depth of 1 cm, but most of this sediment is unable to reach the coastline. The greatest asset that these rivers provide for the Chenier Plain is sediment and freshwater for restoration of marsh lost to salinization or inundation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3acoasts 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3amarshes 3apollution load 3arivers 3asediment transport 3asediment yield 3asediments 3aspring 3asummer 3atotal suspended solids 3awinter 3aGulf of Mexico 3aLouisiana 3aMississippi 3aMississippi River1 aXu, Y.

Grassland will continue to be an important form of land use in Europe, but with increased diversity in management objectives and systems used. Besides its role as basic nutrient for herbivores and ruminants, grasslands have opportunities for an adding value by exploiting positive health characteristics in animal products from grassland and through the delivery of environmental benefits. But even for grassland it is very difficult to create a good frame for its different tasks (1) the provision of forage for livestock, (2) protection and conservation of soil and water resources, (3) furnishing a habitat for wildlife, both flora and fauna and (4) contribution to the attractiveness of the landscape. Nevertheless it is the only crop able to fulfil so many tasks and to fit so many requirements.

A novel halophilic microalgae, Aphanothece halophytica is selected as a potential source to satisfy the enormous energy needs. This species is highly resilient to environmental changes and can effectively utilize both organic and inorganic nutrients. Commercialization of biodiesel production is hindered by its production cost which necessitates advances in quantitative and qualitative microalgae cultivation. In this work, the salinity and major nutrient sources such as nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium of the standard Jaworski’s medium are replaced with commercial agricultural fertilizers like urea (N), single super phosphate (P) and muriate of potash (K) respectively and its concentrations optimized for the growth rate. The result showed maximum growth at 60ppt salinity, 0.05gl−1 (N), 0.5gl−1 (P) and 0.5gl−1 (K). Then a novel attempt is made to identify a low cost media, involving organic–inorganic (seaweed extract+NPK), inorganic (micronutrients+NPK), organic (vermicompost medium) for maximizing growth rate and lipid productivity, which is then compared with the standard Jaworski’s medium. A. halophytica gave the highest cell density of 21.6×106±0.17cellsml−1 on the 20th day with a lipid content of 29±0.1% by dry weight in seaweed extract+NPK medium. It’s potentiality for biodiesel production is further confirmed by the gas chromatography analysis of the lipid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphanothece halophytica 3aalgal oils 3abiodiesel 3acommercialization 3aenergy 3afuel production 3agas chromatography 3alipid content 3alipids 3amacroalgae 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3apotassium chloride 3asalinity 3aurea 3avermicomposts 0aAphanothece halophytica 0aMicroalgae 0aSeaweed extract 0aLipid 0aBiodiesel1 aEdwin Raj, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2383-83381 aKings, Ajith J.1 aAdhi Visvanathan, M.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2017 June 01, v. 141 p.93-100dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.05.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245006700166520129700233592002801530650001801558650002101576650003001597650002301627650001801650650002601668650001701694650001201711651001301723700002801736700002701764700003401791700001901825773012701844856007401971852000902045655001202054IND60652359820221118022031.0190712e20180719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065235982DNAL7 a10.3390/su100725212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFonseca, Luis  Miguel10aAssessment of Circular Economy within Portuguese Organizations  aThe move towards a new Circular Economy (CE) economic model has been advocated and supported in Portugal, however, there is limited research on this topic. To address this gap, a quantitative research based on an online survey was carried out among 99 Portuguese organizations, encompassing a wide range of sectors and sizes. The results show that CE is regarded as a strategic and relevant issue for profitability and value creation. Furthermore, the perception that it requires the adoption of new business models in addition to the classical &ldquo;reduce, reuse and recycle&rdquo; approach is growing. Moreover, based on the hypotheses raised, results suggest that the level of CE adoption is positively impacted by the status of the EMS (Environmental Management System) certification and the willingness to improve the environmental performance and achieve a sustainable business model. However, CE activities are still relatively modest and a friendlier context (fiscal, legal, organizational, etc.) and the stronger support from supply chain agents and consumers are required. Future research should focus on how to design and shape the transition from a linear to a CE economy and to ascertain if the positive attitude towards CE is materialized in changing the way business is done.  aPublisher supplied data 3acertification 3acircular economy 3aenvironmental performance 3amanagement systems 3aprofitability 3aquantitative analysis 3asupply chain 3asurveys 3aPortugal1 aDomingues, José  Pedro1 aPereira, Maria  Teresa1 aMartins, Florinda  Figueiredo1 aZimon, Dominik0 tSustainability.g2018 July 19, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100725213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01224naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245007600165300001600241520046300257592002800720650001300748650001200761650001600773651001100789773010100800856004800901852000900949655001200958IND4477261120221122010518.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447726112DNAL7 a10.1134/S10674136110601292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOzerskii, P.

Therefore, ready‐to‐eat food production and home processing of such foods are gaining importance. Spinach is one of the main ingredients used in ready‐to‐eat baby foods, and it is produced in chopped, blanched, juice, and powder forms. Commonly ready‐to‐eat meals are sold frozen. Therefore, thawing process becomes an important processing step. Conventional thawing (CT) methods require a long process time and high‐energy consumption. In the present study, frozen blanched spinach puree samples were thawed by ohmic thawing (OT) (10 V/cm, 15 V/cm). The thawing at 4°C (refrigerator thawing) was selected as the control thawing method. The energetic and exergetic evaluations were compared. Accordingly, thawing times were shortened by about 70–80% with OT. The energy loss during the CT method was higher than the OT method. The most energy‐efficient (64.2% ± 4.0%) thawing condition was determined as 15 V/cm OT. In case of exergetic evaluation, the destroyed exergy value of the CT method was highest (19.0 ± 2.0 kJ) while those of thawed with 10 and 15 V/cm were 5.8 ± 0.7 and 3.8 ± 0.4 kJ, respectively. Similar to energetic efficiency, OT with 15 V/cm had the highest exergy efficiency value (40.5% ± 2.6%) while that of the CT method was 11.6% ± 1.0%. The result of the present study indicated that the OT process could be an alternative thawing method to CT to improve energy efficiency. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: As the ready‐to‐eat meal habit is becoming more common, processing of such foods is becoming more important. While preparing food, it is desired that the process to be done quickly, homogeneously, and efficiently. Usage of current food technologies to provide fast and homogeneous heating is becoming widespread. However, examining and evaluating their efficiency also emerges as an important issue. In this study, the use of OT, which is one of the current methods, for the thawing of spinach puree was investigated and the efficiency of OT in different voltage gradients was evaluated. In this way, it is thought that important data about the efficiency of the ohmic heating process, which utilization is increasing day‐by‐day, during the thawing process are obtained. It is thought that these data will contribute to future studies and contribute to the widespread dissemination of OT.  aPublisher supplied data  a2209‐AcTürkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştirma Kurumu 3aelectric potential difference 3aenergy efficiency 3aexergy 3afood production 3aheat 3ajuices 3aprocessing time 3aready-to-eat foods 3arefrigerators 3aspinach1 aAzazi, Işın1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2046-44491 aDöner, Deniz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5889-97981 aBayana, Damla1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0466-74701 aÇokgezme, Ömer Faruk1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9806-22821 aİçier, Filiz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9555-33900 tJournal of food process engineering.g2022 July, v. 45, no. 7 p.e14015-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.140153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02970naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010700171300001600278520150300294592002801797650001401825650002401839650001101863650001101874650001201885650002301897650001801920650001101938650001001949650001301959650002501972653001901997653001802016653002402034653001102058653002302069653001702092653002302109653002202132653002102154700001402175700001602189700002102205700001702226700001302243773010102256856008602357852000902443655001202452IND60567146220221120194556.0170710e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056714622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.05.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdelsalam, E.10aEffects of Co and Ni nanoparticles on biogas and methane production from anaerobic digestion of slurry  ap. 108-119.  aNanoparticles (NPs) were hypothesized to enhance the anaerobic process and to accelerate the slurry digestion, which increases the biogas and methane production. The effects of NPs on biogas and methane production were investigated using a specially designed batch anaerobic system. For this purpose, a series of 2L biodigesters were manufactured and implemented to study the effects of Cobalt (Co) and Nickel (Ni) nanoparticles with different concentrations on biogas and methane production. The best results of NPs additives were determined based on the statistical analysis (Least Significant Difference using M-Stat) of biogas and methane production, which were 1mg/L Co NPs and 2mg/L Ni NPs (p<0.05). These NPs additives delivered the highest biogas and methane yields in comparison with their other concentrations (0.5, 1, and 2mg/L), their salts (CoCl2, and NiCl2) and the control. Furthermore, the addition of 1mg/L Co NPs and 2mg/L Ni NPs significantly increased the biogas volume (p<0.05) by 1.64 and 1.74 times the biogas volume produced by the control, respectively. Moreover, the aforementioned additives significantly increased the methane volume (p<0.05) by 1.86 and 2.01 times the methane volume produced by the control, respectively. The highest specific biogas and methane production were attained with 2mg/L Ni NPs (p<0.05), and were 614.5mlBiogasg−1VS and 361.6mlCH4g−1VS, respectively compared with the control which yielded only 352.6mlBiogasg−1VS and 179.6mlCH4g−1VS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3acobalt 3amethane 3amethane production 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3asalts 3aslurries 3astatistical analysis 0aNanotechnology 0aNanoparticles 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aBiogas 0aMethane production 0aTrace metals 0aChemical additives 0aManure management 0aSlurry treatment1 aSamer, M.1 aAttia, Y.A.1 aAbdel-Hadi, M.A.1 aHassan, H.E.1 aBadr, Y.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2017 June 01, v. 141 p.108-119dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.05.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02194naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245012300163300001600286520116000302592002801462650001701490650001901507650002501526653002001551653002301571653001201594653001901606700001301625700001601638773012201654856008301776852000901859655001201868IND60750813120221120044748.0220214e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075081312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.09.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Sihao10aElectronic and optical properties of two-dimensional GaN/ZnO heterojunction tuned by different stacking configurations  ap. 913-921.  aTwo-dimensional (2D) semiconductors show novel electronic and optoelectronic applications due to their excellent performance. The van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures are also a new method for the design of low dimensional optoelectronic devices. However, their fundamental electronic structure and optical properties are sensitive to stacking configurations. Herein, we perform systematic first-principle calculations for monolayer GaN and ZnO by six different stacking styles. The results suggest that the bonding type and stability vary with the stacking method. Chemical bonding and vdW interaction are respectively observed in different models. However, the carrier mobilities for different models are all enhanced after integration. Both type I and II band alignment can be generated from different stacking models. The optical properties suggest high absorptivity in the solar-blind region. This study is an early stage for the design and synthesis of photodetectors or solar cells based on 2D GaN/ZnO heterojunctions and also opens a far-ranging research interest in optoelectronic materials and devices with more advanced semiconductor materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorptivity 3asemiconductors 3avan der Waals forces 0aTwo-dimensional 0avdW heterojunction 0aGaN/ZnO 0aBand alignment1 aDiao, Yu1 aKan, Caixia0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Feb., v. 607 p.913-921dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.09.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245010700177300001800284520162800302592002801930596007401958650002302032650001202055650001402067650001202081650001102093650002202104650002202126650001902148650002302167650000902190650002702199650002202226651001102248700003202259700002302291700002702314700002402341700008402365773013602449856008302585852000902668655001202677IND60769034520221121074454.0220301e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076903452DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-021-01318-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreira, Rafael Oliveira10aGenetic diversity of cambuci [Campomanesia phaea (O.

Berg) Landrum (Myrtaceae), known as cambuci, is a native species from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest with great potential to be developed as a new fruit crop. Microsatellite markers were developed for cambuci to characterize the genetic diversity and to investigate the genetic structure of a group of accessions originally collected at the presumed center of the species diversity. This work involved the collection of 145 accessions from five regional groups (Juquitiba, Paraibuna, Mogi das Cruzes, Ribeirão Pires, and Salesópolis) in São Paulo state, Brazil. Fourteen loci were identified in an enriched genomic library developed from one of these accessions. Six of the 14 loci were polymorphic, disclosing 26 alleles. Based on the allele frequencies, the calculated genetic parameters of the five groups indicated an average allele number per locus (A) of 3.83, with an expected heterozygosity (He) of 0.57 and observed heterozygosity (Ho) of 0.54. Analysis of the genetic structure indicated that most of the genetic diversity was found within population (HS = 0.57), whereas the genetic diversity among populations was low (GST = 0.19). The genetic diversity parameter of Nei was considered low for the cambuci analyzed populations, with no evidence of inbreeding. Based on Darwin analysis, 18 accessions were chosen from the five regional populations to compose a core collection that included most of the genetic diversity found in this study. Our findings may contribute to defining better conservation strategies and genetic breeding approaches for this native species in Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014/126063cfundação de amparo à pesquisa do estado de são paulo 3aCampomanesia phaea 3aalleles 3aevolution 3aforests 3afruits 3agenetic variation 3agenomic libraries 3aheterozygosity 3aindigenous species 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aspecies diversity 3aBrazil1 ade Andrade Bressan, Eduardo1 aBremer Neto, Horst1 aJacomino, Angelo Pedro1 aFigueira, António,1 aMourão Filho, Francisco de Assis Alves,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8950-95130 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2022 Apr., v. 69, no. 4 p.1557-1570dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl49569x0925-98647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-021-01318-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005600140245009400196500001400290520160000304592002801904596001001932650000801942650001301950650001201963650001501975650002201990650001002012650001102022650001802033650001102051650001602062650001502078700002202093700001702115773013502132856007502267852000902342655001202351IND60782235520221123030628.0220706e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078223552DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.139532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoureh, Jean1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7846-777310aSimplified model of airflow and heat transfer in a pallet of food product generating heat  aEDITORIAL  aDuring storage, pallets of food product generating heat (e.g., cheese, fruit, and vegetable) are exposed to low velocity ventilation. In addition, the boxes have often little perforation. Therefore airflow is weak inside the boxes located downstream of the pallet; and if the product generates heat, its temperature can rise above the recommended one. Computational fluid dynamics modeling can predict these phenomena but needs an expertise of numerical fluid flow, a detailed description of product and packaging and leads to expensive computational costs. A simplified model is here developed based on a hydraulic network analogy. Given the vent holes areas of the boxes and the heat generation, it predicts the global air flow (flow through the box faces) and the product temperature. The predictions are in good agreement with experimental data. The software (Matlab executable) is easy to use and needs only some seconds to compute. It can be used to predict temperature evolution along a cold chain and to improve packaging and logistic operating conditions. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Based on a on a hydraulic network analogy, a simplified zonal model of airflow and heat transfer in a pallet of food generating heat is built with the Matlab software. It takes into account the vent holes areas of the boxes and the heat generation, and allows predicting the distribution of air fluxes through the box faces and the product temperature. The major advantage of this model is that it is easy to use and needs only some seconds to compute. Therefore, it can be easily used in industrial field.  aPublisher supplied data  cCNIEL 3aair 3aair flow 3acheeses 3acold chain 3acomputer software 3afoods 3afruits 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3atemperature 3avegetables1 aPhạm, Anh Thư,1 aFlick, Denis0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2022 July, v. 45, no. 7 p.e13953-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.139533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03259naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245008400187300001600271520141000287592002801697650001601725650001201741650002301753650001501776650001801791650002201809650001701831650001301848650001601861650001701877650001501894650001001909650002201919650001201941650004701953650002402000650002202024650002402046650003702070650003602107650003802143650005802181650001102239650002302250650001302273650002302286650004102309650003102350650002602381650004102407700003502448700001702483773008802500856004802588852000902636655001202645IND50067767920221116142129.0130712e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006776792DNAL7 a236867392pmid7 a10.1007/s10646-013-1079-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSobral, Olímpia10aCould contaminant induced mutations lead to a genetic diversity overestimation?  ap. 838-846.  aContaminant driven genetic erosion reported through the inspection of selectable traits can be underestimated using neutral markers. This divergence was previously reported in the aquatic system of an abandoned pyrite mine. The most sensitive genotypes of the microcrustacean cladoceran Daphnia longispina were found to be lacking in the impacted reservoir near the entrance of the metal rich acid mine drainage (AMD). Since that divergence could be, at least partially, accounted for by mutagenicity and genotoxicity of the AMD, the present study aimed at providing such a characterization. The Allium cepa chromosomal aberration assay, using root meristematic cells, was carried out, by exposing seeds to 100, 10, 1, and 0.1 % of the local AMD. Chromosomal aberrations, cell division phases and cell death were quantified after the AMD exposure and after 24 and 48 h recovery periods. The AMD revealed to be mutagenic and genotoxic, even after diluting it to 1 and 0.1 %. Dilutions within this range were previously found to be below the lethality threshold and to elicit sublethal effects on reproduction of locally collected D. longispina clonal lineages Significant mutagenic effects (micronuclei and chromosomal breaks) were also found at 0.1 % AMD, supporting that exposure may induce permanent genetic alterations. Recovery tests showed that AMD genotoxic effects persisted after the exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3aDaphnia 3aacid mine drainage 3acell death 3acell division 3agenetic variation 3agenotoxicity 3agenotype 3amutagenesis 3amutagenicity 3apollutants 3aseeds 3asublethal effects 2aAnimals 2aChromosome Aberrationsxchemically induced 2aChromosome Breakage 2aDNAxdrug effects 2aDaphniaxphysiology 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aGenetic Variationxdrug effects 2aIndustrial Wastexadverse effects 2aMicronuclei, Chromosome-Defectivexchemically induced 2aMining 2aMutagensxtoxicity 2aMutation 2aOnionsxphysiology 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity1 aMarin-Morales, Maria Aparecida1 aRibeiro, Rui0 tEcotoxicology.g2013 July, v. 22, no. 5 p.838-846dSpringer-Verlagx0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-013-1079-4  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005200144245012100196300002000317520160700337592002801944650004401972650002202016650002302038650001302061650001302074650001402087650003402101650002102135650002002156650001102176650003302187650001102220650002302231650001002254650001402264653001502278653003702293653001402330653001402344653002002358700001502378700001802393773014202411856007802553852000902631655001202640IND60650879220221121153440.0190710e20190618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065087922DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b075852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Qi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1448-406110aEnhanced Mechanical and Electrochemical Performances of Silica-Based Coatings Obtained by Electrophoretic Deposition  ap. 24308-24317.  aTo solve the existing problems of silicon dioxide (SiO₂) coating fabricated by the sol–gel method, such as complicated process, long production cycle, uncontrollable quality, etc., an improved electrophoretic deposition (EPD) combined with the sintering process was proposed to prepare SiO₂ coating on a dark nickel (Ni)-coated Q235 steel substrate. Silica sol was prepared by basic catalysis, containing silica of ∼130 g L–¹ with viscosities below 4 mPa s. Silica sol powder was characterized by the differential thermal analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. EPD was applied to prepare SiO₂ coating on the Ni adhesive layer, followed by the sintering process to improve the compactness. In addition, the effects of EPD and sintering parameters were also evaluated. Potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectra were utilized to assess the corrosion behavior of the coating. The results showed that the EPD coating demonstrated excellent wear resistance when deposited at 15 V for 40 s and sintered at 400 °C for 45 min, exhibiting ∼6 μm thickness and a compact morphology. It also showed superior corrosion resistance with icₒᵣᵣ of 1.02 × 10–⁷ A cm–², which was 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of dip-coating. Combining the EPD and sintering processes could shorten the fabrication period of SiO₂ inorganic coating and also improve the mechanical and corrosion properties, providing guidance for inorganic ceramic fabrication and showing potential for practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acatalytic activity 3aceramics 3acoatings 3acorrosion 3adifferential thermal analysis 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrophoresis 3anickel 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3asol-gel processing 3asteel 3aviscosity 0asilica sol 0aelectrophoretic deposition (EPD) 0asintering 0acorrosion 0awear resistance1 aWan, Wenlu1 aChen, Liqiong0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 June 18, v. 11, no. 27 p.24308-24317dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b075853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245015100168300001800319520135800337592002801695650002201723650002901745650002301774650001401797650001801811650001901829650003701848650001901885650001501904653001101919653001301930653001701943653001501960700001401975700001901989700001302008700001602021773012402037856008302161852000902244655001202253IND60750813420221120044645.0220214e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075081342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.09.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jianfeng10aOne-step method to prepare core-shell magnetic nanocomposite encapsulating silver nanoparticles with superior catalytic and antibacterial activity  ap. 1730-1740.  aA facile one-step method for synthesis of magnetic core–shell nanocomposite composed of h-Fe₃O₄ (hollow Fe₃O₄) core and stable PDA (polydopamine) shell with functional Ag NPs (silver nanoparticles) evenly distributed between them is developed. The h-Fe₃O₄@Ag/PDA nanocomposite showed excellent catalytic activity in the reaction for reducing azo dyes (methyl orange, methylene blue, and congo red), and the ratios of k values to the weight of h-Fe₃O₄@Ag/PDA were calculated to be 0.302, 0.0545, and 0.895 min⁻¹ mg⁻¹, respectively. Besides, the h-Fe₃O₄@Ag/PDA nanocomposite also exhibited good antibacterial activity in the experiment of culturing Bacillus subtilis, and the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) was as low as 12.5 μg/mL. Because the Ag NPs will not be leached in the solution under the protection of the PDA shell, the catalytic and antibacterial activities of h-Fe₃O₄@Ag/PDA nanocomposite could maintain more than 90% after five cycles. Intriguingly, this simple synthetic method can be extended to fabricate different multifunctional nanocomposites such as the spherical SiO₂@Ag/PDA and rod-like Fe₂O₃@Ag/PDA. Overall, the facile fabrication process, the superior catalytic and antibacterial activity, and the excellent stability, endow the h-Fe₃O₄@Ag/PDA to be a promising nanocomposite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aantibacterial properties 3acatalytic activity 3amagnetism 3amethyl orange 3amethylene blue 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3ananocomposites 3ananosilver 0aAg NPs 0aAzo dyes 0aPolydopamine 0aAntibiosis1 aCao, Ruya1 aSong, Wencheng1 aLiu, Lei1 aLi, Jiaxing0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Feb., v. 607 p.1730-1740dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.09.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03549naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245014300160500002000303520199100323592002802314596002102342650001802363650003702381650003102418650001702449650000902466650001302475650001602488650001402504650001302518650001202531650000902543650001902552650001702571650003602588650001102624650001502635650001302650650002102663651001102684700006102695700002102756700002102777700002602798773013502824856007502959852000903034655001203043IND60782235720221123040444.0220706e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078223572DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.137882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPappa, Eleni C.10aChemical, microbiological, sensory, and rheological properties of fresh goat milk cheese made by different starter cultures during storage  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFresh soft goat milk cheese was manufactured by two different starter cultures, a mixture consisting of mesophilic and thermophilic microorganisms, that is, Lactococcus Lactis subsp.cremoris, Lactococcus Lactis subsp. lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus (cheese A) and a mesophilic one containing Lactococcus Lactis subsp. cremoris and Lactococcus Lactis subsp. lactis(cheese B). The cheesemaking technology included milk pasteurization, starter culture incubation, milk clotting by liquid rennet and salting in brine containing 15% w/w NaCl. The cheeses were matured for 5 days at 16–17°C and then were packaged in shrink polyethylene bags under vacuum and transferred to cold room (3–4°C) for storage. The composition, microbiological, organoleptic and rheological properties of cheeses were investigated. Cheese microbiota was dominated by mesophilic lactobacilli and cocci. Yeasts and molds were found at the end of storage (60‐day) resulting in the gradual spoilage of cheeses. All cheeses received low scores for hardness while they were very much appreciated for their organoleptic properties. Cheese A presented lower levels of total volatile compounds at 5 days but higher at 60 days than cheese B. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: It is widely known that goat milk has high nutritional properties. In Greece, goat milk is usually added in sheep milk in order to produce protected designation of origin and other traditional cheeses. Greek goat milk cheeses are usually white—brined or hard cheeses and they are produced in small scale. The aim of the present study was to investigate the cheesemaking technology of fresh soft goat milk cheese and evaluate the influence of using different cultures on the chemical, microbiological, sensory and rheological properties of this cheese. The results have shown that a good quality fresh goat cheese can be manufactured with shelf life up to 60 days and mesophilic or mixed thermophilic–mesophilic cultures can be used.  aPublisher supplied data  cRegion of Epirus 3aLactobacillus 3aLactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 3acheesemaking 3acold 3aewe milk 3agoat cheese 3agoat milk 3ahardness 3aliquids 3amilk 3apasteurization 3apolyethylene 3aprotected designation of origin 3arennet 3ashelf life 3aspoilage 3astarter cultures 3aGreece1 aKondyli, Efthymia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0876-987X1 aBosnea, Loulouda1 aMalamou, Evdokia1 aVlachou, Anna‐Maria0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2022 July, v. 45, no. 7 p.e13788-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.137883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02256naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245009900162300001600261520091700277592002801194650002201222650001201244650002601256650002301282650001901305650001401324650000901338650001401347650001701361650001601378650001201394650001101406650001301417650002101430650000901451653001401460653002901474653001301503653003501516653000801551653000901559773012701568856008201695852000901777655001201786IND60478500720221123001057.0160121e20100601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047850072DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.58.2010.2.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakr, M.

Nitrogen was administered to the pea plants in the form of ammonium nitrate at increasing levels: 0, 100, 200 and 300 kg/ha. The experimental soil was loamy Ramann’s brown forest soil (Eutric Cambisol). Green peas were grown to green maturity and harvested according to standard agricultural practices. Following harvest, the fresh and dry weight of the pea and weed shoots were recorded. The nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium contents were determined from dried plant samples after digestion with concentrated sulphuric acid.The main results can be summarized as followsThe addition of nitrogen to the treatments considerably altered the growing potential of pea plants, especially at the early growth stage, where an increase in dry biomass of nearly 30% was observed. Yield biomass decreased in the nitrogen treatments. The nitrogen concentration, which increased in every treatment, was directly correlated to the addition of nitrogen fertilizer. Herbicides mainly influenced the vegetative growth of the plants. Pendimethalin and flumioxazin indirectly caused an increase in the dry biomass of the shoots by killing the surrounding weeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCambisols 3aChenopodium album 3aammonium nitrate 3abentazon 3abiomass production 3aclomazone 3adevelopmental stages 3adigestion 3afield experimentation 3aflumioxazin 3aforest soils 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aloam soils 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apeas 3apendimethalin 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3ashoots 3avegetative growth 3aweeds 0a<i>Pisum sativum</i> 0a<i>Chenopodium album</i> 0aherbicide treatments 0adry weight 0anitrogen %1 aNádasy, E.0 tActa agronomica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae.g2010 June 1, v. 58, no. 2 p.123-132dAkadémiai Kiadóx0238-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAgr.58.2010.2.33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02051naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245011600166300001600282520060300298592002800901650004400929650002200973650001500995650003001010650002601040650001001066650002101076650002601097650002401123650001801147650004401165650002401209650001301233650003301246650001401279650001301293650002601306650001501332700002001347700001901367700002301386773011501409856004801524852000901572655001201581IND4514288920221119064218.0150917e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451428892DNAL7 a10.1007/s10924-011-0310-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Nazia Umar10aDevelopment of Water-Borne Green Polymer Used as a Potential Nano Drug Vehicle and its In Vitro Release Studies  ap. 607-614.  aThis paper describes an ecofriendly development of a nanodrug delivery vehicle from seed oil.

The study is based on data collected as part of a long-term monitoring program in the Tsitsikamma National Park marine protected area, South Africa. As a test scenario, declining population trajectories of the most abundant species, Chrysoblephus laticeps, were simulated by introducing consecutive years of reduced recruitment over periods of 10 and 20 years applying an age-structured operating model. The operating model was designed to generate method-specific relative abundance indices and length–frequency data, using parameters derived from existing data collected in the long-term monitoring program. These were then fitted with an age-structured estimation model. Estimated spawner-biomass depletion was compared to the ‘true’ simulated population to quantify method-specific accuracy and bias using root-mean-squared error. Due to higher data variability and inherent size selectivity of angling, stereo-BRUVs provided more accurate spawner-biomass trends when describing a distinct population decline over 10 and 20 years. Additionally, spawner-biomass was found to be a more accurate population estimate than relative abundance indices due to the inclusion of population size structure information. The study demonstrates the potential of using simulation testing to evaluate sampling methods, given that the process generates the ‘true’ population with a known abundance and size structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3afish 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anational parks 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation size 3asport fishing 3aSouth Africa 0aChrysoblephus laticeps 0aAngling 0aFisheries 0aMarine protected area 0aSimulation model 0aStereo-BRUVs1 aWinker, Henning1 aBernard, Anthony1 aGötz, Albrecht,0 tEcological modelling.g2016 Aug. 10, v. 333 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245008500164300001600249520177900265592002802044650001702072650002202089650002302111650002002134650001302154650001302167650002302180650000902203650001802212650001602230650001602246650001602262650002602278650000902304650001902313650001802332650001002350651001202360653002302372653002002395653002002415700002002435773013202455856007602587961001302663852000902676655001202685IND60751361120221120030501.0210925e20210923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075136112DNAL7 a10.1653/024.104.03022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStuhl, Charles J.10aAttraction of Sitophilus zeamais (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) to Four Host Plants  ap. 158-161.  aThe maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais (Motschulsky) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is an important pest of stored grains, predominantly maize (Zea mays L.), wheat (Triticum L. spp.), rice (Oryza L. spp.), and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor [L.] Moench) (all Poaceae). Weevil infestations occur in the field and weevils are carried to the storage facility after harvest. Infestation also occurs in the grain storage facility. There is no effective field or storage trapping system for control. They are commonly parasitized by Pteromalidae Dalman (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea) spp. parasitoids in the Tropics; however, there is no biocontrol use of these Hymenoptera. Therefore, pesticide application and the development of resistant grain are the current control strategies; although, studies have indicated that odors associated with the grain upon which the weevils feed, mate, and oviposit are attractive to the weevil. Host plant produced volatiles and their associations with the maize weevil have not been investigated fully. To better understand the weevil's attraction to crop plants, a study was initiated to investigate the weevil's preference for immature host plants. Weevils that had been reared on 4 types of grain for several generations were presented immature plants of all 4 types of grains in choice tests to determine if they prefer grains of the host plant on which they had been reared. This research demonstrated that immature rice plants have the greatest attraction, and that previous feeding did not influence the weevil's host plant attraction. The isolation of key rice plant semiochemicals will be the focus in the development of an attractant for S. zeamais and may also prove effective for the control of Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae).  aPublisher supplied data 3aPteromalidae 3aSitophilus oryzae 3aSitophilus zeamais 3aSorghum bicolor 3aTriticum 3aZea mays 3abiological control 3acorn 3aentomologists 3ahost plants 3aoviposition 3aparasitoids 3apesticide application 3arice 3asemiochemicals 3astorage pests 3awheat 3aFlorida 0astored grain pests 0apest management 0ainsect behavior1 aRomero, Maritza0 tFlorida entomologist.g2021 Sept. 23, v. 104, no. 3 p.158-161dFlorida Entomological SocietywJournal:jnl44725x1938-51027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1653/024.104.03023Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245009600169300002000265520135200285592002801637650002001665650002801685650002101713650001501734650001801749650002001767650000901787650001301796650001101809650001801820650001901838650001801857650002201875650001201897650001701909650001301926653002201939653001701961653001101978653001901989653002302008653001202031653002402043653003702067700001902104700001902123700002502142700001902167700001902186700001802205700002302223700006002246700002102306700002102327700006202348773014202410856007802552852000902630655001202639IND60650879620221121090040.0190710e20190617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065087962DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b079802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertucci, Alessandro10aTumor-Targeting, MicroRNA-Silencing Porous Silicon Nanoparticles for Ovarian Cancer Therapy  ap. 23926-23937.  aSilencing of aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) has emerged as one of the strategies for molecular targeted cancer therapeutics. In particular, miR-21 is an oncogenic miRNA overexpressed in many tumors, including ovarian cancer. To achieve efficient administration of anti-miR therapeutics, delivery systems are needed that can ensure local accumulation in the tumor environment, low systemic toxicity, and reduced adverse side effects. In order to develop an improved anti-miR therapeutic agent for the treatment of ovarian cancer, a nanoformulation is engineered that leverages biodegradable porous silicon nanoparticles (pSiNPs) encapsulating an anti-miR-21 locked nucleic acid payload and displaying a tumor-homing peptide for targeted distribution. Targeting efficacy, miR-21 silencing, and anticancer activity are optimized in vitro on a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines, and a formulation of anti-miR-21 in a pSiNP displaying the targeting peptide CGKRK is identified for in vivo evaluation. When this nanoparticulate agent is delivered to mice bearing tumor xenografts, a substantial inhibition of tumor growth is achieved through silencing of miR-21. This study presents the first successful application of tumor-targeted anti-miR porous silicon nanoparticles for the treatment of ovarian cancer in a mouse xenograft model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aantineoplastic activity 3abiodegradability 3acell lines 3aencapsulation 3ain vivo studies 3amice 3amicroRNA 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aoligopeptides 3aovarian neoplasms 3asilicon 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 0apeptide targeting 0ananomedicine 0amiR-21 0acancer therapy 0amicroRNA silencing 0ain vivo 0alocked nucleic acid 0aCOV-318 ovarian cancer xenograft1 aKim, Kang-Hoon1 aKang, Jinyoung1 aZuidema, Jonathan M.1 aLee, Seo Hyeon1 aKwon, Ester J.1 aKim, Dokyoung1 aHowell, Stephen B.1 aRicci, Francesco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4941-86461 aRuoslahti, Erkki1 aJang, Hyeung-Jin1 aSailor, Michael J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4809-98260 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 June 17, v. 11, no. 27 p.23926-23937dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b079803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009000169300001600259520125900275592002801534650001601562650002501578650001701603650001801620650001301638650001301651650001201664650001901676650001701695650002301712650002101735650002401756650001401780650001101794650001301805650001501818653001301833653001901846653002001865653002101885700002001906773012601926856005102052852000902103655001202112IND50088537620221118234542.0140414e20120701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008853762DNAL7 a10.1080/10498850.2011.6015362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammond, M.

Chitosan has been shown to have antioxidant properties which could be beneficial in extending the shelf life of Atlantic salmon; however, the effects of chitosan molecular size on oxidation of salmon fillets have not been reported. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of chitosan coatings on lipid oxidation of Atlantic salmon fillet portions during 5 months frozen storage. The effects of chitosan molecular weight (high molecular weight, low molecular weight, and enzymatically degraded chitosan), concentration (0.5 and 1.0%), and the addition of 1% ascorbic acid to the chitosan coating were evaluated. Chitosan molecular weight significantly affected oxidation as evaluated by propanal levels and changes in L* values of the fillet portions. The chitosan treatment with added ascorbic acid resulted in the lowest propanal levels during 5 months of frozen storage. Manipulation of chitosan molecular weight and incorporation of natural antioxidants into chitosan coatings can provide an effective method of reducing lipid oxidation during extended frozen storage of seafood products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3achitosan 3acoatings 3afillets 3afrozen storage 3ahuman health 3alipid peroxidation 3amolecular weight 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aoxidation 3asalmon 3aseafoods 3ashelf life 0achitosan 0afrozen storage 0alipid oxidation 0amolecular weight1 aSkonberg, D.

The structure and morphology of products was characterized by Nuclear magnetic resonance (1H, 13C-NMR), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A novel chrome-free tanning process based on combination tanning with cage-like octa(aminosilsesquioxane) and tetrakis(hydroxymethyl) phosphonium sulfate (THPS) has been proposed. Hygrothermal stability test showed that the shrinkage temperature (Ts) of THPS tanned leather was obviously increased with the introduction of POSS-NH2, implying that THPS and POSS nanoparticles had synergistic effect in the combination tanning process. The tanning process is optimized as 6.0% POSS-NH2 combination with 2.5% THPS, endowing the leather with Ts above 83.0 °C and thickness rate 44.6%. FT-IR analysis showed that hydrogen bond were formed between amino groups of POSS and hydroxyl groups of collagen during tanning process. The results of scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) results reveal that POSS and THPS tanning agents could penetrate and bind evenly in the leather matrix, thus promoting the weaving of collagen fibers into a tight network structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acatalysts 3acollagen 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogen bonding 3aisopropyl alcohol 3aleather 3aleather tanning 3amoieties 3ananoparticles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ashrinkage 3asolvents 3asulfates 3atanning agents 3atemperature 3atetraethylammonium compounds 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aweaving 0aTHPS 0aPOSS 0aCombination tanning 0aCross-linking1 aWang, Pingping1 aShi, Jiabo1 aLi, Fan1 aLi, Wenbo1 aLyu, Bin1 aMa, Jianzhong0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Aug. 20, v. 229 p.1102-1111dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245012800183300001800311520123200329592002801561650001701589650001401606650002201620650003001642650001301672650002201685650000901707650002201716650001801738650001501756650003701771650004701808650002101855650001601876650008301892700001401975700001701989773013502006856008102141852000902222655001202231IND50074208420221118045959.0141211e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007420842DNAL7 a243668272pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-013-2437-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, J. L.12aA robust simulation–optimization modeling system for effluent trading—a case study of nonpoint source pollution control  ap. 5036-5053.  aIn this study, a robust simulation–optimization modeling system (RSOMS) is developed for supporting agricultural nonpoint source (NPS) effluent trading planning. The RSOMS can enhance effluent trading through incorporation of a distributed simulation model and an optimization model within its framework. The modeling system not only can handle uncertainties expressed as probability density functions and interval values but also deal with the variability of the second-stage costs that are above the expected level as well as capture the notion of risk under high-variability situations. A case study is conducted for mitigating agricultural NPS pollution with an effluent trading program in Xiangxi watershed. Compared with non-trading policy, trading scheme can successfully mitigate agricultural NPS pollution with an increased system benefit. Through trading scheme, [213.7, 288.8] × 10³ kg of TN and [11.8, 30.2] × 10³ kg of TP emissions from cropped area can be cut down during the planning horizon. The results can help identify desired effluent trading schemes for water quality management with the tradeoff between the system benefit and reliability being balanced and risk aversion being considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aemissions 3aissues and policy 3anonpoint source pollution 3aplanning 3apollution control 3arisk 3asimulation models 3awater quality 3awatersheds 2aAgriculturexeconomicsxmethods. 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aModels, Chemical 2aUncertainty 2aWater Pollutionxeconomicsxprevention & controlxstatistics & numerical data.1 aLi, Y.

In this work we have produced PHA from a low-cost substrate, Calophyllum inophyllum oil, using Cupriavidus necator. Effects of various process parameters such as Oil concentration, Nitrogen source and inoculum size on the production of PHA were studied using Response Surface Methodology. A quadratic equation was used in the model to fit the experimental data. It was found that the model could satisfactorily predict the PHA yield (R2=99.17%). Linear, quadratic and interaction terms used in the model were found to be statistically significant. Maximum PHA yield of 10.6gL−1 was obtained under the optimized conditions of oil concentration - 17.5%, inoculum concentration - 50mL/L and nitrogen content - 1.125gL−1, respectively. The product obtained was characterized using FTIR and NMR to confirm that it was PHA. The results demonstrate that C. inophyllum oil, a non-edible oil, can be potentially used as a low-cost substrate for the production of PHA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalophyllum inophyllum 3aCupriavidus necator 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiodegradability 3aequations 3ainoculum 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 3aresponse surface methodology 0aPolyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) 0aCupriavidus necator 0aCalophyllum inophyllum oil 0aCDW (cell dry weight)1 aSenthamizhan, S.G.1 aPonnusami, V.1 aSudalai, S.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 June, v. 112 p.598-607dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04008naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013100167300001600298520211000314592002802424650002102452650002802473650001402501650001502515650001802530650001702548650001602565650001102581650002302592650002302615650001502638650002302653650001702676650002702693650003702720650001502757650001102772650001302783650003402796650002002830650001302850650002802863650002402891650001302915650001402928653001502942653002002957653001402977653000802991653002202999653000803021653000903029653001103038653000803049653000903057653001003066700001603076700002103092700001803113773009703131856008503228852000903313655001203322IND60611282720221120223300.0181127e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061128272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2017.08.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Sunwoo10aNaringenin suppresses growth of human placental choriocarcinoma via reactive oxygen species-mediated P38 and JNK MAPK pathways  ap. 238-246.  aHuman placental choriocarcinoma is a gestational trophoblastic tumor with high rates of metastasis and reoccurrence. However, some patients with choriocarcinoma are chemoresistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents.Naringenin increases apoptosis in human placental choriocarcinoma cells.We investigated the effects of naringenin on proliferation and migration of JAR and JEG3 cells, and performed TUNEL and Annexin V/PI staining assays to examine apoptotic effects of naringenin on both cells. In addition, we studied the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) to determine the specific reason for apoptosis of choriocarcinoma cells being mediated via mitochondria. Consistent with the induction of production of ROS by naringenin in both choriocarcinoma cell lines, we investigated lipid peroxidation and glutathione levels in both JAR and JEG3 cells since both are affected by ROS. We next determined dose-dependent effects of naringenin and its pharmacological inhibitors on signal transduction pathways in JAR and JEG3 cells by western blot analyses.Naringenin reduced viability and migratory functions of both cell lines, and increased mitochondria related apoptosis induced by ROS and lipid peroxidation, decreased glutathione and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential MMP in a dose-dependent manner. We also determined naringenin activated phosphorylation of ERK1/2, P38, JNK and P70S6K in JAR and JEG3 cells in a dose-response manner. Although naringenin induced phosphorylation of AKT proteins in JAR cells, it suppressed phosphorylation of the protein in JEG3 cells. In addition, we confirmed the mechanism of naringenin-induced cell signaling by using a combination of naringenin and pharmacological inhibitors of the PI3K and MAPK pathways, as well as a ROS inhibitor in JAR and JEG3 cell lines.Collectively, results of this study indicate that naringenin is a potential therapeutic molecule with anti-cancer effects on choriocarcinoma cells by inducing generation of ROS and activation of the MAPK pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3acell lines 3adose response 3adrug therapy 3aglutathione 3ahumans 3alipid peroxidation 3amembrane potential 3ametastasis 3amigratory behavior 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anaringenin 3aoxygen 3apatients 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aproteins 3areactive oxygen species 3asignal transduction 3astaining 3aviability 0aNaringenin 0aChoriocarcinoma 0aApoptosis 0aROS 0aSignaling pathway 0aROS 0aPI3K 0aERK1/2 0aJNK 0aPCNA 0aTUNEL1 aLim, Whasun1 aBazer, Fuller W.1 aSong, Gwonhwa0 tPhytomedicine.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 50 p.238-246dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2017.08.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245015600208520160900364592002801973650002002001650001402021650001602035650001402051650001102065650001902076650002302095650001702118651001002135653001802145653002302163653001202186653001402198653001802212653001202230700001902242700002502261700002002286773011802306856008602424852000902510655001202519IND60734029020221119035228.0211213e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073402902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1124032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManish Kumar,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3351-729810aIndoor water end-use pattern and its prospective determinants in the twin cities of Gujarat, India: Enabling targeted urban water management strategies  aWater end-use studies disaggregate the quantity and frequency of water uses for various household purposes. Water end-use studies are available but none for India, which is gradually approaching a water-scarce condition from being a water-stressed country at present. This implies a need for incorporating water end-use understanding for augmenting urban recycling plans and strategies. To identify socio-demographic determinants of water end-use consumption for use in targeted urban water management, we focused on the indoor micro-components of bathing, dish-washing, laundering, and cleaning at households across the twin cities of Gujarat, a water-scarce province of India. A mixed-method approach was used for data collection in which questionnaire surveys (estimated or indirect measurements) were coupled with water meters (direct measurements) at households. The twin cities of Gujrat represent a spatial variation in greywater production at homes even at a distance of 30–40 km. Direct measurement showed less total average water consumption in Ahmedabad (83 L/HH/d) than Gandhinagar (105 L/HH/d), while indirect measurement showed indoor average consumption of 427 and 497 L/HH/d in the respective cities. Statistical significance of income, family size, and education was noticed on the water consumption pattern of a household. Besides, the study provides the attitude and practice of users towards water conservation behavior. We present new insights and recommendations for future urban water sustainability that are specific to India and applicable to several south-Asian countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aeducation 3afamily size 3agreywater 3aincome 3aquestionnaires 3awater conservation 3awater stress 3aIndia 0aWater end-use 0aUrban water crisis 0aGujarat 0aGreywater 0aQuestionnaire 0aRecycle1 aSharma, Ayushi1 aTabhani, Nareshkumar1 aŌtaki, Yurina,0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 June 15, v. 288 p.112403-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1124033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245022400163500001400387520129000401592002801691650001501719650001101734650002001745650001601765650001201781650001001793650001101803650001001814650001401824650001301838700002101851700002501872773012401897856007402021852000902095655001202104IND60715349320221118205548.0201026e20200928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071534932DNAL7 a10.3390/nu121029662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachida, Naomichi 10aClinical Effects of Dietary Supplementation of Lutein with High Bio-Accessibility on Macular Pigment Optical Density and Contrast Sensitivity: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Parallel-Group Comparison Trial  aNAL-light  aImprovements in macular pigment optical density (MPOD) and contrast sensitivity after administration of 12 mg lutein alone and the timing at which efficacy is observed remain unknown.

The study subjects comprised 59 healthy male and female adults aged 20–69 years. The study diet included a placebo (placebo group) or a diet supplemented with 12 mg of lutein (lutein group). Each study diet was continuously administered for 16 weeks. At weeks 8 and 16, MPOD, contrast sensitivity, glare sensitivity, and serum lutein levels were evaluated. Compared with the placebo group, the lutein group showed significantly improved MPOD, contrast sensitivity, and glare sensitivity at week 16 and significantly increased serum lutein levels at weeks 8 and 16. Continuous administration of lutein for 16 weeks, considering its bioaccessibility, increased MPOD; it made the outlines of visible objects clearer and was effective in inhibiting decreases in visual function caused by glare from light.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aadults 3abioavailability 3ablood serum 3afemales 3alight 3alutein 3amales 3anutrients 3aplacebos1 aKosehira, Marie 1 aKitaichi, Nobuyoshi 0 tNutrients.g2020 Sept. 28, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu121029663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008900168300001800257520130600275592002801581650001601609650002201625650001701647650003001664650002901694650003001723650001201753650002701765650001301792650001101805650000901816650001501825650001701840650002501857650000901882650001401891650000701905650001201912650001101924650001301935650002401948650001101972650001301983650002701996650002702023650001302050650001502063650002002078650001802098700001902116700001902135700002002154700002202174700001402196773014602210856008102356852000902437655001202446IND60575746520221118020402.0170728e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057574652DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-7962-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSultana, Tayyaba10aFish scales as a non-lethal tool of the toxicity of wastewater from the River Chenab  ap. 2464-2475.  aWater pollution is gradually increasing in natural waters through anthropogenic activities. This study aimed to use fish scales as a bio-indicator of pollution, along with water quality parameters, and the assessment and detection of selected heavy metals in water samples collected from the River Chenab, including the Chakbandi drain that gathers domestic sewage waste and industrial effluents from Faisalabad and deposits it into this freshwater body. All water quality parameters (pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), salinity, conductivity, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), phenols and sulphates) and concentrations of selected heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb and Cr) were found to be considerably higher than permissible limits as defined by the WHO, and therefore capable of causing ill health effects in aquatic organisms. Specimens of fish scales from selected fish were described qualitatively and observed quantitatively. In Catla catla, Labeo rohita and Cirrhinus mrigala, the scales showed several deformities in shape and different scale structures such as circuli, radii and annuli. In each of the three types of fish, considerable variation in the morphology of their scales was observed in specimens collected from polluted sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCatla catla 3aCirrhinus mrigala 3aLabeo rohita 3aWorld Health Organization 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3acadmium 3achemical oxygen demand 3achromium 3acopper 3afish 3afreshwater 3aheavy metals 3aindustrial effluents 3alead 3amanganese 3apH 3aphenols 3arivers 3asalinity 3ascales (integument) 3asewage 3asulfates 3atotal dissolved solids 3atotal suspended solids 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3awater pollution 3awater quality1 aSiddique, Amir1 aSultana, Salma1 aMahboob, Shahid1 aAl-Ghanim, Khalid1 aAhmed, Z.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Jan., v. 24, no. 3 p.2464-2475dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7962-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03437naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245007900200506007600279520141000355592002801765506003701793650003001830650001701860650002801877650001601905650001801921650001101939650002501950650001601975650001001991651001402001651001102015651001002026651001302036651001502049651001202064651001802076651000902094651001402103700002102117700002202138700002102160700003502181700003502216700003702251700003102288700002702319700003002346700001902376700002602395700002202421700002502443700002802468700003302496700004102529773012202570856007402692852000902766655001202775IND60650276620221207075935.0190709e20180322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065027662DNAL7 a10.3390/nu100403892doi7 aPMC59461742pmcid7 a295653082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFisberg, Mauro10aTotal and Added Sugar Intake: Assessment in Eight Latin American Countries  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNon-communicable diseases are growing at an alarming rate in Latin America. We assessed total and added sugar intake in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela, to verify the adequacy of the World Health Organization’s recommendations, considering gender, socioeconomic level (SEL) and age. A total of 9218 non-institutionalized individuals living in urban areas (age range 15–65 years) were assessed in the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (ELANS), a multicenter household population-based cross-sectional survey. Socio-demographic data were collected. Total and added sugar intakes were measured using two non-consecutive 24-h dietary recalls. The prevalence of excessive sugar intake was estimated. A large proportion of individuals showed high consumption of total and added sugar intake, which reflected in the high prevalence of excessive sugar intake. With minimal differences across countries, in general, women, individuals with high SEL, and younger people had higher percentages of total energy intake from total and added sugar intake, and of contribution of carbohydrates from total and added sugars. Thus, there is high consumption of total and added sugar intake in the Latin American countries with some peculiarities considering socio-demographic variables, which should be considered in each country’s health intervention proposals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadded sugars 3across-sectional studies 3adiet recall 3aenergy intake 3agender 3asocioeconomic status 3aurban areas 3awomen 3aArgentina 3aBrazil 3aChile 3aColombia 3aCosta Rica 3aEcuador 3aLatin America 3aPeru 3aVenezuela1 aKovalskys, Irina1 aGómez, Georgina,1 aRigotti, Attilio1 aSanabria, Lilia Yadira Cortés1 aGarcía, Martha Cecilia Yépez1 aTorres, Rossina Gabriella Pareja1 aHerrera-Cuenca, Marianella1 aZimberg, Ioná Zalcman1 aKoletzko, B.q(Berthold),1 aPratt, Michael1 aAznar, Luis A.

Increasing attention has been paid to the development of an effective strategy for ZEN decontamination. ZEN is oxidized into smaller estrogenic metabolites by a novel peroxiredoxin (Prx) isolated from Acinetobacter sp. SM04. The Prx coding gene was cloned in a secretory vector pYES2-alpha (pYα) with an alpha (α) signal peptide gene inserted into the multiple cloning site of pYES2. The recombinant Prx was secreted from Saccharomyces cerevisiae INVSc1 after inducing with 2% (w/v) galactose for 72h, and was found to be nearly 20kDa through 12% SDS-PAGE. The expressed amount of recombinant Prx was 0.24mg/mL in the extracellular supernatant. Recombinant Prx showed a gradient increase at the beginning of ZEN degradation. The final ZEN degradation amount was 0.43μg by one unit recombinant Prx after 12h. Furthermore, the temperature, H2O2 concentration, and pH for highest peroxidase activity of recombinant Prx were 80°C, 20mM and 9.0, respectively. When compared with other peroxidases, the thermal stability and alkali resistance of recombinant Prx were much better. The results suggest that recombinant Prx is successfully expressed in S. cerevisiae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aFusarium 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3adecontamination 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3agalactose 3agenes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alivestock 3ametabolites 3apH 3aperoxidase 3aperoxiredoxin 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3areproductive disorders 3asignal peptide 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3azearalenone 0aSecretory expression 0aZearalenone 0aDetoxification 0aPeroxiredoxin1 aXiao, Junmei1 aChen, Yi1 aYu, Yigang1 aXiao, Xinglong1 aYu, Yuanshan1 aWu, Hui0 tMicrobiological research.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 168 p.6-11dElsevier GmbHx0944-50137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2012.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245014600166300001600312520142600328592002801754650000801782650002601790650002901816650002901845650001301874650001301887650001401900650001601914650001401930650001601944650002201960650002001982650001002002650002202012650001002034650001602044650001802060650001702078650001402095650002202109650001002131650003202141653002902173653001602202653003202218653001602250700001502266700001602281700001202297700001302309700001502322700002102337700001802358700001702376773010702393856008502500852000902585655001202594IND60583912920221119141215.0190403e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058391292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Maojun10aCholesterol exacerbates Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae-induced apoptosis via stimulating proliferation and adhesion to porcine alveolar macrophages  ap. 112-118.  aMycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyo) is the agent of porcine enzootic pneumonia, a disease that causes considerable economic losses in the swine industry. Induction of apoptosis in porcine alveolar macrophages is an important pathogenic mechanism of M. hyo. Cholesterol has been reported to influence cell adherence and cell invasion of Mycoplasma gallisepticum and Mycoplasma fermentans leading to apoptosis, but the role of cholesterol on the apoptotic inducing activity of M. hyo remains unknown. In this study, we found a positive correlation between cholesterol level and M. hyo infection in porcine serum and lung tissue. Cholesterol exacerbated M. hyo-induced apoptosis in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) in a dosage-dependent manner, which was associated with increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO) production, up-regulated TNF-α mRNA expression, and activated caspase-3. The pathogenicity-enhancing effect of cholesterol was related to increased M. hyo proliferation with an up-regulation of M. hyo genes responsible for DNA and protein synthesis, which led to improved M. hyo adherence to PAMs, presumably via increased mRNA expression of adhesin genes. In conclusion, cholesterol promotes the apoptotic effect of M. hyo through stimulating proliferation and enhancing its adherence to PAMs. Hence, the study gives new insights into the role of cholesterol on the PAM – M. hyo interations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aMycoplasma fermentans 3aMycoplasma gallisepticum 3aMycoplasma hyopneumoniae 3aadhesins 3aadhesion 3aapoptosis 3ablood serum 3acaspase-3 3acholesterol 3aenzootic diseases 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alungs 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3anitric oxide 3apneumonia 3aprotein synthesis 3aswine 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aMycoplasma hyopneumoniae 0aCholesterol 0aPorcine alveolar macrophage 0aInteraction1 aDu, Gaimei1 aLiu, Beibei1 aHu, Yun1 aLiu, Jie1 aJia, Yimin1 aMinion, F.

Adult male specimens of T. carnifex were exposed daily to cadmium (44.5nM/L and 178nM/L as CdCl2, nominal concentrations), respectively, during 3- and 9-months; at the same time, control newts were exposed to tap water only. The accumulation of cadmium in the skin, liver and kidney, the levels of metallothioneins in the skin and the liver, the expression of metallothionein mRNA in the liver, as well as the presence of histological alterations and of apoptosis in the target organs were evaluated. The 9-months exposure induced cadmium accumulation in all the tissues examined; moreover, histological changes were observed in all the tissues examined, irrespective of the dose or the time of exposure. Apoptosis was only detected in the kidney, whereas metallothioneins and metallothionein mRNA did not increase. This study demonstrates that the existing chronic water quality criterion established for cadmium induces in the newt T. carnifex cadmium accumulation and histological alterations in the target organs examined. Together with our previous results, showing that, at these same concentrations, cadmium induced endocrine disruption, the present results suggest that the existing chronic water quality criterion for cadmium appears to be not protective of amphibians.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphibia 3aadults 3aapoptosis 3acadmium 3aexposure duration 3afreshwater 3akidneys 3aliver 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3ametallothionein 3amunicipal wastewater 3asalamanders and newts 3atap water 3atissues 3awater quality 0aAmphibians 0aApoptosis 0aCadmium 0aEnvironment 0aMetallothionein 0aTriturus carnifex1 aGay, Flaminia1 aScudiero, Rosaria1 aTrinchella, Francesca1 aCaputo, Ivana1 aLepretti, Marilena1 aMarabotti, Anna1 aEsposito, Carla1 aLaforgia, Vincenza0 tAquatic toxicology.g2016 Apr., v. 173 p.63-73dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2016.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245012600170300001800296520144200314592002801756650001701784650001101801650001301812650001701825650002101842650002201863650001301885650002201898650001401920650002201934650001401956650002701970650001401997700005602011700002002067700001802087700001702105700001702122700001502139700001902154700002202173700001502195773011902210856008702329852000902416655001202425IND60684531920221121063926.0200220e20200123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068453192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b043252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Huihui10aIn Situ Synthesis of MnO₂/Porous Graphitic Carbon Composites as High-Capacity Anode Materials for Lithium-Ion Batteries  ap. 2480-2491.  aUnique high-capacity MnO₂/porous graphitic carbon (MnO₂/PGC) composites were fabricated by a mild and efficient in situ precipitation approach using PGC derived from coal tar pitch as the carbonaceous precursor and KMnO₄ as the manganese source. MnO₂/PGC composites with reasonable surface areas (190–229 m² g–¹) retain the superior structure of interconnected nanopores and graphitic crystallite from PGC and contain evenly distributed MnO₂ modified on the surface of the carbon skeleton in PGC, which can not only provide sufficient active sites for lithium-ion storage but also enhance electron transport capability and efficient lithium-ion diffusion capability. As a result of the synergistic effect of PGC and MnO₂, MnO₂/PGC composites as anode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) exhibit excellent reversible capacity, rate performance, and cycling stability. In particular, the MnO₂/PGC-36 composite possesses a high initial reversible capacity of 1516 mAh g–¹ at a current density of 0.05 A g–¹ and an average reversible capacity of 399 mAh g–¹ at a high rate of 5.00 A g–¹. Moreover, such a MnO₂/PGC-36 composite also exhibits a superior long-term cycling stability, with over 90.0% capacity retention after 400 cycles. These outstanding electrochemical performances demonstrate that the MnO₂/PGC composite can be a promising anode material in LIBs for further practical application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aanodes 3acoal tar 3acrystallites 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3agraphene 3alithium batteries 3amanganese 3amanganese dioxide 3ananopores 3apotassium permanganate 3asynergism1 aXing, Baolin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2475-12261 aZhang, Chuantao1 aChen, Lunjian1 aZhao, Huihui1 aHan, Xuefeng1 aYi, Guiyun1 aHuang, Guangxu1 aZhang, Chuanxiang1 aCao, Yijun0 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Jan. 23, v. 34, no. 2 p.2480-2491dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b043253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03703naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245010200167520250500269592002802774650003102802650001302833650001202846650002502858650002002883650001202903650001102915650001302926650001502939650001502954650002002969650001502989650002503004651001003029700002403039700003003063773012203093856008103215852000903296655001203305IND60768199320221120074805.0220225e20220206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076819932DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120204062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarvia, Filippo 10aMapping Ecological Focus Areas within the EU CAP Controls Framework by Copernicus Sentinel-2 Data  aGreening is a Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidy that ensures that all EU farmers receiving income support produce climate and environmental benefits as part of their farming activities. To receive greening support, it is mandatory for the farmer to carry out three agricultural practices that are considered environmentally and climate friendly: (a) crop diversification; (b) maintenance of permanent meadows and pastures; and (c) presence of an Ecological Focus Area (EFA). Contributions are delivered and monitored by paying agencies (PP) that ordinarily perform administrative checks and spot checks. The latter are provided through photo-interpretation of high-resolution satellite or aerial images and, in specific cases, through local ground checks (GC) as well. In this work, stimulated by the Piemonte Regional Agency for Payments in Agriculture (ARPEA), a prototype service to support PPs’ controls within the greening CAP framework was proposed with special concern for EFA detection. The proposed approach is expected to represent a valid alternative or supporting tool for GC. It relies on the analysis of NDVI time series derived from Copernicus Sentinel-2 data. The study was conducted in the provinces of Turin, Asti and Vercelli within the Piedmont Region (NW Italy), and over 12,500 EFA fields were assessed. Since the recent National Report No. 5465 stipulates that mowing and any other soil management operation is prohibited on set-aside land designated as an EFA during the reference period (RP) between 1st March and 30th June, a time series (TS) of NDVI in the same period was generated. Once averaged at plot level, NDVI trends were modelled by a first-order polynomial, and the correspondent statistics (namely, R², MAE and maximum residual) was computed. These were assumed to play the role of discriminants in EFA detection based on a thresholding approach (Otsu’s method), calibrated with reference to the training dataset. The threshold satisfaction was therefore tested, and, depending on the number of satisfied thresholds out of the possible three, EFA and non-EFA plots were detected with a different degree of reliability. The correspondent EFA map was generated for the area of interest and validated according to GCs as provided by the ARPEA. The results showed an overall accuracy of 84%, indicating that the approach is promising. The authors retain that this procedure represents a valid alternative (or integrating) tool for ground controls by PPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCommon Agricultural Policy 3aagronomy 3aclimate 3acrop diversification 3adata collection 3afarmers 3aincome 3apiedmont 3aprototypes 3asatellites 3asoil management 3astatistics 3atime series analysis 3aItaly1 aDe Petris, Samuele 1 aBorgogno-Mondino, Enrico 0 tAgronomy.g2022 Feb. 06, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120204063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245022500173300001600398520133900414592002801753650002301781650001101804650001801815650001601833650001001849650001601859650001001875650001301885650001201898650001401910650001401924650002401938650001401962650001401976650000901990653001501999653002802014653001302042653001402055700002102069700002102090700002402111700002702135773014402162856008202306852000902388655001202397IND60565823320221118050315.0190408e20170705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056582332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.etp.2017.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNwaehujor, Chinaka O.10aEffects of Artesunate on some biochemical parameters in pregnant albino Wistar rats challenged with lethal strain Plasmodium berghei NK65: Appreciating the activities of artemisinin drugs on key pregnancy hormone balance  ap. 408-411.  aIn humans, malaria in pregnancy can cause serious maternal and foetal morbidity and in extreme untreated cases, foetal mortality occurs. The therapeutic approach to curbing this malaise is the administration of an effective and/or combinations of anti-malaria medicaments. Acute or chronic administration of some of these drugs, however, gives rise to some adverse medical conditions including reproductive dysfunction, especially in pregnancy. Studies aimed at the hormonal interplays following administration of these drugs in pregnancy have been limited due to too few appropriate animal models. In this experiment, pregnant albino rats were infected with rodent parasite, Plasmodium berghei on the 5th day of gestation, following which biochemical changes, specific for pregnancy maintenance were monitored in the blood of test rats. We observed that infecting the pregnant rats with P. berghei negatively impacted the measured biological parameters (hormones) compared to unchallenged controls. The observed effect was however retreated following oral administration of 3mg/kg body weight, qDay of Artesunate until the 17th day of gestation. Findings, therefore, suggest that Artesunate is an effective therapeutic agent in pregnancy, demonstrated by the restoration of the hormonal changes occasioned by the parasitic infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium berghei 3aalbino 3aanimal models 3aartemisinin 3ablood 3abody weight 3adrugs 3ahormones 3amalaria 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aoral administration 3aparasites 3apregnancy 3arats 0aArtesunate 0aPlasmodium berghei NK65 0aHormones 0aPregnancy1 aAsuzu, Onyeka V.1 aNwibo, Daniel D.1 aNwobi, Obichukwu C.1 aEzeigbo, Ihechiluru I.0 tExperimental and toxicologic pathology.g2017 July 05, v. 69, no. 6 p.408-411dElsevier GmbHaElsevier GmbHwJournal:11954x0940-29937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.etp.2017.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02435naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245010000176300001400276520105600290592002801346650002501374650001001399650001401409650002201423650002601445650001201471650001101483650001101494650003301505650001401538650001101552653002001563653002601583653001301609653002501622653002101647653003301668700001901701700006301720773010901783856008801892852000901980655001201989IND60630733320221122203626.0190502e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063073332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2019.01.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalardeau, Mylène12aA random object-oriented population study of household paints measured by infrared spectroscopy  ap. 72-80.  aForensic paint analysis heavily relies on population studies and creation of databases for estimating frequencies of apparition and perform discrimination studies.

For this, 100 adulterated samples of mutton mixed with different proportions (0.5–1–2-5-10% (w/w)) of pork and 20 pure mutton samples were prepared. The results of the classification model of adulterated mutton and the quantitative prediction model of pork content established by this method were comparable for fresh, frozen-thawed and mixed datasets. It shows that the classification accuracies of adulteration mutton on three datasets were 100.00%, 100.00% and 99.95% respectively. Moreover, for the pork content prediction of adulterated mutton, the R² on three datasets of fresh, frozen-thawed and mixed samples were 0.9762, 0.9807 and 0.9479, respectively. Therefore, the hyperspectral combined with RP-CNN proposed in this paper shows great potential in the classification of adulterated mutton and the pork content prediction of adulterated mutton.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3ameat science 3amutton 3aneural networks 3apork 3aprediction 0aHyperspectral 0aAdulterated mutton 0aRecurrence plot 0aConvolutional neural network 0aQualitative discrimination 0aQuantitative prediction1 aZheng, Minchong1 aZhu, Rongguang1 aMa, Rong0 tMeat science.g2022 Oct., v. 192 p.108900-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2022.1089003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245006800159300001800227520125000245592002801495650001301523650001201536650001901548650001301567650001901580650001901599650003101618650001501649650002001664650001701684700001301701700001501714700001801729700001501747773014001762856007401902852000901976655001201985IND60618697820221120000003.0181030e20180313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061869782DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta00728d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Kang-Qiang10aPhotoredox catalysis over graphene aerogel-supported composites  ap. 4590-4604.  aThree-dimensional (3D) graphene aerogels, by virtue of their unique physicochemical properties, which result from the intrinsic properties of graphene and 3D porous structure characteristics, have attracted ever-increasing research interest in the field of photocatalysis for the sake of efficient utilization of solar energy.

The most dramatic changes are associated with the warm El Niño (EN) phase (opposite the cold La Niña phase), which disrupts the normal coastal upwelling and affects the dynamics of many coastal marine and terrestrial resources. This study presents a trophic model for Sechura Bay, located at the northern extension of the Peruvian upwelling system, where ENSO-induced environmental variability is most extreme. Using an initial steady-state model for the year 1996, we explore the dynamics of the ecosystem through the year 2003 (including the strong EN of 1997/98 and the weaker EN of 2002/03). Based on support from literature, we force biomass of several non-trophically-mediated ‘drivers’ (e.g. Scallops, Benthic detritivores, Octopus, and Littoral fish) to observe whether the fit between historical and simulated changes (by the trophic model) is improved. The results indicate that the Sechura Bay Ecosystem is a relatively inefficient system from a community energetics point of view, likely due to the periodic perturbations of ENSO. A combination of high system productivity and low trophic level target species of invertebrates (i.e. scallops) and fish (i.e. anchoveta) results in high catches and an efficient fishery. The importance of environmental drivers is suggested, given the relatively small improvements in the fit of the simulation with the addition of trophic drivers on remaining functional groups’ dynamics. An additional multivariate regression model is presented for the scallop Argopecten purpuratus, which demonstrates a significant correlation between both spawning stock size and riverine discharge-mediated mortality on catch levels. These results are discussed in the context of the appropriateness of trophodynamic modeling in relatively open systems, and how management strategies may be focused given the highly environmentally influenced marine resources of the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgopecten purpuratus 3aEl Nino 3aLa Nina 3aOctopodidae 3abiomass 3acold 3adetritivores 3aecosystems 3afish 3afisheries 3alittoral zone 3amarine resources 3amodels 3amortality 3aregression analysis 3ascallops 3aspawning 3aPeru1 aWolff, Matthias1 aVadas, Flora1 aYamashiro, C.q(Carmen),0 tHelgoland marine research.g2008 Mar., v. 62, no.

The surface signature of such events is of a small scale; it shows a complex interaction with the local environment and depends greatly on the effluent and marine water constitution. In the context of remote sensing techniques for detecting treated wastewater discharges, we study the surface signature of small river plumes, as they share specific characteristics, such as higher turbidity levels and increased nutrient concentration, and are fresh compared to the salty marine water. The Bulgarian Black Sea zone proves to be a challenging study area, with its optically complex waters and positive freshwater balance. Additionally, the Bulgarian Black Sea coast is a known tourist destination with an increased seasonal load; thus, the problem of the identification of wastewater discharges is a topical issue. In this study, we analyze the absorption components of the Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs) for 84 study points that are located at outfall discharging areas, river estuaries and at different distances from the shoreline, reaching the open sea area at a bottom depth of more than 2000 m. The calculations of IOPs take into account all available Sentinel 2 cloudless acquisitions for three years from 2017 until 2019 and are performed using the Case-2 Regional CoastColour (C2RCC) processor, implemented in the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP). The predominant absorber for each study area and its temporal variation is determined, deriving the specific characteristics of the different areas and tracking their seasonal and annual course. Optical data from the Galata AERONET-OC site are used for validating the absorption coefficient of phytoplankton pigment. A conclusion regarding the possibility of distinguishing riverine, marine and coastal water is derived. The study provides a sound basis for estimating the advantages and drawbacks of optical satellite data for tracking the extent of effluent and fluvial plumes with unknown concentrations of optically significant seawater constituents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3acoastal water 3acoasts 3afreshwater 3anutrient content 3aphytoplankton 3aremote sensing 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3aseawater 3ashorelines 3atemporal variation 3atourists 3aturbidity 3awastewater 3aBlack Sea1 aPeneva, Elisaveta 1 aSlabakova, Violeta 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Oct. 13, v. 13, no. 20dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs132040943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245013700173520171500310592002802025650002802053650001802081650001302099650002502112650001202137650001502149650001602164650001102180650001702191650004102208650001702249650001602266650002202282650001302304700001902317700002502336700001802361773012202379856008102501852000902582655001202591IND60768199620221120064233.0220225e20220206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076819962DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120204082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGopalakrishnan, Vinoj 10aFrom the Lab to the Field: Combined Application of Plant-Growth-Promoting Bacteria for Mitigation of Salinity Stress in Melon Plants  aSoil salinization is a major and increasing problem adversely impacting plant growth and crop production. Accordingly, coping with this problem has become a central topic in agriculture. In this study, we address this issue by evaluating the potential effectiveness of two bacterial species, Azospirillum brasilense and Paenibacillus dendritiformis, in enhancing growth and yield of melon and tomato plants under salinity stress. In vitro laboratory experiments indicated that these bacteria can efficiently colonize plant roots, and increase root length (25–33%) and root biomass (46–210%) of three melon plant varieties under saline stress. Similarly, greenhouse experiments showed that these bacteria significantly induced root (78–102%) and shoot weights (37–57%) of the three melon varieties irrigated with saline water. Tomato plants grown under the same conditions did not exhibit growth deficiency upon exposure to the saline stress and their growth was not enhanced in response to bacterial inoculation. Interestingly, saline-stressed melon plants inoculated with P. dendritiformis and A. brasilense exhibited lower total antioxidant activity compared to un-inoculated plants (80% vs. 60% of DPPH radical scavenging activity, respectively), suggesting that the inoculated plants experienced lower stress levels. These positive effects were further manifested by an increase of 16% in the crop yield of melon plants grown in the field under standard agricultural fertilization practices, but irrigated with saline water. Overall, these results demonstrate the beneficial effects of two plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria, which can significantly alleviate the negative outcome of salt stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzospirillum brasilense 3aPaenibacillus 3aagronomy 3aantioxidant activity 3abiomass 3acrop yield 3agreenhouses 3amelons 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3asaline water 3asalt stress 3asoil salinization 3atomatoes1 aBurdman, Saul 1 aJurkevitch, Edouard 1 aHelman, Yael 0 tAgronomy.g2022 Feb. 06, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120204083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245015400154300001800308520144400326592002801770650001301798650001601811650001601827650002101843650001001864650001301874650001301887650000901900650002601909650003101935650002701966650001001993650002102003650001302024700001602037700001802053700001402071700001902085700001802104700001502122700001402137700001402151773013902165856007402304852000902378655001202387IND60618697920221119235932.0181030e20180306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061869792DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta00736e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lei12aA pre-constructed graphene–ammonium polyphosphate aerogel (GAPPA) for efficiently enhancing the mechanical and fire-safety performances of polymers  ap. 4449-4457.  aThe attainment of both robust mechanical and fire-safety performances is a vital requirement for most polymer composites. Due to its unique structure and physical/chemical properties, graphene has been reported to act as an attractive additive to ameliorate the properties of polymers. However, several key issues should be resolved in advance before practical application, including the complicated dispersion process prior to incorporation into polymers, low flame retardant efficiency, etc. Herein, a sequential versatile strategy was developed to overcome these problems: (1) fabrication of a graphene–ammonium polyphosphate aerogel (GAPPA); (2) backfilling of polymers (taking poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as an example). The resultant PMMA/GAPPA composite possessed not only robust mechanical properties (e.g. an increase of ca. 100.5% and 130.6% in the reduced modulus and hardness, respectively) but also efficient fire-safety performance (e.g. a decrease of ca. 67.2% and 58.7% in the peak heat release rate (PHRR) and total heat release (THR), respectively; a lower amount of smoke and toxic gases), outperforming those of pure PMMA, PMMA/graphene aerogel (GA) and PMMA/graphene oxide–ammonium polyphosphate (GO–APP) composites synthesized by traditional dispersion methods. Our work opens up a promising way for the production of graphene-based polymer composites with superior mechanical and fire-safety performances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerogels 3abackfilling 3afire safety 3aflame retardants 3agases 3agraphene 3ahardness 3aheat 3amechanical properties 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3asmoke 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity1 aWu, Shuhong1 aDong, Xiangyu1 aWang, Rui1 aZhang, Liqiang1 aWang, Jianlei1 aZhong, Jie1 aWu, Lixin1 aWang, Xin0 tJournal of materials chemistry.g2018 Mar. 6, v. 6, no. 10 p.4449-4457dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta00736e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245009400206300001300300520145200313592002801765650002801793650001501821650002201836650001401858650002201872650002001894650001601914650001101930650001801941650001501959650000901974653000901983653002801992653001102020653002302031653002202054653001302076773009602089856008602185852000902271655001202280IND60630733620221122222338.0190502e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063073362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.firesaf.2019.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaser, M.Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1350-365410aFire resistance evaluation through artificial intelligence - A case for timber structures  ap. 1-18.  aWith the ever-growing surge of new technologies, there seems to be an ongoing inertia towards integrating automation and cognition into various engineering applications. Despite a number of initiatives, and oddly enough of all civil engineering sub-disciplines, the structural fire engineering and fire safety community continues to embrace a classical stance to tackle the problem of fire. In support of growing demands to adopt performance-based solutions, this paper showcases the potential of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a unique technology to assess performance and fire resistance of structures. More specifically, this study sheds light on the proper use of AI to derive temperature-dependent material models for wood, together with simple expressions that can be used to trace thermo-structural response of timber elements/components (i.e. floor assemblies, beams, columns, and connections). These expressions comprehend the naturally complex temperature-induced physio-chemical changes to timber properties, including creep and charring, and hence do not require input of such properties nor special computing software. The outcome of this study clearly shows the merit of utilizing AI to modernize fire resistance evaluation given that the developed AI-models have high degree of perception (i.e. learn from past behaviors) and ability to improve their prediction capability through independent and unsupervised learning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3aautomation 3acivil engineering 3acognition 3acomputer software 3afire resistance 3afire safety 3amodels 3amodernization 3aprediction 3awood 0aFire 0aArtificial intelligence 0aTimber 0aStructural members 0aMaterial property 0aCharring0 tFire safety journal.g2019 Apr., v. 105 p.1-18dElsevier LtdwJournal:3526x0379-71127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.firesaf.2019.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245009700211300001600308520195900324592002802283650001502311650001402326650001202340650001502352650001002367650002402377650002202401650002102423650001002444700002402454773013302478856008302611852000902694655001202703IND60789176320221119024417.0220818e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078917632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10682-022-10159-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeGrice, Rebecca J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7171-971510aSize variation, allometry and mating success in Aotearoa|New Zealand kelp flies (Coelopidae)  ap. 683-700.  aThe need to respond quickly to the presence of an ephemeral resource required for breeding is often a feature of scramble competition mating systems. Scramble competition mating systems can feature extreme levels of sexual conflict and coercive mating by males. As a result, sexual selection can act on various traits used by males to overcome female resistance behaviours. Selection on these traits may result in significant intra and intersexual size variation and sexual dimorphism. Additionally, traits that influence mating success in males often show positive static allometry. Kelp flies (Coelopidae) are a small family of Diptera which specialise on wrack (beach cast marine macroalgae), a highly ephemeral resource. The mating system of these flies involves high levels of sexual conflict, with females rejecting all male mating attempts. In this study we describe intra and intersexual size variation and static allometry of traits in two of Aotearoa|New Zealand’s species, Coelopella curvipes and Chaetocoelopa littoralis. In addition, we investigate the mating behaviour of C. littoralis under ecologically relevant mating conditions. We found high levels of variation in both species with significant evidence of sexual dimorphism across all traits measured in C. littoralis, and in mid tibia length in C. curvipes. Furthermore, mid tibia length in both species exhibits positive static allometry and is disproportionally larger in larger males, suggesting that this trait in particular may be under strong sexual selection. We found that larger male C. littoralis which attempt to mate are significantly more likely to mate successfully demonstrating a large-size advantage in this species similar to findings across the Coelopidae. However, we only found a non-significant trend towards a mating advantage for males with longer mid-tibiae. We discuss these findings with reference to the population dynamics and ecology of these species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoelopidae 3aallometry 3afemales 3amacroalgae 3amales 3apopulation dynamics 3asexual dimorphism 3asexual selection 3atibia1 aHolwell, Gregory I.0 tEvolutionary ecology.g2022 Aug., v. 36, no. 4 p.683-700dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl3870055x0269-76537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-022-10159-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02228naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245009500164300001800259520114900277592002801426650001701454650001301471650001101484650001901495650000901514650002001523650002301543650002001566650001601586700006401602773013501666856008001801852000901881655001201890IND60684532520221120183623.0200220e20200128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068453252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b088092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasu, Nandita10aEvaporative Drying of Sodium Chloride Solution Droplet on a Thermally Controlled Substrate  ap. 1266-1274.  aWe report the evaporative drying-mediated pattern formation of dilute aqueous NaCl solution droplets on a hydrophobic surface made of cross-linked PDMS at elevated temperatures. Experiments were performed with various salt concentrations (0.08 to 2 M). Depending on the substrate temperature (TS) and initial salt concentration (Cₙ), a variety of unique deposition morphologies are obtained. Double salt rings are obtained at low Cₙ (0.08 and 0.1 M) at TS ≈ 75 °C. With the increase in Cₙ, the deposition morphology transforms into a single peripheral ring with a central deposition zone that is devoid of any salt deposition. On the other hand, at lower Cₙ and lower TS, a single outer ring deposit surrounding a central region covered with dendritic salt deposits is observed. The variation in the morphology as well as the number of rings formed is attributed to the relative strengths of the radially outward capillary-driven flow, inward Marangoni flow, and inward diffusive transport of the salt ions. A morphology phase diagram shows the collective dependence of the final deposition pattern as a function of both TS and Cₙ.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3adroplets 3adrying 3ahydrophobicity 3aions 3aphysical phases 3asalt concentration 3asodium chloride 3atemperature1 aMukherjee, Rabibrata1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7031-98590 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Jan. 28, v. 124, no. 7 p.1266-1274dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b088093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011100157300001800268520126600286592002801552650001401580650003401594650002101628650001601649650001701665700001701682700001801699700001401717700002101731700001801752700001601770700001501786700001501801773013901816856007401955852000902029655001202038IND60618698120221119235702.0181030e20180403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061869812DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta00750k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Jianglin10aCentral dicyanomethylene-substituted unsymmetrical squaraines and their application in organic solar cells  ap. 5797-5806.  aBy dicyanomethylenation on the central squaric acceptor core, three unsymmetrical squaraines (USQ), namely diCN-USQ-1–3, were synthesized, and in-depth comparative studies between them and their reference compounds (USQ-1–3) were carried out. The results indicate that the presence of dicyanomethylene groups on the central squaric ring will lead to distinctly altered properties on the entire π-conjugated system of the fluorophore, such as lowering of the optical bandgap, deepening of the HOMO energy level, increasing of the dipole moment and changing on the dipole moment direction. Consequently, solution-processed bulk-heterojunction small molecule organic solar cells (BHJ-SMOSCs) using these diCN-USQs as electron donor materials could simultaneously show much enhanced open-circuit voltage and significantly increased short-circuit current density, and hence drastically higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) than their corresponding USQ-based reference devices (PCE: 1.46%, 1.91%, and 4.58% for diCN-USQ-1–3, and 0.45%, 0.77%, and 3.05% for USQ-1–3 in sequence).

Soil TOC is seen to be a highly important health and quality indicator for soils, as well as having the potential to sequester atmospheric carbon. Definition of the form of organic carbon measured by a given method is vital to the selection of appropriate methodology, as well as the understanding of what exactly is being measured. Historically, studies of TOC have ranged from basic measures, such as colour and gravimetric analyses, to dry and wet oxidation techniques. In more recent times, various spectroscopic techniques and the application of remote or mobile approaches have gained prominence. The different techniques, even the oldest ones, may have their place in current research depending on research needs, the available time, budget and access to wider resources.

Four isonitrogenous and isolipidic experimental diets containing different lipid sources were formulated: fish oil (FO), palm oil (PO), linseed oil (LO), and soybean oil (SO), respectively. Results indicated that fish fed HFD supplemented with FO significantly improved growth than SO treatment. The high concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine transaminase were found in HFD supplemented with SO. Fish fed dietary LO supplementation showed significantly lower serum cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein contents than those in SO group. Likewise, hepatic paraffin section analysis indicated that HFD with PO or SO supplementation increased fat drop. The expression levels of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor alpha (pparα) and silent regulator 1 (sirt1) were significantly elevated by HFD with FO or LO supplementation. Additionally, the key marker of OS malonaldehyde was significantly increased in FO and SO groups. ERS-related genes were activated in dietary PO or SO supplementation and, hence, triggering inflammation and apoptosis by promoting the expression levels of nuclear factor kappa B (nf-κb) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (jnk). Overall, the present study reveals that lipid metabolic disorders and physiological stress caused by a HFD have significant lipid source-dependent effects, which have important guiding significance for the use of HFD in marine fish.  aPublisher supplied data  a31802303cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018YFD0900400cNational Key R & D Program of China  aXYL20007cScientific Research Foundation of Ningbo University  aSJLY2021007cFundamental Research Funds for the Provincial Universities of Zhejiang 3aAcanthopagrus schlegelii schlegelii 3aalanine transaminase 3aapoptosis 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3adietary fat 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3afish oils 3agrowth performance 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahigh fat diet 3ainflammation 3ajuveniles 3alinseed oil 3alipid metabolism 3alow density lipoprotein 3amalondialdehyde 3amarine fish 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aoxidative stress 3apalm oils 3asoybean oil 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atriacylglycerols1 aLi, Xuejiao1 aBao, Yangguang1 aZhu, Tingting1 aWu, Zhaoxun1 aYang, Bingqian1 aJiao, Lefei1 aZhou, Qicun1 aJin, Min0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2022 Aug., v. 48, no. 4 p.955-971dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870056x0920-17427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-022-01095-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03862naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245017200170520224000342592002802582650003302610650001102643650001202654650001302666650002002679650002402699650001602723650002602739650001302765650001902778650001102797650001402808650002102822650001702843650001902860650002502879653004902904653003502953653002902988653002703017653002103044653001803065700002203083700002003105700001503125773011903140856008803259852000903347655001203356IND60719355020221116203241.0220228e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071935502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1436772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Jaecheul10aNitrogen removal and microbial community diversity in single-chamber electroactive biofilm reactors with different ratios of the cathode surface area to reactor volume  aRemoval of nitrogen compounds is particularly important domestic wastewater treatment. Our recent study reported the successful removal of nitrogen in single-chamber electroactive biofilm reactors (EBRs) under aeration-free conditions. We hypothesized that the oxygen diffused from the air-cathode is a key factor in the removal of nitrogen in the EBR. If so, the effect of the penetrated oxygen would vary according to the ratio of the air-cathode surface area to the reactor volume (AV ratio) and the hydraulic retention time (HRT). In this study, single-chamber EBRs with three different AV ratios: 125 m²/m³ (EBR-125), 250 m²/m³ (EBR-250), and 500 m²/m³ (EBR-500) were evaluated for the removal of nitrogen under different HRTs of 0.5–6 h. The higher the AV ratio, the greater the increase in nitrification. The total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency of EBR-125 and EBR-250 decreased as the HRT decreased, while that of EBR-500 increased. EBR-250 showed the highest TN removal (62.0%) with well-balanced nitrification (83.9%) and denitrification (75.1%) at an HRT of 6 h. However, EBR-500 appeared to be superior for practical application because it showed a comparable TN removal (59%) at a substantially short HRT of 1 h. The microbial communities that were involved in the nitrogen cycle varied according to whether the biofilms were located on the anodes, separators, and cathodes but were similar among EBRs with different AV ratios. Nitrifying bacteria were detected in the biofilms that were presented on the cathodes (approximately 7.8% of the total phylotypes), while denitrifying bacteria were mainly found in biofilm that were located on the anodes (approximately 23.3%). Anammox bacteria were also detected on the anode (approximately 3.7%) and in the separator biofilms (approximately 1.9%) of all the EBRs. These results suggest that both the A/V ratio and the HRT could affect the counter diffusion of substrates (NH₄⁺ and organic compounds) and oxygen in the biofilms and allow interactions between a diversity of microorganisms for the successful removal of nitrogen in EBRs. These findings are expected to aid in the development of new applications using EBR for energy-saving wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3aanodes 3abiofilm 3acathodes 3adenitrification 3aenergy conservation 3aenvironment 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3aoxygen 3aphylotype 3asewage treatment 3asurface area 3atotal nitrogen 3awastewater treatment 0aSingle-chamber electroactive biofilm reactor 0aElectrode area to volume ratio 0aHydraulic retention time 0aOrganic carbon removal 0aNitrogen removal 0aAeration-free1 aWidyaningsih, Evy1 aPark, Younghyun1 aLee, Taeho0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 758 p.143677-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1436773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245007400167300001800241500001900259520144000278592002801718650001701746650001101763650001201774650001801786650002501804650001601829650001201845650001801857650002001875650001401895650001201909651001001921700005901931773014501990856008202135852000902217655001202226IND60728104420221120185308.0210217e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072810442DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-020-00743-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgarwal, Priti10aSustainability and comprehensive wealth accounting: the case of India  ap. 3762-3786.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe criterion of non-declining comprehensive wealth per capita used to determine sustainability of economic growth indicates that growth in most countries is weakly sustainable, as decline in natural capital is more than offset by increase in anthropogenic capital. This paper examines the sustainability of economic growth in India by estimating the trend in comprehensive wealth during 1975–2013, utilizing recent remote sensing native forest cover data in order to obtain more accurate valuation of natural capital. This is the first study to construct wealth estimates for a period spanning four decades, apart from adopting hybrid methodology for estimating certain wealth components such as subsoil assets. We find that the composition of India’s wealth is biased toward produced capital, although given the large working-age population, India holds immense potential for human capital building. The quality of natural capital is also deteriorating due to increasing carbon emissions and particulate pollution. Although we find that growth in India is weakly sustainable, it is based on the assumption of perfect substitutability of different capital forms, which is questionable. Loss of natural forests and accompanying native biodiversity raises serious concerns of the threat it poses to future generations. Our sensitivity analysis based on variation in the discount rate also suggests cautious use of natural resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acarbon 3adecline 3adiscount rate 3aeconomic development 3aenvironment 3aforests 3ahuman capital 3anatural capital 3apollution 3asubsoil 3aIndia1 aSawhney, Aparna1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4878-77730 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2021 Mar., v. 23, no. 3 p.3762-3786dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-020-00743-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245012600175300001400301520129200315592002801607650003101635650002601666650001901692650001901711650002001730650002201750650002401772650001201796650001501808650002101823650002201844650002001866650001101886651001501897653002001912653002901932653002801961653002901989653001702018700002002035700001902055773011402074856008402188852000902272655001202281IND60583913920221119141209.0190403e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058391392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2017.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, A.R.M.Towfiqul10aPredicting design water requirement of winter paddy under climate change condition using frequency analysis in Bangladesh  ap. 58-70.  aThe effects of climate change on the agricultural sector are tremendous. Thus, it is essential to determine its impacts on agricultural water resources and to minimize adverse effects on crop production. The present study aims to simulate climate data based on SRES A1B scenario from the outputs of three General Circulation Models (GCMs) namely, FGOAL, HADCM3 and IPCM4 and examine the design water requirement (DWR) of winter paddy using frequency analysis under climate change condition in Bangladesh. The average change rates of DWR in four climatic zones were compared to baseline and the results were −12.16% (2020s), −0.28% (2055s), and 1.25% (2090s) for the FGOAL, −4.44% (2020s), 0.57% (2055s) and 1.25% (2090s) for the HADCM3, and −1.12% (2020s), 2.22% (2055s) and 6.69% (2090s) for the IPCM4. The change rates of gross paddy water demand (GPWD) for three GCMs ranged from −3.01% to 11.16%. In both cases of the DWR and GPWD, the change rates were above 3%, indicating a warning signal to the future winter paddy water management. The outcomes of this study can be used as basic data for the development of agricultural water resource management, which will help to minimize the drought-risk and to implement future agricultural water resource policies in Bangladesh.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aagricultural industry 3aclimate change 3aclimatic zones 3acrop production 3aissues and policy 3ameteorological data 3apaddies 3aprediction 3awater management 3awater requirement 3awater resources 3awinter 3aBangladesh 0aCrop production 0aDesign water requirement 0aClimate change scenario 0aGross paddy water demand 0aDrought risk1 aShen, Shuang-He1 aYang, Shen-Bin0 tAgricultural water management.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 195 p.58-70dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2017.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245009700205300001800302500001900320520121700339592002801556650001301584650002201597650001901619650002301638650001601661650002101677700001501698773014501713856008201858852000901940655001201949IND60728104520221120185202.0210217e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072810452DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-020-00749-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeyikoglu, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5713-314114aThe role of dye molecular weight on the decolorization performance of the electrocoagulation  ap. 3917-3928.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aComparative results of color removal performances of Reactive Blue 198 (RB198), Reactive Yellow (RY145) and Reactive Blue 19 (RB19) by electrocoagulation process are presented. Our primary objective was to investigate whether the dye molecular weight affects color removal performance. Dye removal costs of each dye were calculated and compared. Experiments were performed at current densities of 1.04, 2.08, 4.17 and 10.42 A/m² in electrocoagulation (EC) reactor with aluminum electrodes connected parallel monopolar configuration. Laboratory-scale experiments were run in batch mode with 0.5 L synthetic dye solution volume and 50 mg/L initial dye concentration. Results showed that the color removal efficiencies were directly influenced by the molecular weight of the dyes. The color removal efficiency of the dye with the greatest molecular weight (RB198) was the highest, whereas the color removal efficiency of the dye with the smallest molecular weight (RB19) was the lowest. Moreover, results indicated that the operating cost of RB198 was significantly lower (2.91 $ per kg dye removed) than RY145 (6.61 $ per kg dye removed) and RB19 ($6.72 per kg dye removed) at a current density of 4.17 A/m².  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aartificial colors 3adecolorization 3aelectrocoagulation 3aenvironment 3amolecular weight1 aCan, O.

The validation of this innovative method on real matrices (i.e., sediments, mussel, fish, and Posidonia oceanica) indicated a general good performance in all of them for phthalate esters (PAEs), with low blank levels and average method recoveries varying from 54 ± 11 to 71 ± 12%. The best method performance for organophosphate ester (OPE) flame retardants and plasticizers was in biotic matrices (recoveries 52 ± 31 to 86 ± 38%). This application represents an innovative QuEChERS sequence of two dispersive solid-phase extraction (SPE) steps enabling this approach for the determination of important families of organic plastic additives in the marine environment. Indeed, our method allowed the fast screening and simultaneous determination of OPE and PAEs in various sites and matrices subject to different anthropogenic pressure in coastal NW Mediterranean Sea for the first time. ∑₇PAE and ∑₉OPE concentrations of 19–83 and 27–116 ng g⁻¹ dw (fish), of 80–714 and 42–71 ng g⁻¹ dw (mussels), of 192–908 and 47–151 ng g⁻¹ dw (Posidonia oceanica), and of 11–328 and 4–10 ng g⁻¹ dw (sediment) were measured, respectively. Our approach was sensible enough as to detect differences in the (bio)accumulation patterns of the target compounds in various species and/or sites. This application opens new perspectives for environmentally friendly marine environment monitoring and screening campaigns for organic plastic additives.

The nanocomposite was used as a heterogeneous Fenton-like catalyst for Acid Red 73 degradation. The effects of several key parameters, solution pH, H₂O₂ concentration, catalyst dosage, and temperature of the reaction medium on the pseudo-first-order kinetics of dye degradation was evaluated. The results showed that the nanocomposite catalyst were highly effective in activating H₂O₂ to produce reactive radicals for dye degradation, achieving complete decomposition under optimal conditions of 300 min at 25 °C and pH 3.5 with 100 mM H₂O₂ and 200 mg·L⁻¹ catalyst. The complexing hydrogel-Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺ were the key factors that speed up the redox cycling between Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺ species, thus accelerate the fast degradation rate of target pollutants. Scavenging experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance analyses revealed that Acid Red 73 was decomposed mainly by the attack of •OH radicals. Besides, reusability of the prepared nanocatalyst was also tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopolymerization 3acoprecipitation 3adyes 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3afree radicals 3ahydrogels 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airon 3airon oxides 3amagnetism 3ananocatalysts 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apollutants 3atemperature 0aFe3O4 0aCellulose-based hydrogel 0aFenton-like reaction 0aDye degradation 0aPseudo-first-order kinetic1 aShen, Juanli1 aBai, Yong1 aLi, De,1 aXue, Guoxin0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 June 01, v. 152 p.242-249dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.02.2003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245016200165300001400327520141700341592002801758650002901786650002401815650001601839650002301855650003001878650001201908650001501920650002701935650001801962653000801980653000801988653000901996653000802005653001502013653003202028653004902060653002402109653001202133653001602145700002402161700002102185700002102206700001902227700002202246773010402268856008502372852000902457655001202466IND60565824420221119201203.0180831e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056582442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2017.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaio, Aida10aInvolvement of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid in the interaction between Pseudomonas chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens strain M71 and Seiridium cardinale in vivo  ap. 49-56.  aPseudomonas chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens encompasses bacterial strains that effectively control phytopathogenic fungi through the production of the natural antibiotics named phenazines. In this work, the involvement of phenazine production in the interaction between the biological control agent P. chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens M71 and the fungus Seiridium cardinale, a serious cypress pathogen, was investigated.Field trials were carried out to assess the role of phenazines in the control of S. cardinale in vivo. Results showed that P. chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens M71 and 30-84, both able to produce phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA), drastically reduced the canker development incited by S. cardinale. Conversely, strain M71b, a natural gacA mutant of P. chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens M71, showed a decrease in PCA production and a reduction in controlling S. cardinale. These results were enforced by the reduction of canker size higher than 94% registered when 6μg of pure PCA was directly applied on each cypress wound. Furthermore, PCA was detected in cypress plant tissues only when P. chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens M71 was interacting with S. cardinale for 30 days. All these data support that the biological control of S. cardinale achieved by the application of P. chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens M71 relies mainly on the ability of the bacterial strain to produce PCA in planta.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas chlororaphis 3aSeiridium cardinale 3aantibiotics 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3amutants 3aphenazines 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aplant tissues 0aPCA 0aNGA 0aPPMD 0aPDA 0aBiocontrol 0aPhenazine-1-carboxylic acid 0aPseudomonas chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens 0aSeiridium cardinale 0aCypress 0agacA mutant1 aReveglia, Pierluigi1 aPuopolo, Gerardo1 aCimmino, Alessio1 aDanti, Roberto1 aEvidente, Antonio0 tMicrobiological research.g2017 June, v. 199 p.49-56dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2017.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02460naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245008400163300001000247520148100257592002801738596006801766650002001834650002501854650001401879650000901893650000901902700001501911700001301926773011501939856008302054852000902137655001202146IND60722870120221123022943.0211229e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072287012DNAL7 a10.1186/s10086-020-01939-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Yidan10aWind-induced vibration performance of early Chinese hall-style timber buildings  ap. 4.  aTraditional Chinese timber buildings are lightweight, flexible, and quite vulnerable to wind. This paper aims to present a methodology for evaluating the wind-induced vibration performance of early Chinese hall-style timber buildings based on numerical simulations. First, the architectural and structural characteristics of early Chinese hall-style timber buildings were presented and analyzed. It is found that the main hall of the Tianning Temple can be considered a representative to carry out the research. Second, the wind pressure coefficients of the main hall were determined via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. Finally, the time-series wind pressures were generated, and the wind-induced vibration performance was analyzed by the finite-element method (FEM). The CFD simulation results show that the eave corners bear the maximum wind suction, and the windward pediment bears the maximum wind pressure. The FEM analysis has revealed that the lateral structural stiffness in the depth direction is smaller. Under the depth-direction wind load, most of the large displacement occurs intensively at the middle part of the windward frames. The structural response is dominated mainly by the top three vibration modes. The time-series wind vibration coefficients are larger than the code values by a factor of 1.39–1.82. This study can provide a reference for evaluating the wind-induced vibration performance of early Chinese hall-style timber buildings.  aPublisher supplied data  a51578127&51778122cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3afluid mechanics 3atime series analysis 3avibration 3awind 3awood1 aChun, Qing1 aJin, Hui0 tJournal of wood science.g2021 Dec., v. 67, no. 1 p.4-4dSpringer SingaporewJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s10086-020-01939-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02530naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012400165300001400289520148000303592002801783650001301811650001801824650002101842650002201863650001101885650000901896650001301905650001301918650001301931650001501944650001101959650001001970700002301980773009602003856004802099852000902147655001202156IND50063300920221122150504.0130324e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006330092DNAL7 a10.1007/s10340-011-0348-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandl, Marion10aPreliminary investigations into the use of trap crops to control Agriotes spp. (Coleoptera: Elateridae) in potato crops  ap. 85-90.  aA field trial was conducted to investigate the use of peas (Pisum sativum cv. Valverde), wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Capo) and oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus var. oleiformis cv. Adagio) as trap crops to control wireworm in potato fields. We investigated the efficacy of trap crops and distance of attraction by counting larvae in both potato and trap crop rows. Wireworms of the genera Agriotes, Adrastus and Hemicrepidius were observed. In the plots planted with peas as a trap crop, significantly more wireworms were observed than in the other treatments, which was clearly due to the influence of the trap crop pea. The potato rows 0.75 m away from the peas showed 2.4 times more larvae than the potato rows 1.5 m away. This may be due to a decrease of the peas’ attractiveness over time (Miles and Petherbridge 1927), with wireworms that were initially attracted to the peas moving back to the nearby potatoes. In the plots planted with wheat, oilseed radish and the control (bare soil instead of a trap crop), there was no significant difference in numbers of larvae between the potato rows. In the control plots, significantly more larvae were found in the potato rows than in the bare soil. We assessed the damage to potato tubers by weighing them and counting the wireworm holes. Our results indicate that peas are more attractive to wireworms than potatoes and might be an effective trap crop if the right timing and spacing relative to the potatoes is found.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgriotes 3aPisum sativum 3aRaphanus sativus 3aTriticum aestivum 3alarvae 3apeas 3aplanting 3apotatoes 3aradishes 3atrap crops 3atubers 3awheat1 aGlauninger, Johann0 tJournal of pest science.g2013 Mar., v. 86, no. 1 p.85-90dSpringer-Verlagx1612-47587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10340-011-0348-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03163naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245014000205520163600345592002801981650001202009650002902021650001202050650001302062650001502075650001102090650002102101650001102122650001902133650002302152650001702175650003302192650001802225650002202243651001002265653002202275653003002297653002202327653002402349653002402373700001502397700001402412700001602426700001402442700002002456773008702476856008502563852000902648655001202657IND60781442820221118071232.0220809e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078144282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2022.1064922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaojie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1796-526610aAnalysis of spatial-temporal variation of the saline-sodic soil in the west of Jilin Province from 1989 to 2019 and influencing factors  aSoil salinization is a serious land degradation phenomenon that significantly affects regional economies and agricultural development. Since the 1980s, the state of soil salinization has been constantly changing due to various climatic conditions, human activities, and the application of soil improvement measures. In this study, the Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI satellites, launched in 1984 and 2013, respectively, were used to track changes in soil electrical conductivity (EC), a key indicator of soil salinity. A remote-sensing inversion model for the EC of saline-sodic soil was established (R = 0.5), and the soil EC in western Jilin Province from 1989 to 2019 was inverted. Then, the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of the soil salinization degree were counted, and the related variables and influencing factors were analyzed. The results are in good agreement with the conclusion that meteorological conditions are the most relevant and important factors in soil salinization. The area of saline soil increased continuously in the natural state (from 1989 to 1999), and the implementation of government policies (1999 to 2019) reversed the saline soil expansion, converting large areas of saline soil to grassland and cropland. This study is the first to quantitatively analyze the degree of soil salinization and its influencing factors in western Jilin Province from 1989 to 2019; this work also successfully predicted and monitored the variation in soil salinization. This provides data support for the study of the dominant elements in soil salinization changes and the rational development of land.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aagricultural development 3acatenas 3acropland 3agrasslands 3ahumans 3aland degradation 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3asaline sodic soils 3asaline soils 3asoil electrical conductivity 3asoil salinity 3asoil salinization 3aChina 0aSaline-sodic soil 0aSpatio-temporal variation 0aGovernment policy 0aLand use conversion 0aInfluencing factors1 aLi, Yingye1 aWang, Bin1 aSun, Yishan1 aCui, Geng1 aLiang, Zhengwei0 tCatena.g2022 Oct., v. 217 p.106492-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.1064923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005700144245014600201300001800347520131500365592002801680650001101708650001301719650001801732650001501750650001501765650001601780650002501796653001901821653001901840653002001859653002501879653002501904700001801929700001801947700001401965700002201979700005402001700001702055700006202072700006002134700006702194773013902261856007802400852000902478655001202487IND60632367820221121202330.0190314e20190204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063236782DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b215242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Gangjian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9087-404810aEnhanced Density-of-States Effective Mass and Strained Endotaxial Nanostructures in Sb-Doped Pb₀.₉₇Cd₀.₀₃Te Thermoelectric Alloys  ap. 9197-9204.  aHere we report that CdTe alloying and Sb doping increase the density-of-states effective mass and introduce endotaxial nanostructuring in n-type PbTe, resulting in enhanced thermoelectric performance. A prior theoretical prediction for the presence of resonance states in the conduction band of this system, however, could not be confirmed. An amount of 3 mol % CdTe alloying widens the band gap of PbTe by 50%, leading to enhanced carrier effective mass and Seebeck coefficient. This effect is even more pronounced at high temperatures where the solubility of CdTe increases. At 800 K, when the carrier concentration is the same (4 × 10¹⁹ cm–³), the Seebeck coefficient of CdTe-alloyed PbTe is −195 μV K–¹, 16% higher than that of the Cd-free control sample (−168 μV K–¹). Sb doping considerably increases the electron concentration of Pb₀.₉₇Cd₀.₀₃Te, giving rise to optimized power factors of ∼17 μW cm–¹ K–² at 800 K. More importantly, Sb induces strained endotaxial nanostructures evenly distributed in the matrix. These Sb-rich nanostructures account for the ∼40% reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity over the whole measured temperature range. As a result, a maximum ZT of 1.2 is attained at 750 K in 0.5 mol % Sb-doped Pb₀.₉₇Cd₀.₀₃Te alloys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aantimony 3ananomaterials 3aprediction 3asolubility 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity 0athermoelectric 0alead telluride 0ananostructuring 0aelectronic structure 0athermal conductivity1 aZhang, Xiaomi1 aHao, Shiqiang1 aChi, Hang1 aBailey, Trevor P.1 aSu, Xianli1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4428-64611 aUher, Ctirad1 aDravid, Vinayak P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6007-30631 aWolverton, Chris1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2248-474X1 aKanatzidis, Mercouri G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2037-41680 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Feb. 04, v. 11, no. 9 p.9197-9204dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b215243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02261naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005300146245005900199300001800258520093100276592002801207650001201235650002101247650001801268650002101286650001301307650001601320700005501336700005901391700005201450700005701502700006101559700005401620773013501674856008101809852000901890655001201899IND60684533320200902000000.0200902e20200130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068453332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b107832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5615-864610aStructurally Related Scaling Behavior in Ionic Systems  ap. 1240-1244.  aWe examine the density scaling properties of two ionic materials, a classic aprotic low molecular weight ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(perfluoroethylsulfonyl)imide ([BMIm][BETI]), and a polymeric ionic liquid, poly(3-methyl-1,2,3-triazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (TPIL). Density scaling is known to apply rigorously to simple liquids lacking specific intermolecular associations such as hydrogen bonds. Previous work has found that ionic liquids conform to density scaling over limited ranges of temperature and pressure. In this work, we find that the dc-conductivity of [BMIm][BETI] accurately scales for density changes of 17%; however, there is a departure from scaling for TPIL for even more modest variations of temperature and pressure. The entropy of both ionic samples conforms to density scaling only if the scaling exponent is allowed to vary linearly with the magnitude of the entropy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aentropy 3ahydrogen bonding 3aionic liquids 3amolecular weight 3apolymers 3atemperature1 aMusiał, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1624-66171 aWojnarowska, Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7790-29991 aHolt, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2916-69631 aRoland, C.

In this work, we take advantage of the photothermal effect to heat heavy oil by using sunlight as the energy source to significantly reduce its viscosity and thus to achieve a fast heavy oil cleanup. A carbon nanotube (CNT) modified polyurethane sponge was fabricated as a photothermal sorbent that exhibited superhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity, as well as outstanding absorption capacity for heavy oil. Thanks to the excellent photothermal effect of CNTs, the modified sponge achieved nearly full sunlight absorption (99%). The resulting solar heating effectively reduced the viscosity of the heavy oil, which enabled the modified sponge to quickly absorb 20 times its own weight of heavy oil under sun illumination. This solar-assisted heavy oil sorbent design is promising for future remediation of viscous oil-spills.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon nanotubes 3aenergy 3aheat 3ahydrophobicity 3alighting 3aoil spills 3aoils 3apolyurethanes 3aremediation 3asolar radiation 3asorbents 3aviscosity1 aShi, Yusuf1 aWu, Mengchun1 aLi, Renyuan1 aShi, Le1 aJin, Yong1 aQing, Weihua1 aTang, Chuyang1 aWang, Peng0 tJournal of materials chemistry.g2018 May 15, v. 6, no. 19 p.9192-9199dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta00779a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03201naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245012200171300001500293520180400308592002802112650001702140650001902157650002602176650002002202650001202222650001002234650001602244650002702260650001502287650001102302650000902313650001902322650002802341650001702369650002202386650001002408651000902418653001802427653001302445653001702458653001602475653002002491773011502511856008402626852000902710655001202719IND60583914220221119141134.0190403e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058391422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2017.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbolpour, Behrouz10aRealistic evaluation of crop water productivity for sustainable farming of wheat in Kamin Region, Fars Province, Iran  ap. 94-103.  aCurrently, the economic wheat production faces severe challenges due to an increasing number of droughts. In an effort to enhance yields, most arid and semi-arid areas increase the water volume used for irrigation and cultivation of wheat, resulting in an intensified pressure on water resource systems. Therefore, it has become increasingly important to determine the required water volume per unit area in relation to expected wheat performance. However, such an estimation of relevant performance factors has been difficult due to unpredictable water supply capacities and the lack of reliable estimates for the demand of water. The potential crop water productivity (PCWP) defined in this study was comparing with its actual value has which obtained from field measurements based on a new approach of risk quantification. Using this comparison of water use, the management coefficient was estimated, and the production reliability of wheat was calculated.Based on these factors, farms that had competently adapted their management in line with climate change and water availability were selected. The results reveal that only 26 of a total of 666 wheat farms which evaluated for this case study have had reliable crop water productivity and could thus be used as models for other farms. The results showed 100% increasing in CWP with a 27% reducing in hydro-module on these farms, in which case more than 34% will be reduced the groundwater withdrawal. Therefore, the sustainability of groundwater resources would be better, whereas the benefit cost ratio of the whole region and the superior farms has no significant difference. The amount of water that these farms use and the resulting yield can be a suitable reference to determine the expected yield and required water volume per unit area.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3acost benefit analysis 3acrop production 3adrought 3afarms 3agroundwater 3agroundwater extraction 3airrigation 3amodels 3arisk 3asemiarid zones 3asustainable agriculture 3awater supply 3awater utilization 3awheat 3aIran 0aCrop planning 0aModeling 0aOptimization 0aUncertainty 0aWater resources0 tAgricultural water management.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 195 p.94-103dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2017.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245013200204300001800336520183100354592002802185650000802213650000802221650001202229650001202241650002602253650003102279650001402310650001102324650001402335650002302349650001502372650001402387650001302401650002202414650001102436700005702447700006202504773013502566856008002701852000902781655001202790IND60684533420221122002107.0200220e20200129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068453342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b109512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Kyungreem1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2290-485810aCharacterization of Specific Ion Effects on PI(4,5)P₂ Clustering: Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Graph-Theoretic Analysis  ap. 1183-1196.  aNumerous cellular functions mediated by phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P₂; PIP₂) involve clustering of the lipid as well as colocalization with other lipids. Although the cation-mediated electrostatic interaction is regarded as the primary clustering mechanism, the ion-specific nature of the intermolecular network formation makes it challenging to characterize the clusters. Here we use all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of PIP₂ monolayers and graph-theoretic analysis to gain insight into the phenomenon. MD simulations reveal that the intermolecular interactions preferentially occur between specific cations and phosphate groups (P1, P4, and P5) of the inositol headgroup with better-matched kosmotropic/chaotropic characters consistent with the law of matching water affinities (LMWA). Ca²⁺ is strongly attracted to P4/P5, while K⁺ preferentially binds to P1; Na⁺ interacts with both P4/P5 and P1. These specific interactions lead to the characteristic clustering patterns. Specificially, the size distributions and structures of PIP₂ clusters generated by kosmotropic cations Ca²⁺ and Na⁺ are bimodal, with a combination of small and large clusters, while there is little clustering in the presence of only chaotropic K⁺; the largest clusters are obtained in systems with all three cations. The small-world network (a model with both local and long-range connections) best characterizes the clusters, followed by the random and the scale-free networks. More generally, the present results interpreted within the LMWA are consistent with the relative eukaryotic intracellular concentrations Ca²⁺ ≪ Na⁺ < Mg²⁺ < K⁺; that is, concentrations of Ca²⁺ and Na⁺ must be low to prevent damaging aggregation of lipids, DNA, RNA and phosphate-containing proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRNA 3acalcium 3acations 3achemical interactions 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ainositols 3alipids 3amagnesium 3amolecular dynamics 3aphosphates 3apotassium 3aproteins 3asimulation models 3asodium1 aGericke, Arne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3682-02411 aPastor, Richard W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2454-51310 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Jan. 29, v. 124, no. 7 p.1183-1196dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b109513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03367naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005200150245008600202520204300288592002802331650001102359650001202370650001202382650001902394650002002413650001602433650001502449650001502464650001502479650000902494650002002503650001102523650002302534650001902557650001402576653001402590653002102604653002002625653001902645700002202664700001502686700001502701773008702716856008502803852000902888655001202897IND60781443120221118071139.0220809e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078144312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2022.1064952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6051-544210aTracing seismic landslide-derived sediment dynamics in response to climate change  aMass movements such as landslides are prominent sources of sediment in post-seismic mountain belts. Earthquake triggered landslides can generate substantial volumes of fresh sediment and this may have significant long-term (decade to millennium) geomorphic effects on landscape evolution. Downslope and downstream transport of sediment into the channel network is sensitive to meteorological perturbations especially for extreme rainfall events. However, no established techniques can explicitly fingerprint/track landslide-derived sediment under climate change. In this study, we use a new tracing function incorporated into CAESAR-Lisflood (CL) to track the landslide-derived sediment dynamics in response to climate change. The hourly future rainfall sequences under two climate scenarios (RCP4.5, RCP8.5) were firstly generated using ‘NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP)’ dataset and then used as hydrological input to drive CL simulations. The landscape evolution at the Hongxi basin, which suffered great damage from the Wenchuan earthquake (Ms 8.0), was then simulated for 93 years (2008–2100) using CL under two climate scenarios. The results show that the landslides can greatly increase the sediment yield and climatic perturbations can lead to variation of sediment dynamics, the coupling of these two factors perform a combined impact on sediment budget, while the interplay and relevant importance between landslides and climate impact is dependent on the landslide density of specific basin. The landslide-channel connectivity (location of landslides with respect to river channels) plays an important role in post-earthquake sediment evacuation. The yearly sediment yield generated by the landslides can be stable after 20 years under both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios in the study basin. These findings are of great importance to understand the interplay between landslide and climatic perturbations and support the risk management and mitigation after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acatenas 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aearthquakes 3ageophysics 3alandscapes 3alandslides 3arain 3arisk management 3arivers 3asediment transport 3asediment yield 3asediments 0aLandslide 0aSediment tracing 0aCAESAR-Lisflood 0aClimate change1 aCoulthard, Tom J.1 aWang, Ming1 aWu, Jinhui0 tCatena.g2022 Oct., v. 217 p.106495-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.1064953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245008400184300001400268500001500282520155700297592002801854650002801882650002701910650001201937650004301949650001201992650002102004650001402025650001702039650001902056650002502075650001302100650001002113650005202123650005202175650002302227650002302250650003202273650001302305650002702318650003202345653001302377700001802390700001402408700001202422700001302434700002102447700001902468700001402487773010602501856004802607852000902655655001202664IND50072065020221122224615.0140121e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007206502DNAL7 a241215242pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-013-2203-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Dongfang10aAssociation mapping of six yield-related traits in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.)  ap. 85-96.  a2019-12-06  aYield is one of the most important traits for rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) breeding, but its genetic basis remains largely ambiguous. Association mapping has provided a robust approach to understand the genetic basis of complex agronomic traits in crops. In this study, a panel of 192 inbred lines of B. napus from all over the world was genotyped using 451 single-locus microsatellite markers and 740 amplified fragment length polymorphism markers. Six yield-related traits of these inbred lines were investigated in three consecutive years with three replications, and genome-wide association studies were conducted for these six traits. Using the model controlling both population structure and relative kinship (Q + K), a total of 43 associations (P < 0.001) were detected using the means of the six yield-related traits across 3 years, with two to fourteen markers associated with individual traits. Among these, 18 markers were repeatedly detected in at least 2 years, and 12 markers were located within or close to QTLs identified in previous studies. Six markers commonly associated with correlated traits. Conditional association analysis indicated that five of the associations between markers and correlated traits are caused by one QTL with pleiotropic effects, and the remaining association is caused by linked but independent QTLs. The combination of favorable alleles of multiple associated markers significantly enhances trait performance, illustrating a great potential of utilization of the associations in rapeseed breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative trait loci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aalleles 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3akinship 3aagronomic traits 3apotassium 3ainbred lines 3aBrassica napus 3apopulation structure 3arapeseed 3acrops 2aAmplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis 2aBrassica napusxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Plant 2aGenetic Association Studies 2aGenotype 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPlant Developmentxgenetics 0abreeding1 aXiao, Yingjie1 aYang, Wei1 aYe, Wei1 aWang, Bo1 aYounas, Muhammad1 aWu, Jiangsheng1 aLiu, Kede0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2014 Jan., v. 127, no. 1 p.85-96dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-013-2203-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245007300156520167500229592002801904650001601932650001201948650001301960650001601973650001901989650002502008650002902033700001702062700001502079700001702094700001802111700001602129773012902145856007502274852000902349655001202358IND60754393420221119193706.0211023e20211014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075439342DNAL7 a10.3390/rs132041112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Fei 10aLearning Future-Aware Correlation Filters for Efficient UAV Tracking  aIn recent years, discriminative correlation filter (DCF)-based trackers have made considerable progress and drawn widespread attention in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking community. Most existing trackers collect historical information, e.g., training samples, previous filters, and response maps, to promote their discrimination and robustness. Under UAV-specific tracking challenges, e.g., fast motion and view change, variations of both the target and its environment in the new frame are unpredictable. Interfered by future unknown environments, trackers that trained with historical information may be confused by the new context, resulting in tracking failure. In this paper, we propose a novel future-aware correlation filter tracker, i.e., FACF. The proposed method aims at effectively utilizing context information in the new frame for better discriminative and robust abilities, which consists of two stages: future state awareness and future context awareness. In the former stage, an effective time series forecast method is employed to reason a coarse position of the target, which is the reference for obtaining a context patch in the new frame. In the latter stage, we firstly obtain the single context patch with an efficient target-aware method. Then, we train a filter with the future context information in order to perform robust tracking. Extensive experimental results obtained from three UAV benchmarks, i.e., UAV123_10fps, DTB70, and UAVTrack112, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed tracker. Our tracker has comparable performance with other state-of-the-art trackers while running at ∼49 FPS on a single CPU.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironment 3afilters 3alearning 3amethodology 3aremote sensing 3atime series analysis 3aunmanned aerial vehicles1 aMa, Shiping 1 aYu, Lixin 1 aZhang, Yule 1 aQiu, Zhuling 1 aLi, Zhenyu 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Oct. 14, v. 13, no. 20dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs132041113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03663naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002100192245017800213500001900391506007600410520185000486592002802336506003702364650004302401650001802444650001702462650001902479650002802498650001502526650001502541650001602556650001602572650001202588650002602600650001402626650002302640650001202663650001702675650002702692650001002719651001002729653002202739653001802761653003002779653002602809700002002835700002202855700003302877773009302910856008503003852000903088655001203097IND60690805620221207073344.0200508e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069080562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e012362doi7 aPMC63830482pmcid7 a308286642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuupiel, Desmond10aAccessibility of pregnancy-related point-of-care diagnostic tests for maternal healthcare in rural primary healthcare facilities in Northern Ghana: A cross-sectional survey  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aImproving access to maternal healthcare in resource-limited settings plays a critical role in improving maternal health outcomes and reducing maternal deaths. However, barriers and challenges may exist in rural clinics and could affect successful implementation. This study assessed the current accessibility of pregnancy-related point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests for maternal healthcare in rural primary healthcare (PHC) clinics in northern Ghana.We randomly selected 100 PHC clinics providing maternal healthcare from a total list of 356 PHC clinicss obtained from the Regional Health Directorate. Selected clinics were surveyed from February to March 2018, using an adopted survey tool. We obtained data for clinic-level staffing, availability, usage, and desired POC diagnostic tests. Stata 14 was used for data analysis.Majority (64%) of the respondents were midwives. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) years of work experience and working hours per week were estimated at 5.6 years ± 0.4 and 122 hours ± 5.2 respectively. Average antenatal clinic attendance (clinic census) per month was 65 ± 67 pregnant women (Range: 3–360). The mean ± SD POC tests available and use was 4.9 tests ± 2.2. POC tests for malaria, HIV, urine pregnancy, and blood pressure monitoring devices were available in most clinics. POC tests requested by the clinics to assist them care for pregnant women included: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (95%); hepatitis C (94%); sickling (91%); tuberculosis, blood glucose and blood type (89%) each; urinary tract infection (87%); urine protein (81%); hepatitis B (78%); haemoglobin (76%); and syphilis (76%).There is poor accessibility to pregnancy-related POC diagnostic tests for maternal healthcare due to low availability (≤5 tests per PHC clinic) of POC tests in rural PHC clinics in northern Ghana.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3ablood glucose 3ablood groups 3ablood pressure 3across-sectional studies 3agovernance 3ahemoglobin 3ahepatitis B 3ahepatitis C 3amalaria 3apoint-of-care systems 3apregnancy 3astandard deviation 3asurveys 3atuberculosis 3aurinary tract diseases 3aurine 3aGhana 0aHealth profession 0aPublic health 0aObstetrics and gynecology 0aReproductive medicine1 aTlou, Boikhutso1 aBawontuo, Vitalis1 aMashamba-Thompson, Tivani P.0 tHeliyon.g2019 Feb., v. 5, no. 2 p.e01236-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e012363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012500170300001600295520106000311592002801371650002301399650003001422650001701452650001701469650002001486650001401506650001301520650000701533650000901540650001301549650002301562650001701585650001201602650001801614653001401632653002301646653002501669653002701694653001701721700001401738700005901752773009501811856008601906852000901992655001202001IND60533911820221120201957.0190403e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053391182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2015.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Sang-Keun10aEffect of Caesalpinia sappan L. extract on physico-chemical properties of emulsion-type pork sausage during cold storage  ap. 245-252.  aThis study was performed to investigate the effect of extract from heart wood of Caesalpinia sappan on the physico-chemical properties and to find the appropriate addition level in the emulsion-type pork sausage during cold storage. The pH of treatments with C. sappan extract was significantly lower than control and T1 during cold storage periods (P<0.05). Also, the reduction of moisture content, and the increase of cooking loss significantly occurred by the addition of 0.2% C. sappan extract. Also, the texture properties and sensory of sausages containing C. sappan extract were decreased compared to control. Inclusion of the C. sappan extract in sausages resulted in lower lightness and higher yellowness, chroma and hue values. However, the antioxidant, antimicrobial activity, and volatile basic nitrogen in the emulsion-type pork sausages with C. sappan extract showed increased quality characteristics during cold storage. In conclusion, the proper addition level of C. sappan extract was 0.1% on the processing of emulsion-type pork sausage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaesalpinia sappan 3aanti-infective properties 3aantioxidants 3acold storage 3acooking quality 3aheartwood 3anitrogen 3apH 3apork 3asausages 3asensory properties 3astorage time 3atexture 3awater content 0aC. sappan 0aQuality properties 0aAntioxidant activity 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aCold storage1 aHa, So-Ra1 aChoi, Jung-Seok1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8033-04100 tMeat science.g2015 Dec., v. 110 p.245-252dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2015.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001800181245010900199506007600308520155700384592002801941506003701969650002102006650002402027650002702051650001102078650002202089650002402111650000902135650001702144650001702161651001102178700002102189700002002210700002002230700001902250700001902269700001902288773012202307856007402429852000902503655001202512IND60650273720221207075851.0190709e20180324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065027372DNAL7 a10.3390/nu100404072doi7 aPMC59461922pmcid7 a295873702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlum, Solomon10aStakeholders’ Perceptions of Agronomic Iodine Biofortification: A SWOT-AHP Analysis in Northern Uganda  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAgronomic biofortification (i.e., the application of fertilizer to elevate micronutrient concentrations in staple crops) is a recent strategy recommended for controlling Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDDs). However, its success inevitably depends on stakeholders’ appreciation and acceptance of it. By taking Northern Uganda as a case, this study aimed to capture and compare the perceptions of seven key stakeholder groups with respect to agronomic iodine biofortification. Therefore, we employed a SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities &amp; Threats) analysis in combination with an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Findings show that stakeholders (n = 56) are generally positive about agronomic iodine biofortification in Uganda, as its strengths and opportunities outweighed weaknesses and threats. Cultural acceptance and effectiveness are considered the most important strengths while the high IDD prevalence rate and the availability of iodine deficient soils are key opportunities for further developing agronomic iodine biofortification. Environmental concerns about synthetic fertilizers as well as the time needed to supply iodine were considered crucial weaknesses. The limited use of fertilizer in Uganda was the main threat. While this study provides insight into important issues and priorities for iodine biofortification technology in Uganda, including differences in stakeholder views, the application of the SWOT-AHP method will guide future researchers and health planners conducting stakeholder analysis in similar domains.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiofortification 3adeficiency diseases 3afertilizer application 3aiodine 3aiodine deficiency 3amineral fertilizers 3asoil 3astakeholders 3astaple crops 3aUganda1 aGellynck, Xavier1 aOkello, Collins1 aWebale, Dominic1 aOdongo, Walter1 aOngeng, Duncan1 aDe Steur, Hans0 tNutrients.g2018 Mar. 24, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu100404073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245018800160500001400348520152300362592002801885650001601913650002001929650002001949650001001969650001101979650001501990650001002005650001402015650001302029650001802042650001302060650001302073650001102086650002502097700002302122700002302145700002702168700001802195773012402213856007402337852000902411655001202420IND60715346520221118205256.0201026e20200925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071534652DNAL7 a10.3390/nu121029402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerić, Marina 14aThe Effects of 6-Month Vitamin D Supplementation during the Non-Surgical Treatment of Periodontitis in Vitamin-D-Deficient Patients: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Study  aNAL-light  aBackground: This study assessed the effects of weekly vitamin D (VD) supplementation on clinical and biological parameters after scaling and root planning (SRP) in the treatment of periodontitis and served to validate the VD dosage regimen. Methods: It was a monocentric, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with 6 months follow-up. Healthy Caucasian periodontitis patients presenting serum 25(OH) vitamin D3 below 30 ng/mL were randomly allocated to test group (SRP + VD 25,000 international units (IU)/week) or the control group (SRP + placebo). Results: A total of 59 patients were screened, 27 were included and 26 completed 3 months (M) and 21 completed 6M control. Test (n = 13) and control groups (n = 14) had similar 25(OH) vitamin D3 levels at baseline (17.6 ± 7.4 vs. 14.4 ± 5.2, respectively). After one month, there was a significant difference between groups (32.9 ± 5.2 vs. 16.1 ± 4.7), also seen at M3 and M6 (t-test, p < 0.001). Periodontal treatment was successful in both groups, since it resulted in a reduction of all measured clinical parameters at M3 and M6 (probing pocket depth (PPD), full mouth bleeding and plaque). However, the reduction in PPD was greater in the test group. Conclusions: In this short-term pilot study, no significant differences were observed between two groups. However, supplementation with VD tended to improve the treatment of periodontitis in patients with initial 25(OH) vitamin D3 < 30 ng/mL and proved safe and efficacious.

Using a qualitative design, we explored the perceptions, awareness, and experiences of pregnancy nutrition, focusing on iodine. Women in the perinatal period (n = 48) were interviewed and filled in a food frequency questionnaire for iodine. Almost all participants achieved the recommended 150 μg/day intake for non-pregnant adults (99%), but only 81% met the increased demands of pregnancy (250 μg/day). Most were unaware of the importance, sources of iodine, and recommendations for iodine intake. Attitudes toward dairy products consumption were positive (e.g., helps with heartburn; easy to increase). Increased fish consumption was considered less achievable, with barriers around taste, smell, heartburn, and morning sickness. Community midwives were the main recognised provider of dietary advice. The dietary advice received focused most often on multivitamin supplements rather than food sources. Analysis highlighted a clear theme of commitment to change behaviour, motivated by pregnancy, with a desired focus on user-friendly documentation and continued involvement of the health services. The study highlights the importance of redirecting advice on dietary requirements in pregnancy and offers practical suggestions from women in the perinatal period as the main stakeholder group.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadults 3aattitudes and opinions 3adairy consumption 3adietary recommendations 3afish consumption 3afood frequency questionnaires 3ahealth services 3aiodine 3amidwives 3amultivitamin supplements 3aneurodevelopment 3anutrient requirements 3aperinatal period 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3asmell 3astakeholders 3ataste 3athyroid hormones1 aLean, Michael E.

This work aims to evaluate the impact of maritime transport emissions on air quality in Portugal using a numerical air quality modelling approach, with high-resolution emission data. Emissions from the European TNO inventory were compiled and pre-processed at hourly and high spatial (∼3 × 3 km²) resolutions. Scenarios with and without these maritime emissions were then simulated with the WRF-CHIMERE modelling system, extensively tested and validated for Portugal domain, in order to evaluate their impact on air quality. A simulation was performed for one year (2016) and the resulting differences were analysed in terms of spatial distribution, time series and deltas. The main deltas for NO₂ and PM10 are located over international shipping routes and major ports, while O₃ concentrations are impacted in a larger area. The modelling results also indicate that shipping emissions are responsible for deltas in the concentration of NO₂ higher than 20% over specific urban areas located in the west coast of Portugal, and less than 5% for PM10. For O₃ the relative contribution is low (around 2%) but this contribution is also observed at locations more than 50 km from the coast.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acoasts 3aemissions 3afossil fuels 3afuel combustion 3ainventories 3amodels 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3aparticulates 3asea transportation 3ashipping 3atime series analysis 3aurban areas 3aPortugal 0aAtmospheric pollutants 0aEmissions 0aShipping 0aAir quality modelling 0aPortugal1 aRusso, M.1 aGama, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9193-03741 aBorrego, C.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 Nov., v. 242 p.565-575dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2018.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03471naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006100145245009500206300001600301500001900317500002000336520155800356592002801914596005401942596007001996596002802066596010702094596008602201596007002287650002302357650002102380650001102401650001802412650001702430650001002447650001102457650001002468650002502478650001202503650001202515650001402527650001802541650002402559650002702583700001302610700002102623700001902644700006202663773011602725856007902841852000902920655001202929IND60740345920221121092341.0210602e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074034592DNAL7 a10.1111/1744-7917.128012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xiao‐Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2237-341710aLmIntegrinβ‐PS is required for wing morphogenesis and development in Locusta migratoria  ap. 705-717.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWings are an important flight organ of insects and their morphogenesis depends on a series of cell‐to‐cell and cell‐to‐extracellular matrix interactions. Integrin as a transmembrane protein receptor mediates cell‐to‐cell adhesion, cell‐to‐extracellular matrix interactions and signal transduction. In the present study, we characterized an integrin gene that encodes integrinβ‐PS protein in Locusta migratoria. LmIntegrinβ‐PS is highly expressed in the wing pads and the middle stages of 5th instar nymphs. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the LmIntegrinβ‐PS protein was localized at the cell base of the two layers of wings. After suppression of LmIntegrinβ‐PS by RNA interference, the wing pads or wings were unable to form normally, with a blister wing appearance during nymph to nymph transition and nymph to adult transition. We further found that the dorsal and ventral epidermis of the wings after dsLmIntegrinβ‐PS injection were improperly connected and formed huge cavities revealed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Furthermore, the morphology and structure of the wing cuticle was significantly disturbed which affected the stable arrangement and attachments of the wing epidermis. Moreover, the expression of related cell adhesion genes was significantly decreased in LmIntegrinβ‐PS‐suppressed L. migratoria, suggesting that LmIntegrinβ‐PS is required for the morphogenesis and development of wings during molting by stabilizing cell adhesion and maintaining the cytoskeleton of these cells.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0200900cNational Key R&D Program of China  a31702067, 31970469cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31761133021cNSFC‐DFG  a2019L0033cScientific and Technological Innovation Programs of Higher Education Institutions in Shanxi  a201803D221004‐5cKey Research and Development Program of Shanxi Province, China  a201805D211019cSpecial Talents Projects in Shanxi Province, China 3aLocusta migratoria 3aRNA interference 3aadults 3acell adhesion 3acytoskeleton 3aeosin 3aflight 3agenes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainsects 3ainstars 3aintegrins 3amorphogenesis 3asignal transduction 3atransmembrane proteins1 aNiu-Niu,1 aYang, Jia‐Peng1 aLiu, Wei‐Min1 aZhang, Jian‐Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3400-00440 tInsect science.g2021 June, v. 28, no. 3 p.705-717dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3869360x1672-96097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1744-7917.128013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245016600169300001600335520181600351592002802167650002202195650005002217650001602267650001302283650002102296650002202317650001402339650001502353650002402368650001102392650000702403650002102410650001302431650001402444650002202458650001902480650003002499650001102529650003002540650002902570650001902599700001802618700001702636700001602653700001402669700001702683773010102700856008402801852000902885655001202894IND60083858320221117043237.0141101e20120906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008385832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2012.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Chang Long10aCloning and biochemical analysis of β-glucoside utilization (bgl) operon without phosphotransferase system in Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum LY34  ap. 461-469.  aβ-Glucosidases are widespread in bacteria and involved in the metabolism of various carbohydrate substrates. Studying of β-glucoside utilization (bgl) operons on operon of Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum LY34 (Pcc LY34) will help us understanding how β-glucoside utilization (bgl) operon can cooperate with other systems in bacterium caused soft-rot disease. Pcc LY34 causes soft-rot disease in plants and expresses multiple enzymatic forms of β-glucosidases. To fully explore the β-glucoside utilization system in Pcc LY34, we have isolated a bgl operon from a genomic library for screening of β-glucosidase activities. Sequence analysis of a 3050bp cloned DNA fragment (accession number AY870655) shows two open reading frames (bglY and bglK) that are predicted to encode proteins of 474 and 278 amino acid residues, respectively. Pair wise similarity analysis suggests BglY is a beta-glucosidase (a member of glycosyl hydrolase family 1) and BglK is a transcriptional antiterminator protein. bglY promoter region contains an inverted repeat sequence similar to transcriptional terminator. Different from other four β-glucoside utilization operons of Pcc LY34 strain, BglY contains signal peptide sequences as extracellular β-glucosidase. Comparisons of five β-glucoside utilization operons of Pcc LY34 strain showed that bglYK operon does not have phosphotransferase system domain which are responsible for sugar transportation. BglY shares 33–44% identity with other four β-glucosidases of Pcc LY34 strain. Enzyme assay showed that purified BglY enzyme hydrolyzed salicin, arbutin, pNPG, and MUG, and exhibited maximal activity at pH 7.0 and 40°C. This activity was enhanced Mg²⁺. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed E166 and E371 are critical of BglY's β-glucosidase activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aPectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3abeta-glucosidase 3agenomic libraries 3amagnesium 3ametabolism 3aopen reading frames 3aoperon 3apH 3apromoter regions 3aproteins 3ascreening 3asequence analysis 3asignal peptide 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3asugars 3aterminal repeat sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransportation1 aKim, Min Keun1 aKang, Tae Ho1 aKim, Jungho1 aKim, Hun,1 aYun, Han Dae0 tMicrobiological research.g2012 Sept. 6, v. 167, no. 8 p.461-469dElsevier GmbHx0944-50137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2012.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001800181245012700199506007600326520156700402592002801969506003701997650002202034650002402056650002602080650001802106650001502124650001302139650001802152650001902170650002302189650002202212650001302234650001402247650002502261700001802286700001602304700002102320700002002341700002002361700002002381700001402401700001802415700001702433700001902450700001702469700001802486773012202504856007402626852000902700655001202709IND60650273920221207075941.0190709e20180326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065027392DNAL7 a10.3390/nu100404092doi7 aPMC59461942pmcid7 a295874382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Ming-Dar10aDoes Vitamin D Deficiency Affect the Immunogenic Responses to Influenza Vaccination? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInfluenza virus infection is a major global public health problem, and the efficacy of influenza vaccination is not satisfactory. Vitamin D is involved in many immune-mediated inflammatory processes. The impact of vitamin D levels on the immunogenic response to influenza vaccination is not clear. We performed a comprehensive literature search and systematic review of studies that investigated vitamin D and influenza vaccination. Data pertaining to study population, vaccine components, vitamin D levels, and immunogenic response were analyzed. Nine studies, with a combined study population of 2367 patients, were included in the systematic review. Four studies were included in the meta-analysis to investigate the influence of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) on the seroprotection (SP) rates and seroconversion (SC) rates following influenza vaccination. We found no significant association between vitamin D level and the immunogenic response to influenza vaccination. However, strain-specific differences may exist. We observed lower SP rates of influenza A virus subtype H3N2 (A/H3N2) and B strain in VDD patients than patients with normal vitamin D levels (A/H3N2: 71.8% vs. 80.1%, odds ratio (OR): 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.43–0.91, p = 0.01; B strain: 69.6% vs. 76.4%, OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.5–0.93, p = 0.01). However, the SP rates of A/H1N1 and SC rates of all three strains were not significantly different in VDD and control groups. In conclusion, no association was observed between VDD and immunogenic response to influenza vaccination.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInfluenza A virus 3aconfidence interval 3ainfluenza vaccination 3ameta-analysis 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3apublic health 3aseroconversion 3astrain differences 3asystematic review 3avaccines 3avitamin D 3avitamin D deficiency1 aLin, Chao-Hsu1 aLei, Wei-Te1 aChang, Hung-Yang1 aLee, Hung-Chang1 aYeung, Chun-Yan1 aChiu, Nan-Chang1 aChi, Hsin1 aLiu, Jui-Ming1 aHsu, Ren-Jun1 aCheng, Yu-Jyun1 aYeh, Tzu-Lin1 aLin, Chien-Yu0 tNutrients.g2018 Mar. 26, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu100404093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011400173300001600287520092600303592002801229650001801257650001501275650001301290650001901303650001501322650003001337650001501367650000901382650002001391653002501411653001901436653001901455653002601474700001801500700001601518700001801534700001401552773013201566856008701698852000901785655001201794IND60592651820221120181323.0190131e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059265182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.01.1922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhongshan10aEffect of two seaweed polysaccharides on intestinal microbiota in mice evaluated by illumina PE250 sequencing  ap. 796-802.  aEffect of polysaccharides from two seaweeds, Porphyra haitanensis and Ulva prolifera, on intestinal microbiota in mice was evaluated by illumina PE250 sequencing.

At the phylum level, the most predominant phylum was Bacteroidetes contributing 58.76%, 73.39%, 75.38% and 64.40% of the fecal microbiota in K, Z, H and D groups respectively, followed by Firmicutes, contributing 37.61%, 23.99%, 21.87% and 30.82% respectively. Many genera were significantly higher in the Z and H group than in the K group, including Prevotellaceae UCG-001 (p<0.05) and Rikenellaceae RC9 (p<0.01). In conclusion, our results suggest that polysaccharide type and glycoside may contribute to shaping mice gut microbiota.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aFirmicutes 3aPorphyra 3aUlva prolifera 3aglycosides 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amacroalgae 3amice 3apolysaccharides 0aPorphyra haitanensis 0aUlva prolifera 0aPolysaccharide 0aIntestinal microbiota1 aWang, Xiaomei1 aHan, Shuwen1 aLiu, Chundong1 aLiu, Feng0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 June, v. 112 p.796-802dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.01.1923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02020naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245013400165300001600299520079900315592002801114650001301142650002101155650000901176650001201185650002301197650001401220650001001234653002201244653001701266653002101283653000901304653001401313700001501327700001601342700001601358700001701374700001701391773009501408856008601503852000901589655001201598IND60533912020221120145801.0190403e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053391202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2015.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, J.C.10aSupra-nutritional vitamin E supplementation for 28days before slaughter maximises muscle vitamin E concentration in finisher pigs  ap. 270-277.  aA 4×3 factorial experiment (n=8 pigs per treatment combination) was conducted with 96 female Landrace×Large White pigs to examine the required level of dietary vitamin E and optimum feeding duration before slaughter to maximise muscle vitamin E content in the Longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) muscle. The respective factors were four dietary levels of vitamin E (supplemented as dl-α-tocopheryl acetate; 35, 300, 500, and 700IU/kg) and three feeding durations (14, 28 and 42days before slaughter). Vitamin E concentration in the LTL was maximised at 6mg/kg, which was achieved by feeding a 700IU vitamin E diet for 28days before slaughter (P<0.001). There was no further increase in the vitamin E content of the LTL by feeding the high vitamin E diet more than 28days before slaughter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aalpha-tocopherol 3adiet 3afemales 3alongissimus muscle 3aslaughter 3aswine 0aIntramuscular fat 0aMeat quality 0aMuscle vitamin E 0aPork 0aVitamin E1 aJose, C.G.1 aTrezona, M.1 aMoore, K.L.1 aPluske, J.R.1 aMullan, B.P.0 tMeat science.g2015 Dec., v. 110 p.270-277dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2015.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245019400166300001600360520091100376592002801287650003401315650001601349650002501365650001401390650001401404650001701418650001201435650001101447650001401458650001201472650001501484650002201499650001501521650002201536650003201558650002101590650002001611650002201631650001301653650001801666650001101684700001801695700001801713700001601731700001601747700001801763700001801781700001801799700001801817773013201835856008701967852000902054655001202063IND60592651920221120161234.0190131e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059265192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.01.2122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lei10aProtective effect of polysaccharides from Celluclast-assisted extract of Hizikia fusiforme against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress in vitro in Vero cells and in vivo in zebrafish  ap. 483-489.  aPolysaccharides were extracted by Celluclast-assisted hydrolysis and ethanol precipitation from Hizikia fusiforme (HFPS), and their in vitro antioxidant effects were evaluated in Vero cells. HFPS contains 63.56±0.32% sulfate polysaccharides, which comprise fucose (53.53%), galactose (23.15%), glucose (5.95%), and xylose (17.37%). HFPS scavenged DPPH, alkyl, and hydroxyl radicals at IC50 values of 0.81±0.02, 0.25±0.02, and 0.21±0.03mg/mL, respectively. HFPS significantly reduced H2O2-induced cytotoxicity in Vero cells. Furthermore, HFPS reduced intracellular ROS levels, and H2O2-induced apoptosis. HFPS has a strong protective effect against H2O2-stimulated oxidative stress in vivo in zebrafish, and showed improved survival rate, decreased heart rate, and reduced ROS generation and cell death. These results suggest that HFPS may be useful as an antioxidant in medical and cosmetic industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aDanio rerio 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3acosmetics 3acytotoxicity 3aethanol 3afucose 3agalactose 3aglucose 3aheart rate 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrolysis 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aoxidative stress 3apolysaccharides 3aprotective effect 3asulfates 3asurvival rate 3axylose1 aOh, Jae Young1 aKim, Hyun Soo1 aLee, WonWoo1 aCui, Yongri1 aLee, Hyo Geun1 aKim, Yong-Tae1 aKo, Jae Young1 aJeon, You-Jin0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 June, v. 112 p.483-489dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.01.2123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05179naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245011400185300001600299520253400315592002802849650003102877650002202908650002802930650001402958650001702972650001302989650001403002650003303016650004303049650001103092650002303103650002403126650001103150650001903161650001703180650001603197650002203213650002203235650000903257650001403266650002503280650001003305650001203315650003103327650002503358650004003383650002103423650001103444650003703455650004003492650004103532650004403573650004803617650003103665650002703696650003103723650001603754650003603770650000903806650002503815650002603840650003203866650002603898700001803924700002003942700001503962700001503977700003003992700002004022700001504042700001904057700002004076700001504096773011204111856008104223852000904304655001204313IND50060298420221119045016.0141111e20121218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006029842DNAL7 a230368092pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2012.09.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Qing-Feng10aEffect of a derived herbal recipe from an ancient Chinese formula, Danggui Buxue Tang, on ovariectomized rats  ap. 567-575.  aEthnopharmacological relevance: Radix Astragali (root of Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge. var. mongholicus (Bge.) Hsiao, RA), Radix Angelicae sinensis (root of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, RAS) and Folium Epimedii (leaves of Epimedium brevicomum Maxim., FE) are three of the extensively applied herbal remedies among traditional Chinese medicines for gynecological disorders and osteoporosis. A derivative herbal recipe—RRF, composed of the three medicines with a weight ratio of 5:1:5, is derived from a famous Chinese herbal formula—Danggui Buxue Tang (DBT). RRF has shown noteworthy protective effect in ovariectomized rats, which might represent a promising candidate for the treatment of perimenopausal disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the herbal recipe RRF for its efficacy on perimenopausal disorders and the underlying mechanisms via ovariectomy (OVX) models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An experimental model of OVX female rats was applied. Vehicle (Sham and OVX group), RRF (564, 282 and 141mg/kg/d) and conjugated equine estrogens (CEE, 0.1mg/kg/d, reference drug) were all administrated orally once daily for 16 weeks post operation. After the treatment, radioimmunoassay for estradiol (E₂), lutenizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and β-endorphin (β--EP), neurotransmitter determination by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD) for norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid), bone mineral density (BMD) assay as well as lipid peroxidation assessment, were carried out to probe into the effectiveness of RRF. RESULTS: (1) RRF treatment enhanced E₂ synthese while diminished the elevated serum FSH and LH levels; in terms of neurotransmitter, β-EP syntheses rallied whereas the hypothalamic NE, DA and 5-HT release experienced varying mitigation in OVX female rats. (2) Repeated administration of RRF was able to attenuate osteoporosis by elevating the BMD levels of total body, and arrest the bone trabeculae degradation. (3) RRF exposure decreased serum levels of constituent MDA and increased endogenous SOD activity. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the current studies revealed that RRF was capable of acting at multiple targets which presumably underlay its potential protective effect in OVX rats mimicking symptoms as observed in perimenopausal women. Hence, RRF might represent a promising candidate in the treatment of perimenopausal disorders in midlife women.  aPublisher supplied data 3a5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid 3aAngelica sinensis 3aAstragalus membranaceus 3aEpimedium 3abone density 3adopamine 3aestrogens 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3aluteinizing hormone 3amodels 3anorepinephrine 3aosteoporosis 3aovariectomy 3aprotective effect 3aradioimmunoassays 3arats 3aserotonin 3asuperoxide dismutase 3awomen 2aAnimals 2aBone Densityxdrug effects 2aDopaminexmetabolism 2aDrugs, Chinese Herbalxpharmacology 2aEstradiolxblood 2aFemale 2aFemurxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aFollicle Stimulating Hormonexblood 2aHydroxyindoleacetic Acidxmetabolism 2aHypothalamusxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aLumbar Vertebraexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aLuteinizing Hormonexblood 2aMalondialdehydexblood 2aNorepinephrinexmetabolism 2aOvariectomy 2aProtective Agentsxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSerotoninxmetabolism 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexblood 2abeta-Endorphinxblood1 aXie, Jian-Hui1 aDong, Tina T.X.1 aSu, Ji-Yan1 aCai, Da-Ke1 aChen, J.

Despite its remoteness, plastic pollution has been documented in this region. In the coming years, it is likely to worsen since, with climate changes and the opening of new shipping routes, the human presence is going to increase in the whole area. Here, we investigated the presence of microplastics (MPs) in sub-surface water and in two mid-trophic level Arctic fishes collected off Northeast Greenland: the demersal bigeye sculpin, Triglops nybelini, and the pelagic polar cod, Boreogadus saida. Plastics debris were found in the water samples at a concentration of 2.4 items/m³ ±0.8 SD which is higher than in most seas at lower latitudes. Both fish species had eaten MPs with different proportion among the species, 34% for T. nybelini (n = 71) and 18% for B. saida (n = 85). The significant difference in the occurrence of MPs between the two species is likely a consequence of their feeding behavior and habitat. Polyethylene was the main plastic polymer for water samples (41%, n = 17) and polyester (34%, n = 156) for fish samples as analyzed by Fourier Transformed Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Our data underscore that the Arctic regions are turning into a hotspot for plastic pollution, and this calls urgently for precautionary measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBoreogadus saida 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aTriglops 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3afeeding behavior 3afish 3ahabitats 3alatitude 3aplastics 3apollution 3apolyesters 3ashipping 3aArctic region 3aGreenland 0aGreenland sea 0aMicroplastics 0aPolar cod 0aFish 0aSub-surface 0aPlastic pollution 0aPolar regions1 aGhigliotti, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2139-13811 aEstévez-Calvar, Noelia1 aStifanese, Roberto1 aWieckzorek, Alina1 aDoyle, Tom1 aChristiansen, Jørgen S.1 aFaimali, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5558-35551 aGaraventa, Francesca0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 Nov., v. 242 p.1078-1086dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2018.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010100169300001600270520133100286592002801617650002101645650002501666650001601691650002501707650001701732650001501749650001201764650001601776650002101792650001001813650002801823650001101851650001801862650001401880650001301894700001701907700001701924700001501941700001701956700001901973700001801992700001702010700001802027700001802045773010102063856008402164852000902248655001202257IND60083858520221117043927.0141101e20120906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008385852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2012.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shao-Ru10aStRas2 regulates morphogenesis, conidiation and appressorium development in Setosphaeria turcica  ap. 478-486.  aThe proteins of Ras family are a large group of monomeric GTPases and act as molecular switches transducing extracellular signals into the cell in higher eukaryotes. However, little is known about roles of Ras family in the foliar pathogens. In this research, we cloned the gene named StRas2 encoding Ras in Setosphaeria turcica and investigated its function by RNA interference technology. We found that the growth rate of RNAi transformants named as R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6, in which the StRas2 silencing efficiency fell in turn. With the highest silencing efficiency, the transformant R1 showed anomalistic hyphae morphology, indicating its growth was significantly affected. The transformants with a middle-silencing efficiency, such as R3, R4, displayed a delay when forming appressoria and invasive hyphae. R1 could not form conidia and appressoria. However, the conidial formation in R5 and R6 was significantly reduced, and these two transformants could form appressoria and penetrate the artificial cellophane, only that its invasive hyphae were fascicular and rarely branched. The HT-toxin biological activity of all transformants showed no difference. All results suggested that StRas2 is involved in the morphogenesis, conidiation, and appressorium development and is not related to the biosynthesis of HT-toxin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aSetosphaeria turcica 3aappressoria 3abioactive properties 3abiosynthesis 3acellophane 3aconidia 3aconidiation 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3ahyphae 3amorphogenesis 3apathogens 3aproteins1 aHao, Zhi-Min1 aWang, Lihui,1 aShen, Shen1 aCao, Zhi-Yan1 aXin, Yuan-Yuan1 aHou, Mei-Ling1 aGu, Shou-Qin1 aHan, Jian-Min1 aDong, Jin-Gao0 tMicrobiological research.g2012 Sept. 6, v. 167, no. 8 p.478-486dElsevier GmbHx0944-50137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2012.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03895naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245008700156300001800243500002000261520174900281592002802030596008502058596005902143596005902202650002502261650001802286650001402304650001602318650001802334650002102352650001602373650001702389650001402406650003802420650001702458650001302475650001402488650002102502650002102523650002102544650001202565650001502577650000902592650002102601650003902622650002702661650001302688650001302701650001202714650001102726650001002737700001502747700005502762700001502817700001202832700001502844700001702859700001302876700001902889700005802908773014902966856007303115852000903188655001203197IND60676461920221121162021.0191118e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067646192DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.99692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Jiaheng10aAllergenicity reduction and rheology property of Lactobacillus‐fermented soymilk  ap. 6841-6849.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the reduction in the potential allergenicity of soymilk, and its rheological properties, after fermentation with Lactobacillus. Soymilk (SM) was fermented with Lactobacillus brevis and Lactobacillus sp. The molecular weight of fermented soymilk (FSM) was characterized using sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS‐PAGE), and the potential allergenicity of FSM was analyzed using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay in vitro and the BALB/c mouse model to detect changes in histamine, mouse mast cell protease‐1 (mMCP‐1), allergen‐specific IgG/IgE, and cytokine levels and histomorphology of jejunum in vivo. RESULTS: The SDS‐PAGE and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that allergens of soybean (β‐conglycinin and acidic subunit of glycinin) were almost degraded, and their immunoreactivity was decreased. In the BALB/c mouse model, the FSM group did not show anaphylactic shock symptoms compared with the SM group. Moreover, a tendency toward decreased serum allergen‐specific IgG/IgE levels, plasma histamine levels, and mMCP‐1 concentrations was observed in the FSM group. Furthermore, Th2‐related cytokines were decreased, while IFN‐γ production increased in spleen cell cultures. The intestinal villus was slightly damaged after the challenge. All these findings indicated that the Th1/Th2 balance in the FSM group shifted toward a Th1 response, ultimately reducing the potential allergenicity of FSM. Rheological assessment suggested that FSM has good viscous and pseudoplastic properties. CONCLUSION: Fermentation might be a promising method for producing tasty, hypoallergenic soybean products. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a2013AA102205cNational High Technology Research and Development Program of China  a31460439cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31760453cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aLactobacillus brevis 3aallergenicity 3aallergens 3aanaphylaxis 3aanimal models 3abeta-conglycinin 3ablood serum 3acell culture 3acytokines 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afermentation 3aglycinin 3ahistamine 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainterferon-gamma 3ajejunum 3amast cells 3amice 3amolecular weight 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3arheological properties 3arheology 3asoybeans 3asoymilk 3aspleen 3avilli1 aZu, Qinqin1 aYang, Anshu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5756-27551 aWu, Zhihua1 aLi, Xin1 aTong, Ping1 aYuan, Juanli1 aWu, Yong1 aFan, Qingsheng1 aChen, Hongbing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4845-383X0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2019 Dec., v. 99, no. 15 p.6841-6849dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.99693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001800192245009800210500001900308506007600327520100500403592002801408506003701436650002001473650001601493650001501509650002801524650001801552650001701570650001301587650001101600650002401611650002101635650001001656650001101666650000901677650001001686653002501696700002701721773009401748856008501842852000901927655001201936IND60690806120221207075308.0200508e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069080612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e009112doi7 aPMC62220902pmcid7 a304261062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarx, Sanette10aMicrowave-assisted recovery of monomeric sugars from an acidic steam treated wood hydrolysate  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFractionation of components from bio-refinery wastes streams is complicated by the presence of both oligomer and lignin fractions. Microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis was used in this study to convert oligomer sugars in an industrial prehydrolysis liquor (PHL) to monomeric sugars. A total of 19.6 g/L monomeric sugars was obtained at a combined severity factor (CSF) of 3.2. Furthermore, it was found that xylan linked to lignin in a lignin-carbohydrate complex (LCC) could be liberated, resulting in lignin with a relatively low dispersity (3.12) and average molecular weight (1718 g/mol) that has high commercial value in the phenol–formaldehyde resin industry. This study presents for the first time a relatively inexpensive method for recovery of 100% of available sugars in the PHL without apparent loss in monomeric sugar as well as 50% removal of lignin as a valuable by-product. Application of this method can significantly improve the economic sustainability of forest-based biorefineries.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacid hydrolysis 3abiorefining 3abyproducts 3aeconomic sustainability 3afractionation 3ahydrolysates 3aindustry 3alignin 3amicrowave treatment 3amolecular weight 3asteam 3asugars 3awood 3axylan 0aChemical engineering1 aRadebe, Lehlohonono J.0 tHeliyon.g2018 Nov., v. 4, no. 11 p.e00911-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e009113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006200145245013500207300001600342500001900358500002000377520138600397592002801783596010301811650001601914650001701930650001701947650001701964650001001981650001301991650002102004650002002025650001802045650001202063650002202075650001702097650003102114650001402145700005602159773011602215856007902331852000902410655001202419IND60740346220221121065512.0210602e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074034622DNAL7 a10.1111/1744-7917.128022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKh., Sanathoibi D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3638-908110aLarval feeding status regulates the transcript levels of genes encoding PTTH and allatoregulatory peptides in silkworm Bombyx mori  ap. 680-691.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn Bombyx mori, two dorsolateral neurosecretory cells (NSCs) in each of the two brain lobes have been identified as prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) producing cells. This neuropeptide in insects stimulates the prothoracic gland for the synthesis and release of ecdysone, responsible for the molting events. Allatotropin (AT) and allatostatin (AST) are allatoregulatory neuropeptides that regulate juvenile hormone biosynthesis. Here, by using RT‐qPCR, we showed that in B. mori, nutritional stress modulates the mRNA expression of AT and AST‐C (allatostain type C) in the central nervous system consisting of the brain lobes and all the associated ganglia. Using whole‐mount in situ hybridization, we showed that the feeding status of Bombyx larvae also influences the expression of PTTH in the NSCs of the brain. Food deprivation significantly decreased the mRNA expression levels of PTTH in larvae at active or terminal growth period. Further, we showed that insulin modulates the expression level of PTTH. However, its action was dependent on the feeding status of the larvae. At feeding, the insulin decreased the PTTH expression level, while at food deprivation, the insulin increased the PTTH expression level. The data thus indicates that larval feeding status plays an important role in altering the mRNA expression levels of allatoregulatory peptide genes and PTTH.  aPublisher supplied data  aBT/PR14289/BRB/10/837/2010cDepartment of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India 3aBombyx mori 3aallatostatin 3aallatotropin 3abiosynthesis 3abrain 3aecdysone 3afood deprivation 3agene expression 3ahybridization 3ainsulin 3ajuvenile hormones 3amalnutrition 3aprothoracicotropic hormone 3asilkworms1 aKeshan, Bela1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0912-85560 tInsect science.g2021 June, v. 28, no. 3 p.680-691dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3869360x1672-96097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1744-7917.128023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010300160500001400263520128100277592002801558650001501586650002301601650001401624650001601638650001401654650001201668650001201680650002801692650001401720650002301734650000901757650001501766650001301781650001001794650001101804650001501815651001001830700001801840700002001858773012401878856007402002852000902076655001202085IND60715346920221118205329.0201026e20200925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071534692DNAL7 a10.3390/nu121029432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRopero, Ana  B.10aNutrition Claims Frequency and Compliance in a Food Sample of the Spanish Market: The BADALI Study  aNAL-light  aNutrition claims (NCs) have been shown to affect customers’ perceptions and behaviour. In Europe, they are regulated by Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. The aim of this work was to analyse the prevalence and compliance of NCs according to this regulation in Spain. For this purpose, we used the BADALI database, which included 3197 foods present in the Spanish market. Our results show that 36.1% of all foods carried NCs, at a rate of 3.3 NCs/food. The prevalence was very heterogeneous among food groups. Nuts and seeds, legumes and non-alcoholic beverages were the groups with the highest prevalence. Micronutrients, fat, fibre and sugars were the nutrients most referred to in NCs. Overall, the compliance was low, with 49.2% NCs correct. Fibre and proteins were the nutrients with most correct NCs. Vegetables and non-alcoholic beverages were the food groups with the highest proportion of correct NCs. The main reason for incorrect NCs was because the amount of the nutrient was not stated in the label. The results of our study reveal that the aim of the European Commission to ensure a high level of protection for consumers regarding NCs has not been fulfilled. Therefore, we consider it crucial that European institutions invest in guaranteeing regulation compliance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompliance 3aconsumers (people) 3adatabases 3afood groups 3afrequency 3alegumes 3amarkets 3anon-alcoholic beverages 3anutrients 3anutrition labeling 3anuts 3aprevalence 3aproteins 3aseeds 3asugars 3avegetables 3aSpain1 aBlain, Nuria 1 aBeltrá, Marta 0 tNutrients.g2020 Sept. 25, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu121029433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245013800207300001400345520127700359592002801636650001201664650001601676650001201692650001301704650001001717650002201727650000901749650001501758650001001773650003601783650002301819650001401842650003101856653002001887653002101907653001101928653001601939653001901955700002001974700001701994700001702011773010902028856008602137852000902223655001202232IND60626599520221118012916.0210118e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062659952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.12.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedrotti, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9383-950410aEthnicity, gender and physiological parameters: Their effect on in vivo flavour release and perception during chewing gum consumption  ap. 57-70.  aIn this study, the impact of physiological parameters, ethnicity and gender on flavour perception and flavour release of chewing gum was investigated. Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry in-nose monitoring of volatile organic compounds was coupled to discontinuous time intensity sensory evaluation for mint flavour and sweetness perception. Each of the 29 subjects, 14 European and 15 Chinese panelists (13 male and 16 females, age 24 ± 1.4 years old) consumed the samples in triplicates. Physiological parameters (oral cavity volume, salivary flow, acetone and isoprene concentration and fungiform papillae density) were measured. Significant differences for in vivo flavour release between Chinese and European panelists after 90 s of consumption and after the gum was removed from the mouth were found. Significant differences were observed also in flavour and sweetness perception while no gender effect was detected.In this work, for the first time an effect of ethnicity on in-nose flavour release monitored through PTR-MS was noticed during chewing gum consumption, in agreement with the findings from sensory evaluation. Single physiological parameters do not explain the relation between flavour in nose release and perception during consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3achewing gum 3afemales 3aisoprene 3amales 3amass spectrometry 3amint 3amonitoring 3amouth 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3asensory evaluation 3asweetness 3avolatile organic compounds 0aFlavour release 0aIn-vivo analysis 0aPTR-MS 0aChewing gum 0aCross-cultural1 aSpaccasassi, A.1 aBiasioli, F.1 aFogliano, V.0 tFood research international.g2019 Feb., v. 116 p.57-70dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.12.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245013300174520138200307592002801689650002001717650001101737650001801748650002101766650002101787650001101808651001601819653002401835653002201859653002001881653001701901653002601918653002301944653000801967653000801975653001401983700002201997700006302019700006202082773009402144856008402238852000902322655001202331IND60734026320221119035212.0211213e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073402632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1122652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Wildt, Tristan E.13aAn ex ante assessment of value conflicts and social acceptance of sustainable heating systems: An agent-based modelling approach  aThis paper demonstrates an approach to assess, ex ante, the social acceptance of sustainable heating systems in city districts. More sustainable heating systems are required in city districts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, these systems may lack social acceptance as they often require significant adjustments to homes and may lead to a noticeable loss of in-home thermal comfort. Predicting social acceptance is often difficult due to the long-term planning horizon for energy systems. It is therefore unclear which design requirements and policy guidelines need to be specified ex ante. We suggest an approach to anticipate social acceptance by identifying value conflicts embedded in sustainable heating systems in specific social settings. These value conflicts might cause a lack of social acceptance over time due to value change. We demonstrate this approach using a case of community-driven heating initiative in The Hague, the Netherlands. We identify value conflicts embedded in various sustainable heating systems using an agent-based model. We formulate scenarios of value change to understand the severity of resulting social acceptance issues and discuss suitable heating systems for the city district. The approach can be used to support the decision-making process of policymakers at the local level, even in situations of limited local expertise.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3aex ante analysis 3agreenhouse gases 3amodels 3aNetherlands 0aSustainable heating 0aSocial acceptance 0aValue conflicts 0aValue change 0aAgent-based modelling 0aScenario discovery 0aABM 0aGHG 0aODD + D1 aBoijmans, Anne R.1 aChappin, Emile J.L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8529-42411 aHerder, Paulien M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4742-75220 tEnergy policy.g2021 June, v. 153 p.112265-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1122653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02261naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001900169245013700188300001600325520111600341592002801457650001301485650001701498650001601515650002001531650001101551650002201562650001501584650001101599650001401610650002301624650001401647650001101661700001701672773009101689856008601780852000901866655001201875IND4457687120221119044908.0141111e20110915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445768712DNAL7 a252121702pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.03.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chengjun10aUltrasound-assisted hydrolysis and gas chromatography–mass spectrometric determination of phenolic compounds in cranberry products  ap. 562-568.  aAn ultrasound-assisted hydrolysis and gas chromatography–mass spectrometric (GC–MS) method has been developed for determination of phenolics in cranberry products. Prior to GC–MS separation and characterisation, the phenolics in samples were hydrolysed by hydrochloric acid with ultrasound-assistance, extracted with ethyl acetate, and derivatised with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA)+1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) reagents. The application of ultrasonication significantly accelerated the acidic hydrolysation of the conjugated phenolics. A baseline separation of the 20 phenolics and internal standard was achieved in 25min. Standard calibration curves were linear over the concentration range of 0.0–50μg/mL and detection limits were 0.06–0.70μg/mL. Twenty phenolics were identified in cranberry samples and all of them occurred mainly in conjugated forms. Of those, the benzoic acid, quercetin, and myricetin were most abundant phenolics. The total phenolics were 12.4mg/g in cranberry fruits, 9.1mg/mL in 100% cranberry juice, and 11.1mg/g in cranberry sauces, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3abenzoic acid 3acranberries 3adetection limit 3afruits 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrolysis 3ajuices 3amyricetin 3aphenolic compounds 3aquercetin 3asauces1 aZuo, Yuegang0 tFood chemistry.g2011 Sept. 15, v. 128, no. 2 p.562-568dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.03.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245006400202506007600266520134200342592002801684506003701712650001301749650001201762650001201774650001201786650001701798650001701815650001601832651001901848700001901867773012201886856007402008852000902082655001202091IND60650274320221207075938.0190709e20180327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065027432DNAL7 a10.3390/nu100404132doi7 aPMC59461982pmcid7 a295846442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhitelock, Emily10aOn Your Own: Older Adults’ Food Choice and Dietary Habits  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe United Kingdom, in common with many countries, has an ageing demographic. Changes accompanying ageing can influence food choice and dietary habits. This study explored older adults’ perceptions and practices related to dietary behaviour and the factors influencing their food choice in later life. Semi-structured focus-group discussions were conducted with 30 individuals (aged 63–90 years) in a UK city. An inductive thematic approach was adopted for data analysis, and 4 themes and 12 sub-themes emerged: age-related changes (lower appetite, food changes, declining physical function); food access (food cost, support with food, maintaining independence); on your own (cooking for one, eating alone, shopping for one); and relationship with food (food variety, eating what you want, dieting). These influenced participants’ food acquisition, food preparation and cooking, as well as eating habits. Living alone and its substantial influence, as well as associated social isolation and loneliness, were highlighted in many of the discussions. Given the possible implications for nutritional intake, further work is recommended in this area. Likewise, steps should be taken to improve food access, increase opportunities for commensal eating and, fundamentally, address social isolation and loneliness in the older population.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aappetite 3acooking 3adieting 3aelderly 3afocus groups 3afood choices 3afood prices 3aUnited Kingdom1 aEnsaff, Hannah0 tNutrients.g2018 Mar. 27, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu100404133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013100162300001800293500001500311520128600326592002801612650002001640650001601660650002101676650002901697650001301726650001601739650002401755650001201779650000701791650001601798650002301814650001101837650002001848650001501868650001201883650001501895650001501910653001901925700001601944700001501960700001701975700001801992700001502010700001802025700002002043773014602063856008102209852000902290655001202299IND60575743720221118021707.0170728e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057574372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-7853-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qiu10aEffect of land use pattern change from paddy soil to vegetable soil on the adsorption-desorption of cadmium by soil aggregates  ap. 2734-2743.  a2019-12-06  aThe influence of land use change from paddy soil to vegetable soil on the adsorption-desorption behavior of Cd in soil aggregates and the variation in soil properties were investigated. The vegetable soil was characterized by lower pH, organic matter content, cation exchange capacity (CEC), free iron oxides, manganese oxides, and catalase activity and higher urease activity compared with the paddy soil. In the isothermal adsorption and desorption experiments, the adsorption characteristics of Cd of the two soils could be well described by Langmuir and Freundlich equations. The adsorption capacity of vegetable soil decreased 22.72 %, and the desorption rate increased 35 % with respect to paddy soil. Therefore, conversion from paddy to vegetable field can reduce the adsorption ability to Cd of the soil to a certain extent. Both the two soils reached the maximum adsorption capacity and the minimum desorption rate in the <0.002-mm faction. The adsorption capacity of Cd in paddy and vegetable soils exhibited great reliance on the content of CEC. Desorption rate was negatively correlated with the four indicators: organic matter, CEC, free iron oxides, and manganese oxides, and specific adsorption was primarily controlled by soil organic matter and manganese oxides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland use change 3acorrelation 3amanganese oxides 3acation exchange capacity 3acatalase 3airon oxides 3asoil organic matter 3acadmium 3apH 3apaddy soils 3asorption isotherms 3aurease 3asoil aggregates 3avegetables 3apaddies 3adesorption 3aadsorption 0aorganic matter1 aLi, Zhongwu1 aHuang, Bin1 aLuo, Ninglin1 aLong, Lingzhi1 aHuang, Mei1 aZhai, Xiuqing1 aZeng, Guangming0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Jan., v. 24, no. 3 p.2734-2743dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7853-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006400147245011000211520134500321592002801666650001501694650001701709650002501726650002301751650002001774650001701794650001301811650002101824650002101845650000901866650001001875650001401885650002001899650001601919650002901935650002301964650002601987650001502013650001702028650000902045650001002054653002602064653002302090653002102113653004002134653002902174700003902203700006702242700002802309700002102337700002202358700007702380773012302457856008102580852000902661655001202670IND60740830420221121223519.0211030e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074083042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1118832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDantas, Aline Macedo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3412-332710aEffect of cold plasma on açai pulp: Enzymatic activity, color and bioaccessibility of phenolic compounds  aThis study evaluates atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) effects on deteriorative enzymes, color, and phenolic compounds in açai pulp. The bioaccessibility of the bioactive compounds was also assessed after simulated digestion. Nine different treatments were applied, varying the excitation frequency (50, 500, 750 Hz) and processing time (5, 10, 15 min). ACP processing at low frequencies (50 Hz/15 min) was more effective in inactivating polyphenol oxidase (82.4%) and peroxidase (42.3%) (p < 0.05). Operation at medium excitation frequency and short application time (500 Hz/5 min) increased the phenolic content by 38.8% (p < 0.05). When treated at 500 Hz/5min and 500 Hz/15 min, the anthocyanin contents were similar to the untreated açaí pulp. The atmospheric cold plasma treatment 50 Hz/10 min increased the bioaccessibility of catechin (194.70%), epicatechin (383.44%), epigallocatechin gallate (68.84%), procyanidin B1 (130.71%), rutin (16.84%), caffeic acid (341.48%), and chlorogenic acid (57.63%). It increased the antioxidant activity of the bioaccessible fraction assessed by DPPH and ORAC assays. Cold plasma processing of acai pulp contributed to reducing PPO and POD activity; increased the phenolic compounds' bioaccessibility and antioxidant activity, facilitating the absorption of compounds after digestion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aapplication timing 3abioavailability 3acaffeic acid 3acatechin 3acatechol oxidase 3achlorogenic acid 3acold 3acolor 3adigestion 3aenzyme activity 3aepicatechin 3aepigallocatechin gallate 3ain vitro digestion 3anonthermal processing 3aperoxidase 3aprocyanidins 3apulp 3arutin 0aEmerging technologies 0aEnzymatic activity 0aEuterpe oleracea 0aGastrointestinal digestion in vitro 0aNon-thermal technologies1 aBatista, Jéssica Dayanne Ferreira1 ados Santos Lima, Marcos1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7057-48681 aFernandes, Fabiano A.N.1 aRodrigues, Sueli1 aMagnani, Marciane1 aBorges, Graciele da Silva Campelo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3412-33270 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Sept., v. 149 p.111883-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1118833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245016100171300001600332520132300348592002801671650002301699650001801722650002301740650001301763650003801776650001901814650001201833650002501845650000901870650003901879650001501918650001601933650001601949650005801965650001802023650001402041650002202055650001102077650002702088653002302115653002102138653003102159653002502190653002202215700002702237700005902264700002502323773013202348856008702480852000902567655001202576IND60592652220221123035903.0190131e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059265222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.02.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKazemi, Rezvan10aAllergenicity reduction of bovine milk β-lactoglobulin by proteolytic activity of lactococcus lactis BMC12C and BMC19H isolated from Iranian dairy products  ap. 876-881.  aNowadays health benefits of bioactive food constituents, known as probiotic microorganisms, are a growing awareness. Cow's milk is a nutritious food containing probiotic bacteria. However, milk allergenicity is one of the most common food allergies. The milk protein, β-lactoglobulin (BLG), is in about 80% of all main cases of milk allergies for children and infants. With the aim of screening proteolytic strains of lactic acid bacteria to evaluate their potential for the reduction of allergenicity of the major bovine milk proteins, we isolated new proteolytic strains of cocci lactic acid bacteria from traditional Iranian dairy products. The proteases produced by these strains had strong proteolytic activity against BLG. Proteolysis of BLG, observed after sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE, was confirmed by the analysis of the peptide profiles by reversed-phase HPLC. The two isolates were submitted to 16S rDNA sequencing and identified as Lactcoccus lactis subsp. cremoris and Lactcoccus lactis subsp. hordniea. The competitive ELISA experiments confirmed that these isolates, with high proteolytic activity, reduce significantly the allergenicity of BLG. Accordingly, these isolates can reduce the immunoreactivity of bovine milk proteins, which can be helpful for the production of low-allergic dairy products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactococcus lactis 3aallergenicity 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3achildren 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afood allergies 3ainfants 3alactic acid bacteria 3amilk 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprobiotics 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3aribosomal DNA 3ascreening 3asequence analysis 3asodium 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 0aCow's milk allergy 0aβ-Lactoglobulin 0aCocci lactic acid bacteria 0aProteolytic activity 0aCompetitive ELISA1 aTaheri-Kafrani, Asghar1 aMotahari, Ahmad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1709-98041 aKordesedehi, Reihane0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 June, v. 112 p.876-881dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.02.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245008300158300001800241500002000259520151900279592002801798596008101826650001601907650002001923650001001943650001901953650001701972650001201989650001002001650001002011650001802021650002302039650001202062650001402074650001202088650002202100650002002122650001102142650001102153700001902164700001902183700002302202700002002225700001402245700001902259700002102278700002002299700005702319773014902376856007302525852000902598655001202607IND60676462320221123013612.0191118e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067646232DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.99622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Zhao‐Bo10aComparison of internal organs between myostatin mutant and wild‐type piglets  ap. 6788-6795.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Myostatin (MSTN) negatively regulates skeletal muscle development; however, its functions in internal organs have not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we compared the morphological, molecular, and biological characteristics of the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, and tongue of homozygous MSTN mutant (MSTN⁻/⁻), heterozygous MSTN mutant (MSTN⁺/⁻), and wild‐type (WT) piglets. RESULTS: The heart and liver were lighter in MSTN⁻/⁻ piglets than in MSTN⁺/⁻ piglets, while the tongue was heavier in MSTN⁻/⁻ piglets than in WT piglets (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the tongue was longer in MSTN⁻/⁻ piglets than in WT piglets, and myofibers of the tongue were significantly larger in the former piglets than in the latter ones (P < 0.01). mRNA expression of MSTN in all organs was significantly lower in MSTN⁻/⁻ and MSTN⁺/⁻ piglets than in WT piglets (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, mRNA expression of follistatin, which is closely related to MSTN, in the heart and liver was significantly higher in MSTN⁻/⁻ piglets than in MSTN⁺/⁻ and WT piglets (P < 0.05). In addition, protein expression of MSTN in the heart, kidneys, and tongue was significantly lower in MSTN⁻/⁻ piglets than in WT piglets (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that MSTN is widely expressed and has marked effects in multiple internal organs. Myostatin has crucial functions in regulating internal organ size, especially the tongue. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a20170204035N YcScience and Technology Development Project in Jilin Province 3afollistatin 3agene expression 3aheart 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3akidneys 3aliver 3alungs 3amessenger RNA 3amuscle development 3amutants 3amyostatin 3apiglets 3aprotein synthesis 3askeletal muscle 3aspleen 3atongue1 aLuo, Qi‐Rong1 aXuan, Mei‐Fu1 aHan, Sheng‐Zhong1 aWang, Jun‐Xia1 aGuo, Qing1 aChoe, Yong-Gyu1 aJin, Song‐Shan1 aKang, Jin‐Dan1 aYin, Xi‐Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0322-35600 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2019 Dec., v. 99, no. 15 p.6788-6795dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.99623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100007100153245007500224300001600299520116400315592002801479650001701507650003001524650002801554650001501582650002301597650002701620651001101647653001301658653003101671653001101702653002001713653001501733773011001748856008801858852000901946655001201955IND60626599920221118012843.0190321e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062659992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira da Silva, Alexandre1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8707-864110aBrazilian large-scale marine protected areas: Other “paper parks”?  ap. 104-112.  aThis article takes the opportunity of the recent establishment of two large and remote marine protected areas (MPAs) in Brazilian jurisdictional waters to discuss the role played by large-scale MPAs and their impacts to achieve international goals. After the launching of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in 2010, especially Target 11, which concerns marine areas, some coastal states have created large-scale MPAs as a way of attaining a numerical target, though not necessarily fulfilling other ecosystem commitments. Brazil is the most recent example of this strategy through the establishment of MPAs that seem primarily concerned with international goals rather than effective biodiversity protection. Since the management of these protected areas will be shared between a technical body (Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation) and the Navy, and only a small portion of which will have similar status to “no-take” zone, the new MPAs can hardly be identified as being strongly committed to the marine environment protection. The article ends with some suggestions for improving biodiversity conservation in the Brazilian large-scale MPAs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3acoastal zone management 3aecosystems 3amarine environment 3amarine protected areas 3aBrazil 0aReserves 0aAichi biodiversity targets 0aBrazil 0aOceanic islands 0aProtection0 tOcean & coastal management.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 169 p.104-112dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03566naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245013600164300001600300520189800316592002802214650001502242650001102257650001302268650001202281650001502293650001102308650002402319650001602343650003002359650001802389650002602407650001102433650001402444650001502458650002002473650001402493650002002507650002802527650001602555653002702571653002002598653002602618653002402644653004002668653002002708700001302728700001402741700002102755700001602776773011302792856008602905852000902991655001203000IND60644282620221119114451.0191231e20190820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064428262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.3152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYun, Hao10aOptimization of energy consumption in coating removal for recycling scrap coated cemented carbide tools using hybrid laser-waterjet  ap. 104-114.  aIn order to purified recovery of scrap cemented carbide, stripping of coatings was mandatory as engineering tools for improving service life were almost modified with anti-wear coatings. However, the low efficiency of current coating removal technologies leaded to the overmuch energy consumption, it was of great importance to achieve energy conservation to relieve the environment impact because of sustainable development. Reducing the energy consumption during processing could significantly improve the environmental performance of manufacturing systems. According to the energy consumption characteristics of hybrid laser-waterjet machine, a multi-objective optimization model for energy prediction with key parameters under actual constraints is constructed to trade off two responses: the cutting specific energy consumption (CSEC) and the processing time, which is transformed into a single-objective model and then solved by genetic algorithm. Simultaneously, the orthogonal experiment is proposed to identify the parametric influence on the multi-objective optimization and to validate the feasibility of the proposed model with the comparisons between single-objective and multi-objective optimization. Finally, the comparisons about energy consumption, carbon emission and the mechanical properties between high temperature oxidation method and hybrid laser-waterjet technology are carried out. The results indicate that larger feed speed and larger laser offset distance can benefit the energy conservation due to the shortened processing time. The multi-objective optimization model realizes about 80% of energy conservation compared to minimum CSEC, and 40% of which compared to minimum processing time. Contrasted to the energy conservation and substrate quality after processing, the hybrid laser-waterjet technology is much better than the high-temperature oxidation method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acarbon 3acoatings 3acutting 3adurability 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aengineering 3aenvironmental performance 3amanufacturing 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aprediction 3aprocessing time 3arecycling 3aspecific energy 3asustainable development 3atemperature 0aScrap cemented carbide 0aCoating removal 0aHybrid laser-waterjet 0aEnergy conservation 0aCutting specific energy consumption 0aCarbon emission1 aZou, Bin1 aWang, Jun1 aHuang, Chuanzhen1 aLi, Shizhen0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Aug. 20, v. 229 p.104-114dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.3153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03950naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245015300161300001800314520227400332592002802606650005002634650002002684650002402704650001202728650003502740650001202775650001302787650001102800650001902811650001502830650003102845650001702876650001702893650000902910650001102919650001702930650001102947650001802958650001602976650001602992650001803008650001503026650000903041651001003050651001803060700001803078700001903096700001703115700001603132773014603148856008103294852000903375655001203384IND60575744120221118021514.0170728e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057574412DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-8046-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xin10aDistribution and health risk assessment of dissolved heavy metals in the Three Gorges Reservoir, China (section in the main urban area of Chongqing)  ap. 2697-2710.  aThe Three Gorges Project (TGP) is the largest hydropower station ever built in the world. A better understanding of the concentrations of heavy metals in the aquatic environment of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) is crucial for national drinking water security and sustainable ecosystem development. To thoroughly investigate the impact of heavy metals on water quality after the impoundment to the maximum level of 175 m in the TGR, the concentrations of the dissolved heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, As) were measured in April and August 2015, by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). (1) Except Zn and Pb, most of the heavy metal concentrations in the water of the TGR reached the level of the National Surface Water Environmental Quality Standards (GB3838-2002) I of China, revealing that the water quality of the TGR was good overall. (2) There were significant positive correlations among the concentrations of Cu, As, and Cd, revealing that they may exhibit similar geochemical behaviors. (3) The spatial distribution of the heavy metal concentrations was diverse and complex. The Zn concentration obviously increased in the rainy season from upstream to downstream in the Yangtze River, while the other heavy metals exhibited no significant changes in their concentrations. The distribution characteristics of the heavy metal concentrations on both sides and the middle of the river were different at different sites. (4) The health risk of the six elements was assessed through a human health risk assessment (HHRA), and the assessment results were lower than the maximum acceptable risk level designed by the US EPA and International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). The HHRA model in the aquatic environment revealed that the risk of non-carcinogenic heavy metals (Cu, Zn, and Pb) was at a negligible risk level of 10⁻¹¹∼10⁻⁹ a⁻¹. At all the study sites, the risk of carcinogenic heavy metals (Cr, Cd, and As) was higher than the risk of non-carcinogenic heavy metals. As was the most important risk factor, followed by Cr. The results of this study hold great significance for a timely understanding of the changing water quality for affected departments to ensure the health of the residents in the TGR area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aacceptable risk 3aaquatic environment 3aarsenic 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3adrinking water 3aecosystems 3ahealth effects assessments 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3alead 3amodels 3arisk factors 3arivers 3asurface water 3aurban areas 3awater power 3awater quality 3awet season 3azinc 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aLi, Ting-Yong1 aZhang, Tao-Tao1 aLuo, Wei-Jun1 aLi, Jun-Yun0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Jan., v. 24, no. 3 p.2697-2710dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-8046-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245013100166300001400297520122800311592002801539650002201567650002501589650001301614650002001627650001801647650001401665650002101679650001101700650002301711650001201734650002201746650003001768650002201798653002201820653002001842653002001862653003301882700001401915700001401929700001701943700001601960700005701976700001702033700001702050700001202067773013002079856008702209852000902296655001202305IND60592652520221123035851.0190131e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059265252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.01.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lijun10aImproving the thermostability by introduction of arginines on the surface of α-L-rhamnosidase (r-Rha1) from Aspergillus niger  ap. 14-21.  aTo improve the thermostability of α-L-rhamnosidase (r-Rha1), an enzyme previously identified from Aspergillus niger JMU-TS528, multiple arginine (Arg) residues were introduced into the r-Rha1 sequence to replace several lysine (Lys) residues that located on the surface of the folded r-Rha1. Hinted by in silico analysis, five surface Lys residues (K134, K228, K406, K440, K573) were targeted to produce a list of 5 single-residue mutants and 4 multiple-residue mutants using site-directed mutagenesis. Among these mutants, a double Lys to Arg mutant, i.e. K406R/K573R, showed the best thermostability improvement. The half-life of this mutant's enzyme activity increased 3 h at 60 °C, 23 min at 65 °C, and 3.5 min at 70 °C, when compared with the wild type. The simulated protein structure based interaction analysis and molecular dynamics calculation indicate that the thermostability improvement of the mutant K406R-K573R was possibly due to the extra hydrogen bonds, the additional cation-π interactions, and the relatively compact conformation. With the enhanced thermostability, the α-L-rhamnosidase mutant, K406R-K573R, has potentially broadened the r-Rha1 applications in food processing industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aalpha-L-rhamnosidase 3aarginine 3aenzyme activity 3afood industry 3ahalf life 3ahydrogen bonding 3alysine 3amolecular dynamics 3amutants 3aprotein structure 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3athermal stability 0aα-L-Rhamnosidase 0aThermostability 0aRational design 0aLys → Arg substitution1 aLiao, Hui1 aYang, Yan1 aGong, Jianye1 aLiu, Jianan1 aJiang, Zedong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7579-36801 aZhu, Yanbing1 aXiao, Anfeng1 aNi, Hui0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 June, v. 112 p.14-21dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.01.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001600141245012300157300001600280520148200296592002801778650002701806650002501833650004701858650001801905650001401923650001701937650001701954650001801971653002701989653001702016653004402033700002102077700001902098700001802117700001502135700001602150700001602166773012402182856007602306852000902382655001202391IND60480787920221119200451.0200226e20100601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048078792DNAL7 a10.3920/BM2009.00342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReimann, S.10aDevelopment of a rapid screening protocol for selection of strains resistant to spray drying and storage in dry powder  ap. 165-174.  aAn efficient screening method for selection of Bifidobacterium longum strains resistant to spray drying and storage was developed based on randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) for identification of the best survivors in mixed strains bacterial preparations. Three different primers were used to generate RAPD profiles of 22 B. longum strains. All strains were distinguished according to their RAPD profiles except for the strain NCC2705 and its H₂O₂ resistant derivative variant. The 22 strains were grouped in 3 batches of 7, 7 and 8 strains and subjected to spray drying and storage at 30 and 37 °C under anaerobic conditions. Batch survival rates after spray drying reached 17.1±4.4%. Strains showing the highest prevalence and/or resistance to storage at 37 °C were selected from individual batches for subsequent spray drying and storage testing. After 67 days of storage, NCC572 was identified as the dominant strain in powder. The stability of strain NCC572 was confirmed by performing single spray drying and storage tests. Out of 22 B. longum strains, a robust strain was identified by combining RAPD with a simultaneous screening test for survival under spray drying and storage. The method allowed a fast screening of B. longum strains in mixture for resistance to spray drying and storage compared to traditional screening procedures carried out with individual strains, in the same conditions. This approach could be applied to other stress conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium longum 3aanaerobic conditions 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3arapid methods 3ascreening 3aspray drying 3astorage time 3asurvival rate 0aBifidobacterium longum 0aspray drying 0arandom amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)1 aGrattepanche, F.1 aBaggenstos, C.1 aRezzonico, E.1 aBerger, B.1 aArigoni, F.1 aLacroix, C.0 tBeneficial microbes.g2010 June 1, v. 1, no. 2 p.165-174dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:6303x1876-28917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/BM2009.00343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011300166300001600279500001500295520181600310592002802126650004002154650002702194650002502221650002802246650001102274650002102285650002302306650001902329650001102348650002902359650002202388650003202410650001702442653001502459700001602474700002002490773009802510856004802608852000902656655001202665IND50063063720221119044722.0130324e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006306372DNAL7 a10.1007/s10725-012-9761-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Xiao-Dong10aPhysiological, structural, and proteomic analysis of chloroplasts during natural senescence of Ginkgo leaves  ap. 191-201.  a2019-12-06  aA proteomic analysis was conducted to study the changes in chloroplast proteins during leaf senescence in Ginkgo under natural conditions. We also examined the physiological changes in senescing chloroplasts, including changes in photosynthesis and alterations in chloroplast ultrastructure. Decreased photosynthetic activity was observed during leaf senescence, while chloroplast structures were damaged with grana thylakoid unstacking and large accumulation of osmiophilic granules. Chloroplast proteins were extracted from Ginkgo leaves collected at an early stage (June) and late stage (October) of leaf senescence, and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. More than 850 protein spots were reproducibly detected, including 27 that were up-regulated and 21 that were down-regulated during senescence. Mass spectrometry analysis and database searches identified 17 spots, which represented 15 different proteins. Fifteen of these spots were chloroplast proteins, and the other two spots were proteins of unknown localization in Ginkgo leaves. Five of the proteins were previously reported as senescence-related proteins, and 10 were novel; (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl diphosphate synthase, Ycf4, putative 97B2-like cytochrome P450, limonene synthase, light-independent protochlorophyllide reductase subunit B, taxadiene synthase, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, ribosomal protein L2, RNA polymerase alpha chain, and RNA polymerase IV second largest subunit. These proteins are involved in photosynthesis, transcription and translation, secondary metabolism, and reactive oxygen species scavenging. The results indicated that the decline of photosynthesis was mainly due to the decrease in stomatal conductance and the degradation of the photosynthetic apparatus during leaf senescence.  aPublisher supplied data 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3atranslation (genetics) 3astomatal conductance 3areactive oxygen species 3aGinkgo 3acytochrome P-450 3aribosomal proteins 3aphotosynthesis 3aleaves 3atranscription (genetics) 3amass spectrometry 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3achloroplasts 0asenescence1 aShi, Da-Wei1 aChen, Guo-Xiang0 tPlant growth regulation.g2013 Mar., v. 69, no. 2 p.191-201dSpringer-Verlagx0167-69037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-012-9761-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245009600204300001800300500001900318520120900337592002801546650001501574650001501589650001401604650002101618650001301639650001101652650001901663700006901682700006401751700002301815700001801838700002201856700006401878773017001942856008002112852000902192655001202201IND60740347120221121092332.0210602e20210520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074034712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c002092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaccari, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6044-454110aOptimally Managing Chemical Plant Operations: An Example Oriented by Industry 4.0 Paradigms  ap. 7853-7867.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUpdating industrial facilities to increase the level of automation and digitalization to match Industry 4.0 paradigms has become essential for many companies. Following such a trend, this paper presents a real-time optimization algorithm that plays a central role in a larger project framework devoted to highly interconnecting different network components of an Italian chemical industrial site. The proposed methodology aims at best managing the production rates of various products to fulfill a sales plan organized to satisfy numerous client requests. The considered model takes into account both batch and continuous processes as well as salable and non-storable products. The algorithm structure relies on the use of a non-linear optimization scheme and on the concepts of batch scheduling. Different features of the proposed methodology have been tested on real plant data, showing how the predicted forecast always improved the initial operation plan by considering both aspects of feasibility and economic nature. The use of the proposed algorithm assures the basis for fully integrating the control systems and the selling department of the facility in a more interactive and responsive manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aautomation 3achemistry 3aindustrial sites 3aindustry 3amodels 3aprocess design1 aBacci di Capaci, Riccardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6339-63031 aBrunazzi, Elisabetta1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6316-69461 aTognotti, Leonardo1 aPierno, Paolo1 aVagheggi, Roberto1 aPannocchia, Gabriele1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5578-344X0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 May 20, v. 60, no. 21 p.7853-7867dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c002093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245011200152300001800264500002000282520145100302592002801753596005901781596005901840596007901899650001801978650002301996650001302019650001602032650001402048650002502062650001802087650001902105650001702124650001902141650000702160650002502167650001702192650002002209650001502229650001602244650001202260650001702272700005402289700001902343700001602362700001302378700001602391700001602407700001302423700001402436700001302450700001802463700001502481773015002496856007302646852000902719655001202728IND60676462720221122011502.0191118e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067646272DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.99552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Xin10aEffect of enzyme types on the stability of oil‐in‐water emulsions formed with rice protein hydrolysates  ap. 6731-6740.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Common oil‐in‐water plant‐based emulsions are allergenic and unstable to environmental stress, leading to increased consumer concerns about the food industry. To solve the problem of safety and instability, we investigated the influence of environmental stress on the stability of emulsions containing various rice protein hydrolysates, and compared the performance to whey protein, a common food emulsifier. RESULTS: Rice protein hydrolysates were obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis with different proteases (neutrase, trypsin and alcalase). We evaluated the stability of emulsions produced with different hydrolysates according to storage, pH, ionic strength and thermal processing. Trypsin hydrolysates formed emulsion as stable as emulsion containing whey protein against a range of environmental stress containing pH (pH 6 to 7), salt (< 150 mmol L–¹ NaCl) and temperature (30–90 °C). Moreover, a higher partition coefficient of protein in emulsion showed that the trypsin hydrolysates were easy to adsorb at the oil–water droplet interface, indicating its higher stability. CONCLUSION: The results obtained in the present study suggest that trypsin hydrolysates could be utilized as natural emulsifiers to stabilize emulsion instead of traditional animal‐based emulsifiers, opening many opportunities with respect to hypoallergenic emulsion systems in the food industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a31471680cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31972020cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017YFD0401105cthe National Key Research and Development Program of China 3aallergenicity 3aconsumer attitudes 3adroplets 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afood industry 3aheat treatment 3ahydrolysates 3aionic strength 3apH 3aprotein hydrolysates 3arice protein 3asodium chloride 3asubtilisin 3atemperature 3atrypsin 3awhey protein1 aFang, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8310-56731 aWang, Lingling1 aXie, Minhao1 aHu, Bing1 aZhu, Yiqing1 aZhao, Ermin1 aPei, Fei1 aShen, Fei1 aLi, Peng1 aShen, Xinchun1 aHu, Qiuhui0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2019 Dec., v. 99, no. 15 p.6731-6740dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.99553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245010100163300001600264520168100280592002801961650001101989650001702000650002302017650002402040650002002064650001002084650002602094650001502120650001102135650001802146650001802164650001002182651001002192700001902202700001602221773009502237856004802332852000902380655001202389IND4471499820221119045256.0120306e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447149982DNAL7 a10.1007/s10457-012-9485-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Fu-liang10aCompetitive interactions in Ginkgo and crop species mixed agroforestry systems in Jiangsu, China  ap. 401-415.  aIntercropping Ginkgo and crop species in southern China is receiving increasing attention because it offers potential advantages for resource utilization, higher economic income to farmers and increased sustainability in crop production, We carried out a 2-year field intercropping system composed of Ginkgo with wheat, broad bean, and rapeseed, respectively, to determine the competitive interactions between the different species, and productivity and the economic yield of each intercropping system. The density of Ginkgo and crop species was varied systematically in a two-way density matrix composed of three monoculture densities and nine intercropping of all possible pairwise combinations of monoculture densities. Intercropping systems were assessed on the basis of several intercropping indices such as land equivalent ratio, relative crowding coefficient, relative competition intensity and vector competition analysis. The results showed that the combined biomass production of the component crop species was significantly greater in the Ginkgo/crop mixtures than in monocultures crops (Ginkgo, broad bean, wheat, and rapeseed). Ginkgo: rapeseed ratio 24:12, Ginkgo: bread bean ratio 24:5, and Ginkgo: wheat ratio 24:200 had the best total biomass production. Ginkgo: rapeseed (and broad bean) ratio 24:5 and Ginkgo: wheat ratio 24:200 in respective Ginkgo/crop mixtures had the maximum economic yield. Vector competition analysis showed that Ginkgo/rapeseed mixture exhibited an antagonistic interaction type and therefore is not suitable for intercropping. Ginkgo/broad bean mixture demonstrated the most beneficial effects among the three intercropping systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGinkgo 3aagroforestry 3abiomass production 3acontinuous cropping 3acrop production 3acrops 3aeconomic productivity 3afaba beans 3aincome 3aintercropping 3aplant density 3awheat 3aChina1 aKimmins, J.

During the past 20 years, several islands – including Flores, Ambon and Bali – that had historically been free of rabies have become infected. However, the Dutch East Indies (a Dutch colony that became modern Indonesia following World War II) had been infected since the 1880s. The spread of rabies is a lesson in the emergence of an infectious disease.Reports of human cases treated for rabies and livestock rabies cases from the 1880s to 1917 were compiled. The spatial and temporal distribution of these cases was analyzed using maps, spatial statistics and time-series techniques. The first confirmed case of rabies was reported in 1889 from the Batavia [Jakarta] district (although disease suspicion was reported as early as 1884). During the 1890s rabies was already commonly reported from Java and the east coast of Sumatra, and by the late 1890s, from Celebes [Sulawesi]. Between 1900 and 1916, cases were reported from other parts of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi, and from Borneo, the Moluccas and other outlying islands. Between 1897 and 1916, a total of 8826 human cases treated for rabies were reported and between 1908 and 1917, 1033 livestock cases were reported. Most (97.5%) human cases treated were attributed to rabid dogs. Increasing numbers of reports were observed during the period. Between 1908 and 1916 the correlation between human and livestock case reports was 64.2%, and at the district level it was 75.9%. Moderate correlations (>40%) were found between human cases and livestock cases reported up to six months previously. Based on year of first report from each district, human cases were strongly clustered (Moran's autocorrelation 0.47, P=0.005). The most likely spatio-temporal cluster of reported cases of humans treated for rabies originated from the west coast of Sumatra between 1899 and 1905, and other clusters were identified in west Java (1898–1899), the district of Batavia and in east Java (1910–1911), Nusa Tengarra Barat (1912), Borneo (1914) and the east coast of Sumatra (1903–1906).Rabies was probably first introduced to the colonial capital of the Dutch Indies, Batavia [Jakarta] in the 1880s. It then spread rapidly throughout most of the archipelago during the next two to three decades because of the movement of dogs via the military forces, for trade and as pets, despite government regulations designed to control the epidemic. Such a history suggests that further emergence and reemergence of rabies in rabies-free islands will occur based on an island's location and position within the complex social, trade and transport network that represents the Indonesian archipelago. Targeted surveillance and enforcement of quarantine regulations remain critical, to prevent history repeating itself.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3acase studies 3acoasts 3adogs 3ahumans 3aislands 3alaws and regulations 3alivestock 3amonitoring 3apets 3aquarantine 3arabies 3atime series analysis 3atrade 3aBorneo 3aIndonesia 0aRabies 0aTransboundary disease spread 0aDisease emergence 0aSpatial analysis 0aIndonesia 0aDutch East Indies0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2014 Apr. 01, v. 114, no. 1 p.11-20dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2014.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006700149245014300216520122900359592002801588650002301616650001801639650001201657650001301669650001101682653001601693653002101709653002301730653003101753653002201784700001701806700001901823700003201842773009401874856008401968852000902052655001202061IND60734027220221119035427.0211213e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073402722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1122852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaeem, Muhammad Abubakr1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6962-317510aComparative efficiency of green and conventional bonds pre- and during COVID-19: An asymmetric multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis  aMotivated by the lack of research on price efficiency dynamics of green bonds and the impact of the COVID-19 on the pricing of fixed-income securities, this study investigates the comparative efficiency of green and conventional bond markets pre- and during the COVID-19 pandemic applying asymmetric multifractal analysis. Specifically, the multifractal scaling behaviour is examined separately during upward and downward trends in bond markets using the asymmetric multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (A-MF-DFA) approach. The empirical findings confirm the presence of asymmetric multifractality in the green and traditional bond markets. Not surprisingly, inefficiency in both bond markets significantly escalated during the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, our results indicate a higher level of efficiency of the conventional bond market over the full sample period. However, the green bond market is more efficient during a black swan event, such as the COVID-19 global pandemic, showing the potential of green bonds to become an effective diversifier for investors in traditional assets in times of extreme market turmoil. The results of the study can have important implications for investors and policymakers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aenergy policy 3amarkets 3apandemic 3aprices 0aGreen bonds 0aPrice efficiency 0aConventional bonds 0aAsymmetric multifractality 0aCOVID-19 pandemic1 aFarid, Saqib1 aFerrer, Román1 aShahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain0 tEnergy policy.g2021 June, v. 153 p.112285-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1122853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002500192245012400217500001900341506007600360520139600436592002801832506003701860650001501897650001101912650001901923650001201942650001101954650000901965650002301974651001001997653001602007653001402023700005502037700003802092700002002130773009302150856008502243852000902328655001202337IND60690807220221207074740.0200508e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069080722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e012182doi7 aPMC64015242pmcid7 a308915092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaina, Fredah Wangui10aProducers' valuation of geographical indications-related attributes of agri-food products from semi-arid lands in Kenya  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aArid and semi-arid lands comprise 84% of Kenya's land, characterised by low and erratic rainfall, and increasing human and animal population. The study sought to determine producers' willingness to pay for protection of unique terroir-based agri-food products from semi-arid lands as geographical indications. The sample products comprised two commodities: mangoes from lower Eastern region of Kenya and goats from Baringo in the North Rift region. Using random parameters logit model specification, choice experiments were used to elicit the producers' willingness to pay for attributes related to design of geographical indications (GI) for agricultural products in Kenya. Mango producers attached greater value to having minimum guaranteed payments for their products and receiving price information before the start of the season. Goat producers attached higher value to where to sell the produce as well as use of collective marketing. The producers therefore view GIs as a means to reduce market failures. GIs can enhance collective participation of producers in the semi-arid regions in delimiting the production region responsible for the unique characteristics; hence increase value accruing to producers. The voluntary nature of GI requires effective coordination and governance through GI framework that can limit parallel protection groups of the same product in the same region.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agovernance 3ahumans 3alogit analysis 3amarkets 3aprices 3arain 3awillingness to pay 3aKenya 0aAgriculture 0aEconomics1 aMburu, John1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6762-99791 aAckello-Ogutu, C.q(Christopher),1 aEgelyng, Henrik0 tHeliyon.g2019 Feb., v. 5, no. 2 p.e01218-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e012183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01895naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007000139245008000209300001600289500002000305520072900325592002801054650002501082650001401107650001601121650001201137650001701149650001401166650001501180650001001195650001201205650001401217650002301231650001901254700001901273773013501292856007301427852000901500655001201509IND60681277820221120192845.0200115e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068127782DNAL7 a10.1111/ahe.124822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartín‐Alguacil, Nieves1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6676-550610aBody wall defects and amniotic band syndrome in pig (Sus scrofa domesticus)  ap. 144-149.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe amniotic band syndrome is a congenital condition.

The concentration of T-Hg and MeHg in the forest soil ranged from 0.07 to 16.7 mg kg⁻¹ and from <0.07 to 2.0 μg kg⁻¹, respectively, whereas it ranged from 0.40 to 24.9 mg kg⁻¹ and from <0.07 to 56.3 μg kg⁻¹, respectively, in the paddy field soil. In the vertical variation of the T-Hg of forest soil, the highest values were observed at the soil surface, and these values were found to decrease with increasing depth. A similar variation was observed for MeHg and total organic carbon content (TOC), and a linear relationship was observed between them. Mercury deposited on the soil surface can be trapped and retained by organic matter and subjected to methylation. The slope of the line obtained for the T-Hg vs. TOC plot became larger near the ASGM villages, implying a higher rate of mercury deposition in these areas. In contrast, the plots of MeHg vs. TOC fell along the same trend line regardless of the distance from the ASGM village. Organic carbon content may be a predominant factor in controlling MeHg formation in forest soils. The T-Hg concentration in the river water ranged from 0.40 to 9.6 μg L⁻¹. River water used for irrigation can prove to be a source of mercury for the paddy fields. The concentrations of Hg⁰ and Hg²⁺ in river water showed similar variations as that observed for the T-Hg concentration. The highest Hg⁰ concentration of 3.2 μg L⁻¹ can be attributed to the waste inflow from work sites. The presence of Hg⁰ in river water can become a source of mercury present in the atmosphere along the river. MeHg concentration in the river water was found to be 0.004–0.14% of T-Hg concentration, which was considerably lower than the concentrations of other Hg species. However, MeHg comprised approximately 0.2% of the T-Hg in paddy field soil. Mercury deposited from the atmosphere and the river water can be subjected to methylation. Paddy fields are very important ecosystems; therefore, the effect of MeHg on these ecosystems and human beings should be further investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aecosystems 3aforest soils 3agold 3ahumans 3airrigation 3amercury 3amethylation 3amethylmercury compounds 3amining 3aorganic matter 3apaddies 3apaddy soils 3ariver water 3arivers 3atraditional technology 3avillages 3awastes 3aIndonesia1 aKodamatani, Hitoshi1 aHamada, Yuriko Kono1 aMatsuyama, Akito1 aImura, Ryusuke1 aTaniguchi, Yoko1 aHidayati, Nuril1 aRahajoe, Joeni Setijo0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Jan., v. 24, no. 3 p.2643-2652dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7998-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245011100163300001800274520165100292592002801943650002901971650000902000650001502009650000902024650001102033650001402044650001102058650001402069651001002083653001802093653002602111653002302137653002002160653002002180700001702200700001802217700001902235700001802254700001502272773010902287856008502396852000902481655001202490IND60610505620221119161127.0201125e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061050562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2018.07.1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Lei10aContamination, potential mobility, and origins of lead in sediment cores from the Shima River, south China  ap. 1128-1136.  aIdentifying contamination sources of environmental media and revealing their changing trends over time is useful for regional contamination control and environmental improvements. Four sediment cores (S1−S4) were collected from the Shima River to determine lead (Pb) concentrations, geochemical fractions and isotopic compositions, as well as the geochronology of core S3. The results show that Pb concentrations decreased from the upper and middle reach sites (means: 57.6, 95.9, and 97.6 mg kg⁻¹, respectively) to the lower reach site (43.8 mg kg⁻¹), resulting in a minimal to moderate enrichment in the sediments; enrichment increased due to anthropogenic Pb inputs at the river middle reach site since the 1990s. Sediment Pb in the geochemical fractions followed a decreasing order of reducible (47.3%) > residual (37.8%) > oxidizable (11.2%) > acid-soluble fraction (3.68%), exhibiting high mobility, further verifying the anthropogenic inputs. A descending trend in the ²⁰⁶Pb/²⁰⁷Pb ratio of the top sediments was the result of anthropogenic activities. In the present study, coal combustion, which was the major anthropogenic Pb source determined by its isotopic composition, contributed significantly (means: 18.4–60.6%) to sediment Pb based on a three end-members model. Less of a contribution (0–10.6%) was derived from vehicle exhaust. The increasing trend in the coal contribution was in accordance with that of the coal consumption in the study area. These results suggest that Pb contamination resulting from coal combustion has grown to become a major environmental issue in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3acoal 3acombustion 3alead 3amodels 3apollution 3arivers 3asediments 3aChina 0aPb enrichment 0aGeochemical fractions 0aStable Pb isotopes 0aCoal combustion 0aVehicle exhaust1 aLi, Shaoheng1 aWang, Zhuowei1 aLiang, Zuobing1 aChen, Jianyao1 aLiang, Bin0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 Nov., v. 242 p.1128-1136dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2018.07.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03986naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245013300197300001800330500002000348520197000368592002802338650004402366650002202410650001802432650001202450650000902462650001202471650001102483650001102494650001602505650001802521650002202539650002002561650002502581650000902606650001102615650001402626650001402640650001302654650001302667650002302680650002102703650001202724650001502736650001402751650002002765650001102785650002502796650001102821650000902832700003202841700002102873700001902894700002002913700001602933700001202949700002002961700001502981700001602996700001503012700001803027773014903045856007303194852000903267655001203276IND60676462920221122032342.0191118e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067646292DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.99772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Asif Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9719-934010aModulation of agronomic and nutritional response of Pleurotus eryngii strains by utilizing glycine betaine enriched cotton waste  ap. 6911-6921.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the possibility of cotton waste enrichment with glycine betaine (GB) for production of two strains (P9, P10) of king oyster (Pleurotus eryngii). Cotton waste was used as (100%) control (T0 = cotton waste) and augmented with various combinations of GB, (T1 = 2 mmol L⁻¹, T2 = 4 mmol L⁻¹, T3 = 6 mmol L⁻¹, T4 = 8 mmol L⁻¹ and T5 = 10 mmol L⁻¹). The response of king oyster to GB was evaluated by earliness, yield, biological efficiency (BE), minerals (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), sodium (Na), calcium (Ca)), total sugars, total soluble solids, reducing sugars, non‐reducing sugars, ascorbic acid, proximate (crude protein, carbohydrates, crude fibers, ash, fats) content of fruiting body and Fourier‐transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis compared with the control substrate (cotton waste). RESULTS: The earliness, yield, and BE were higher as compared to control substrate and increased with an augmentation in the concentration of GB within the cotton waste. Two strains showed (on dry weight basis) 33.9–54.9 mg g⁻¹ nitrogen, 6.8–12.5 mg g⁻¹ phosphorus, 16.9–25.1 mg g⁻¹ potassium, 40.5–64.2 mg kg⁻¹ Zn, 17.1–37.3 mg kg⁻¹ Cu, 1174–1325 mg kg⁻¹ Mg, 20.1–29.1 mg kg⁻¹ Mn, 129–265 mg kg⁻¹ Fe, 779–835 mg kg⁻¹ Ca), 6.3%–11.3% total sugars, 7.3–14.9 °Brix total soluble solids, 2.1–7.3% reducing sugars, 10.4–18.1% crude protein, 3.6–4.4% crude fiber and 5.6–16.7 mg (100 g)‐¹ on various concentration of GB enrich cotton waste.

The effects of initial solution pH (1.0–10.0), temperature (30–50°C), contact time (0–660min) and initial concentration (50–1600mg/L) were studied. The results indicated that the adsorption capacity increased with the increasing of initial solution pH and temperature. The adsorption kinetic and adsorption equilibrium data fitted closely to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model respectively, confirming monolayer adsorption. The maximum adsorption capacity of PMCMs for MB at initial solution 9.0 were 1000, 1250 and 1428mg/g at 30, 40 and 50°C, respectively. Furthermore, the magnetic microspheres could be easily separated using a magnet and effectively regenerated after finishing the treatment process. Therefore, PMCMs are promising candidates for the removal of dye from wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3amagnetism 3afree radicals 3achitosan 3apolymerization 3amagnetic materials 3amethylene blue 3amicroparticles 3amodels 3aadsorbents 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3asulfonic acids 3akinetics 3atemperature 3awastewater 3aadsorption 0aMagnetic 0aDye 0aFree radical polymerization 0asulfonic acid 0aChitosan 0aAdsorption1 aZheng, Huaili1 aWang, Yongjuan1 aAn, Yanyan1 aLuo, Kun1 aZhao, Chun1 aXiang, Wenying0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 June, v. 112 p.648-655dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.02.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005800149245007800207520135000285592002801635650000801663650002001671650002901691650001101720650001801731650002901749650001101778650001601789651001801805653002001823653002501843653002201868653001301890653001801903700002001921700002101941700002401962700005701986773009402043856008402137852000902221655001202230IND60734027420221119035332.0211213e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073402742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1122902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarran, Lucile1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4206-070112aA data-driven study of thermostat overrides during demand response events  aIn the context of increasing renewable energy penetration in energy systems, demand response is acknowledged as a solution to guarantee grid stability and security of supply.

The present study, based on data from 6,389 connected thermostats in North America in the summer of 2019, investigates users' thermostat overriding behavior during demand response events targeting their air conditioners. An average event in this dataset was triggered around 3 p.m. and lasted three hours. The overall override rate was 12.9%. Overrides critically affected power usage during an event, with the share of the expected power demand reduction missed due to overrides being of the same order of magnitude as the override rate. In a decision tree analysis, the override rate showed to be particularly affected by occupants' habitual setpoint change frequency, outdoor temperature, event duration, and occupants’ previous experience with demand response. Even though the dataset is not representative of all types of demand response events, this study highlights the potential lying in connected thermostat data for utilities to design tailored demand response events with an increased success rate and a smaller impact on occupant comfort.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3adata collection 3adecision support systems 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3arenewable energy sources 3asummer 3atemperature 3aNorth America 0aDemand response 0aConnected thermostat 0aOccupant behavior 0aOverride 0aDecision tree1 aGunay, H.

However, when data arise from imperfect surveillance systems, the interpretation of results is confusing since explanatory variables can be related either to the occurrence of the disease or to the efficiency of the surveillance system. As an alternative, we present spatial and non-spatial zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regressions for modelling the number of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreaks that were reported at subdistrict level in Thailand during the second epidemic wave (July 3rd 2004 to May 5th 2005). The spatial ZIP model fitted the data more effectively than its non-spatial version. This model clarified the role of the different variables: for example, results suggested that human population density was not associated with the disease occurrence but was rather associated with the number of reported outbreaks given disease occurrence. In addition, these models allowed estimating that 902 (95% CI 881–922) subdistricts suffered at least one HPAI H5N1 outbreak in Thailand although only 779 were reported to veterinary authorities, leading to a general surveillance sensitivity of 86.4% (95% CI 84.5–88.4). Finally, the outputs of the spatial ZIP model revealed the spatial distribution of the probability that a subdistrict could have been a false negative. The methodology presented here can easily be adapted to other animal health contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal health 3aavian influenza 3adisease occurrence 3ahuman population 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apopulation density 3aprobability distribution 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3aThailand 0aZero-inflation 0aSurveillance 0aUnder-detection 0aCapture–recapture 0aRisk factors 0aEvaluation 0aAvian influenza H5N1 0aBias 0aCount 0aSpatial 0aConditional autoregressive model1 aPaul, Mathilde C.1 aChaengprachak, Wanida1 aDurand, Benoit1 aGilbert, Marius1 aDufour, Barbara1 aRoger, François,1 aKasemsuwan, Suwicha1 aGrosbois, Vladimir0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2014 Apr. 01, v. 114, no. 1 p.28-36dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2014.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02267naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245007200130300001400202520129400216592002801510650002401538650001801562650001701580650001101597650002401608650001501632650001301647650001601660650001501676653002201691653001601713700001701729700001901746773014301765852000901908655001201917IND60709747320221118070816.0200908e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070974732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhirwar, K.C.10aPopulation dynamics of major Insect Pests and seed yield of Soybean  ap. 56-59.  aThe peak larval population of green semilooper (Chrysodexis acuta) was recorded 9.97 larvae/mrl and 100% foliage damage due to foliage feeders at 34ᵗʰ SW when maximum and minimum temperature was 32°C and 28.2°C, respectively.

First, we built a reduced representation library of snub-nosed monkeys through digesting the DNA of four individuals using HaeIII and pooling the 350â500Â bp fragments together. Second, we sequenced the DNA pool using pyrosequencing technology. Third, we analyzed sequencing reads using bioinformatic software. We detected 23 putative SNPs, 10 polymorphic STR loci, and 347 candidate STR loci (number of repeats greater than 9). The markers generated by this study can be used to address questions regarding genetic diversity, population structure, phylogeography, and conservation of this endangered primate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acomputer software 3aendangered species 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3aloci 3amonkeys 3aphylogeography 3apopulation structure 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aShattuck, Milena R.1 aThimmapuram, Jyothi1 aVullaganti, Deepika1 aMalhi, Ripan0 tConservation genetics resources.g2012 June, v. 4, no. 2 p.451-453dSpringer-Verlagx1877-72527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12686-011-9572-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245013300168300001400301506011700315506007600432520099500508592002801503506003701531653002401568653001801592653001101610653001101621653001401632700002301646700002301669773011401692856008301806852000901889655001201898IND60722866320221207075130.0220706s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072286632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mset.2020.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, Biswanath10aThermal pre-treatment – A prerequisite for the reduction of hydrolysis stage during anaerobic digestion of Ageratum conyzoides  ap. 34-45.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe present study mainly focussed on the effect of different thermal pretreatments on Ageratum conyzoides. Thermal pretreatment reduced the hydrolysis period and, at the same time, increased biogas production as compared to the untreated Ageratum conyzoides. The effects of four different thermal pretreatment techniques, i.e., hot air oven, microwave, autoclave, and hot water bath on the anaerobic digestion of Ageratum conyzoides were studied. Autoclave pretreatment was found to be more efficient, followed by a hot water bath, hot air oven, and microwave pretreatments. Autoclave pretreatment enhanced the solubilization. Simultaneously, increment in volatile fatty acids and soluble chemical oxygen demand was observed as 55.33% and 54.59% for autoclave at 90° C for 90 min, respectively, compared to the control/untreated. After autoclave pretreatment, cumulative methane production rose to 4053 mL CH4/g VS in 35 days from 3011 mL CH4/g VS in 50 days for the untreated sample.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 0aAgeratum conyzoides 0aPre-treatment 0aBiogas 0aLignin 0aAutoclave1 aKhwairakpam, Meena1 aKalamdhad, Ajay S.0 tMaterials science for energy technologies.g2021, v. 4 p.34-45dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27475x2589-29917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mset.2020.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245014400169300001600313520120600329592002801535650002101563650001601584650002401600650001401624650001901638650002701657650001101684650002601695650003101721650002001752650001101772650001801783650001001801653002501811653002401836653001901860653002401879653001801903700002101921700002301942700002701965700002201992773014102014856008402155852000902239655001202248IND60557627320221119172326.0190415e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055762732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jssas.2016.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEljak, Samah A.10aEffect of fertilizers application and growing environment on physicochemical properties and bread making quality of Sudanese wheat cultivar  ap. 376-384.  aThe primary aim of this study was to evaluate the physicochemical and bread making quality of Sudanese wheat cultivar, known as Imam, grown under different growing conditions (location and fertilization). The results showed significant differences (P⩽0.01) in all quality tests among the growing environments, fertilization, and fertilization vs. environments. Different ranges were observed for 1000-Kernel weight (KW, 30.50–34.47g), hectoliter weight (HW, 803.8–825.7g/hl), moisture content (MC, 12.34–12.94%), ash content (AC, 0.47–0.63%), protein content (PC, 10.76–14.08%), falling number (FN, 383.3–597.0%), wet gluten (WG, 25.77–35.08%), dry gluten (DG, 8.71–12.18%), gluten index (GI, 63.22–87.13), and loaf specific volume (LSV, 3.69–4.04ml/g). Simple correlation analysis indicated different associations (positive, negative, weak) between all traits and throughout the three growing environments and fertilizations.

Compared to traditional methods for the synthesis of highly ordered mesoporous metal oxides using PS-PEO as a single template, synergistic templates can form new hierarchical structures. The peanut-like tungsten oxide sphere with an open mouth on its surface has two monodisperse microspheres; the diameter range in the long dimension of the mesoporous tungsten oxides is approximately 1.0–2.0 μm. The peanut-like mesoporous tungsten oxide shows good gas-sensing properties toward isoprene with a low concentration (10–50 ppm) at an operating temperature of 205 °C, with the relative humidity of the testing environment at approximately 80%, and at sensing response/recovery times of approximately 12 s and 71 s, respectively. The outstanding selectivity to isoprene is ten and three times greater than that of ethanol and acetone, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFC1602500cthe National Key R&D Program of China 3aacetone 3acomposite polymers 3aethanol 3aisoprene 3amicroparticles 3aporous media 3arelative humidity 3atemperature 3atungsten oxide1 aGe, Kangjie1 aQi, Shuyan1 aChen, Yan1 aQiu, Jingxuan1 aWang, Shuying1 aTian, Yachen1 aFang, Shuiqin1 aLiu, Cheng1 aLiu, Qing0 tJournal of materials science.g2020 June, v. 55, no. 18 p.7645-7651dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-04564-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03782naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014400163300001600307520186700323592002802190650002102218650002802239650002602267650001402293650001402307650001502321650001702336650001802353650001502371650001902386650003502405650002102440650001702461650001702478650003202495650000902527650001902536650002502555650002002580650002402600650001302624650002502637650003702662651001002699653001402709653001402723653002202737653000802759653000902767700002002776700001702796700001802813700001502831700001902846700001802865700001802883700001302901773011502914856008203029852000903111655001203120IND60630731520221120142920.0190325e20190510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063073152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2019.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jiazhe10aTotal flavonoid aglycones extract in Radix Scutellariae induces cross-regulation between autophagy and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells  ap. 133-140.  aRadix Scutellariae (RS), the dried root of Scutellariae baicalensis Georgi, known as a herbal medicine in several Asian countries including China, has been widely used to treat inflammation, hypertension, cardiovascular disease as well as cancer. The total flavonoid aglycone extracted (TFAE) was extracted by ethyl acetate and this extraction methodology was optimized and obtained the protection of Chinese patents.To investigate the underlying mechanism of the chemotherapeutic effects of TFAE in inducing autophagy and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.We performed CCK8 assays, AnnexinV-FITC/PI staining, flow cytometry assays, transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence analysis and Western blot to study the molecular mechanism of TFAE in inducing autophagy and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.In vitro, TFAE exhibits significant anti-tumor activity against pancreatic cancer cell lines, especially for BxPC3 (IC50 = 6.5 μg mL−1). Moreover, TFAE induces apoptosis and autophagy as evidenced by the increased apoptosis or autophagy-related protein level, the increased the fraction of apoptotic cells and the punctuate patterns of LC3 II. Furthermore, TFAE induce autophagy through PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibition. Interestingly, pharmacological block autophagy by 3-MA enhanced TFAE-induced apoptosis, indicating that TFAE induced autophagy functions as a cytoprotective process against apoptosis. In vivo, 150 mg/kg TFAE inhibited the BxPC3 tumor growth in immune deficient mice with the inhibitory rate of 66.87% and induced both apoptosis and autophagy.TFAE have anti-tumor activity against pancreatic cancer and can induce apoptosis and autophagy through PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal pathway. TFAE might be a potential anticancer drug to be further developed for human pancreatic cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3acell lines 3adrug therapy 3aethyl acetate 3aflavonoids 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aherbal medicines 3ahypertension 3ainflammation 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3apancreatic neoplasms 3aprotein content 3asignal transduction 3astaining 3atraditional medicine 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aChina 0aAutophagy 0aApoptosis 0aPancreatic cancer 0aAkt 0amTOR1 aWang, Hongcheng1 aWang, Jianfa1 aChang, Qimeng1 aHu, Zhiqiu1 aShen, Xiaodong1 aFeng, Jinfeng1 aZhang, Ziping1 aWu, Xubo0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2019 May 10, v. 235 p.133-140dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01438naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245010700135300001400242520060200256592002800858650002700886650002000913650001700933650001300950650000900963650001700972700001900989773014301008852000901151655001201160IND60709747720221118070818.0200908e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070974772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadwal, Kanchan G.10aEfficacy of plant products and combinations with cypermethrin in management of Earias vittella of Okra  ap. 73-75.  aAmong all treatments, combination of cypermethrin 25 EC at 0.025% + neem oil (0.5%) was most effective by recording lowest shoot and fruit damage (3.3 & 4.4%), respectively with higher CBR (1:3.05) and yield 94.95 q/ha, followed by cypermethrin 25 EC at 0.05% (4.1 & 6.8%), combination of cypermethrin 25 EC at 0.025% + NSKE 2.5%, (4.8 & 7.6%), combination of cypermethrin 25 EC at 0.025% + karanj oil 0.5% (5.9 & 9.6%), neem oil 1% (8.0 & 11.3%), NSKE 5% (9.3 & 11.9%), and karanj oil @ 1% was recorded less effective among all treatments with (11.2 & 16.5%) shoot and fruit damage, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbelmoschus esculentus 3aEarias vittella 3acypermethrin 3aneem oil 3aokra 3aplant damage1 aAshwani Kumar,0 tAnnals of plant protection sciences.g2014 Mar., v. 22, no. 1 p.73-75dSociety of Plant Protection ScienceswJournal:2082x0974-01637nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245017000166300001600336520165100352592002802003650001802031650001402049650001802063650001402081650003002095650003302125650001502158650001602173650001402189650002002203650001802223650003302241650001102274650002202285651001002307651001602317653002702333653002902360653002902389653001502418653001602433653001402449700002102463700005702484773009902541856008202640852000902722655001202731IND60623466520221120225214.0190415e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062346652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hal.2018.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, Se Hyeon10aGambierdiscus jejuensis sp. nov., an epiphytic dinoflagellate from the waters of Jeju Island, Korea, effect of temperature on the growth, and its global distribution  ap. 149-157.  aThe genus Gambierdiscus produces ciguatera toxins, which has led to extensive studies of this genus. Epiphytic dinoflagellate cells were isolated from coralline macroalgae collected from the coastal waters of Jeju Island, Korea, and two clonal cultures were established. The morphology of these cells was examined using light and scanning electron microscopy, and the sequences of the small subunit (SSU), large subunit (LSU), and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA were determined. The phylogenetic trees based on SSU, LSU (D1-D3), and LSU (D8-D10) rDNA showed the two Korean isolates forming a clade with unidentified strains named Gambierdiscus sp. type 2. This clade showed a clear divergence from the two closest clades containing of the G. caribaeus and G. carpenteri strains. Morphologically, the Korean isolates had an anteroposteriorly compressed cell shape having a smooth theca ornamentation. Growth of the Korean isolates ceased when water temperatures were <20 °C or >30 °C with an optimum at 26 °C. This temperature preference may account for why Gambierdiscus sp. type 2 has only been isolated from the temperate waters of Korea and Japan. However, the two most closely related species G. caribaeus and G. carpenteri have broader temperature ranges tolerating as high as 34–36 °C and are globally distributed. Based on these results, the Korean isolates are proposed as a new species in the genus Gambierdiscus and named Gambierdiscus jejuensis sp. nov. Furthermore, it is suggested that the unidentified strains belonging to the Gambierdiscus sp. type 2 be transferred to the new species, G. jejuensis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGambierdiscus 3aciguatera 3acoastal water 3aepiphytes 3ageographical distribution 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amacroalgae 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3apoisonous algae 3aribosomal DNA 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atoxins 3awater temperature 3aJapan 3aSouth Korea 0aBenthic dinoflagellate 0aCiguatera fish poisoning 0aEpiphytic dinoflagellate 0aMorphology 0aNew species 0aPhylogeny1 aChŏng, Hye-jin,1 aYoo, Yeong Du1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0682-21120 tHarmful algae.g2018 Dec., v. 80 p.149-157dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3946763x1568-98837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2018.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245009700174520130200271592002801573650001401601650002001615650001401635650001601649650001701665650001501682650001101697650002201708650001401730650001101744650001501755650001301770650002401783650001501807653000801822653000801830653000801838653000901846653000801855653001401863653001601877653000801893653000801901653000701909653000801916653000801924653000801932653001901940653001501959653003901974653002402013700003602037700002302073700002202096700005902118700001802177700002302195773011902218856008802337852000902425655001202434IND60678997720221118063258.0220321e20200320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067899772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1362062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBharathiraja, B.10aBiochemical conversion of biodiesel by-product into malic acid: A way towards sustainability  aCrude glycerol, one of the ever-growing by-product of biodiesel industry and is receiving the closest review in recent times because direct disposal of crude glycerol may emerge ecological issues.

The composition and spatiotemporal distribution of Microcystis chemotypes within and among waterbodies was studied at different time scales by analyzing (i) Microcystis strains isolated between 1998 and 2007 from different Spanish reservoirs and (ii) individual Microcystis aeruginosa colonies collected from pelagic and littoral habitats in Valmayor reservoir (Spain) during a bloom. No agreement between chemotypes and both morphotypes and genotypes (based on cpcBA-IGS, 16S–23S rRNA ITS and mcyB genes) was found, suggesting that oligopeptide profiles in individual strains evolve independently across morphospecies and phylogenetic genotypes, and that the diversity of microcystin variants produced cannot be explained by mcyB gene variations alone. The presence of identical chemotypes in spatially-distant reservoirs with dissimilar trophic state, lithology or depth indicate that waterbody characteristics and geographical boundaries weakly affect chemotype composition and distribution. At smaller spatiotemporal scales (i.e. during bloom), M. aeruginosa populations showed high number of chemotypes, as well as marked differences in chemotype composition and relative abundance among the littoral and pelagic habitats. This indicates that the factors influencing chemotype composition, relative abundance and dynamics operate at short spatial and temporal scales, and supports emerging hypotheses about interactions with antagonistic microorganisms as possible drivers for widespread chemical polymorphisms in cyanobacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3achemotypes 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alittoral zone 3amicrocystins 3amicroorganisms 3amorphospecies 3amorphs 3aphylogeny 3apoisonous algae 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3asecondary metabolites 3asurface water 3asurveys 3aSpain 0aCyanobacteria 0aMicrocystis 0aChemotypes 0a16S-23S rRNA ITS 0acpcBA-IGS 0amcyB1 aAgha, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6109-46241 aCirés, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8272-55121 aQuesada, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8913-59930 tHarmful algae.g2019 Jan., v. 81 p.77-85dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3946763x1568-98837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2018.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245013300170520177300303592002802076650001302104650001302117650001902130650001602149650003002165650001902195650001802214650001802232650001402250650001102264650001802275650001702293650001602310651001502326653001802341653001302359653002202372653002002394700002002414700002002434700001902454700002702473700003202500700001702532700002802549700002402577773011902601856008802720852000902808655001202817IND60678997820221118063416.0211114e20200325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067899782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1362132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Abidur10aProcesses controlling the extent of groundwater pollution with chromium from tanneries in the Hazaribagh area, Dhaka, Bangladesh  aThe Hazaribagh industrial area in Dhaka city, the capital of Bangladesh, is considered one of the hotspots of chromium (Cr) pollution, due to excessive discharge of Cr contaminated waste over decades by approximately 150 tanneries. In 2000, elevated Cr concentrations were observed in the underlying Dupi Tila Aquifer (DTA), which is heavily deployed for drinking water supply of Dhaka city's population. In the following years, Cr concentrations in the DTA have dropped and apparently stayed low. In 2010, elevated Cr concentrations were found again in the DTA. This study aims to evaluate the status of the total Cr contamination in the surface waters, groundwater, and soils in the area, to clarify the temporal evolution of the total Cr contamination pattern in the DTA. For this, we collected water and soil samples in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2019 for (hydro)chemical characterization and analyzed new groundwater level data on the development of the cone of depression below the city.Our study indicates that the temporal evolution of the total Cr contamination in the DTA is closely coupled to the groundwater dynamics. The rapid growth of the cone of depression due to excessive pumping resulted (i) in a disconnection of the groundwater table from the heavily contaminated Hazaribagh soils, and (ii) in an increased gradient between the contaminated surface waters and the groundwater, increasing infiltration into the groundwater. Finally, (iii) the further growth of the cone of depression resulted in an inflow of fresh groundwater from the west of Dhaka city, causing a dilution effect. Although in 2017 tanneries were moved out of the Hazaribagh area, the contaminated soils still pose a threat to groundwater quality when groundwater levels would recover.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3achromium 3adrinking water 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3apolluted soils 3asoil sampling 3asurface water 3atanneries 3awastes 3awater quality 3awater supply 3awater table 3aBangladesh 0aTannery waste 0aChromium 0aDupi Tila Aquifer 0aBuriganga river1 aMichelsen, Nils1 aMarandi, Andres1 aHossain, Rabby1 aHossain, Mohammed Abed1 aRoehl, K.

MPs have been extensively observed in the aquatic environment, yet rarely investigated in the terrestrial ecosystem, especially in relation to health risks. To evaluate potential MPs pollution in land-dwelling animal medicine materials, we collected 20 types of small animal-based medicinal materials and 10 types of available fresh terrestrial animals from eight different regions in China. MPs were found in all medicinal materials with an average incidence rate of 94.67%. The abundance of MPs was in the range of 1.80 ± 0.38 to 7.80 ± 0.83 items/individual or 1.59 ± 0.33 to 43.56 ± 9.22 items/g (dry weight), with polymer distribution by polyethylene terephthalate (40.45%), rayon (30.64%), polyethylene (10.11%), nylon (7.35%), polypropylene (5.93%), and polyvinyl chloride (5.52%). The majority of MPs were microfibers (84.68%), with 15.32% of fragments. Moreover, MPs were directly observed in the intestine, detected in all ten types of fresh medicinal animals with the abundance of 0.83 ± 0.35 to 3.42 ± 0.46 items/individual. Furthermore, significant positive correlations (R: 0.32–0.99, p < 0.05) of MPs characteristics were found between medicinal materials and fresh animals, including shape, size, color, and polymer distribution of MPs. The results support that MPs in the medicinal materials were likely derived from living animals. This study demonstrates the prevalence of MPs in animal-based, traditional medicinal materials, and also suggests widespread MPs pollution in terrestrial environments and latent health risks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aaquatic environment 3acolor 3aintestines 3amedicine 3amicroplastics 3anylon 3apollution 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3apolyethylene 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3apolypropylenes 3arayon 3arisk 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3aChina 0aMicroplastics 0aMedicinal animals 0aTraditional medicinal materials 0aTerrestrial environments 0aInsects1 aQiu, Rong1 aHu, Jiani1 aLi, Xinyu1 aChen, Yingxin1 aZhang, Xiaoting1 aCao, Chengjin1 aShi, Huahong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2978-06801 aXie, Bing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2335-59661 aWu, Weimin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5244-06551 aHe, Defu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0850-08810 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Mar. 20, v. 709 p.136214-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1362143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245014300174300001800317520143900335592002801774650002001802650002801822650001601850650001001866650001701876650001201893650001501905650004301920650001401963650001101977650002101988650002202009650002402031650001002055650001602065653002002081653002502101653001102126653001002137700006102147700002502208700002102233700002102254700002702275700002802302773011702330856008502447852000902532655001202541IND60601737520221118233008.0190624e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060173752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2018.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharlie-Silva, Ives10aLack of impact of dietary inclusion of dried Artemisia annua leaves for cattle on infestation by Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus ticks  ap. 1115-1119.  aThe present study evaluated whether a natural dietary additive, dried Artemisia annua leaves, may be useful to control Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus on naturally infested cattle. Twenty heifers of the Canchim breed, weighing around 250 kg, were divided into two equally sized experimental groups: 1) control animals and 2) animals receiving 200 g/day of dried A. annua leaves for two months. Before treatment began, the animals were homogeneously distributed in control and treatment groups based on their pre-treatment weight and tick infestation level. Counts of engorged female ticks then occurred weekly during the two-month experimental period. We also monitored cattle weight gain and packed cell volume (PCV). Artemisinin (0.96%) was quantified in the plant material by high-performance liquid chromatography with refractive index detector (HPLC-IR). No statistical differences between the control and treatment groups were observed for engorged female counts (log averages of 1.3 ticks and 1.4 ticks per animal, respectively), daily cattle weight gain (0.910 kg and 0.888 kg, respectively) or PCV (33.5% and 33.0%, respectively). We conclude that the oral supplementation of cattle feed with dried A. annuna leaves did not control natural infestation of R. (B.) microplus. The hypothesis of artemisinin’s action on cattle ticks by ingestion through the animals’ blood was not confirmed at the evaluated dose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia annua 3aRhipicephalus microplus 3aartemisinin 3ablood 3acattle feeds 3aheifers 3ahematocrit 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aingestion 3aleaves 3arefractive index 3atick infestations 3atick-borne diseases 3aticks 3aweight gain 0aArtemisia annua 0aOral supplementation 0aCattle 0aTicks1 aGiglioti, Rodrigo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1700-05471 aMagalhães, Pedro M.1 aSousa, Ilza M.O.1 aFoglio, Mary Ann1 aOliveira, Márcia C.S.1 aChagas, Ana Carolina S.0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2018 July, v. 9, no. 5 p.1115-1119dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2018.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245017200173300001400345520151800359592002801877650001501905650001401920650002201934650002201956650004101978650001102019650001602030650002002046650002002066650001302086650001102099650002802110650003102138653003102169653001502200653003302215653001102248653001202259653003002271653001202301700001402313700002402327700002102351700001902372773010902391856008602500852000902586655001202595IND60623467120221119081547.0190206e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062346712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2018.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShigeyama, Hiroyo10aIdentification of volatile metabolites in human saliva from patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma via zeolite-based thin-film microextraction coupled with GC–MS  ap. 49-58.  aIn recent years, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) discharged from the human body, of which some compounds exhibit strong correlations with pathological conditions, have attracted attention as a new means of disease diagnosis technology. The aim of this study was to establish the salivary metabolomic profiles of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients and healthy volunteers (control group) and to investigate VOCs as potential biomarkers in the diagnosis of oral cancer. We have demonstrated a method combining thin-film microextraction based on a ZSM-5/polydimethylsiloxane hybrid film coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and carried out a comparative analysis of salivary VOC profiles between OSCC patients and healthy controls. The results depicted that 42 and 73 VOCs were detected and identified in samples from the healthy control group (n = 50) and oral cancer group (n = 24), respectively. Among them, twenty-seven VOCs (ten were decreased, seven disappeared, and ten were newly produced in the oral cancer group) depict significant differences between both the sample groups, and they have relevance as candidate biomarkers for OSCC. Twelve salivary VOCs that were characteristic of oral cancer patients were finally extracted and used for pattern recognition analyses for oral cancer diagnosis. The proposed TFME approach for analyzing human saliva on the basis of a ZSM-5-loaded PDMS hybrid thin film has been performed for the very first time in the field of dentistry.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3adentistry 3adisease diagnosis 3afilms (materials) 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3amicroextraction 3amouth neoplasms 3apatients 3asaliva 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3avolatile organic compounds 0aVolatile organic compounds 0aBiomarkers 0aOral squamous cell carcinoma 0aSaliva 0aGC–MS 0aThin-film microextraction 0aZeolite1 aWang, Tao1 aIchinose, Masatoshi1 aAnsai, Toshihiro1 aLee, Seung-Woo0 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 1104 p.49-58dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2018.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04035naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014100169300001500310520207900325592002802404650003402432650001402466650002102480650001302501650001502514650002602529650001502555650000902570650004302579650002202622650001602644650001702660650001102677650002602688650002102714650001802735650001202753650001502765650000902780650002502789650001302814650001202827650001702839650002902856650001502885653001902900653002602919653002202945653002802967653002702995700001803022700001503040700001803055700001603073700001503089700001503104700001803119700001903137773011003156856008603266852000903352655001203361IND60623467520221119081559.0190202e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062346752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2018.11.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yuanyuan10aNon-target metabonomic method provided new insights on the therapeutical mechanism of Gancao Fuzi decoction on rheumatoid arthritis rats  ap. 93-103.  aGancao Fuzi decoction (GFD) is a classic Chinese medicine formula for the treatment of rheumatic and rheumatoid arthritis. The main active components of GFD are alkaloids, flavonoids and saponins. This study aimed to clarify the pharmacodynamic effects of the active components in GFD and investigate the mechanism of them treating rheumatoid arthritis rats by the method of metabonomics. Seven groups were studied, named as the normal group (NG), the model group (MG), the Gancao Fuzi decoction treatment group (GFDe), the alkaloids group (ALK), the compatibility of alkaloids with flavonoids group (AF), the compatibility of alkaloids with saponins group (AS) and the compatibility of alkaloids with flavonoids and saponins group (AFS), respectively. Firstly, the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of these groups were studied. Besides, urinary metabonomics based on ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was employed for delineation of metabolic alterations in the rats. Based on our results, it is concluded that AFS showed better anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities in GFD. Urinary metabonomic study and multivariate statistical analyses were used to investigate the mechanism of different groups. 26 potential biomarkers have been identified. By the analysis of heat map combined with score plot, the AFS group was the closest group to the NG group after treatment in GFD. The changes of urinary endogenous metabolites showed that AFS exhibited better effect on regulating the taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, TCA cycle, tryptophan metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, vitamin B6 metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism and purine metabolism pathways. The pharmacodynamics results showed that three components of flavonoids, saponins and alkaloids in GFD played an overall efficacy. Metabonomics studies showed that the compatibility of three components in GFD achieved the therapeutic effect by regulating the perturbations of multiple metabolic pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aalkaloids 3aanalgesic effect 3aarginine 3abiomarkers 3afatty acid metabolism 3aflavonoids 3aheat 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3apharmacodynamics 3aphenylalanine 3aproline 3apyridoxine 3arats 3arheumatoid arthritis 3asaponins 3ataurine 3atherapeutics 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3atryptophan 0aUHPLC-Q-TOF-MS 0aGancao Fuzi decoction 0aActive components 0aPharmacodynamic effects 0aRat urine metabonomics1 aWei, Mengying1 aYue, Kexin1 aWang, Rongjin1 aMa, Yinghui1 aMen, Lihui1 aPi, Zifeng1 aLiu, Zhiqiang1 aLiu, Zhongying0 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 1105 p.93-103dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2018.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245017900190300001800369520145200387592002801839650003001867650002001897650001501917650001001932650001401942650001101956650001101967650001001978650001001988650000901998650002202007650001802029650002802047650001702075650002002092650002802112650001202140650001402152650007702166650004902243650003302292650007502325700002102400700002102421700002202442700002202464700002502486700001902511700002102530773009902551856004802650852000902698655001202707IND50068152320221122035352.0130727e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006815232DNAL7 a237332322pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-013-3462-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeneziano, Vincenzo14aThe efficacy and safety of alphacypermethrin as a pour-on treatment for water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) infested with Haematopinus tuberculatus (Phthiraptera: Haematopinidae)  ap. 2907-2912.  aThe sucking louse Haematopinus tuberculatus (Burmeister 1839) is an ectoparasite of buffaloes, cattle, camels, and American bison. Alphacypermethrin (ACYP) is a pyrethroid insecticide commonly used to control arthropods of veterinary and public health interest. Therapeutics, such as antiparasitic compounds, is often administered to buffaloes based on dosage and intervals recommended for cattle because very few drugs have buffalo-specific label indications. A trial was conducted on 20 louse-infested buffaloes at a farm to assess the efficacy and safety of ACYP pour-on, at the manufacturer's recommended dose for cattle, on buffaloes naturally infested by H. tuberculatus. Ten animals were assigned to ACYP-treated group (ACYP-group) and ten to untreated control group (C-group). On day 0, all ACYP-group buffaloes received alphacypermethrin pour-on. Louse counts were performed on days -1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, and 56 at eight predilection sites on the skin of each buffalo. ACYP was completely effective (100 %) at day 7, highly effective (99.8 %) at day 14, and completely effective (100 %) from day 21 until the end of the study (day 56 post-treatment). During the trial, ACYP was well tolerated by all animals as there were no observed clinically adverse reactions. The results of this trial suggest that ACYP is an effective, safe, and user-friendly compound suitable for treatment of buffaloes with natural louse infestations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaematopinus tuberculatus 3aadverse effects 3aarthropods 3abison 3abuffaloes 3acamels 3acattle 3adrugs 3afarms 3alice 3alice infestations 3apublic health 3apyrethroid insecticides 3atherapeutics 3awater treatment 2aAdministration, Topical 2aAnimals 2aBuffaloes 2aInsecticidesxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aLice Infestationsxdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aPhthirapteraxclassification 2aPyrethrinsxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxtherapeutic use.1 aNeglia, Gianluca1 aCimmino, Roberta1 aBalestrieri, Anna1 aRufrano, Domenico1 aBastianetto, Eduardo1 aSantoro, Mario1 aGokbulut, Cengiz0 tParasitology research.g2013 Aug., v. 112, no. 8 p.2907-2912dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-013-3462-8  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245015100168300001400319520159400333592002801927650001701955650001301972650002101985650003202006650001502038650002602053650001502079650001402094650002102108650001402129650000902143650001802152650002902170650001402199653001902213653001502232653002102247653001302268700001402281700001402295700001602309700001602325700001302341700001502354773010902369856008602478852000902564655001202573IND60623467820221119081724.0190206e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062346782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2018.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xueyan10aSimultaneous determination of bioactive flavonoids of Hoveniae Semen in rat plasma by LC-MS/MS: Application to a comparative pharmacokinetic study  ap. 73-80.  aA selective, sensitive and fully validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was established for the determination of dihydromyricetin, dihydroquercetin, myricetin and quercetin in rat plasma after intragastric administration of Hoveniae Semen total flavonoids. Baicalin was selected as the internal standard. Analytes were extracted from the rat plasma by protein precipitation with acetonitrile and separated on a C18 chromatographic column (Agilent ZORBAX Eclipse Plus, 4.6 mm × 100 mm, 3.5 μm) using the mobile phase containing acetonitrile (A) and 0.1% formic acid-water (B) by gradient elution at 0.5 mL/min flow rate. A tandem mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source was used to detect analytes. The analytes were measured by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in the negative ionization mode. The lower limit of quantification of dihydromyricetin, dihydroquercetin, myricetin and quercetin were 0.70, 8.16, 1.62 and 0.56 ng/mL, respectively. The accuracy, intra-day and inter-day precision and recovery were all satisfactory and the compounds were stable in rat plasma under all tested conditions. The approach was successfully applied to study pharmacokinetic characteristics of the four bioactive flavonoids in plasma after administering Hoveniae Semen total flavonoids intragastrically to rat. Further investigation was carried out to assess pharmacokinetic comparability of the four bioactive flavonoids after intragastric administration of Hoveniae Semen total flavonoids to mixture of flavonoids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3abaicalin 3achemical species 3aintragastric administration 3aionization 3aliquid chromatography 3amonitoring 3amyricetin 3apharmacokinetics 3aquercetin 3arats 3aspectrometers 3atandem mass spectrometry 3ataxifolin 0aHoveniae Semen 0aFlavonoids 0aPharmacokinetics 0aLC-MS/MS1 aYan, Liye1 aLiu, Ting1 aZhang, Qili1 aZhao, Yunli1 aYu, Miao1 aYu, Zhiguo0 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 1104 p.73-80dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2018.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245011300172500001900285520110800304592002801412650003301440650001601473650002301489650001201512650001501524650001501539653001001554653001701564653000801581653000901589653000901598653001301607653002301620653001701643653002101660653002301681653001701704700001701721700005601738700001801794773011301812856008801925852000902013655001202022IND60678999520221118063241.0200318e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067899952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2019.1094932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Cheng-Hao10aEfficient synthesis of L-phosphinothricin using a novel aminoacylase mined from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aL-phosphinothricin (L-PPT) is a competitive and environmentally friendly herbicide. To develop an efficient approach for synthesis of l-PPT, a kinetic resolution route with a novel aminoacylase (SmAcy) mined from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia using N-acetyl-PPT as a substrate was first constructed. This SmAcy exhibited high hydrolytic activity and excellent enantioselectivity (E > 200) toward N-acetyl-PPT. Optically pure l-PPT (> 99.9 % eeₚ) was acquired with high conversion (> 49 %) within 4 h by the whole cells. On the basis of the docking analysis, a main reason for high enantioselectivity (E > 200) of SmAcy towards l-enantiomer would be that the D-N-acetyl-PPT cannot interact with the key general acid-base residue and the metal ions. A low-cost and simple preparation process of the substrate from commercially available racemic PPT for production of L-PPT was provided. A chemical racemization method of the unreacted D-enantiomer of substrate was also provided to recycle the unwanted substrate enantiomer. This study provides a potential route for the industrial production of L-PPT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStenotrophomonas maltophilia 3aenantiomers 3aenantioselectivity 3aenzymes 3aherbicides 3atechnology 0aL-PPT 0aN-acetyl-PPT 0aPPO 0aHPLC 0aIPTG 0aSDS-PAGE 0aL-phosphinothricin 0aAminoacylase 0aEnzyme catalysis 0aKinetic resolution 0aRacemization1 aZheng, Feng,1 aXue, Ya-Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0370-25021 aZheng, Yu-Guo0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2020 Apr., v. 135 p.109493-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12419x0141-02297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2019.1094933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03505naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245010000164300001600264520191000280592002802190650002002218650002602238650002602264650002502290650001502315650001502330650001902345650002002364650001702384650002202401650002602423650001702449650001902466650001402485650002402499650001302523653002102536653001402557653001702571653002402588653001202612700001802624700001702642700001302659700001602672700002002688700001502708700001802723773011602741856008502857852000902942655001202951IND60623468720221119081540.0181127e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062346872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2018.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Hui10aCell metabolomics identify regulatory pathways and targets of magnoline against prostate cancer  ap. 143-151.  aProstate cancer is known as a common malignant tumor in clinics and moreover, traditional chemotherapeutic drugs have great toxic side effects and drug resistance. Therefore, the searching the highly efficient and low toxicity antitumor drugs from natural drugs has become an important approach for the treatment of prostate cancer. Many studies showed that Cortex Phellodendri has important therapeutic significance for prostate cancer. Magnoline is the main component of Cortex Phellodendri Amurensis, and it is of great significance to evaluate the effect of magnoline on prostate cancer. By using metabolomics, we established a comprehensive analysis strategy based on cell metabolic analysis to study the inhibitory effect of magnoline on the proliferation of prostate cancer cell line 22RV1, and finally conducted an analysis on the cell metabolism footprint samples. Results showed that magnoline had a significant inhibitory effect on the proliferation of the prostate cancer cell line 22RV1. According to the established cell metabolomics methods, we found that 12 metabolic biomarkers of the cell metabolic footprint samples, respectively, could inhibit the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Magnoline could significantly affect these metabolic biomarkers to disrupt the growth and proliferation of the prostate cancer cell line 22RV1. Additionally, through MetPA analysis indicated that these biomarkers were closely correlated with a variety of metabolic pathways in tumor cells, including the energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism, most of which were associated with nutrition and energy metabolism. Therefore, we speculated that because of the disturbance of nutrition metabolism and energy metabolism of the prostate cancer cell line 22RV1, cells could not provide the material basis for rapid proliferation, eventually resulting in the inhibition effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aamino acid metabolism 3aantineoplastic agents 3abiochemical pathways 3abiomarkers 3acell lines 3achromatography 3adrug resistance 3adrug therapy 3aenergy metabolism 3afatty acid metabolism 3ametabolomics 3aneoplasm cells 3anutrition 3aprostatic neoplasms 3atoxicity 0aProstatic cancer 0aMagnoline 0aMetabolomics 0aRegulatory pathways 0aTargets1 aZhang, Ai-hua1 aLiu, Shao-bo1 aQiu, Shi1 aLi, Xian-na1 aZhang, Tian-lei1 aLiu, Liang1 aWang, Xi-Jun,0 tJournal of chromatography.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 1102-1103 p.143-151dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2018.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03467naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014500172300001800317520139200335592002801727650001301755650001601768650001801784650002101802650001101823650004201834650001701876650001201893650002401905650001001929650001601939650001201955651002101967653000901988653000901997653000902006653001002015653000902025653000902034653000602043653000602049653000802055653000802063653000802071653000702079653000602086653000902092653000802101653001002109653001002119653000902129653000902138653001502147653001602162653001002178653001602188653001102204700001902215700005702234700002202291700002202313700002102335700005702356700003202413700002102445700002002466773011702486856008502603852000902688655001202697IND60601739020221118233033.0190624e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060173902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2018.04.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrinkmann, Annika12aA metagenomic survey identifies Tamdy orthonairovirus as well as divergent phlebo-, rhabdo-, chu- and flavi-like viruses in Anatolia, Turkey  ap. 1173-1183.  aWe employed a direct metagenomic approach via next-generation sequencing for a cross-sectional investigation of viruses in 10 tick pools, collected from Aegean, Mediterranean and central Anatolian locations in Turkey. Sequences from all genome segments of Tamdy orthonairovirus (family Nairoviridae) were characterized in ticks collected from a Meriones tristrami. We further obtained near-complete L and partial S segments of several tick-associated phleboviruses (family Phenuiviridae), including Tacheng tick virus 2 and a novel virus, tentatively named as the tick phlebovirus Anatolia. Partial NS5-coding region of recently-described flavi-like virus (Tacheng tick virus 8) was further detected. Moreover, near-complete and polymerase-coding regions of arthropod-associated rhabdoviruses as well as sequences closely-related to the members of the newly-proposed virus family, the Chuviridae, were characterized. Despite origins of the viral sequences could not be fully elucidated, the findings suggest the circulation of diverse arthropod and tick-associated viruses in Anatolia. Occurrence and outcome of vertebrate exposure and probable health impact of these viruses require further investigation. We also report the initial detection of Tamdy orthonairovirus, an established human pathogen, which should be included in the diagnostic workup of infections with unknown etiology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeriones 3aPhlebovirus 3aRhabdoviridae 3aanimal pathogens 3agenome 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ametagenomics 3asurveys 3atick-borne diseases 3aticks 3avertebrates 3aviruses 3aTurkey (country) 0aBTV1 0aBTV2 0aBTV3 0aCCHFV 0aCTV1 0aCTV2 0aL 0aM 0aNGS 0aORF 0aPCR 0aRT 0aS 0aTBEV 0aTOV 0aTaTV2 0aTaTV8 0aWTV1 0aTick 0aMetagenome 0aPhlebovirus 0aTamdy 0aRhabdovirus 0aTurkey1 aDinçer, Ender1 aPolat, Ceylan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1511-41771 aHekimoğlu, Olcay1 aHacıoğlu, Sabri1 aFöldes, Katalin1 aÖzkul, Aykut1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5008-94431 aÖktem, İbrahim Mehmet Ali1 aNitsche, Andreas1 aErgünay, Koray0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2018 July, v. 9, no. 5 p.1173-1183dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2018.04.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100006000159245008200219520092900301592002801230650001601258650001201274650001101286650001801297650001801315650000901333650001201342650001301354650002201367650001701389650001401406650001601420653001701436700001701453700001601470700006901486700001601555700002001571700001901591700002301610773011401633856009401747852000901841655001201850IND60679000520221119112305.0200318e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067900052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2019.1090572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaycock, Bronwyn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0251-844X10aPyrolysis of brominated polyethylene as an alternative carbon fibre precursor  aPolyethylene as a polymeric precursor for carbon fibre production has attracted much attention over recent years. Not only is it a low-cost commodity polymer, it has a higher theoretical carbon yield (at 100%) than polyacrylonitrile (at 67%) and is very readily melt processed into fibres. The challenge is to efficiently dehydrogenate and graphitize polyethylene fibres. This paper explores the use of bromine as a novel oxidant to functionalise polyethylene prior to carbonisation, leading to efficient cyclisation and carbonisation on heating. Through a process of low-temperature photo-induced liquid-phase bromination followed by dehydrobromination at moderate temperature and subsequent carbonisation to 800 °C, a carbonaceous product was obtained in high carbon yield (>90%). The effects of a range of process conditions, as well as the use of different types of polyethylene and polyethylene blends, were explored.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromination 3abromine 3acarbon 3acarbon fibers 3acarbonization 3aheat 3amelting 3aoxidants 3apolyacrylonitrile 3apolyethylene 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 0aCarbon fibre1 aWang, Xiaoyu1 aLiu, Ru-Fen1 aAnnamalai, Pratheep Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7284-08131 aCork, Jorja1 aDerstine, Chris1 aMills, Michael1 aMcFarland, Eric W.0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2020 Feb., v. 172 p.109057-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2019.1090573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04004naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002800159245017400187520221600361592002802577650001402605650002002619650002102639650001802660650002002678650001302698650001702711650001402728650001702742650002202759650001102781650002002792650001802812650001602830650002702846650002702873650001202900650002102912650001902933650001202952650001602964653002802980653002403008653002703032700001703059700002703076700001803103700002003121700002003141700006003161773011403221856009403335852000903429655001203438IND60679000620221119112246.0200318e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067900062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2019.1090582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeffrey Kuo, Chung-Feng10aIn vivo degradation study of polyvinylidene fluoride/polybutylene succinate/modified organic montmorillonite nanocomposite films implanted in the gastrointestinal tract  aA duodenal barrier treatment implanted in gastrointestinal (GI) tract prevents the direct contact of food with the duodenal wall, which helps control the plasma glucose by manipulating the intestinal hormone and insulin secretion. Duodenal barrier material design has to withstand the stress of enterogastric peristalsis and be degradable to avoid damaging the intestinal tissue during its removal when the treatment finished. Most of the biodegradable polymer based implanted materials in the digestive tract were failed to withstand the erosion by gastric acid and intestinal juice. In this regards, composites from polybutylene succinate (PBS) shows weaker stability while used in digestive track, but it could improve towards less prone to sticking to the intestinal wall in the digestive tract through reduce the incidences of infection and inflammation while mixed with poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). Moreover, addition of nanosized additives like montmorillonite to polymer nanocomposites can offer versatile mechanical stability and sustainable degradation. Therefore, in this study, a polymer nanocomposite with degradability and high mechanical properties was prepared by blending (PVDF with biodegradable PBS and organic montmorillonite (OMMT). The nanocomposite with 3 wt% OMMT (PVDF90/PBS10/OMMT3wt%) exhibited the highest tensile strength of 62.61 MPa, which exceeds the tensile strength required for application to soft tissues (46.5 MPa) due to uniform distribution of OMMT. The result showed that the PBS films degraded much faster than the nanocomposite film did in the duodenum and stomach. The rates of weight loss of the nanocomposite in stomach and duodenum were 1.88% and 0.88%, respectively, which indicated that the degradation rate of the nanocomposite film is faster in the stomach than in the duodenum. The nanocomposite maintained a high tensile strength of 60.85 MPa after one month of implantation. Moreover, histological examination revealed mild inflammation of tissue and negligible adverse effects. The in vivo degradation test suggests that the PVDF/PBS/OMMT nanocomposite prepared in this study have the potential for application as a biodegradable duodenal barrier.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aadverse effects 3abiodegradability 3ablood glucose 3adigestive tract 3aduodenum 3agastric acid 3ahistology 3ainflammation 3ainsulin secretion 3amixing 3amontmorillonite 3ananomaterials 3aperistalsis 3apolybutylene succinate 3apolymer nanocomposites 3astomach 3atensile strength 3athermoplastics 3atissues 3aweight loss 0aBiodegradable composite 0aMechanical strength 0aGastrointestinal tract1 aWang, Hao-Yu1 aPrasannan, Adhimoorthy1 aLai, Juin-Yih1 aWang, Runsheng,1 aChang, Hao-Ming1 aTsai, Hsieh-Chih1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8378-32200 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2020 Feb., v. 172 p.109058-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2019.1090583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245019200185300001800377520143300395592002801828650001701856650002101873650001901894650001501913650001701928650001301945650001501958650001401973650002601987650001402013650003002027650001802057650001902075650004302094650003302137650002702170650001302197650001102210650002402221651001302245651001302258700001802271700002502289700001802314700001402332700001702346773009902363856004802462852000902510655001202519IND50068152520221122045317.0130727e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006815252DNAL7 a237490882pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-013-3465-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanveer, Tania10aIsolation and molecular characterization of potentially pathogenic Acanthamoeba genotypes from diverse water resources including household drinking water from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan  ap. 2925-2932.  aAcanthamoeba, an opportunistic protozoan pathogen, is ubiquitous in nature, and therefore plays a predatory role and helps control microbial communities in the ecosystem. These Acanthamoeba species are recognized as opportunistic human pathogens that may cause blinding keratitis and rare but fatal granulomatous encephalitis. To date, there is not a single report demonstrating Acanthamoeba isolation and identification from environmental sources in Pakistan, and that is the aim of this study. Acanthamoeba were identified by morphological characteristics of their cysts on non-nutrient agar plates seeded with Escherichia coli. Additionally, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with genus-specific primers followed by direct sequencing of the PCR product for molecular identification. Furthermore, our PCR and sequencing results confirmed seven different pathogenic and nonpathogenic genotypes, including T2–T10, T4, T5, T7, T15, T16, and T17. To the best of our knowledge, we have identified and isolated Acanthamoeba sp., for the first time, from water resources of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. There is an urgent need to address (1) the pathogenic potential of the identified genotypes and (2) explore other environmental sources from the country to examine the water quality and the current status of Acanthamoeba species in Pakistan, which may be a potential threat for public health across the country.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthamoeba 3aEscherichia coli 3adrinking water 3aecosystems 3aencephalitis 3agenotype 3ahouseholds 3akeratitis 3amicrobial communities 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apublic health 3awater currents 2aAcanthamoebaxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aDrinking Waterxparasitology 2aFamily Characteristics 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aWaterxparasitology 3aPakistan 0aPakistan1 aHameed, Abdul1 aMuazzam, Ambreen Gul1 aJung, Suk-Yul1 aGul, Asma1 aMatin, Abdul0 tParasitology research.g2013 Aug., v. 112, no. 8 p.2925-2932dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-013-3465-5  aDNAL 7aarticle03119naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014100170300001800311520152600329592002801855650002401883650003001907650000801937650002301945650001401968650001801982650001102000650001402011650001302025650001202038650001002050650001902060650000902079650001302088650001002101650002402111650001002135653001402145653001402159653001702173653001402190653001302204653001002217653000902227700002202236700001902258700002102277700002202298700002202320773011702342856008502459852000902544655001202553IND60601740620221118022145.0190624e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060174062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2018.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHornok, Sándor10aMolecular evidence of a badger-associated Ehrlichia sp., a Candidatus Neoehrlichia lotoris-like genotype and Anaplasma marginale in dogs  ap. 1302-1309.  aThe family Anaplasmataceae contains pathogenic and endosymbiotic bacteria of veterinary-medical importance. In this study, 90 blood samples from rural dogs, five blood samples from road-killed European badgers and 34 ticks, i.e. 27 Ixodes (Pholeoixodes) canisuga, six I. (Ph.) hexagonus and one Haemaphysalis concinna collected from the badgers were molecularly analysed for members of Anaplasmataceae. Apart from the molecular evidence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum in one dog and Wolbachia sp. associated with Dirofilaria repens in five dogs, four species/genotypes not yet known to occur in canine hosts have also been found. These included A. marginale in two dogs, a badger-associated Ehrlichia sp. in one dog, a Candidatus Neoehrlichia lotoris-like genotype in six dogs and the DNA of arthropod-associated wolbachiae in three dogs. In two badgers the DNA from the Candidatus N. lotoris-like genotype was identified. Among ticks, four I. canisuga carried the DNA of the above badger-associated Ehrlichia sp., one I. canisuga contained the Candidatus N. lotoris-like genotype, and in H. concinna Wolbachia DNA was present. In conclusion, results shown here should be interpreted as the first molecular evidence for exposure of dogs to three members of Anaplasmataceae, i.e. A. marginale, a badger-associated Ehrlichia sp. and a Candidatus N. lotoris-like agent. The presence of DNA in the blood of relevant animals may also indicate susceptibility to these bacteria, but in support of this, further studies are needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaplasma marginale 3aAnaplasma phagocytophilum 3aDNA 3aDirofilaria repens 3aEhrlichia 3aHaemaphysalis 3aIxodes 3aWolbachia 3abacteria 3abadgers 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3adogs 3agenotype 3ahosts 3atick-borne diseases 3aticks 0aAnaplasma 0aEhrlichia 0aNeoehrlichia 0aWolbachia 0a16S rRNA 0agroEL 0amsp41 aHorváth, Gábor,1 aTakács, Nóra1 aFarkas, Róbert,1 aSzőke, Krisztina1 aKontschán, Jenő0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2018 July, v. 9, no. 5 p.1302-1309dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2018.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02248naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245007900174300001600253520101100269592002801280650002201308650001201330650001501342650001901357650001101376650001101387650001801398653002401416653001201440653002401452653003301476653001701509653002501526700001701551700003501568700002301603773011801626856008501744852000901829655001201838IND60623470320221123044827.0190404e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062347032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2018.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖsterlund, Nicklas10aMembrane-mimetic systems for biophysical studies of the amyloid-β peptide  ap. 492-501.  aThe interplay between the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide and cellular membranes have been proposed as an important mechanism for toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Membrane environments appear to influence Aβ aggregation and may stabilize intermediate Aβ oligomeric states that are considered to be neurotoxic. One important role for molecular biophysics within the field of Aβ studies is to characterize the structure and dynamics of the Aβ peptide in various states, as well as the kinetics of transfer between these states. Because biological cell membranes are very complex, simplified membrane models are needed to facilitate studies of Aβ and other amyloid proteins in lipid environments. In this review, we examine different membrane-mimetic systems available for molecular studies of Aβ. An introduction to each system is given, and examples of important findings are presented for each system. The benefits and drawbacks of each system are discussed from methodical and biological perspectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamyloid 3abiophysics 3acell membranes 3alipids 3amodels 3aneurotoxicity 0aAlzheimer's disease 0aAmyloid 0aProtein aggregation 0aProtein-membrane interaction 0aBiomembranes 0aProtein spectroscopy1 aLuo, Jinghui1 aWärmländer, Sebastian K.T.S.1 aGräslund, Astrid,0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2019 May, v. 1867, no. 5 p.492-501dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1570-96397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2018.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03422naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245014400184300001800328520133700346592002801683650001801711650001301729650001601742650002301758650002401781650001001805650001101815650001501826650002101841650001801862650001401880650002101894650000901915650001701924650002501941650001201966650002101978650003201999650003902031650003002070650002402100650006002124650003102184650003102215650001102246650007302257650000902330650001202339650002902351650000902380650001702389650004502406650000902451700002002460700002102480700003202501700002502533700002202558773009902580856004802679852000902727655001202736IND50068152620221122035342.0130727e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006815262DNAL7 a238281872pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-013-3466-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Mohammad10aImproved antifilarial activity of ivermectin in chitosan–alginate nanoparticles against human lymphatic filarial parasite, Brugia malayi   ap. 2933-2943.  aThe current antifilarial treatments are not up to the mark partly due to deep location of filarial parasites in the human lymphatic system. We report here on the improvement in the antifilarial activity of ivermectin (IVM) using chitosan-alginate nanoparticles prepared by modified complex coacervation method. The nanoparticles were spherical having 155 nm size and 4.56 and 75.67 % loading and entrapment efficiency respectively for IVM. The delivery system maintained the sustained release and significantly augmented the microfilaricidal (MIF) activity at a single low dose (200 μg/kg body weight, subcutaneously) in contrast to much higher dose of free ivermectin (400 μg/kg body weight, subcutaneously) against human lymphatic filariid, Brugia malayi in rodent host, Mastomys coucha. To substantiate increase in MIF activity, pharmacokinetics study was designed on Wistar rats which revealed a greater peak plasma concentration (45.3 ± 1.79 ng/ml), area under the concentration curve (298 ± 38.7 ng d/ml) and extended mean residence time (23.4 ± 8.56 days)of IVM in chitosan-alginate nanoparticles. Administration of 25 mg/kg of diethylcarbamazine following nanoparticle therapy significantly improved the MIF and macrofilaricidal action of encapsulated drug and was considered superior in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrugia malayi 3aMastomys 3abody weight 3adiethylcarbamazine 3aexperimental design 3ahosts 3ahumans 3aivermectin 3alymphatic system 3ananoparticles 3aparasites 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 3atherapeutics 2aAlginatesxchemistry 2aAnimals 2aArea Under Curve 2aBrugia malayixdrug effects 2aCalorimetry, Differential Scanning 2aChemistry, Pharmaceutical 2aChitosanxchemistry 2aFilaricidesxchemistryxpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aGlucuronic Acidxchemistry 2aHexuronic Acidsxchemistry 2aHumans 2aIvermectinxadministration & dosagexpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aMale 2aMurinae 2aNanoparticlesxchemistry 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aTime1 aAfzal, Mohammad1 aVerma, Meenakshi1 aMisra-Bhattacharya, Shailja1 aAhmad, Farhan Jalees1 aDinda, Amit Kumar0 tParasitology research.g2013 Aug., v. 112, no. 8 p.2933-2943dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-013-3466-4  aDNAL 7aarticle03724naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245013600168300001600304520168100320592002802001650004402029650002702073650001602100650002202116650002902138650001702167650001502184650001602199650002202215650001702237650000902254650003202263650000902295650001602304650001302320650001902333650001402352650001802366650001802384650003302402650002202435650001802457650002102475650003702496650003702533650001902570653002302589653001702612653002802629653001702657653001802674700003002692700002302722700002802745700001802773700003402791700002302825773012202848856008302970852000903053655001203062IND60601741220221118022153.0191129e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060174122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2018.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJafari, Mandana10aCytotoxic and antibacterial activities of biologically synthesized gold nanoparticles assisted by Micrococcus yunnanensis strain J2  ap. 245-253.  aIn the present study the capability of Micrococcus yunnanensis J2 (isolated from Sarcheshme mine soil samples and identified by 16S rDNA sequencing) for biosynthesis of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) was evaluated. The produced biogenic Au NPs were characterized using UV–visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) methods. The related TEM and SEM images of biogenic Au NPs indicated spherical shaped and well dispersed nanostructures with the average particle size of 53.8 nm. Zeta potential analysis of as-synthesized Au NPs showed a peak at − 17.6 ± 1.8 mV. The XRD profile of the biogenic Au NPs contained five peaks positioned at 2θ of 38.2°, 45.8°, 63.7°, 77.6°, and 82.1° due to (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) lattice planes, respectively, which clearly indicated the crystalline structure of the obtained Au NPs. Cytotoxic activity of biologically synthesized Au NPs (assisted by MTT-based colorimetric assay) revealed IC50 (µg/mL) of 73.6 ± 1.9, 85.6 ± 2.9, 63.5 ± 2.1, 65.2 ± 1.9, 105.3 ± 1.7, and 88.4 ± 2.1 against six cancer cell lines of U87, HT1080, PC12, Caco2, MCF7, and A549, respectively. However, two normal cells of 3T3 and Vero inhibited by 85% in the presence of 500 µg/mL of the biogenic Au NPs. Evaluation of antibacterial effect of the produced Au NPs and Au3+ ions against three Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacterial strains exhibited lower inhibitory activity of Au NPs compared to that of Au3+ ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aMicrococcus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantibacterial properties 3abiosynthesis 3acell lines 3acolorimetry 3acrystal structure 3acytotoxicity 3agold 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aions 3amined soils 3ananogold 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aparticle size 3aribosomal DNA 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asequence analysis 3asoil sampling 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3azeta potential 0aGold nanoparticles 0aBiosynthesis 0aMicrococcus yunnanensis 0aCytotoxicity 0aAntibacterial1 aRokhbakhsh-Zamin, Farrokh1 aShakibaie, Mojtaba1 aMoshafi, Mohammad Hasan1 aAmeri, Atefeh1 aRaḥīmī, Ḥamīd Riz̤ā,1 aForootanfar, Hamid0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2018 July, v. 15 p.245-253dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2018.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009600166300001600262520157900278592002801857650001801885650002101903650002701924650002801951650001201979650001201991650002602003650002002029650000902049650002402058650001602082650000902098650001102107650001502118653001902133653002702152653002102179653002302200653002402223653002502247700001602272700001702288773012202305856008302427852000902510655001202519IND60601741620221118022331.0191129e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060174162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2018.06.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Hanseul10aHeterologously expressed carrot Hsp17.7 was denatured by ATP treatment under abiotic stress  ap. 240-244.  aHeat shock proteins (HSPs) play a key role to maintain the solubility of cellular proteins under various stress conditions. Previous studies showed that Hsp17.7 from carrot (Daucus carota L.) increased the amount of soluble proteins under the various stress of heat, lead (Pb), and arsenic (As). We studied the molecular chaperon function of the heterologously expressed Hsp17.7 in E. coli with the supplement of ATP. In the Hsp17.7 expressing cells, the ATP supplement under the stress of heat and Pb decreased the amount of soluble proteins, in which the expression level of carrot Hsp17.7 also decreased. The same ATP supplement under the stresses of As maintained the amount of soluble proteins, in which the expression level of Hsp17.7 was also maintained. Our results suggest that the decreased amount of soluble protein under the stress conditions of heat and Pb could be due to the decreased expression level of Hsp17.7 and the influence of ATP on the stressed Hsp17.7 transformed E. coli depends on the type of stress presented. Heterologously expressed Hsp17.7 was purified by affinity chromatography. Under heat stress, purified Hsp17.7 was stable, mostly remained in a soluble fraction, while citrate synthase, a control model substrate, was denatured into the pellet fraction. The ATP supplement under both normal and heat conditions denatured the Hsp17.7 protein into the pellet fraction. Our results suggest that the decreased molecular chaperone function under heat and Pb stress conditions with the ATP supplement could be due to the instability of Hsp17.7.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaucus carota 3aEscherichia coli 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aaffinity chromatography 3aarsenic 3acarrots 3acitrate (si)-synthase 3agene expression 3aheat 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat stress 3alead 3amodels 3asolubility 0aAbiotic stress 0aAdenosine triphosphate 0aEscherichia coli 0aHeat shock protein 0aMolecular chaperone 0aProtein denaturation1 aLee, Joohee1 aAhn, Yeh-Jin0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2018 July, v. 15 p.240-244dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2018.06.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011500169300001600284520103400300592002801334650003401362650004401396650001601440650002501456650001401481650001401495650001201509650002201521650002101543650001201564650001301576650002801589650002001617650003301637650001001670650002201680650002101702650001101723653001901734653002101753700002501774700001701799700001701816700001901833700001701852700002001869700001501889700001801904700002001922773013501942856008702077852000902164655001202173IND60679002520221119112407.0200210e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067900252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.12.1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRozi, Parhat10aIsolations, characterizations and bioactivities of polysaccharides from the seeds of three species Glycyrrhiza  ap. 364-371.  aIn this paper, polysaccharides from the seeds of three species of genus Glycyrrhiza were extracted to investigate the physicochemical properties, structural characteristics and antioxidant activities. The polysaccharides were composed of xylose, mannose, galactose, and glucose with different molar ratio. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed the presence of key functional groups of polysaccharides whereas scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed the characteristic morphology of different polysaccharides, and thermogravimetric analysis exhibited good thermal stability of all samples. The antioxidant activities of polysaccharides were evaluated in vitro. All the three polysaccharides demonstrated strong reducing power, as well as scavenging activity against DPPH, ABTS, and hydroxyl free radicals. Antioxidant assays indicated that all the polysaccharides have obvious antioxidant activities and possess a potential development and application value in food, cosmetics as well as pharmaceutical industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGlycyrrhiza 3aantioxidant activity 3acosmetics 3agalactose 3aglucose 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ain vitro studies 3amannose 3amoieties 3apharmaceutical industry 3apolysaccharides 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aseeds 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3axylose 0aPolysaccharide 0aCharacterization1 aAbuduwaili, Aytursun1 aMa, Shengjun1 aBao, Xiaowei1 aXu, Hezhixiang1 aZhu, Jinfang1 aYadikar, Nigary1 aWang, Juan1 aYang, Xiaojun1 aYili, Abulimiti0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 145 p.364-371dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.12.1073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100001700189245008400206300001600290506007600306520083400382592002801216506003701244650002801281650001301309650001401322650002001336650002201356650001301378650001901391650001101410650001601421650002301437650001701460650002901477653002401506653002601530653001601556653003001572653002401602653001501626653000801641653001001649653000901659653000801668653000901676653000801685653000901693653000901702653000901711653000901720653001001729653001001739653000901749653000901758653000801767653000901775653001001784653000901794653000801803653000801811653000901819653001001828700001601838700001601854700001801870700001601888700001501904773012601919856008302045852000902128655001202137IND60601741820221207103437.0201125s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060174182DNAL7 a300027912pmid7 aPMC60397092pmcid7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2018.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yuchen10aLung Cancer Therapy Targeting Histone Methylation: Opportunities and Challenges  ap. 211-223.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLung cancer is one of the most common malignancies. In spite of the progress made in past decades, further studies to improve current therapy for lung cancer are required. Dynamically controlled by methyltransferases and demethylases, methylation of lysine and arginine residues on histone proteins regulates chromatin organization and thereby gene transcription. Aberrant alterations of histone methylation have been demonstrated to be associated with the progress of multiple cancers including lung cancer. Inhibitors of methyltransferases and demethylases have exhibited anti-tumor activities in lung cancer, and multiple lead candidates are under clinical trials. Here, we summarize how histone methylation functions in lung cancer, highlighting most recent progresses in small molecular inhibitors for lung cancer treatment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantineoplastic activity 3aarginine 3achromatin 3aclinical trials 3aenzyme inhibitors 3ahistones 3alung neoplasms 3alysine 3amethylation 3amethyltransferases 3atherapeutics 3atranscription (genetics) 0aHistone methylation 0aHistone demethylation 0aLung cancer 0aHistone methyltransferase 0aHistone demethylase 0aInhibitors 0aALK 0aDUSP3 0aElk1 0aEMT 0aHDAC 0aIHC 0aKDMs 0aKLF2 0aKMTs 0aLSDs 0aMEP50 0aNSCLC 0aPAD4 0aPCNA 0aPDX 0aPRC2 0aPRMTs 0aPTMs 0aSAH 0aSAM 0aSCLC 0aTIMP31 aLiu, Xinran1 aLi, Yangkai1 aQuan, Chuntao1 aZheng, Ling1 aHuang, Kun0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2018, v. 16 p.211-223dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2018.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011700170300001400287520128900301592002801590650004401618650002701662650001301689650002301702650002601725650001701751650001001768650002601778650001401804650001101818650001301829650004401842650001301886650003301899650001701932650001301949650003701962653001301999653001802012653002402030700001902054700002102073700002502094700002302119773013302142856008702275852000902362655001202371IND60679002720221119112336.0200210e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067900272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.12.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaisankar, E.10aDual property of chitosan blended copolymer membranes: Antidiabetic drug release profile and antimicrobial assay  ap. 42-52.  aMembranes were fabricated from a blend of synthetic copolymer (thiourea, phenylhydrazine and formaldehyde) and chitosan to study the metformin drug release profile and its kinetics. The membranes were characterized with elemental, scanning electron microscopy, FTIR and ¹H NMR spectroscopy to identify the empirical formula & weight, surface morphology and functional group changes occurred during the incorporation of chitosan to the copolymer. The swelling behaviour, drug loading efficiency and drug release profile of the membranes were studied using UV–visible spectroscopy. The mechanical properties and in vitro degradation studies were also performed. The reactive sites, better porosity and larger surface area provided by chitosan to the copolymer led to higher drug loading efficiency and controlled drug release profile. Kinetic study revealed swelling and diffusion controlled mechanism for the membranes, which obtained from Ritger-Peppas and Higuchi model. The chitosan and its copolymer membranes were tested for antimicrobial assay using selective gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial and fungal strains. The CS-TPF-drug membranes showed an acceptable control of the growth of all the microbial species compared to CS, CS-drug and the standard metformin drug.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGram-negative bacteria 3achitosan 3acomposite polymers 3adrug delivery systems 3aformaldehyde 3afungi 3amechanical properties 3ametformin 3amodels 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3athiourea 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aMembrane 0aDrug delivery 0aAntimicrobial assay1 aPavithra, M.E.1 aKrishna, Sanjith1 aThirumarimurugan, M.1 aAzarudeen, Raja S.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 145 p.42-52dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.12.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02508naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245009300164300001600257520111800273592002801391650001401419650001301433650001201446650001901458650001201477650002201489650000901511650002301520650001301543650001401556650003101570650001901601650002401620653001501644653000901659653004201668700002601710700001601736700001601752700001901768700002001787773013501807856008701942852000902029655001202038IND60679003120221119112319.0200210e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067900312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.12.1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Hao10aOxidation of dextran using H2O2 and NaClO/NaBr and their applicability in iron chelation  ap. 615-623.  aThe structural modification of polysaccharides directly affects their physicochemical properties and applications. Dextran, a chained polysaccharide, consists of multiple d-glucose molecules with repetitive structures. In this study, the physicochemical properties of oxidized dextran (DO) at different concentrations of NaClO/NaBr and H₂O₂ were compared. The results showed that NaClO/NaBr oxidation is more conducive to the formation of carboxyl groups. Oxidized dextran with NaClO/NaBr (DOB) showed good iron (III) chelating ability, and the DOB‑iron (III) complex (DOBIC) had an iron content of 28.31%. According to structural analysis, NaClO/NaBr (2 g/100 g of active chlorine) and H₂O₂ (4 g/100 g), respectively, oxidize the C1 and C2 hydroxyl groups of dextran to carboxyl groups and open the ring when DO and iron have the strongest chelation ability. The complex is indeed a chelate iron complex, and iron core is composed of iron oxyhydroxide or the β-FeOOH mineral polymorph. These results indicate that DOBIC is expected to be a good iron supplement or food additive to strengthen iron.  aPublisher supplied data 3achelation 3achlorine 3adextran 3afood additives 3aglucose 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3airon oxyhydroxides 3amoieties 3aoxidation 3aphysicochemical properties 3asodium bromide 3asodium hypochlorite 0aNaClO/NaBr 0aH2O2 0aPolysaccharide‑iron (III) complexes1 aShang-guan, Ding-cong1 aLu, Qi-meng1 aHu, Xue-qin1 aYang, Jing-wen1 aZhang, Hong-bin0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 144 p.615-623dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.12.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100004100151245011800192300001400310520131500324592002801639650001501667650001301682650001401695650002401709650002101733650001201754653002101766653002001787653001901807653002301826653002101849653004201870653002501912653002401937653004201961653002402003773017702027856008502204852000902289655001202298IND60601742520221118022314.0180706s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060174252DNAL7 a10.1016/S2007-1523(13)71993-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMariscal Rodríguez, Gabriela Lizeth10aSociocultural Influences associated with the body perception in children: a review and analysis of the literature  ap. 58-67.  aIn recent years, numerous studies have suggested the importance of the alteration of the perception of body image as an early symptom for the detection of eating disorders. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to do a review and analysis of the literature of those articles in which we may analyze the influence of friends, media and family about the body perception in children 8 to 13 years. For this was done a search for articles in the databases of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Science Direct, which relate sociocultural influences with the TCA and the body perception, for more than a decade. The female population and in developed countries were the main focus of attention in the research, the majority were of transverse type. In addition this hotfix allows you to observe that in spite of the fact that has been studied the socio-cultural influence that perception exists in the body there are still inconsistencies or lack of update on the investigations, which can be viewed in the instruments used and the design of the study. A limitation of this study was not encompass more years and find other reviews on the subject, that is why it is recommended to continue to extend the studies related to this theme not only with female shows, or in developed countries but also in those samples less studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody image 3achildren 3adatabases 3adeveloped countries 3aeating disorders 3afemales 0aEating disorders 0abody perception 0apeer influence 0ainfluence of media 0afamily influence 0aTrastornos de la conducta alimentaria 0apercepción corporal 0ainfluencia de pares 0ainfluencia de medios de comunicación 0ainfluencia familiar0 tRevista mexicana de trastornos alimentarios.g2013, v. 4, no. 1 p.58-67dElsevier España, S.L.U.aUniversidad Nacional Autónoma de MéxicowJournal:23522x2007-15237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2007-1523(13)71993-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245009100181300001500272520155700287592002801844650002001872650002901892650002301921650001301944650001501957650001101972650001201983650001501995650001902010650002502029650001602054650001002070651001102080653001502091653001202106653002302118653000802141653001002149653001102159653001402170653001302184653002302197653000802220653001202228653001202240700002402252773017802276856008502454852000902539655001202548IND60601742820221118022310.0180706s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060174282DNAL7 a10.1016/S2007-1523(13)71996-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoral de la Rubia, José,10aCausal Attribution of Overweight/Obesity and its Relation to BMI and Eating Alteration  ap. 89-101.  aThe aims of this paper were: 1) to describe the differences in causal attributions of overweight or obesity in two groups of women, one with overweight or obesity and the another with normal weight or underweight, and 2) to generate predictive models for three criterion variables: one dichotomous criterion variable (having or not overweight/obesity), and two continuous criterion variables (body mass index [BMI] and eating alteration). A quota sample with two BMI groups of 217 women (107 with BMI < 25 and 110 with BMI ≥ 25) from Monterrey (Mexico) was collected. The Overeating Questionnaire (O’Donnell & Warren, 2007) was used to measure eating alteration. The condition of overweight/obesity was attributed mainly to putative aspects to the person: bad habits, lack of exercise, consumption of fast food, and lack of will. Three factors were defined from the inter-correlation of causal attributions: dietetic-nutritional, medical and psychological causes. The attributions and their factors were differential, and allowed to predict the dichotomous variable of having o not overweight/obesity, and the continuous variables of BMI and eating alteration. The socioeconomic status correlated to having overweight/obesity and higher BMI, but was independent of educational level. It is suggested that professionals and socio-health and educational institutions persist in the social communication about obesity causes, since this communication influences social representation, which will facilitate the processes of change during intervention.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3aeducational institutions 3aeducational status 3aexercise 3afast foods 3amodels 3aobesity 3aovereating 3aquestionnaires 3asocioeconomic status 3aunderweight 3awomen 3aMexico 0aOverweight 0aobesity 0acausal attribution 0aBMI 0awomen 0aMexico 0aSobrepeso 0aobesidad 0aatribución causal 0aIMC 0amujeres 0aMéxico1 aMeza Peña, Cecilia0 tRevista mexicana de trastornos alimentarios.g2013, v. 4, no. 2 p.89-101dElsevier España, S.L.U.aUniversidad Nacional Autónoma de MéxicowJournal:23522x2007-15237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2007-1523(13)71996-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245013000159300001800289520134900307592002801656650002501684650002401709650001401733650002201747650002201769653001801791653002801809653001801837653002501855653001101880700001201891700001501903700006601918700001301984700001301997700001202010700001802022700002602040700005202066773013902118856007802257852000902335655001202344IND60631583320221120111452.0190311e20190130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063158332DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b214212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhi10aMechanical Strain Manipulation of Exchange Bias Field and Spin Dynamics in FeCo/IrMn Multilayers Grown on Flexible Substrates  ap. 8258-8265.  aAs a key effect in spintronic devices, exchange bias has attracted tremendous attention. Various approaches have been attempted for optimizing this effect, among which the application of strain in flexible exchange-biased systems is promising, but little significant improvement has been reported. Here, we demonstrate encouraging progress in this field. With a pure mechanical compressive strain of −6.26‰ applied to the flexible polyimide (PI) substrate, distinct enhancement of ∼900% in the bias field (from 20 to 200 Oe) is achieved for the exchange-biased (FeCo/IrMn)₃/Ta multilayers grown on top of a flexible PI substrate, accompanied by a notable decrease in the Gilbert damping parameter from 0.02 to 0.008, signifying an improved exchange bias effect as well as a potentially reduced switching current density. The underlying mechanism is investigated by a systematic ferromagnetic resonance study, suggesting that the angle between the unidirectional and uniaxial magnetic easy axes plays an important role, which may be controlled by adjusting the layer number. This work offers an efficient strategy for tuning the exchange bias effect via applying appropriate mechanical strain on a multiperiodic exchange bias multilayered system, opening up an avenue for tailoring the magnetic properties of flexible spintronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompression strength 3amagnetic properties 3amagnetism 3amaterials science 3amechanical stress 0aexchange bias 0aferromagnetic resonance 0aspin dynamics 0aflexible spintronics 0astrain1 aLiu, Er1 aZhang, Wen1 aWong, Ping Kwan Johnny1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4645-03841 aXu, Zhan1 aHu, Fang1 aLi, Xia1 aTang, Jiaxuan1 aWee, Andrew Thye Shen1 aXu, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5802-79250 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Jan. 30, v. 11, no. 8 p.8258-8265dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b214213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03353naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012100167300001300288520190200301592002802203650002002231650001402251650002002265650001802285650001302303650001502316650002002331650001102351650001102362650001102373650001802384650001002402653002302412653001302435653002302448653001802471653001502489653001102504700005702515700002002572700002402592700001902616700001902635773011302654856008302767852000902850655001202859IND60623474020221122015247.0190415e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062347402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2018.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBournez, Elena10aSensitivity of simulated light interception and tree transpiration to the level of detail of 3D tree reconstructions  ap. 1-10.  aThe aim of this paper is to investigate the minimal level of detail of the tree geometry reconstruction required to enable an accurate estimate of the evaporative cooling effect of an individual tree.The Functional Structural Plant Modeling approach, which links the 3D tree structure to its functioning, is used to investigate the impact of the level of detail of a tree reconstruction on its simulated transpiration. Based on terrestrial laser scanning point cloud data of a nine-meter-high silver linden tree (Tilia tomentosa Moench), several methods of reconstruction of its crown were considered. They can be divided into three groups: (i) tree branching structure reconstructions where leafy shoots are reconstructed; (ii) envelope reconstructions such as 3D convex/concave envelopes; and (iii) voxel reconstructions where leaves are uniformly distributed within the given volume. Based on these methods, several mock-ups of resolved tree crowns from low to high level of details were created. The cooling performance of each tree mock-up was compared by simulating its transpiration rate with a validated 3D ecophysiological model based on the turbid medium approach.The resulting mock-ups differ in several characteristics related to tree metrics and light interception: volume, projected leaf area, leaf area index, leaf area density, leaf clumping and silhouette-to-total area ratio. An inter-comparison of the transpiration rates provided by these mock-ups shows that tree branching structure reconstruction methods perform better than envelope computation methods and that these differences are related to the light interception property of the reconstructed trees.This study provides guidelines to determine which structural characteristics of tree crowns must be measured and taken into account in order to carry out accurate estimates of the transpiration rates of individual trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTilia tomentosa 3abranching 3adata collection 3aecophysiology 3ageometry 3aguidelines 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3amodels 3ashoots 3atranspiration 3atrees 0aBranching skeleton 0aEnvelope 0aLight interception 0aTranspiration 0aUrban tree 0aVoxels1 aLandes, Tania1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9115-94011 aNajjar, Georges1 aKastendeuch, Pierre1 aNgao, Jérôme1 aSaudreau, Marc0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2019 Feb., v. 38 p.1-10dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2018.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02174naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245009100181300001600272520084000288592002801128650001201156650002001168650001701188650001301205650001701218650001001235653001201245653002001257653001501277653001401292653002501306653001201331653002101343653001601364653001601380653002701396700002201423700002201445773017901467856008501646852000901731655001201740IND60601744820221118022308.0180706s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060174482DNAL7 a10.1016/S2007-1523(14)72009-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReyes-Rodriguez, Mae Lynn10aCulturally Sensitive Intervention for Latina Women with Eating Disorders: A Case Study  ap. 136-146.  aWe describe cognitive-behavioral therapy for bulimia nervosa (CBT-BN) with a Latina woman that incorporates culturally relevant topics.A single case report of a 31-year-old monolingual Latina woman with BN describes the application of a couple-based intervention adjunctive to CBT-BN.The patient reported no binge and purge episodes by session 20 and remained symptom free until the end of treatment (session 26).

We reviewed the impacts on UGS provision exerted by different actors (individuals, formal and informal groups, community councils, city authorities, national governmental and non-governmental organizations), along with the relevant institutional foundations of those impacts. As a result, we identified and classified the different barriers for which these actors are responsible in the case of fifteen UGS types in our case study city, Lodz (Łódź) in Poland. The main barriers at different levels concern conflicting interests, physical barriers (private green spaces), and the lack of funds, together with legal and governmental failures (public green spaces). These barriers result from the different actors’ mandates or lack thereof. Our analysis has implications for the operationalization of UGS availability, accessibility and attractiveness, and, in particular, for mapping UGS and setting the relevant indicators and thresholds for UGS availability, accessibility and attractiveness.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3agreen infrastructure 3anongovernmental organizations 3aPoland 0aAccess to urban green spaces 0aFormal green spaces 0aInformal green spaces 0aInstitutions 0aUniversal access 0aUrban green space provision 0aEnvironmental justice1 aKronenberg, Jakub1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4903-24010 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2018 Dec., v. 36 p.22-33dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2018.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245007300176246005500249300001800304520194200322592002802264650001002292650001402302650001102316650002002327650001802347650000902365650001502374650001202389650001502401650001702416650001402433650002402447650000902471650001302480700003002493773010602523856005502629852000902684655001202693IND4475735220221119190154.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447573522DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01726.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatten, Michael A.,10aPredictores de Tendencias de Ocupación en Varias Escalas Espaciales3 aPredictors of Occupancy Trend Across Spatial Scale  ap. 1203-1211.  aMany explorations of extinction probability have had a global focus, yet it is unclear whether variables that explain the probability of extinction at large spatial extents are the same as those at small spatial extents. Thus, we used nearly annual presence–absence records for the most recent 40 years of a 110‐year data set from Palenque, Mexico, an area with ongoing deforestation, to explore which of >200 species of birds have probabilities of extirpation that are likely to increase. We assessed associations between long‐term trends in species presence (i.e., detection in a given year) and body size, geographic range size, diet, dependence on forest cover, taxonomy, and ecological specialization. Our response variable was the estimated slope of a weighted logistic regression for each species. We assessed the relative strength of each predictor by means of a model ranking scheme. Several variables associated with high extinction probability at global extents, such as large body size or small geographic range size, were not associated with occurrence of birds over time at our site. Body size was associated with species loss at Palenque, but occurrence trends of both very large and very small species, particularly the latter, have declined, or the species have been extirpated. We found no association between declining occurrence trend and geographic range size, yet decline correlated with whether a species depends on forest (mean occupancy trend =−0.0380, 0.0263, and 0.0186 for, respectively, species with high, intermediate, or low dependence on forest) and with complex combinations of diet and foraging strata (e.g., occurrence of canopy insectivores and terrestrial omnivores has increased, whereas occurrence of mid‐level frugivores and terrestrial granivores has decreased). Our findings emphasize that analyses of local areas are necessary to explicate extirpation risk at various spatial extents.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3abody size 3acanopy 3adata collection 3adeforestation 3adiet 3aextinction 3aforests 3afrugivores 3ainsectivores 3aomnivores 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3ataxonomy1 aSMITH‐PATTEN, BRENDA D.0 tConservation biology.g2011 Dec., v. 25, no. 6 p.1203-1211dBlackwell Publishing Incx0888-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01726.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03209naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245011000169300001600279520163700295592002801932650004101960650002802001650001502029650003002044650001202074650002002086650002102106650001302127650001502140650001502155650001902170650002702189650001602216650002102232650001802253651001102271653001902282653001602301653001502317653001402332653001402346653001602360700002402376700001902400700002402419700002102443773012802464856007802592852000902670655001202679IND60520816220221120233602.0160907e20140306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052081622DNAL7 a10.2478/sggw-2013-00112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarcinkowski, Paweł10aModelling of discharge, nitrate and phosphate loads from the Reda catchment to the Puck Lagoon using SWAT  ap. 125-141.  aModelling of discharge, nitrate and phosphate loads from the Reda catchment to the Puck Lagoon using SWAT. This study presents an application of the SWAT model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) in an agricultural, coastal catchment situated in northern Poland, draining an area of 482 km2 (the Reda catchment). The main objective of this study was calibration and validation of the model against daily discharge and water quality parameters (bi-monthly total suspended solids [TSS], nitrate nitrogen [N-NO3] and phosphate phosphorus [P-PO4] loads). Calibration and validation were conducted using the SWAT-CUP program and SUFI-2 (Sequential Uncertainty Fitting Version 2) algorithm. The Nash- -Sutcliffe efficiency, which was set as an objective function in calibration of all variables, was equal for discharge to 0.75 and 0.61 for calibration and validation periods, respectively. For TSS, N-NO3 and P-PO4 loads NSE was equal to 0.56, 0.62 and 0.53 in calibration period, and 0.22, 0.64 and -1.78 in validation period, respectively. For the calibration period all the results are satisfactory or good, while for the validation period the results for TSS and P-PO4 loads are rather poor, which is related mainly to the lack of homogeneity between calibration and validation periods. These results demonstrate that SWAT is an appropriate tool for quantification of nutrient loads in Polish agricultural catchments, in particular for N-NO3. The model can therefore be applied for water resources management, for quantification of scenarios of climate and land use change, and for estimation of the Best Management Practices efficiency  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aagricultural watersheds 3aalgorithms 3abest management practices 3aclimate 3aland use change 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3apollution load 3atotal suspended solids 3auncertainty 3awater management 3awater quality 3aPoland 0aReda catchment 0aPuck Lagoon 0aSWAT model 0anutrients 0adischarge 0acalibration1 aPiniewski, Mikołaj1 aKardel, Ignacy1 aGiełczewski, Marek1 aOkruszko, Tomasz0 tAnnals of Warsaw University of Life Sciences, SGGW.g2014 Mar. 06, v. 45, no. 2 p.125-141dDe Gruyter Openx2081-96177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/sggw-2013-00113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01882naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245010900162300001600271520072200287592002801009650002201037650000901059650001301068650002601081650000901107653002301116653000801139653002501147653001301172653003601185653002101221700002501242700002601267773012801293856007801421852000901499655001201508IND60520816320221120233554.0160907e20140306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052081632DNAL7 a10.2478/sggw-2013-00122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSas, Wojciech10aEstimation of physical and mechanical properties of cohesive soil stabilized by hydratized lime addition  ap. 143-157.  aEstimation of physical and mechanical properties of cohesive soil stabilized by hydratized lime addition.

To evaluate the importance of stem starch, we investigated a retrotransposon (Tos17) insertion rice mutant lacking a gene encoding a large subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP) called OsAGPL1 or OsAPL3. The AGP activity and starch contents of the mutant were drastically reduced in the stem (i.e. leaf sheath and culm) but not in the leaf blade or endosperm. This starch reduction in the leaf sheaths of the mutant was complemented by the introduction of wild-type OsAGPL1. These results strongly suggest that OsAGPL1 plays a principal role in stem starch accumulation. Field experimentations spanning 2 years revealed that the mutant plants were shorter than the wild-type plants. Moreover, the tiller number and angle were larger in the mutant plants than the wild-type plants, but the dry weight at heading stage was not different. The grain yield was slightly lower in control plots without shading treatment. However, this difference increased substantially with shading. Therefore, stem starch is indispensable for normal ripening under low irradiance conditions and probably contributes to the maintenance of appropriate plant architecture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aendosperm 3afield experimentation 3agenes 3agrain yield 3aheading 3aleaf blade 3alight intensity 3amutants 3aplant architecture 3arice 3aripening 3astarch 3astems 0anonstructural carbohydrate 0ashading 0astem starch 0atiller angle 0atiller number1 aHirose, Tatsuro1 aHashida, Yoichi1 aYamagishi, Tohru1 aOhsugi, Ryu1 aAoki, Naohiro0 tFunctional plant biology.g2013, v. 40, no. 11 p.1137-1146dCSIRO Publishingx1445-44087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP13105  aDNAL 7aarticle01346naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245005700156300001800213520044600231592002800677650002300705650002300728650002300751650002200774700001900796700002100815700001800836773010600854856007500960852000901035655001201044IND60578480120180213000000.0170813e20121221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057848012DNAL7 a10.1021/ol303039s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Ho Yong10aThree-Stage Binary Switching of Azoaromatic Polybase  ap. 6286-6289.  aAn OFF–ON–OFF-type three-stage binary switching was realized with an azoaniline-based polybase 1.

The study concerns the assessment of the traffic influence on the concentrations of three particulate matter (PM) fractions and their basic components. The PM samples were collected simultaneously at two receptors in Katowice. The measurement sites represented the so-called urban background and traffic points. The contents of the organic and elementary carbon as well as water- -soluble ions were determined in the samples. It has been observed that the traffic (car engines) pollution emissions enrich the submicron and fine PM particles with the elementary carbon at a typical urban background in southern Poland. On the other hand, the influence of the re-suspension of the road and soil dust, caused by traffic, on the concentrations and chemical composition is observed for the coarse PM fraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3achemical composition 3adust 3aemissions 3aions 3aparticulates 3apollution 3asoil 3atraffic 3aPoland 0aPM1 0aPM1-2.5 0aPM2.5-10 0aelemental carbon 0aorganic carbon 0achemical composition 0asize distribution 0atraffic site 0aurban background1 aRogula-Kupiec, Patrycja1 aMathews, Barbara1 aKlejnowski, Krzysztof0 tAnnals of Warsaw University of Life Sciences, SGGW.g2014 Mar. 06, v. 45, no. 2 p.243-253dDe Gruyter Openx2081-96177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/sggw-2013-00213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04504naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002500113040001800138100002300156245014000179300001800319520160500337592002801942650001801970650002501988650001102013650003302024650004302057650002002100650001402120650002002134650001702154650002102171650001202192650001802204650001202222650003902234650001302273650001602286650001402302650001402316650001202330650001102342650001802353650001102371650004502382650004602427650004602473650009102519650004802610650005402658650007802712650004702790650001402837650006602851650008702917650008103004650003103085650008203116650004203198653001303240700002203253700002003275700001803295700002003313700002303333700002503356700002103381700003003402700001903432700002203451700002103473700002003494773011303514856003803627852000903665655001203674IND50069635120221117235541.0131017s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006963512DNAL7 a232412202pmid7 a10.1071/RD121732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasconcelos, G.

After 12 days culture, sequential FSH (100ngmL-1 from Days 0 to 6 and 500ngmL-1 from Days 7 to 12) increased follicular diameter and resulted in increased antrum formation (P<0.05). Alone, 200ngmL-1 GDF-9 significantly reduced HAS1 mRNA levels, but increased versican and perlecan mRNA levels in whole follicles, which included the oocyte, theca and granulosa cells. Together, FSH and GDF-9 increased HAS2 and versican (VCAN) mRNA levels, but decreased PCNA mRNA expression, compared with levels in follicles cultured in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 3.0mgmL-1 bovine serum albumin, 10µgmL-1 insulin, 5.5µgmL-1 transferrin, 5ngmL-1 selenium, 2mM glutamine, 2mM hypoxanthine and 50μgmL-1 ascorbic acid (α-MEM+). Comparisons of uncultured (0.2mm) and α-MEM+ cultured follicles revealed that HAS1 mRNA expression was higher, whereas VCAN expression was lower, in cultured follicles (P<0.05). Expression of HAS1, VCAN and perlecan (HSPG2) was higher in cultured than in vivo-grown (0.3mm) follicles. In conclusion, FSH and/or GDF-9 promote follicular growth and antrum formation. Moreover, GDF-9 stimulates expression of versican and perlecan and interacts positively with FSH to increase HAS2 expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3abovine serum albumin 3acattle 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3afollicle-stimulating hormone receptors 3agene expression 3aglutamine 3agranulosa cells 3ahypoxanthine 3ain vitro culture 3ainsulin 3amessenger RNA 3aoocytes 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3aselenium 3atransferrin 3aviability 2aAbattoirs 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCell Survival 2aFemale 2aFollicle Stimulating Hormonexmetabolism 2aFollicular Fluidxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGlucuronosyltransferasexantagonists & inhibitorsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGrowth Differentiation Factor 9xmetabolism 2aIn Vitro Oocyte Maturation Techniquesxveterinary 2aIsoenzymesxantagonists & inhibitorsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOocytesxcytologyxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aOogenesis 2aOvarian Folliclexcytologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aProliferating Cell Nuclear Antigenxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProteoglycansxantagonists & inhibitorsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aReceptors, FSHxantagonists & inhibitorsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTissue Culture Techniquesxveterinary 0aculture.1 aSaraiva, M.

There were more autophagosomes, as revealed by electron microscopy, in follicles from females fed the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus IMC 501. This was confirmed by increased expression of genes involved in the autophagic process, namely ambra1, becn1, lc3 and uvrag. In addition, preovulatory follicles from females fed the probiotic contained more microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 isoform II (LC3-II) and less p62 protein. The increased autophagy in preovulatory follicles from females fed the probiotic was concomitant with a decrease in the apoptotic process in the ovary, as evidenced by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP–digoxigenin nick end-labelling analysis and confirmed by lower expression of genes involved in apoptosis (i.e. p53, bax, apaf and cas3) and higher expression as igfII and igf1r. The results of the present study provide preliminary evidence of the involvement of autophagy during follicle development in the zebrafish ovary. In addition, we have demonstrated for the first time that a functional food, such as L. rhamnosus IMC 501, can modulate the balance between apoptosis and autophagy that regulates ovary physiology in zebrafish by inhibiting follicular apoptosis and improving follicular survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3aelectron microscopy 3afemales 3afunctional foods 3agenes 3aphysiology 3aprobiotics 2aAnimals 2aApoptosis 2aApoptosis Regulatory Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAutophagy 2aDietxveterinary 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor IIxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLacticaseibacillus rhamnosusxgrowth & development. 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aMicrotubule-Associated Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOogenesis 2aOvarian Folliclexcytologyxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aProbiotics 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-mycxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aSomatomedinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aVitellogenesis 2aZebrafishxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aZebrafish Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aactivating molecule in becn-1-regulated autophagy (Ambra1) 0aLactobacillus rhamnosus 0azebrafish1 aValle, Luisa Dalla1 aBenato, Francesca1 aFimia, Gian Maria1 aNardacci, Roberta1 aCiccosanti, Fabiola1 aPiacentini, Mauro1 aBorini, Andrea1 aCarnevali, Oliana0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2013, v. 25, no. 8 p.1115-1125dCSIRO Publishingx1031-36137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RD12187  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002800144245010500172300001400277520109600291592002801387650001001415650001401425650001501439650001501454650001101469650000901480650001301489650001201502650001801514650001501532650002501547650001501572651001101587653001501598653002201613653002201635653002401657653001101681653002401692653002501716653002301741700001901764773012501783856007801908852000901986655001201995IND60520817820221121014605.0160525e20140404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052081782DNAL7 a10.2478/sggw-2014-00052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarczmarczyk, Agnieszka10aTesting of reactive materials for phosphorus removal from water and wastewater – comparative study  ap. 57-67.  aTesting of reactive materials for phosphorus removal from water and wastewater - comparative study. Excess of phosphorus in surface water is a global problem. Phosphorus found in rivers, streams, agricultural ditches and lakes comes from both point and diffuse sources. To keep water bodies in a good ecological status it is necessary to manage it a at local level. One of the possible solutions is to use reactive materials in wastewater treatment plants as well as in case of diffuse sources of pollution to implement it in water bodies transporting pollutants from small catchments. This paper presents results of research made over the period of 6 years (2008-2013) in the Department of Environmental Improvement and Water Center WULS-SGGW. Seventeen different materials available in Poland and in other parts of the world were tested as potential reactive materials for phosphorus.

The present study investigated the ability of ovine oocytes vitrified at the GV stage using a cryoloop to be subsequently matured, fertilised and cultured in vitro to blastocyst-stage embryos. Selected cumulus–oocyte complexes obtained from mature ewes at the time of death were randomly divided into vitrified, toxicity and control groups. Following vitrification and warming, viable oocytes were matured in vitro for 24h. Matured oocytes were either evaluated for nuclear maturation, spindle and chromosome configuration or fertilised and cultured in vitro for 7 days. No significant differences were observed in the frequencies of IVM (oocytes at the MII stage), oocytes with normal spindle and chromatin configuration and fertilised oocytes among the three groups. Cleavage at 24 and 48h post insemination was significantly decreased (P<0.01) in vitrified oocytes. No significant differences were observed in the proportion of blastocyst development between vitrified and control groups (29.4% v. 45.1%, respectively). No significant differences were observed in total cell numbers, the number of apoptotic nuclei or the proportion of diploid embryos among the three groups. In conclusion, we report for the first time that ovine oocytes vitrified at the GV stage using a cryoloop have the ability to be matured, fertilised and subsequently developed in vitro to produce good-quality blastocyst embryos at frequencies comparable to those obtained using fresh oocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3ablastocyst 3achromatin 3acryopreservation 3adeath 3adiploidy 3aewes 3agerminal vesicle 3ain vitro culture 3ain vitro fertilization 3ainsemination 3atoxicity 3avitrification 2aAnimals 2aApoptosis 2aBlastocystxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolism 2aCell Survival 2aCleavage Stage, Ovumxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aCryopreservationxinstrumentationxveterinary. 2aCumulus Cellsxphysiology 2aEctogenesis 2aEmbryo Culture Techniquesxveterinary 2aFemale 2aFertilization in Vitroxveterinary 2aIn Vitro Oocyte Maturation Techniquesxveterinary 2aMale 2aOocytesxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aOogenesis 2aSemen Preservationxveterinary 2aSheep, Domesticxphysiology 2aSpindle Apparatusxmetabolism 2aVitrification 0aoocyte 0avitrification1 aZhu, Jie1 aChoi, Inchul1 aAmarnath, Dasari1 aChen, Wenchao1 aCampbell, Keith H.

The Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) is one of the European regions seriously vulnerable to drought events and there is an urgent need in the region to develop better drought management systems. In February 2013 the Global Water Partnership for Central and Eastern Europe region launched the Integrated Drought Management Programme (IDMP CEE) involving more than 40 organizations from 10 CEE countries. The Programme is structured to provide both policy advice and practical solutions in drought management. The specific objectives of the IDMP CEE are to develop understanding, knowledge and planning for integrated drought management, map and assess the impact of droughts. Moreover, several case studies (demonstration projects) in pilot basins involving local communities are initiated. The national governments are supported to incorporate drought management in their national programs, develop monitoring framework and raise drought awareness through efficient dissemination mechanisms. All countries of the CEE region need to improve both their short-term and long-term responses across sectors to meteorological, agricultural and hydrological droughts. In spite of the fact that several basins in the region are of transboundary character, regional integration of drought monitoring and early warning is not at the level desired. Whilst the lack of water is the primary cause of drought, there are still a large number of factors which exacerbate and intensify its effects. If these factors - many of which have little to do with water per se - are adequately managed, the consequences of the lack of water can be greatly reduced. For example, there are several specific problems and challenges related to the current process of economic transition in the region, including macroeconomic and financial problems  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acase studies 3adrought 3ahydrology 3aissues and policy 3amacroeconomics 3amanagement systems 3amonitoring 3aplanning 3aEastern European region 0adrought 0arisk 0amanagement 0aintegration 0avulnerability 0aresilience 0asusza 0aryzyko 0azarządzanie 0aintegracja 0anarażenie (np. na straty) 0aodporność1 aOkruszko, Tomasz0 tAnnals of Warsaw University of Life Sciences, SGGW.g2014 Oct. 10, v. 46, no. 3 p.167-179dDe Gruyter Openx2081-96177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/sggw-2014-00143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01510naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245011700163300001800280520052400298592002800822650001300850650002300863650002300886650002200909650002100931650001600952650001300968700002500981773010601006856007501112852000901187655001201196IND60578481720221121092512.0170813e20121221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057848172DNAL7 a10.1021/ol303124r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalladino, Pasquale10aNew TFA-Free Cleavage and Final Deprotection in Fmoc Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis: Dilute HCl in Fluoro Alcohol  ap. 6346-6349.  aA novel method for cleaving from resin and removing acid-labile protecting groups for the Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis is described. 0.1 N HCl in hexafluoroisopropanol or trifluoroethanol cleanly and rapidly removes the tert-butyl ester and ether, Boc, trityl, and Pbf groups and cleaves the common resin linkers: Wang, HMPA, Rink amide, and PAL.

This paper compares the predicted insulation of clothing (Iclp) in Toruń and Koniczynka, presented using a scale of evaluation of thermal environment proposed by B. Krawczyk (2000). The annual mean value of predicted insulation of clothing in urban areas of Toruń was equal to 1.0 clo, which was 0.1 less than in the agricultural area of Koniczynka. The influence of atmospheric circulation on the Iclp index was also analysed. The study used the circulation types as classified by Niedźwiedź (1981) in the Catalogue of atmospheric circulation for the Bydgoszcz-Toruń region (Przybylak and Maszewski 2009, 2013). The frequency of occurrence of individual circulation types was examined along with their influence on the predicted insulation of clothing in different seasons of the year and in an annual course. During the year, the highest mean value of Iclp (1.4 clo in Koniczynka) corresponded to cyclonic situations with northerly advection, whereas the lowest value (0.8 clo in Toruń and Koniczynka) was observed for the anticyclonic wedge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvection 3ainsulating materials 3aurban areas 0aatmospheric circulation 0apredicted insulation of clothing 0acyrkulacja atmosferyczna 0aToruń 0awarunki biometeorologiczne 0aprzewidywana termoizolacyjność odzieży 0aKoniczynka 0abiometeorological conditions1 aUscka-Kowalkowska, Joanna1 aKejna, Marek0 tAnnals of Warsaw University of Life Sciences, SGGW.g2015 Apr. 4, v. 47, no. 1 p.55-67dDe Gruyter Openx2081-96177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/sggw-2015-00053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02136naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245009300166300001600259520100100275592002801276650001701304650001301321650001101334650002301345650001501368653001901383653002101402653002301423653001801446653001801464653002201482653002401504653001901528773012801547856007801675852000901753655001201762IND60520820120221120130900.0160525e20150127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052082012DNAL7 a10.1515/sggw-2015-00082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCzajka, Agnieszka14aThe upper Odra as a case study of the impact of channel regulation on its morphodynamics  ap. 353-361.  aThe upper Odra as a case study of the impact of channel regulation on its morphodynamics. The aim of the research was to compare morphodynamics of the Odra river channel in three different sectors and to find the main difference in the way of sediment transport before and after regulation in meandering, straight and sinuous channel sectors and compare the data with those calculated for reconstructed, natural channel of the Odra river. Sediment transport in discussed sectors was compared for average, bankfull and flood discharges and it proceeds in different ways. Morphodynamics of the preregulated Odra was most similar to the one currently observed in the meandering section. Also the dynamics of bed-material transport and, consequently, the possibility of the occurrence and disappearance of channel forms is greatly varied among the studied sectors. As it was assumed, a diversified channel geometry imposes water flow, which entails a series of processes shaping the channel dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3ageometry 3arivers 3asediment transport 3awater flow 0amorphodynamics 0ariver regulation 0asediment transport 0ahydrogeometry 0amorfodynamika 0arzeka uregulowana 0atransport rumowiska 0ahydrogeometria0 tAnnals of Warsaw University of Life Sciences, SGGW.g2015 Jan. 27, v. 46, no. 4 p.353-361dDe Gruyter Openx2081-96177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/sggw-2015-00083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02046naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245011200164300001400276520088000290592002801170650001601198650002701214650001901241650001101260650002001271651001101291653002901302653001801331653001801349653003201367653002001399653001701419700002401436773012501460856007801585852000901663655001201672IND60520820420221120130751.0160525e20150404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052082042DNAL7 a10.1515/sggw-2015-00112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPopek, Zbigniew10aVariability of morphological conditions of the Vistula river channel in the section Czerwińsk-Kępa Polska  ap. 19-29.  aVariability of morphological conditions of the Vistula river channel in the section Czerwińsk-Kępa Polska.

An attempt was made to estimate the trends and rate of transformation of the following parameters in the river channel: width, length, and position of the riverbanks, abundance and size of islands and fluvial deposits, as well as their percentage in the total area of the main river channel and the floodplain area between levees.  aPublisher supplied data 3afloodplains 3aglaciofluvial deposits 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3astream channels 3aPoland 0ariver channel morphology 0abraided river 0aVistula river 0amorfologia koryta rzecznego 0arzeka roztokowa 0arzeka Wisła1 aWasilewicz, Michał0 tAnnals of Warsaw University of Life Sciences, SGGW.g2015 Apr. 4, v. 47, no. 1 p.19-29dDe Gruyter Openx2081-96177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/sggw-2015-00113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02339naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245011400166300001400280520092300294592002801217650002101245650001501266650002201281650001801303650001201321650001101333650001701344650001301361650000901374650001101383650000701394650001101401650001301412650002301425650000901448653002101457653001701478653001601495653001501511653002001526653002101546653001901567653001401586700002101600773012501621856007801746852000901824655001201833IND60520820520221120130746.0160525e20150404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052082052DNAL7 a10.1515/sggw-2015-00122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPawluk, Katarzyna10aRemoval of dissolved metals by activated carbon from road runoff in batch systems – equilibrium and kinetic  ap. 31-42.  aRemoval of dissolved metals by activated carbon from road runoff in batch systems – equilibrium and kinetic. Activated carbon is an effective sorbent for removing organic and inorganic contaminants from aqueous solutions. In conducted experiments, granulated activated carbon (GAC) was used to examine the adsorption processes of heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn). Studies (performed in batch system) were carried out as a function of time, heavy metals concentration and pH values. The obtained results show that GAC effectively removes mentioned metals. Numerous kinetic models were used to investigate the mechanism of adsorption processes. Using the Langmuir isotherm, the maximum adsorption capacities were calculated to be 3.010, 3.662, 4.430, 3.800 and 4.169 mg·g–¹ for Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn, respectively, in neutral conditions and 2.684, 2.578, 3.482, 2.592 and 2.253 mg·g–¹ in acidic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abatch systems 3acadmium 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3akinetics 3alead 3anickel 3apH 3arunoff 3asorbents 3asorption isotherms 3azinc 0aactivated carbon 0aheavy metals 0aroad runoff 0aadsorption 0awęgiel aktywny 0ametale ciężkie 0awody spływowe 0aadsorpcja1 aFronczyk, Joanna0 tAnnals of Warsaw University of Life Sciences, SGGW.g2015 Apr. 4, v. 47, no. 1 p.31-42dDe Gruyter Openx2081-96177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/sggw-2015-00123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01904naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002800144245009200172300001600264520074300280592002801023650001401051650002601065650000901091650001601100653003001116653004001146653002101186653003301207653004501240653002601285700002801311773012801339856007801467852000901545655001201554IND60520821320221122144621.0160525e20150710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052082132DNAL7 a10.1515/sggw-2015-00202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLipiński, Mirosław J.10aCapability and limitations in laboratory determination of stiffness parameters of soils  ap. 139-151.  aThe paper concerns laboratory methods for determination of soil stiffness. Major criterion for selection of analysed equipment is range of strain in which stiffness can be reliably determined. Substantially, various configurations of triaxial apparatus are referred to i.e. with standard cell and with the modified one. Additional system for internal measurement of strain is described and rational (based on test results) for use of it is presented. As to shear wave velocity measurement as a mean to obtain initial stiffness, requirements for proper measurement and interpretation was given. Finally, an approach to determine Poisson’s ratio on the basis of combined results of cyclic triaxial and resonant column tests was presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequipment 3alaboratory techniques 3asoil 3avelocimetry 0asoil stiffness parameters 0asmall and intermediate strain range 0alaboratory tests 0aparametry sztywności gruntu 0azakres małych i średnich odkształceń 0abadania laboratoryjne1 aWdowska, Małgorzata K.0 tAnnals of Warsaw University of Life Sciences, SGGW.g2015 July 10, v. 47, no. 2 p.139-151dDe Gruyter Openx2081-96177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/sggw-2015-00203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01933naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245008700161300001600248520056400264592002800828650001100856650001400867650001000881650001100891653001600902653000800918653001300926653001400939653002500953653002800978653002601006653004201032653003401074653001301108653001401121653002701135653003001162653002701192700001901219700002201238773012801260856007801388852000901466655001201475IND60520821720221122144641.0160525e20151014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052082172DNAL7 a10.1515/sggw-2015-00242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiczko, Adam10aExperimental and numerical investigation of non-submerged flow under a sluice gate  ap. 187-201.  aThe problem of sluice gate flow is analyzed using two models: a simplified one, derived according to the concept of the Potential Field (PF), and a more complex form, based on the Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. The numerical solution is compared with experimental data, including measurements performed by authors and results acquired from literature. Despite its simplicity, the PF model provides a satisfactory agreement with the measurements. The slightly worse performance of the RANS model comes from an overestimation of energy losses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aequations 3agates 3amodels 0asluice gate 0aCFD 0aOpenFoam 0ainterFoam 0aPotential Flow model 0acontraction coefficient 0adischarge coefficient 0aniezatopiony wypływ wody spod zasuwy 0anumeryczna mechanika płynów 0aOpenFoam 0ainterFoam 0aprzepływy potencjalne 0awspółczynnik kontrakcji 0awspółczynnik wydatku1 aKubrak, Janusz1 aKubrak, Elżbieta0 tAnnals of Warsaw University of Life Sciences, SGGW.g2015 Oct. 14, v. 47, no. 3 p.187-201dDe Gruyter Openx2081-96177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/sggw-2015-00243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01349naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011700155300001600272520032700288592002800615650002300643650002300666650001300689650001400702650001700716650002100733700001300754700002100767700001700788700001900805773010300824856007500927852000901002655001201011IND60578484420221122224137.0170813e20120203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057848442DNAL7 a10.1021/ol203275b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Liang10aSynthesis of Indolo [1,2-a]Quinoxalines via a Pd-Catalyzed Regioselective C–H Olefination/Cyclization Sequence  ap. 740-743.  aA highly efficient approach to indolo [1,2-a]quinoxaline derivatives through a Pd-catalyzed regioselective C–H olefination/cyclization sequence has been developed.

The symptoms and the percentage of mortality in animals infected were recorded. On the basis of the estimated parameters, the present study confirmed the existence of immunotypes among the strains of the RHD virus. However, the results did not indicate a connection between biological property of the RHD virus (haemagglutination capacity and generation of antigenic variants) and the immunological profile of the strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 3aabsorption 3agranulocytes 3ahemagglutination 3alysozyme 3amortality 3amyeloperoxidase 3anitroblue tetrazolium 3arabbits 3aviruses 0aNon-specific immunity 0aRabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 0aImmunotypes1 aDeptuła, Wiesław0 tOpen life sciences.g2010 Aug. 20, v. 5, no. 5 p.613-632dVersitax2391-54127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11535-010-0049-63Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02159naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245013300167300001400300520098800314592002801302650001701330650003101347650001501378650001201393650001101405650000901416650001201425650001201437653001501449653000801464653002701472653002401499700001801523700001901541773012601560856007801686852000901764655001201773IND60520823420221122221225.0160525e20160420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052082342DNAL7 a10.1515/sggw-2016-00032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZydroń, Tymoteusz10aAnalysis of rainfall-induced shallow landslides in Jamne and Jaszcze stream valleys (Polish Carpathians) – preliminary results  ap. 27-40.  aAnalysis of rainfall-induced shallow landslides in Jamne and Jaszcze stream valleys (Polish Carpathians) - preliminary results. Preliminary shallow landslide susceptibility mapping of the Jamne and Jaszcze stream valleys, located in the Polish Flysch Carpathians, is presented in the paper. For the purpose of mapping, there were used SINMAP and Iverson’s models integrating infiltration and slope stability calculations. The calibration of the used models parameters, obtained from limited field and laboratory tests, was performed using data from 8-9 July 1997, when as a consequence of a very intense rainfall, 94 shallow landslides were observed on meadows and arable lands. A comparison of the slope stability calculation results and the localisation of the noticed shallow landslides showed satisfactory agreement between localisation of the observed and computed unstable areas. However, it was concluded that better simulation results were obtained using Iverson’s model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarable soils 3alaboratory experimentation 3alandslides 3ameadows 3amodels 3arain 3astreams 3avalleys 0alandslides 0aGIS 0athe Flysch Carpathians 0athe Gorce Mountains1 aBucała, Anna1 aDemczuk, Piotr0 tAnnals of Warsaw University of Life Sciences, SGGW.g2016 Apr. 20, v. 48, no. 1 p.27-40dDe Gruyter Openx2081-96177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/sggw-2016-00033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01162naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245007900159300001600238520030800254592002800562650002300590650002300613650002100636650002200657700001800679773010300697856007500800852000900875655001200884IND60578485820221123023655.0170813e20120203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057848582DNAL7 a10.1021/ol20333062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbero, Nekane10aLigand-Free Ni-Catalyzed Reductive Cleavage of Inert Carbon–Sulfur Bonds  ap. 796-799.  aA catalytic reductive cleavage of C(sp²)– and C(sp³)–SMe bonds under ligandless conditions is presented.

C. canadensis is known to possess a broad set of pharmacological effects because of content of various antioxidants, antiplatelet and anticoagulant compounds. The aim of our study was to assess if this extract protects plasma proteins against oxidative/nitrative damages induced by ONOO−. The plasma components are continuously exposed to reactive oxygen/nitrogen species action. Peroxynitrite evokes oxidative stress and induces undesirable effects in biological systems and causes damage to biomolecules. The extract from Conyza (50–2500 mg/ml) caused a dose-dependent reduction of protein nitration by 90%. The oxidation of plasma proteins was diminished by about 75%. ONOO− oxidized the plasma thiol groups and this process was inhibited by tested extract. The level of reduced protein thiols was increased thrice at the lowest concentration of extract (50 mg/ml). The highest concentration of extract decreased twice the level of protein thiols in reduced forms and increased the homocysteine level about 4.5 times. The obtained results demonstrated that the extract from Conyza possesses antioxidative properties in vitro, protects plasma proteins against toxicity induced by peroxynitrite and has modulating effects on thiol/disulfide redox status.  aPublisher supplied data 3aConyza canadensis 3aadverse effects 3aanticoagulants 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3ablood proteins 3adose response 3ahomocysteine 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3athiols 3atoxicity 0aCarbonyl groups 0aConyza canadensis 0aNitrotyrosine 0aPeroxynitrite 0aPlasma 0aThiols1 aOlas, Beata1 aNowak, Paweł1 aWachowicz, Barbara1 aBald, Edward1 aGłowacki, Rafał1 aPawlaczyk, Izabela1 aGancarz, Roman0 tOpen life sciences.g2010 Sept. 23, v. 5, no. 6 p.800-807dVersitax2391-54127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11535-010-0065-63Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02542naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245015100163300001600314520115800330592002801488650002601516650000901542650002101551650001601572650001301588650001001601650001601611650001101627650001301638650000901651650001601660650001201676651001801688651001101706653001401717653001301731653001301744653002001757653001401777653001301791653002601804700001601830700001501846773009601861856008201957852000902039655001202048IND60520824220221122224909.0200609e20080201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052082422DNAL7 a10.2478/v10208-011-0006-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoshino, T.10aSnow mold fungus, Typhula ishikariensis group III, in Arctic Norway can grow at a sub-lethal temperature after freezing stress and during flooding  ap. 125-131.  aIsolates of the snow mold fungus Typhula ishikariensis group III, which is predominant in Finnmark (northern Norway) and Svalbard, are more resistant to freezing stress than group I isolates from the southern part of Norway. Group III isolates showed irregular growth on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates when subjected to heat stress at 10°C. However, group III isolates showed relatively good growth on PDA at 10°C after freezing treatment. The optimal temperatures for mycelial growth were 5°C on PDA and 10°C in potato dextrose broth (PDB), and group III isolates showed normal mycelial growth at 10°C in PDB. Mycelium of group III isolates cultivated in water poured into PDA plates, and normal hyphal extension was observed only in the liquid media. Hyphal growth became irregular when mycelia had extended above the surface of the liquid media. These results suggested that group III isolates can grow at a sub-lethal temperature after freezing stress and during flooding. Soil freezing and thawing occurs regularly in the Arctic, and physiological characteristics of group III isolates are well adapted to climatic conditions in the Arctic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTyphula ishikariensis 3aagar 3aclimatic factors 3acold stress 3afreezing 3afungi 3aheat stress 3ahyphae 3amycelium 3asoil 3atemperature 3athawing 3aArctic region 3aNorway 0agroup III 0aFinnmark 0aflooding 0afreezing stress 0asnow mold 0aSvalbard 0aTyphula ishikariensis1 aTronsmo, A.1 aYumoto, I.0 tSommerfeltia.g2008 Feb. 01, v. 31, no. 1 p.125-131dVersitawJournal:2053x2084-00987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10208-011-0006-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01394naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245008300152300001600235520033400251592002800585650002300613650002300636650001700659650001900676650000900695650001200704650002200716700001500738700001600753700001700769700001600786700001700802700001400819773010300833856007500936852000901011655001201020IND60578486420221123010439.0170813e20120203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057848642DNAL7 a10.1021/ol20334772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xing12aA “Turn-on” Fluorescent Hg2+ Chemosensor Based on Ferrier Carbocyclization  ap. 820-823.  aA “turn-on” fluorescent chemosensor with excellent selectivity and satisfactory sensitivity on Hg²⁺ detection in 100% water media has been established employing a carbohydrate based Ferrier carbocyclization reaction.

In Slovakia, observation of an adult male shows its fidelity of to the breeding territory even after 6 or 7 years; another male has in his 5th year been nesting 18 km from the site he hatched at. The next observation in Slovakia is represented by a 3 year old non-breeding individual which occured 50 km from the site he hatched at. The final record was of a year old individual that stayed 40 km from the site he originated from.

Sealworms are a cause for concern because they can infect humans who consume raw or undercooked fish. However, despite their economic and zoonotic importance, morphological and molecular characterization of species of Pseudoterranova in South America is still scarce. METHODS: A total of 542 individual fish from 20 species from the Patagonian coast of Argentina were examined for sealworms. The body cavity, the muscles, internal organs, and the mesenteries were examined to detect nematodes. Sealworm larvae were removed from their capsules and fixed in 70% ethanol. For molecular identification, partial fragments of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox 1) were amplified for 10 isolates from 4 fish species. Morphological and morphometric data of sealworms were also obtained. RESULTS: A total of 635 larvae were collected from 12 fish species. The most infected fish was Prionotus nudigula, followed by Percophis brasiliensis, Acanthistius patachonicus, Paralichthys isosceles, and Pseudopercis semifasciata. Sequences obtained for the cox 1 of sealworms from A. patachonicus, P. isosceles, P. brasiliensis and P. nudigula formed a reciprocally monophyletic lineage with published sequences of adult specimens of Pseudoterranova cattani from the South American sea lion Otaria flavescens, and distinct from the remaining 5 species of Pseudoterranova. A morphological description, including drawings and scanning electron microscopy photomicrographs of these larvae is provided. Sealworms collected from Argentinean fishes did not differ in their diagnostic traits from the previously described larvae of P. cattani. However a discriminant analysis suggests that specimens from P. nudigula were significantly larger than those from other fishes. Most of the sealworms were collected encapsulated from the muscles and, to a lesser degree, from the mesenteries and the liver. CONCLUSIONS: We provided the first molecular identification, morphological description and microhabitat characterization of sealworm larvae from the Argentinean Patagonian coast. We also reported the infection levels of sealworms on 20 fish species in order to elucidate the life cycle of these nematodes in this area.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOtariidae 3aParalichthys 3aPrionotus nudigula 3aPseudopercis semifasciata 3aPseudoterranova decipiens 3aadults 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3adiscriminant analysis 3aeconomics 3aethanol 3agenes 3ahumans 3alarvae 3aliver 3amarine fish 3amicrohabitats 3amonophyly 3amorphometry 3amuscles 3ascanning electron microscopy 2aAnimal Structuresxparasitology 2aAnimals 2aAscaridida Infectionsxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aAscaridoideaxanatomy & histologyxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA, Helminthxchemistryxgenetics. 2aElectron Transport Complex IVxgenetics 2aFishesxparasitology 2aLarvaxanatomy & histologyxclassificationxgenetics. 2aMicroscopy 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aArgentina 0aArgentina1 aAznar, Francisco J1 aBlasco-Costa, Isabel1 aGarcía, Néstor A1 aVíllora-Montero, María1 aCrespo, Enrique A1 aRaga, Juan A1 aMontero, Francisco E0 tParasites & vectors.g2013 Dec., v. 6, no. 1 p.252-252dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-6-2523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01738naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245008100172300001400253520054700267592002800814650001500842650001400857650002200871650002100893650001700914650001200931650000900943650001200952650001800964650001200982650001100994650001601005650002501021653001201046653002201058653000901080653001301089700001701102773009501119856008101214852000901295655001201304IND60520826120221121034600.0160525e20120704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052082612DNAL7 a10.2478/v10262-012-0021-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKečkéšová, Lucia14aThe diet of the Common Kestrel in the urban environment of the city of Nitra  ap. 81-85.  aThe diet of the urban Common Kestrel population was studied in Nitra during 2003-2005.

Changes in the concentration and activities of enzymes, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehyderogenase (G6PDH), lactate dehyderogenase (LDH), DNA damage and lipid peroxidation (LPO), can be used as biomarkers to identify possible environmental contamination in fish. This study aimed to investigate the impact of UVA on the activity of the selected enzymes, DNA damage and LPO during early developmental stages of the African catfish Clarias gariepinus. Embryo hemogenates were used for measurements of G6PDH, LDH, DNA damage and LPO concentrations and activities spectrophotometrically at 37°C. The normal ontogenetic variations in enzyme activities, DNA damage and LPO of the early developmental stages (24–168 h-PFS; hours-post fertilization stage) were studied. There was a significant decrease in the activity of G6PDH till 120 h-PFS. Then after 120 h-PFS, the activity of such enzymes insignificantly increased toward higher stages. The LDH activity was recorded with a pattern of decrease till 96 h-PFS, followed by a significant increase toward 168 h-PFS. The polynomial pattern of variations in DNA damage and LPO was also evident. The patterns of the enzyme activities, corresponding DNA damage and LPO of the early ontogenetic stages under the influence of three different UVA doses (15, 30 and 60 min), were recorded. The pattern of variations in G6PDH activity in UVA-induced groups was similar to that of the control group with variation in the magnitude of such activity. In all treated groups, LDH activity decreased till 96 h-PFS, then increased till 168 h-PFS. Within each of the embryonic stages, the increase in UVA led to a significant increase in DNA damage. A significant increase in lipid peroxidation under UVA doses was recorded. The variability in number and molecular weight of proteins under exposure to UVA was evident, reflecting some of the genetic and transcriptional changes during exposure and development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aproteins 3aDNA damage 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3amolecular weight 3abiomarkers 3adevelopmental stages 3alipid peroxidation 3aontogeny 3atranscription (genetics) 3aClarias gariepinus 3apollution 3acatfish 3aglucose 6-phosphate 3aenzyme activity 3aultraviolet radiation 2aAnimals 2aCatfishesxembryologyxmetabolism. 2aComet Assay 2aDNA Fragmentationxradiation effects 2aGlucosephosphate Dehydrogenasexmetabolism 2aIsoenzymesxmetabolism 2aL-Lactate Dehydrogenasexmetabolism 2aLipid Peroxidationxradiation effects 2aTime Factors 2aUltraviolet Raysxadverse effects 0aEgypt 0aglucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase1 aMahmoud, UsamaM.1 aOsman, AlaaG.1 aSayed, AlaaEl-Din H.0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2010 Sept., v. 36, no. 3 p.605-626dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870056x0920-17427nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-009-9334-63Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01611naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245008400163300001600247520046500263592002800728650002300756650002300779650002900802650001600831650001400847650001600861650003700877700002600914700002000940700002200960700002200982700002601004700002001030773010301050856007501153852000901228655001201237IND60578488820221121194454.0170813e20120203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057848882DNAL7 a10.1021/ol203432x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolander, Lauren E.10aStannyl Derivatives of Naphthalene Diimides and Their Use in Oligomer Synthesis  ap. 918-921.  a2-Stannyl and 2,6-distannyl naphthalene diimides (NDIs) can be synthesized through the palladium-catalyzed reaction of the appropriate bromo derivatives with hexabutylditin.

(Clusiaceae). The two woody perennials co-occur on a neotropical inselberg in French Guiana. I studied whether the two congeners, which differ in ecological amplitudes, also differ in effectiveness of sexual regeneration and survival strategies, as suggested by previous evidence from different ecosystems. Animal dispersal, secondary removal, germination, seedling mortality and juvenile distribution were examined in an inselberg specialist (Clusia blattophila) and a species with a broader ecological amplitude (Clusia nemorosa). Habitat heterogeneity was accounted for. The two species differed in parameters of individual recruitment stages such as preservation of seed germinability, seedling mortality and juvenile distribution. C. blattophila, the inselberg specialist, suffered high losses during the whole recruitment process and had low juvenile density in spite of its large cover and dominance in the shrub patches. Survival is effected by individual persistence and supported by extensive vegetative growth. C. nemorosa has inefficient primary dispersal and high seedling mortality, but exhibits higher germination rate, higher preservation of seed germinability and numerous juveniles in the community. This suggests that sexual reproduction is important for C. nemorosa, but the ability to reproduce is limited due to the ecosystem characteristics. Microhabitat heterogeneity affected most recruitment stages, but the most suitable sites were not concordant across the recruitment stages. The highest juvenile density of both species occurred in shrub patches. From the long-term perspective of both species, this results in a limited ability to colonize open microhabitats, which may limit succession towards the edaphic climax.  aPublisher supplied data 3agermination 3aperennials 3aseeds 3ashrubs 3aseedlings 3amicrohabitats 3avegetative growth 3asexual reproduction 3aecosystems 3aClusia 3amortality 3ajuveniles 3aFrench Guiana 0arecruitment0 tPlant ecology.g2013 Feb., v. 214, no. 2 p.279-290dSpringer-Verlagx1385-02377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-013-0167-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006600168300001600234520149800250592002801748650002601776650001101802650001901813650001701832650001501849650001601864650001301880650001901893650001001912650001301922650001801935650001401953650002601967651001501993700002702008700002202035700002202057700002502079700001802104700002502122773009302147856008102240852000902321655001202330IND50069733120221121034213.0150209e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006973312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-013-9830-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNold, Stephen C.10aUnderwater sinkhole sediments sequester Lake Huron’s carbon  ap. 235-250.  aLake Huron’s submerged sinkhole habitats are impacted by high-conductivity groundwater that allows photosynthetic cyanobacterial mats to form over thick, carbon-rich sediments. To better understand nutrient cycling in these habitats, we measured the stable isotopic content of carbon and nitrogen in organic and inorganic carbon pools in Middle Island sinkhole, a ~23 m deep feature influenced by both groundwater and overlying lake water. Two distinct sources of dissolved CO₂(DIC) were available to primary producers. Lake water DIC (δ¹³C = −0.1 ‰) differed by +5.9 ‰ from groundwater DIC (δ¹³C = −6.0 ‰). Organic carbon fixed by primary producers reflected the two DIC sources. Phytoplankton utilizing lake water DIC were more enriched in¹³C (δ¹³C = −22.2 to −23.2 ‰) than mat cyanobacteria utilizing groundwater DIC (δ¹³C = −26.3 to −30.0 ‰). Sinkhole sediments displayed an isotopic signature (δ¹³C = −23.1 ‰) more similar to sedimenting phytoplankton than the cyanobacterial mat. Corroborated by sediment C/N ratios, these data suggest that the carbon deposited in sinkhole sediments originates primarily from planktonic rather than benthic sources.²¹⁰Pb/¹³⁷Cs radiodating suggests rapid sediment accumulation and sub-bottom imaging indicated a massive deposit of organic carbon beneath the sediment surface. We conclude that submerged sinkholes may therefore act as nutrient sinks within the larger lake ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sinks 3aecosystems 3agroundwater 3ahabitats 3aimage analysis 3alakes 3anitrogen 3aphytoplankton 3asediments 3atrophic relationships 3aLake Huron1 aBellecourt, Michael J.1 aKendall, Scott T.1 aRuberg, Steven A.1 aSanders, T.

A multiple lines of evidence approach involving catchment-, and stream reach-scale investigations were undertaken to describe the factors that influence pore water biogeochemical processes. At the catchment-scale gaining stream reaches were identified from water table mapping and groundwater discharge estimated to be between 0.1 and 0.8 m³ m⁻² d⁻¹from baseflow analysis. Sediment temperature profiles also suggested that the high groundwater discharge limited stream water infiltration into the sediments. At the stream reach-scale, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations were higher in stream water than in groundwater. However, DOC and DON concentrations were greatest in sediment pore water. This suggests that biodegradation of sediment organic matter contributes dissolved organic matter (DOM) to the streams along with that delivered with groundwater flow. Pore water ammonium (NH₄⁺) was closely associated with areas of high pore water DOM concentrations and evidence of sulfate (SO₄²⁻) reduction (low concentration and SO₄:Cl ratio). This indicates that anoxic DOM mineralization was occurring associated with SO₄²⁻reduction. However the distribution of anoxic mineralization was limited to the center of the streambed, and was not constrained by the distribution of sediment organic matter which was higher along the banks. Lower sediment temperatures measured along the banks compared to the center suggests, at least qualitatively, that groundwater discharge is higher along the banks. Based on this evidence anoxic mineralization is influenced by groundwater residence time, and is only measurable along the center of the stream where groundwater flux rates are lower. This study therefore shows that the distribution of biogeochemical processes in stream sediments, such as anoxic mineralization, is strongly influenced by both the biogeochemical conditions and pore water residence time.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3adissolved organic nitrogen 3amineralization 3atemperature profiles 3astream channels 3agroundwater flow 3abase flow 3adissolved organic carbon 3abiodegradation 3asummer 3agroundwater 3awater table 0anitrogen1 aBarron, Olga V.0 tBiogeochemistry.g2013 Oct., v. 115, no. 1-3 p.267-286dSpringer-Verlagx0168-25637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-013-9833-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01991naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245017300171300001400344520078200358592002801140650001801168650001701186650001001203650000901213650001801222650001401240650001201254650001601266651001301282653001801295653002701313653002601340653000901366653001701375700001601392773009501408856008101503852000901584655001201593IND60520827320221121034518.0160525e20120705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052082732DNAL7 a10.2478/v10262-012-0033-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDravecký, Miroslav10aContribution to the knowledge on the synanthropization and dietary specialization of the Ural Owl (Strix uralensis) in urban environment of Košice city (East Slovakia)  ap. 51-60.  aS. uralensis is a typical silvatic species, specialized for this life style through its biology and diet. Synanthropization is a rare phenomenon in this species, reflected in the changes of diet and hunting strategies, adapting to the characteristics of the urban environment. Between November 22, 1993 and June 2, 1994, an individual of the Ural Owl was observed 39 times in the urban areas of Košice city. The examination of the pellets revealed that the Ural Owl specialized in hunting Streptopelia decaocto (76.7%) and Columba livia f. domestica (13.4%). These results were confirmed by observations of S. uralensis hunting S. decaocto. This discovery is the first direct evidence of S. uralensis diet adaptation to S. decaocto and feral C. livia f. domestica in Slovakia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColumba livia 3aStreptopelia 3aStrix 3adiet 3aferal animals 3alifestyle 3apellets 3aurban areas 3aSlovakia 0aurban habitat 0aEurasian Collared Dove 0aStreptopelia decaocto 0adiet 0aurbanization1 aObuch, Ján0 tSlovak raptor journal.g2012 July 5, v. 3 p.51-60dVersitawJournal:23175x1338-72277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10262-012-0033-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01407naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012600157300001600283520031500299592002800614650002300642650002100665650001300686650001300699650001700712700002200729700003000751700002200781700002100803700002400824700002200848773010300870856007500973852000901048655001201057IND60578489520221121194340.0170813e20120203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057848952DNAL7 a10.1021/ol300003f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViaud, Pierre10aElectrochemical Cleavage of Sulfonamides: An Efficient and Tunable Strategy to Prevent β-Fragmentation and Epimerization  ap. 942-945.  aThe electrochemical reduction of sensitive sulfonamides is described.

The results show the following: (1) Bentonite is K-bentonite, mainly composed of clay mineral (illite–montmorillonite mixed layer and illite) and amorphous body, containing a certain content of quartz, feldspar, pyrite, and carbonate minerals in Wufeng–Longmaxi Formation. (2) Bentonite is rhyodacite dacite–andesite, and its protomagma is basic-neutral. (3) Bentonite is rich in Th, U, Cs, and Co but low in Cr, Ni, and Ta. Its partition diagram of rare earth elements leans to the right, rich in light rare earth elements but low in heavy rare earth elements, presenting a slight Eu negative anomaly. (4) Primordial magma eruption of bentonite occurred in a volcanic arc environment, speculated to be related to the volcanic eruptions on the edge of the continent after post-collision proliferation between Cathaysia and Yangtze Plates during the Late Ordovician to the Early Silurian period. (5) The main influence of bentonite on the shale reservoir is its controlling effect on organic matter enrichment in the Wufeng–Longmaxi Formation. Moderate volcanic activity (thickness of bentonite is 1–2 cm) can promote algal blooming to improve the paleo-ocean productivity and lead to the formation of high TOC. On the contrary, if the volcano is less active (thickness of bentonite is <1 cm) or overactive (thickness of bentonite is >2 cm), the productivity improvement of the paleo-ocean would be restrained and TOC would drop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrdovician period 3aSilurian period 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalgal blooms 3abasins 3abentonite 3acarbonate minerals 3acesium 3achromium 3aclay 3acobalt 3afeldspar 3aillite 3anickel 3aporosity 3apyrite 3aquartz 3arare earth elements 3ashale 3atantalum 3athorium 3atotal organic carbon 3auranium 3avolcanic activity 3aChina1 aWang, Gaoxiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0881-86861 aYang, Yang1 aJing, Cui1 aChen, Man1 aTan, Xiucheng0 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Nov. 14, v. 33, no. 12 p.12366-12373dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b035103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006300146245015000209300002000359520144800379592002801827650000801855650000801863650003601871650002401907650001301931650002501944650001901969650001401988650001202002650002302014650001502037650003102052650000702083650002202090650001302112650001702125650002202142700002502164700006302189700006402252773013802316856008002454852000902534655001202543IND60678984420221118063150.0191219e20191112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067898442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b071482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGolyshev, Victor M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0521-622810aStructure and Hybridization Properties of Glycine Morpholine Oligomers in Complexes with DNA and RNA: Experimental and Molecular Dynamics Studies  ap. 10571-10581.  aMethylenecarboxamide (glycine) morpholine oligomers (gMOs) with a modified backbone are new and promising nucleic acid analogues. In this work, a combination of circular dichroism spectroscopy, optical melting, and molecular dynamics simulations was used to investigate hybridization properties of gMOs, as well as the structure and dynamics of their tandem complexes with DNA and RNA. It was shown that the structure of nucleic acids in modified complexes is similar to that of the fully native analogues. The energies of binding and cooperative interactions at the helix–helix interface in the nick were determined experimentally and by computer simulation analysis. Here, we found for the first time, the possibility to determine and predict precisely the thermodynamic parameters of complementary complex formation using the original experimental and computer simulation approaches. It was shown that the use of simulation data in the explicit solvent and the molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann (or generalized Born) surface area methods for the calculation of the hybridization enthalpy makes it possible to evaluate the thermal stability of DNA and gMO tandem duplexes with DNA or RNA with an unexpectedly high accuracy. We found that at high ionic strength and neutral pH, the observed thermal stability of the gMO/RNA tandem complex is similar to that of DNA/DNA and lower than that of gMO/DNA which is close to that of DNA/RNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRNA 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acomputer simulation 3aenthalpy 3aglycine (amino acid) 3aionic strength 3amechanics 3amelting 3amolecular dynamics 3amorpholine 3anucleic acid hybridization 3apH 3asimulation models 3asolvents 3asurface area 3athermal stability1 aAbramova, Tatyana V.1 aPyshnyi, Dmitrii V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2587-37191 aLomzov, Alexander A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3889-94640 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Nov. 12, v. 123, no. 50 p.10571-10581dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b071483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245018500186300001600371500001500387520152300402592002801925650002901953650001401982650004401996650001102040650001902051650001702070650004302087650001902130650001202149650001502161650003002176650001702206650001802223650001502241650002202256650001102278650002102289650001802310650001502328653002902343700002202372700003202394700002202426700001602448773011202464856008202576852000902658655001202667IND60120099620221123032133.0190128e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012009962DNAL7 a252608922pmid7 a10.1007/s12033-014-9807-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, Arabinda10aRecovery and Purification of Oligosaccharides from Copra Meal by Recombinant Endo-β-mannanase and Deciphering Molecular Mechanism Involved and Its Role as Potent Therapeutic Agent  ap. 111-127.  a2019-12-04  aProduction of manno-oligosaccharides (MOSs) from pretreated and defatted copra meal (dFCO) hydrolysis was achieved by endo-mannanase. Structural characterization of dFCO by FT-IR and NMR exhibited resemblance with galactomannan. The time-dependent hydrolysis of dFCO by recombinant endo-β-(1 → 4)-mannanase of Clostridium thermocellum by TLC and HPAEC displayed the release of mannose and MOSs mannobiose and mannotriose. Purified MOSs yielded 40 % mannobiose and 18 % mannotriose confirmed by mass spectroscopy which showed mannobiose (m/z = 365) and mannotriose (m/z = 527). The homology based structural analysis of catalytic endo-mannanase (CtManT) showed the catalytic core composed of Glu181 and Glu300 acting as acid/base and Glu288 as a nucleophile during galactomannan hydrolysis. Sub-site mapping of CtManT exhibited two aglycone and four glycone sites at cleavage sites existing on either side of β-(1 → 4)-linkage of galactomannan. Isolated MOSs displayed potential prebiotic characteristics and supported higher growth of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis than with standard inulin. Moreover, MOSs displayed over 97 % tolerance to simulated gastric juice, intestinal fluid, and α-amylase proving its potential as a stable prebiotic over inulin. In vitro cytotoxicity assay of MOSs (500 µg/mL) on human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (HT-29) demonstrated 60 % decreased viability of cells after 48 h displaying anti-tumorigenic property.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium thermocellum 3aviability 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ahumans 3aadenocarcinoma 3acytotoxicity 3aBifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis 3agalactomannans 3amannose 3aprobiotics 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3acoconut meal 3agastric juice 3ahydrolysis 3amass spectrometry 3ainulin 3aoligosaccharides 3aalpha-amylase 3aprebiotics 0aBifidobacterium infantis1 aVerma, Anil Kumar1 aTingirikari, Jaganmohan Rao1 aShukla, Rishikesh1 aGoyal, Arun0 tMolecular biotechnology.g2015 Feb., v. 57, no. 2 p.111-127dSpringer USwJournal:jnl52132x1073-60857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-014-9807-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02405naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012800173300001600301520094000317592002801257650003401285650001301319650001201332650002601344650001701370650001901387650001601406650001301422650001301435650001901448650002001467650001901487650001601506650002701522650001001549650002201559650000901581650002501590653001301615653003301628653002601661653001801687773012401705856008501829852000901914655001201923IND60601726120221118233854.0180706e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060172612DNAL7 a10.1016/S1875-5364(14)60102-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmadvand, Hassan10aAmelioration of altered antioxidant enzyme activity by Satureja khuzistanica essential oil in alloxan-induced diabetic rats  ap. 672-676.  aTo examine the possible protective effect of Satureja khuzistanica essential oil (SKE) on antioxidant enzyme activity in alloxan-induced Type 1 diabetic rats.Thirty Sprague-Dawley male rats were divided into three groups randomly; group one as control, group two diabetic, with no treatment, and group three treatment with SKE at 500 ppm in drinking water, respectively. Diabetes was induced in the second and third groups by alloxan injection subcutaneously. After eight weeks, animals were anaesthetized. Blood samples were also collected before killing to measure antioxidant enzymes activity.SKE significantly increased the serum level of glutathione and the serum activity of glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase in the treated group compared with the diabetic untreated group.The findings showed that SKE exerts beneficial effects on the antioxidant enzymes activity in alloxan-induced Type 1 diabetic rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aSatureja 3aalloxan 3aanimal disease models 3aantioxidants 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acatalase 3adiabetes 3adrinking water 3aenzyme activity 3aessential oils 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3amales 3aprotective effect 3arats 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aDiabetes 0aAntioxidant enzyme activity; 0aSatureja khuzistanica 0aEssential oil0 tChinese journal of natural medicines.g2014 Sept., v. 12, no. 9 p.672-676dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6169x1875-53647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1875-5364(14)60102-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245009600186300001600282520129500298592002801593650000801621650001501629650001601644650001701660650001301677650001401690650004301704650001401747700002901761700002001790700002001810773011201830856008201942852000902024655001202033IND60120100020221120215913.0190128e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012010002DNAL7 a253111162pmid7 a10.1007/s12033-014-9811-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanero, Julieta10aAbsolute qPCR for Measuring Telomere Length in Bone Marrow Samples of Plasma Cell Disorders  ap. 155-159.  aTelomere length (TL) is currently used as an emerging biomarker in understanding the development/progression of hematological malignancies. The absolute quantitative PCR (qPCR) methodology has allowed the study of TL from a variety of mammalian tissues, but it has not been tested for bone marrow (BM) samples. In this study, we have examined the relationship between TL data generated by absolute qPCR versus those obtained by terminal restriction fragments (TRF) in 102 BM samples from patients with plasma cell disorders. A significant linear correlation between both methodologies was observed (p < 0.0001; r ² = 0.70). Results were also analyzed in relation to clinical characteristics and significant associations between telomere shortening and parameters of adverse prognosis were observed. Furthermore, another set of 47 BM samples from patients with low quantity of DNA for TRF assay were suitably analyzed by qPCR, indicating the usefulness of the absolute qPCR methodology for the inclusion of patients with scarce material to the study. Taken together, these findings are of interest considering the importance of telomere dysfunction in the pathogenesis of cancer and give a new alternative to measure TL in hematologic disorders with substantial time and cost savings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiomarkers 3abone marrow 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aprognosis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atelomeres1 aO’Callaghan, Nathan J.1 aFenech, Michael1 aSlavutsky, Irma0 tMolecular biotechnology.g2015 Feb., v. 57, no. 2 p.155-159dSpringer USwJournal:jnl52132x1073-60857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-014-9811-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005500146245010800201300002000309520144200329592002801771650002501799650001701824650001801841650002401859650001301883650001801896650001501914650001101929650002301940650001301963650001901976700001801995700001702013700005702030773013802087856008102225852000902306655001202315IND60678986020221118063245.0220113e20191125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067898602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b089122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVo, Quan V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7189-958410aAntioxidant Activities of Monosubstituted Indolinonic Hydroxylamines: A Thermodynamic and Kinetic Study  ap. 10672-10679.  aIndolinonic hydroxylamine (IH) is known as a potential artificial antioxidant in apolar environments. Here, a library of 108 monosubstituted derivatives was screened in silico to identify a lead compound for increased antioxidant activity, following a strategy of shortlisting based on thermochemical and kinetic properties. It was found that the presence of substituents at the 2, 4, and 7 positions increased, while substituents in other positions decreased the BDE(O–H) values, in good correlation to the electron-donating ability of substituents. Among the studied compounds, the N and 5 amine-substituted derivatives have the lowest BDE(O–H) values (62.4–64.0 kcal mol–¹). The presence of the strong electron-withdrawing substituents can decrease the proton affinities of the derivatives, whereas the decrease of ionization energies correlates to the electron-donating ability of the substituents. It was also found that the formal hydrogen transfer (FHT) mechanism is the favored pathway for the HOO· radical scavenging. Kinetic calculations showed that the rate constant of the reaction between N-NHMe-IH compound and HOO· radical following the FHT mechanism (k = 3.00 × 10⁷ M–¹ s–¹) is about 8223 and 5253 times higher than those of Trolox and ascorbic acid, respectively, in the pentyl ethanoate solvent. Thus, N-NHMe-IH is expected to be the most powerful antioxidant reported to date in lipid environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3acomputer simulation 3ahydrogen 3ahydroxylamine 3aionization 3alipids 3aphysical chemistry 3asolvents 3athermodynamics1 aGon, Tran Van1 aBay, Mai Van1 aMechler, Adam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6428-67600 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Nov. 25, v. 123, no. 50 p.10672-10679dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b089123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245014300205300002000348520157000368592002801938650000801966650002701974650001902001650002302020650002402043650001402067650002202081650001302103650001902116700006102135700006602196773013802262856008002400852000902480655001202489IND60678986720221118063311.0191219e20191121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067898672DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b094782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez, Carla P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9154-236010aComputationally Modeling Electrostatic Binding Energetics in a Crowded, Dynamic Environment: Physical Insights from a Peptide–DNA System  ap. 10718-10734.  aThe cell is a crowded place, and it may be crucial at times to account for the local environment when studying determinants of molecular recognition. In this work, we use continuum electrostatics calculations on snapshots extracted from molecular dynamics simulations to understand how various aspects of a crowded environment affect electrostatic binding energies between the antimicrobial peptide buforin II and DNA. By comparing multiple models for representing crowding, sequentially introducing layers of model complexity for maximum control, we explore how electrostatic binding energetics depend on crowder physical properties, the sampling of the binding partners and crowder molecules, and the treatment of bulk solvent. We show that physical characteristics can combine to create an interplay of competing effects in this highly charged system. For example, increased ionic strength screening due to crowding partially cancels out the reduced solvent screening due to water depletion. We also quantify the effect of crowders’ charge distributions on binding energetics. While we focus on electrostatic effects of crowding on binding, we begin to consider nonpolar components as well, and we implement a thermodynamic cycle accounting for both bound and unbound states to show the necessity of adequate crowder sampling in future studies. The insights developed here provide a rich starting point for experiments to further explore these competing effects and, ultimately, to rationally modulate molecular recognition in the complex cellular environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aionic strength 3amolecular dynamics 3aphysical properties 3ascreening 3asimulation models 3asolvents 3athermodynamics1 aElmore, Donald E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8723-87101 aRadhakrishnan, Mala L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5434-36960 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Nov. 21, v. 123, no. 50 p.10718-10734dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b094783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006000146245008600206300002000292520158500312592002801897650002201925650001201947650001101959650001201970650001501982650002301997650001402020650001302034650001102047650002002058650001702078700002402095700005702119773013802176856008002314852000902394655001202403IND60678986920200514000000.0191219e20191202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067898692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b096942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuchner, Richard1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3029-127810aSystematic Variations of Ion Hydration in Aqueous Alkali Metal Fluoride Solutions  ap. 10868-10876.  aAqueous solutions of three alkali metal fluorides—NaF, KF, and CsF—have been studied by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) over the frequency range 0.2 ≲ ν/GHz ≤ 89 at 25 °C and at concentrations 0.05 ≲ c/mol L–¹ ≲ 1. The combination of these measurements with analogous literature data for RbF(aq) and M′Cl(aq) (M′ = Li, Na, K, and Cs) made possible a systematic analysis of the hydration of F– and the alkali metal cations. Unlike the other halide ions, F– was found to have a well-defined hydration shell which contains ∼7 water molecules, consistent with the appearance of a “slow”-water mode at ∼10 GHz in the spectra. Limiting total effective hydration numbers (Zₜ⁰) for M′F(aq), obtained from the solvent-related modes, did not follow a simple sequence, varying in the order CsF < NaF < RbF < KF. However, it is shown that this anomalous sequence results from subtle variations in the strength of the M′⁺–OH₂ bonding. Thus, it was established that Zᵢb⁰(M′⁺) values, corresponding to the numbers of strongly (“irrotationally”) bound (ib) water molecules around the cations, do vary with charge density in the order Li⁺ ≫ Na⁺ > K⁺ > Rb⁺ > Cs⁺. It was also found that Zₛ⁰(M′⁺), the number of moderately bound (“slow”) water molecules, varied in the same order: K⁺ > Rb⁺ > Cs⁺. However, the presence of ib water molecules in the hydration shells of Li⁺ and Na⁺ attenuates their further interaction with surrounding water molecules such that Zₛ⁰(M′⁺) ≈ 0 for both ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acations 3acesium 3alithium 3ametal ions 3aphysical chemistry 3apotassium 3arubidium 3asodium 3asodium fluoride 3aspectroscopy1 aWächter, Wolfgang,1 aHefter, Glenn1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9388-27830 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Dec. 02, v. 123, no. 50 p.10868-10876dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b096943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04116naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014100167300001600308520207300324592002802397650003102425650003402456650002302490650001802513650003102531650002002562650001602582650001802598650003802616650001902654650004302673650001602716650002202732650001802754650001102772650001602783650000902799650001402808650001202822650001302834650002502847650003202872650001502904651001402919653002302933653001802956653001902974653002202993653003803015700001703053700001403070700001903084700001703103700001903120700001303139700001303152700001503165700001503180700001703195773012403212856008503336852000903421655001203430IND60601727420221118233705.0180706e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060172742DNAL7 a10.1016/S1875-5364(14)60115-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJI, Wei-Wei10aAntidepressant-like effect of essential oil of Perilla frutescens in a chronic, unpredictable, mild stress-induced depression model mice  ap. 753-759.  aPerilla frutescens (Perilla leaf), a garnishing vegetable in East Asian countries, as well as a plant-based medicine, has been used for centuries to treat various conditions, including depression. Several studies have demonstrated that the essential oil of P. frutescens (EOPF) attenuated the depressive-like behavior in mice. The present study was designed to test the anti-depressant effects of EOPF and the possible mechanisms in an chronic, unpredictable, mild stress (CUMS)-induced mouse model. With the exposure to stressor once daily for five consecutive weeks, EOPF (3, 6, and 9 mg·kg⁻¹) and a positive control drug fluoxetine (20 mg·kg⁻¹) were administered through gastric intubation to mice once daily for three consecutive weeks from the 3ʳᵈ week. Open-field test, sucrose consumption test, tail suspension test (TST), and forced swimming test (FST) were used to evaluate the behavioral activity. The contents of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), in mouse hippocampus were determined by HPLC–ECD. Serum interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that CUMS significantly decreased the levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the hippocampus, with an increase in plasma IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α levels. CUMS also reduced open-field activity, sucrose consumption, as well as increased immobility duration in FST and TST. EOPF administration could effectively reverse the alterations in the concentrations of 5-HT and 5-HIAA; reduce the IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α levels. Moreover, EOPF could effectively reverse alterations in immobility duration, sucrose consumption, and open-field activity. However, the effect was not dose-dependent. In conclusion, EOPF administration exhibited significant antidepressant-like effects in mice with CUMS-induced depression. The antidepressant activity of EOPF might be related to the relation between alteration of serotonergic responses and anti-inflammatory effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3a5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aPerilla frutescens 3aanimal models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantidepressants 3ablood serum 3adose response 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aessential oils 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahippocampus 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3amice 3aserotonin 3asucrose 3aswimming 3atail suspension test 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avegetables 3aEast Asia 0aPerilla frutescens 0aEssential oil 0aAntidepressant 0aAnti-inflammation 0aChronic unpredictable mild stress1 aLI, Rui-Peng1 aLi, Meng,1 aWang, Shuyuan,1 aZhang, Xian,1 aNIU, Xing-Xing1 aLi, Wei,1 aYan, Lu,1 aWANG, Yang1 aFu, Qiang,1 aMA, Shi-Ping0 tChinese journal of natural medicines.g2014 Oct., v. 12, no. 10 p.753-759dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6169x1875-53647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1875-5364(14)60115-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03562naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245018000205300001000385500001500395506007600410520168400486592002802170506003702198650001902235650002002254650002002274650003202294650001302326650001402339650002502353650003002378650001402408650001302422650001802435650000902453650001002462650002402472650001202496650003102508650001402539651001002553653003202563653002702595653003102622700001902653700001602672700001502688700001402703700001102717700001802728700001902746773009302765856008102858852000902939655001202948IND60120101520221207112608.0160905e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012010152DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-014-0312-62doi7 aPMC43001732pmcid7 a255820572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jianke10aDevelopment of a nanoparticle-assisted PCR (nanoPCR) assay for detection of mink enteritis virus (MEV) and genetic characterization of the NS1 gene in four Chinese MEV strains  ap. 1.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Mink enteritis virus (MEV) causes mink viral enteritis, an acute and highly contagious disease whose symptoms include violent diarrhea, and which is characterized by high morbidity and mortality. Nanoparticle-assisted polymerase chain reaction (nanoPCR) is a recently developed technique for the rapid detection of bacterial and viral DNA. Here we describe a novel nanoPCR assay for the clinical detection and epidemiological characterization of MEV. RESULTS: This assay is based upon primers specific for the conserved region of the MEV NS1 gene, which encodes nonstructural protein 1. Under optimized conditions, the MEV nanoPCR assay had a detection limit of 8.75 × 10¹ copies recombinant plasmids per reaction, compared with 8.75 × 10³ copies for conventional PCR analysis. Moreover, of 246 clinical mink samples collected from five provinces in North-Eastern China, 50.8% were scored MEV positive by our nanoPCR assay, compared with 32.5% for conventional PCR. Furthermore no cross reactivity was observed for the nanoPCR assay with respect to related viruses, including canine distemper virus (CDV) and Aleutian mink disease parvovirus (AMDV). Phylogenetic analysis of four Chinese wild type MEV isolates using the nanoPCR assay indicated that they belonged to a small MEV clade, named “China type”, in the MEV/FPLV cluster, and were closely clustered in the same location. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the MEV China type clade is currently circulating in domestic minks in China. We anticipate that the nanoPCR assay we have described here will be useful for the detection and epidemiological and pathological characterization of MEV.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3across reaction 3aviral enteritis 3adetection limit 3aCarnivore protoparvovirus 1 3adiarrhea 3amorbidity 3aCanine morbillivirus 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aphylogeny 3aplasmids 3arapid methods 3amink 3agenes 3amicrobial detection 3aviruses 3aCarnivore amdoparvovirus 1 3amortality 3aChina 0aAleutian mink disease virus 0aCanine distemper virus 0aFeline panleukopenia virus1 aCheng, Yuening1 aZhang, Miao1 aZhao, Hang1 aLin, Peng1 aYi, Li1 aTong, Mingwei1 aCheng, Shipeng0 tBMC veterinary research.g2015 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.1-1dBioMed Centralx1746-61487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-014-0312-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03742naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245009600209300001000305506007600315520205900391592002802450506003702478650001202515650001802527650002102545650001402566650001502580650001502595650001002610650001002620650002002630650002402650650001402674650001402688650001802702650000902720651001002729651001702739651001302756700001902769700002102788700002202809700001702831700001902848700002002867700002002887700002002907700002302927700001902950773009302969856008103062852000903143655001203152IND60120101720221207112625.0160905e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012010172DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-014-0316-22doi7 aPMC43289582pmcid7 a256046782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtiende, Moses Y10aEpidemiology of Theileria bicornis among black and white rhinoceros metapopulation in Kenya  ap. 4.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: A huge effort in rhinoceros conservation has focused on poaching and habitat loss as factors leading to the dramatic declines in the endangered eastern black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis michaeli) and the southern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum). Nevertheless, the role disease and parasite infections play in the mortality of protected populations has largely received limited attention. Infections with piroplasmosis caused by Babesia bicornis and Theileria bicornis has been shown to be fatal especially in small and isolated populations in Tanzania and South Africa. However, the occurrence and epidemiology of these parasites in Kenyan rhinoceros is not known. RESULTS: Utilizing 18S rRNA gene as genetic marker to detect rhinoceros infection with Babesia and Theileria, we examined blood samples collected from seven rhinoceros populations consisting of 114 individuals of black and white rhinoceros. The goal was to determine the prevalence in Kenyan populations, and to assess the association of Babesia and Theileria infection with host species, age, sex, location, season and population mix (only black rhinoceros comparing to black and white rhinoceros populations). We did not detect any infection with Babesia in the sequenced samples, while the prevalence of T. bicornis in the Kenyan rhinoceros population was 49.12% (56/114). White rhinoceros had significantly higher prevalence of infection (66%) compared to black rhinoceros (43%). The infection of rhinoceros with Theileria was not associated with animal age, sex or location. The risk of infection with Theileria was not higher in mixed species populations compared to populations of pure black rhinoceros. CONCLUSION: In the rhinoceros studied, we did not detect the presence of Babesia bicornis, while Theileria bicornis was found to have a 49.12% prevalence with white rhinoceros showing a higher prevalence (66%) comparing with black rhinoceros (43%). Other factors such as age, sex, location, and population mix were not found to play a significant role.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBabesia 3aCeratotherium 3aDiceros bicornis 3aTheileria 3aanimal age 3ababesiosis 3ablood 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3ahabitat destruction 3amortality 3aparasites 3aribosomal RNA 3arisk 3aKenya 3aSouth Africa 3aTanzania1 aKivata, Mary W1 aMakumi, Joseph N1 aMutinda, Mathew N1 aOkun, Daniel1 aKariuki, Linus1 aObanda, Vincent1 aGakuya, Francis1 aMijele, Dominic1 aSoriguer, Ramón C1 aAlasaad, Samer0 tBMC veterinary research.g2015 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.4-4dBioMed Centralx1746-61487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-014-0316-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03385naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245010700190300001800297520172700315592002802042650001702070650001402087650001502101650001902116650001102135650001002146650001002156650002202166650003002188650001802218650001002236650001702246650001202263650002802275650005602303650004702359650001002406650002802416650001002444650004802454650003002502650004602532651001402578651002102592651002602613700001702639700001902656773009902675856004802774852000902822655001202831IND50068151320221122055836.0130727e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006815132DNAL7 a236896042pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-013-3452-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAydin, Mehmet Fatih10aMolecular identification of Theileria and Babesia in sheep and goats in the Black Sea Region in Turkey  ap. 2817-2824.  aThis study was carried out to investigate presence and distribution of Theileria and Babesia species via microscopic examination and reverse line blotting (RLB) techniques in sheep and goats in the Black Sea region of Turkey. For this purpose, 1,128 blood samples (869 sheep and 259 goats) were collected by active surveillance from sheep and goats in different provinces of various cities in the region in the years 2010 and 2011. Smears were prepared from the blood samples, stained with Giemsa, and examined under the light microscope for Theileria and Babesia piroplasms. The genomic DNAs were extracted from blood samples. The length of 360-430-bp fragment in the variable V4 region of 18S SSU rRNA gene of Theileria and Babesia species was amplified using the gDNAs. The polymerase chain reaction products were hybridized to the membrane-connected species-specific probes. A total of 38 animals (3.37 %) including 34 sheep (3.91 %) and 4 goats (1.54 %) were found to be positive for Theileria spp. piroplasms in microscopic examination of smears while Babesia spp. piroplasm could not detected. Infection rates were 34.64 % in sheep, 10.04 % in goats, and totally 28.99 % for Theileria ovis while 0.58 % in sheep and totally 0.44 % for Babesia ovis. However, Theileria sp. OT3 was detected in 2.65 % of sheep and 2.04 % of all animals; besides Theileria sp., MK had 0.58 % prevalence in sheep and 0.77 % in goats, with a total 0.62 % with RLB. Although T. ovis and Theileria sp. MK were determined in both sheep and goats, B. ovis and Theileria sp. OT3 were observed only in the sheep. These results provide the first detailed molecular data for sheep and goat theileriosis and babesiosis in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBabesia ovis 3aTheileria 3ababesiosis 3ablood sampling 3acities 3agenes 3agoats 3alight microscopes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asheep 3atheileriosis 2aAnimals 2aBabesiaxclassification 2aBabesiosisxepidemiologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aGoat Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aGoats 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aTheileriaxclassification 2aTheileriasisxepidemiologyxparasitology. 3aBlack Sea 3aTurkey (country) 0aTurkeyxepidemiology.1 aAktas, Munir1 aDumanli, Nazir0 tParasitology research.g2013 Aug., v. 112, no. 8 p.2817-2824dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-013-3452-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03476naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003000188245010300218300001000321506007600331520191400407592002802321506003702349650002602386650000902412650001602421650001302437650001202450650002002462650001102482650002002493650001202513650001902525650001202544650001702556650001402573650001702587650001802604650001402622651001102636700003302647700002802680700003002708700003702738773009302775856008102868852000902949655001202958IND60120101820221207112616.0160905e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012010182DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-015-0319-72doi7 aPMC43115142pmcid7 a255916672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFabres-Klein, Mary Hellen13aAn association between milk and slime increases biofilm production by bovine Staphylococcus aureus  ap. 3.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is associated with chronic mastitis in cattle, and disease manifestation is usually refractory to antibiotic therapy. Biofilm production is a key element of S. aureus pathogenesis and may contribute to the treatment failure that is consistently reported by veterinarians. Minas Gerais State is the largest milk-producing state in Brazil, and the characterization of bacterial isolates is an important aspect of disease control for dairy farmers. Here, we investigated the potential of S. aureus isolated from bovine mastitis to produce slime and biofilm in a skim-milk medium and classified the isolates according to their agr type. RESULTS: Slime was detected using the Congo Red agar (CRA) test in 35.18% (19/54) of the strains; however, 87.04% (47/54) of the strains were considered biofilm-positive based on crystal violet staining. Compared to TSB supplemented with 0.25% glucose, skim milk significantly increased the production of biofilm, but this effect was only observed in slime-producing strains. The bacteria belonged to agr groups I (12/54), II (34/54), III (6/54), and IV (2/54), and bacteria in agr group III were found to be stronger biofilm producers than those in groups I and II. Again, milk had a significant influence only on slime-positive agr I and II isolates, revealing an association between milk and slime. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that skim-milk medium and slime production are two factors that together influence biofilm formation by bovine strains of S. aureus. A predominance of bacteria belonging to agr group II was observed, and bacteria from agr group III showed the highest proportion of biofilm producers. The majority of bacteria characterized in this study formed biofilm in milk, which suggests that biofilm formation has an important role in the virulence of S. aureus isolated from bovine intramammary infections.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aagar 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3abovine mastitis 3acattle 3adisease control 3afarmers 3agentian violet 3aglucose 3apathogenesis 3askim milk 3atherapeutics 3aveterinarians 3avirulence 3aBrazil1 aCaizer Santos, Mário Junior1 aContelli Klein, Raphael1 aNunes de Souza, Guilherme1 ade Oliveira Barros Ribon, Andrea0 tBMC veterinary research.g2015 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.3-3dBioMed Centralx1746-61487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-015-0319-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005500146245011500201300002000316520123000336592002801566650002201594650002101616650001501637650001901652650001301671650002301684650001101707700001601718700002001734700001701754700001601771700001301787773013801800856008001938852000902018655001202027IND60678988220221118063110.0191219e20191125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067898822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b073452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Zhongyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9888-218110aEffects of Radius and Length on the Nanomotor Rotors in Aqueous Solution Driven by the Rotating Electric Field  ap. 30649-30656.  aNanomotors with ultrahigh speed that are easy to assemble, with low friction and long service life, have been actively researched in several fields recently, owing to the relentless development of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS). They are based on the principle that the reorientation of the water dipole moment induced by the rotating electric field can rotate the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) immersed in the aqueous solution. The dynamic behaviors of nanomotor rotors with different radii and lengths are studied. According to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the lag angle between the nanomotor rotor and the water molecule dipole can be reduced by increasing the radius of the nanomotor rotor or increasing the length of the nanomotor rotor. At the same time, the synchronization speed between the nanomotor rotor and the rotating electric field can also be increased by increasing the radius of the nanomotor or reducing the length of the nanomotor rotor. These studies show that the radii and lengths of the nanomotor rotor can affect the nanomotor rotor rotation angle, rotation speed and cycle time. Our findings may have potential applications in the design of nanopropellers and nanogears of complex structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon nanotubes 3adurability 3aelectric field 3afriction 3amolecular dynamics 3arotors1 aLiang, Dong1 aJiang, Shuanlei1 aZhao, Pengde1 aHan, Kaixin1 aXu, Zhen0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Nov. 25, v. 123, no. 50 p.30649-30656dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b073453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245008400167300001600251520145800267592002801725650003401753650002101787650001801808650003101826650001001857650003801867650002001905650001401925650001701939650002201956650001801978650002401996650001002020650001802030650000902048650002002057650001602077650002202093650002002115650004302135650002402178650001302202650002502215650003602240650003202276653001702308653001702325653003402342700001802376700001402394700001702408773012402425856008502549852000902634655001202643IND60601728520221121113054.0180706e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060172852DNAL7 a10.1016/S1875-5364(14)60126-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Junhua,10aTectorigenin inhibits the inflammation of LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice  ap. 841-846.  aIn a previous study, the anti-inflammatory effects of tectorigenin were disclosed. In this study, the anti-inflammatory effects of tectorigenin on acute lung injury using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) mouse model were investigatedThe cell-count in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was measured. The animal lung edema degree was evaluated by the wet/dry weight (W/D) ratio. The superoxidase dismutase (SOD) activity and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was assayed using SOD and MPO kits, respectively. The levels of inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-1β, and IL-6 were assayed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Pathological changes of lung tissues were observed through HE staining. The inflammatory signal pathway related protein nuclear factor NF-κB p65 mRNA expression was measured by real-time PCR, and the protein level of NF-κB p65 was measured using Western blotting analysis.The data showed that treatment with the tectorigenin markedly attenuated the inflammatory cell numbers in the BALF, decreased nuclear factor NF-κB p65 mRNA level and protein level in the lungs, and improved SOD activity and inhibited MPO activity. Histological studies showed that tectorigenin substantially inhibited LPS-induced neutrophils in lung tissue compared with the model group.The results indicated that tectorigenin had a protective effect on LPS-induced ALI in mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aedema 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agene expression 3ahistology 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3alungs 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amyeloperoxidase 3aneutrophils 3aprotective effect 3aprotein content 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3astaining 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aTectorigenin 0aInflammation 0aLPS-induced acute lung injury1 aLiu, Ji-ping,1 aQu, Rong,1 aMA, Shi-Ping0 tChinese journal of natural medicines.g2014 Nov., v. 12, no. 11 p.841-846dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6169x1875-53647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1875-5364(14)60126-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245010300184300001800287520142800305592002801733650002901761650001801790650001101808650001401819650001001833650002301843650001801866650001101884650001201895650001401907650001101921650001401932650001301946650002501959650001001984650004401994650001202038650002002050650004502070650002802115650004402143651001202187700003102199700003102230700001902261700001902280700002702299700002102326700002202347773009902369856004802468852000902516655001202525IND50068151420221122055813.0130727e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006815142DNAL7 a236811942pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-013-3453-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSifaoui, Ines10aActivity assessment of Tunisian olive leaf extracts against the trophozoite stage of Acanthamoeba   ap. 2825-2829.  aThe olive tree (Olea europaea, Oleaceae) has historically provided huge economic and nutritional benefits to the Mediterranean basin. In fact, olive leaf extracts have also been used by native people of this area in folk medicine to treat fever and other diseases such as malaria. Recently, several studies have focused on the extraction of high-added-value compounds from olive leaves. However, no previous studies have been developed in order to evaluate the activity of these extracts against Acanthamoeba. In the present work, olive leaf extracts from five different Tunisian varieties of olive trees (Chemlali Tataouine, Zarrazi, Toffehi, Dhokkar, and Limouni) were obtained by using three different solvents, and their activity against the trophozoite stage of Acanthamoeba castellanii Neff was screened. The IC50/96 h (50 % parasite growth inhibition) was chosen as the appropriate and comparable data to give as previously described. It could be observed that the amoebicidal activity was dose dependent. Trophozoite growth was inhibited by all the tested extracts with IC50 ranging from 8.234 ± 1.703 μg/ml for the alcoholic mixture of the Dhokkar extract to 33.661 ± 1.398 μg/ml for the methanolic extract of the Toffehi variety. The activity in fact was affected especially by the tested variety and not by the solvent extraction, the Dhokkar variety being the most active one as mentioned above.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthamoeba castellanii 3aOlea europaea 3abasins 3aeconomics 3afever 3aindigenous peoples 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3amalaria 3anutrition 3aolives 3aparasites 3asolvents 3atraditional medicine 3atrees 2aAcanthamoebaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aOleaxchemistry 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aTrophozoitesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 0aTunisia1 aLópez-Arencibia, Atteneri1 aMartín-Navarro, Carmen Ma1 aChammem, Nadia1 aMejri, Mondher1 aLorenzo-Morales, Jacob1 aAbderabba, Manef1 aPiñero, José E.0 tParasitology research.g2013 Aug., v. 112, no. 8 p.2825-2829dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-013-3453-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245013100184300001600315520116900331592002801500650002501528650003401553650001801587650001801605650001901623650002001642650003101662650001201693650002501705650001301730650004801743650002201791650003301813650002401846653002501870653001301895653002201908653001101930653001601941653002601957700003301983700002602016700002902042700002202071773012402093856008502217852000902302655001202311IND60601729120221119123340.0180706e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060172912DNAL7 a10.1016/S1875-5364(14)60132-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Puttanarasaiah Mahesh10aMethanolic extract of Momordica cymbalaria enhances glucose uptake in L6 myotubes in vitro by up-regulating PPAR-γ and GLUT-4  ap. 895-900.  aThe present study was undertaken to evaluate the influence of the methanolic fruit extract of Momordica cymbalaria (MFMC) on PPARγ (Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor gamma) and GLUT-4 (Glucose transporter-4) with respect to glucose transport. Various concentrations of MFMC ranging from 62.5 to 500 μg·mL⁻¹ were evaluated for glucose uptake activity in vitro using L6 myotubes, rosiglitazone was used as a reference standard. The MFMC showed significant and dose-dependent increase in glucose uptake at the tested concentrations, further, the glucose uptake activity of MFMC (500 μg·mL⁻¹) was comparable with rosigilitazone. Furthermore, MFMC has shown up-regulation of GLUT-4 and PPARγ gene expressions in L6 myotubes. In addition, the MFMC when incubated along with cycloheximide (CHX), which is a protein synthesis inhibitor, has shown complete blockade of glucose uptake. This indicates that new protein synthesis is required for increased GLUT-4 translocation. In conclusion, these findings suggest that MFMC is enhancing the glucose uptake significantly and dose dependently through the enhanced expression of PPARγ and GLUT-4 in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMomordica cymbalaria 3aOriental traditional medicine 3acycloheximide 3adose response 3afruit extracts 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3amyotubes 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors 3aprotein synthesis 3aprotein synthesis inhibitors 3areference standards 0aMomordica cymbalaria 0aDiabetes 0aGlucose transport 0aPPARγ 0aL6 myotubes 0aAntidiabetic activity1 aVenkataranganna, Marikunte V1 aManjunath, Kirangadur1 aViswanatha, Gollapalle L1 aAshok, Godavarthi0 tChinese journal of natural medicines.g2014 Dec., v. 12, no. 12 p.895-900dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6169x1875-53647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1875-5364(14)60132-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005300146245010200199300002000301520123100321592002801552650002301580650002501603650002201628650002301650650001101673700001901684700005401703700001301757700005001770773013801820856008001958852000902038655001202047IND60678989420221118063209.0191219e20191119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067898942DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b080592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Fei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7193-568510aPosition-Selective Growth of 2D WS₂-Based Vertical Heterostructures via a One-Step CVD Approach  ap. 30519-30527.  aVertical heterostructures of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) provide a prospective foreground for practical applications via combining novel physical characteristics that are distinguished from those of traditional counterparts. Here, we report the position-selective growth of 2D WS₂-based vertical heterostructures, including WS₂/MoS₂, WS₂/MoS₂-Mo₀.₄₂W₀.₅₈S₂, WS₂/MoS₂-Mo₁–ₓWₓS₂ (0.4 ≤ x ≤ 0.85), and WS₂/Mo₁–ₓWₓS₂ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.76), with the WS₂ monolayer as the top layer by a one-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Systematical Raman and photoluminescence (PL) characterizations corroborate that position-dependent vertical heterostructures exhibit a significant relationship between structural/optical characteristics and compositions. A possible growth mechanism of various 2D WS₂-based heterostructures at different deposition regions is discussed based on the variation of metallic atoms along the gas flow direction. The current work supplies a promising and efficient strategy to fabricate complex heterostructures composed of various TMDCs, which is a crucial step to develop functional optoelectronic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3amolybdenum disulfide 3aphotoluminescence 3aphysical chemistry 3avapors1 aWang, Yinliang1 aSu, Weitao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7831-19551 aDing, Su1 aFu, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5957-77900 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Nov. 19, v. 123, no. 50 p.30519-30527dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b080593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02785naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001100146245007200157300002000229520170500249592002801954650001701982650002601999650001802025650002302043650001302066650002002079650002002099700005902119700005402178773013802232856008002370852000902450655001202459IND60678989720221118063253.0191219e20191125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067898972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b082412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeha, 10aTheory for the Dynamics of Polymer Grafted Nanoparticle in Solution  ap. 30657-30665.  aWe develop a theory for the dynamics of polymer grafted nanoparticles (PGNP) in a dilute solution. A formalism of multiscale generalized Gaussian structure (mGGS) is developed where the multiscale nature is described as a variable size of monomers connected to each other through harmonic springs with different spring constants. This formalism allows for the study of various dynamic properties of polymer chains or networks grafted nanoparticles at arbitrary positions. We analyze three dynamic properties of PGNP, viz. (i) the mean displacement of a specified monomer of the polymer chain and its time evolution under external (unit step) forces, (ii) loss and storage moduli, and (iii) intrinsic viscosity. The study highlights the unfolding dynamics of a polymer chain with different sizes of nanoparticles and shows that the chain dynamics depends on the position of applied step force in PGNP. Similarly, the elastic moduli and the intrinsic viscosity reflects the viscoelastic properties of PGNP. The storage and the loss moduli of PGNP show anomalous enhancement with temporal slow down in low and intermediate frequency regimes. The increase in the size and the number fraction of nanoparticles in the polymer chain suppresses the power-law exponent in the intermediate frequency regime. The transition frequency between solid- and liquid-like viscoelastic region decreases with an increase in the size and the number fraction of NPs in PGNP. The intrinsic viscosity and the radius of gyration increase with increasing the size of a nanoparticle grafted on the polymer chain. Finally, we conclude that the viscoelastic properties of PGNP are altered by tuning their molecular architectures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aloss modulus 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananoparticles 3aphysical chemistry 3apolymers 3astorage modulus 3aviscoelasticity1 aBiswas, Parbati1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7709-22631 aKant, Rama1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0752-26210 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Nov. 25, v. 123, no. 50 p.30657-30665dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b082413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006800146245014800214300002000362520121000382592002801592650002101620650000901641650002001650650001101670650002301681650001601704650001701720700002401737773013801761856008001899852000901979655001201988IND60678990120200331000000.0191219e20191122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067899012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b084572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernhardsgrütter, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5033-597410aModeling of Intensity-Modulated Photocurrent/Photovoltage Spectroscopy: Effect of Mobile Ions on the Dynamic Response of Perovskite Solar Cells  ap. 30077-30087.  aIntensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) have proven to provide insights into the charge carrier dynamics of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), though the interpretation of measured spectra is not straightforward. Using a one-dimensional drift–diffusion model, we investigate the effect of mobile ions on the small signal response of PSCs. The IMPS and IMVS response is derived by sinusoidal steady-state analysis and Fourier decomposition (FD) of the transient cell response to a light intensity step. The FD method links the time and frequency domain, giving an additional perspective for the interpretation of the results at the expense of numerical efficiency. The simulated spectra are characterized by two separate arcs, where the high-frequency response is attributed to the transport and recombination of electronic charges, while the low-frequency peak represents the transport of ions. We show that this model is able to reproduce qualitatively the measurements reported in the literature. The concepts presented in this paper are applicable for the analysis of the small signal response of any mixed ionic electronic conductor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric current 3aions 3alight intensity 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry 3asolar cells 3aspectroscopy1 aSchmid, Matthias M.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Nov. 22, v. 123, no. 50 p.30077-30087dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b084573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245011200161300002000273520113200293592002801425650001301453650001301466650001601479650001101495650001801506650001501524650001401539650002301553650001301576650001401589650002201603650001301625650002101638650002501659650001601684700002001700700006001720700001501780700005401795773013801849856008001987852000902067655001202076IND60678990620221118063338.0191219e20191114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067899062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b085802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Qiang10aMassively Engineering the Wettability of Titanium by Tuning Nanostructures and Roughness via Laser Ablation  ap. 30382-30388.  aEfficient, environment-friendly, and low-cost oil–water separation is currently a global challenge, to which surface wettability engineering is a key. Here, we introduce an advanced titanium membrane with thousands of water-selective microchannel arrays in a Ti mesh, which is fabricated by femtosecond laser machining. The laser ablation accomplishes three tasks during one process: drilling microchannels, forming a TiO₂@Ti membrane, and engineering nanoscale surface roughness. Particles ejected during machining resolidify to produce rough surfaces with micro-/nanoscale hierarchical structures. This direct ablation gives a highly stable, self-cleaning, and pollutant-free oil–water filter with high separation efficiency. Furthermore, the critical values of the surface roughness and the pore size are analytically derived, providing a guidance for laser surface wettability engineering. Our results could be useful in surface engineering, laser machining, nanostructure engineering, and industrial-scale oil–water separation applications, including wastewater treatment, oil-spill cleaning, and petroleum mining.  aPublisher supplied data 3acleaning 3adrilling 3aengineering 3amining 3ananomaterials 3aoil spills 3apetroleum 3aphysical chemistry 3aporosity 3aroughness 3asurface roughness 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide 3awastewater treatment 3awettability1 aZheng, Shaolong1 aWong, Ching-Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3556-80531 aLiu, Sheng1 aPeng, Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8281-86360 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Nov. 14, v. 123, no. 50 p.30382-30388dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b085803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02049naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245009500173300001600268520095500284592002801239650001201267650002401279650001001303650002901313650002801342650001001370650001701380650001201397700003401409700002501443700002701468773011401495856008101609852000901690655001201699IND60120105120221120185410.0150125e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012010512DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-014-8286-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelgado-Blanca, Irene12aA new approach for automated liquid–liquid extraction in a sequential injection manifold  ap. 521-528.  aA new approach for the implementation of liquid–liquid extraction in a sequential injection manifold is presented. The manifold consists of two syringe pumps and one multi-position valve. The use of a 30 % MeOH/H₂O (v/v) solution as the carrier, with isobutanol as the extractant, made it possible to avoid the problems associated with the different affinities of the organic and aqueous phases for Teflon tubing, and the formation of bubbles. The suitability of the proposed method was demonstrated by the determination of thiamine in pharmaceutical preparations and dietary supplements. Detection and quantification limits were estimated as 9 and 30 μg L–¹, respectively. The repeatability was lower than 3 % and the intermediate precision (3 d) was lower than 7 %. The sample throughput was 14 samples per h. The results were in agreement with a high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray/mass spectrometry reference method.  aPublisher supplied data 3abubbles 3adietary supplements 3adrugs 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3apumps 3aspectroscopy 3athiamin1 aLlorent-Martínez, Eulogio J.1 aRuiz-Medina, Antonio1 aOrtega-Barrales, Pilar0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2015 Jan., v. 407, no. 2 p.521-528dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-014-8286-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245007500173300001600248520167000264592002801934650001401962650001001976650001501986650002402001650000902025650001502034650001902049653001802068653001902086653001702105653001902122653001502141700002002156700002002176700001602196700002302212700001902235773009702254856008402351852000902435655001202444IND60601731320221118233155.0180706e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060173132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aeolia.2013.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParteli, Eric J.R.10aOrigins of barchan dune asymmetry: Insights from numerical simulations  ap. 121-133.  aBarchan dunes — crescent-shaped dunes that form in areas of unidirectional winds and low sand availability — commonly display an asymmetric shape, with one limb extended downwind. Several factors have been identified as potential causes for barchan dune asymmetry on Earth and Mars: asymmetric bimodal wind regime, topography, influx asymmetry and dune collision. However, the dynamics and potential range of barchan morphologies emerging under each specific scenario that leads to dune asymmetry are far from being understood. In the present work, we use dune modeling in order to investigate the formation and evolution of asymmetric barchans. We find that a bimodal wind regime causes limb extension when the divergence angle between primary and secondary winds is larger than 90°, whereas the extended limb evolves into a seif dune if the ratio between secondary and primary transport rates is larger than 25%. Calculations of dune formation on an inclined surface under constant wind direction also lead to barchan asymmetry, however no seif dune is obtained from surface tilting alone. Asymmetric barchans migrating along a tilted surface move laterally, with transverse migration velocity proportional to the slope of the terrain. Limb elongation induced by topography can occur when a barchan crosses a topographic rise. Furthermore, transient asymmetric barchan shapes with extended limb also emerge during collisions between dunes or due to an asymmetric influx. Our findings can be useful for making quantitative inference on local wind regimes or spatial heterogeneities in transport conditions of planetary dune fields hosting asymmetric barchans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetry 3adunes 3alandscapes 3amathematical models 3asand 3atopography 3awind direction 0aBarchan dunes 0aDune asymmetry 0aWind erosion 0aSand transport 0aDune model1 aDurán, Orencio1 aBourke, Mary C.1 aTsoar, Haim1 aPöschel, Thorsten1 aHerrmann, Hans0 tAeolian research.g2014 Mar., v. 12 p.121-133dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12141x1875-96377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aeolia.2013.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03428naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009500165300001400260520192300274592002802197650001202225650001902237650000902256650002202265650001902287650001502306650001102321650001102332650004302343650001902386651001002405651001602415653000902431653001702440653002202457653001302479653001402492700001502506700001402521700001902535700002002554700002002574700001702594700001402611700001602625700001402641700001602655700001502671773009502686856008402781852000902865655001202874IND60601732020221118233133.0180706e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060173202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aeolia.2014.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Siyu10aRegional modeling of dust mass balance and radiative forcing over East Asia using WRF-Chem  ap. 15-30.  aThe Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) is used to investigate the seasonal and inter-annual variations of mineral dust over East Asia during 2007–2011, with a focus on the dust mass balance and its direct radiative forcing. A variety of in situ measurements and satellite observations have been used to evaluate the simulation results. Generally, WRF-Chem reasonably reproduces not only the column variability but also the vertical profile and size distribution of mineral dust over and near the dust source regions. In addition, the dust lifecycle and processes that control the seasonal and spatial variations of dust mass balance are investigated over seven sub-regions of desert dust sources (Taklimakan Desert (TD) and Gobi Desert (GD)), the Tibetan Plateau (TP), Northern China, Southern China, the ocean outflow region, and Korea–Japan. Over the two major dust source regions of East Asia (TD and GD), transport and dry deposition are the two dominant sinks with contributing of ∼25% and ∼36%, respectively. Dust direct radiative forcing in a surface cooling of up to −14 and −10Wm⁻², atmospheric warming of up to 9 and 2Wm⁻², and TOA (Top of atmospheric) cooling of −5 and −8Wm⁻², respectively. Dust transported from the TD is the dominant dust source over the TP with a peak in summer. Over the identified outflow regions (the ocean outflow region, and Korea–Japan), maximum dust column concentration in spring is contributed by transport. Dry and wet depositions are comparable dominant sinks, but wet deposition is larger than dry deposition over the Korea–Japan region, particularly in spring (70% versus 30%). The ability of WRF-Chem to capture the measured features of dust optical and radiative properties and dust mass balance over East Asian provides confidence for future investigation of East Asia dust impact on regional or global climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adry deposition 3adust 3aradiative forcing 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aspring 3asummer 3aweather research and forecasting model 3awet deposition 3aChina 3aGobi Desert 0aDust 0aMass balance 0aRadiative forcing 0aWRF-Chem 0aEast Asia1 aZhao, Chun1 aQian, Yun1 aLeung, L.

In this work, we report time-resolved spectroscopic studies on the energy-transfer (ENT) process within mixed-metal Ln-MOFs based on Tb³⁺ and Eu³⁺ (Tb/Eu-MOF) as well as the ENT process from Ln-MOFs to methylene blue (MB⁺) that encapsulated the MOF. We show that the Tb/Eu-MOF not only exhibits an extended emission spectrum with respect to the single-metal Ln-MOF but also shows a tunable emission lifetime by altering the atomic ratio of Tb³⁺ and Eu³⁺, which can be attributed to the additional ENT pathway from Tb³⁺ to Eu³⁺. Moreover, in the presence of MB⁺, ENT can occur from Tb³⁺ but not from Eu³⁺ in the mixed-node Ln-MOF, which provides a viable approach to tune the ENT rate and efficiency to MB⁺ by altering the atomic ratio of Tb³⁺ and Eu³⁺.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoordination polymers 3aencapsulation 3aenergy transfer 3aeuropium 3amethylene blue 3aphysical chemistry 3aspectral analysis 3aterbium1 aSun, Qi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7092-07051 aWang, Shiping1 aZhang, Yunbo1 aFan, Donghua1 aHuang, Jan J.1 aJin, Shengye1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2001-22120 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Nov. 26, v. 123, no. 50 p.30165-30170dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b092943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01970naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006600146245008200212300002000294520080300314592002801117650002601145650001101171650001101182650001301193650002601206650002301232650002301255650001601278700001901294700002501313700001901338700002401357773013801381856008001519852000901599655001201608IND60678993120221118063357.0191219e20191126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067899312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b093322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFitzGerald, Stephen A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9492-925610aHydrogen Isotope Separation within the Metal–Organic Framework Cu(I)-MFU-4l  ap. 30427-30433.  aHydrogen isotope separation within the metal–organic framework material known as Cu(I)-MFU-4l is investigated using a combination of breakthrough analysis, equilibrium measurements, and infrared spectroscopy. Results confirm the expected large infrared frequency shift of the adsorbed H₂ vibrational mode and reveal an extremely high binding energy difference between H₂ and D₂ of 2.3 kJ/mol. Both static and dynamic measurements indicate that the material’s selectivity for D₂ over H₂ increases with decreasing temperature, reaching a maximum at ≈100 K, but then decreases for lower temperatures. These results indicate an activation barrier for the replacement of adsorbed H₂ by D₂ and place a limit on the material’s effectiveness for isotope separation at low temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoordination polymers 3acopper 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aisotope separation 3aphysical chemistry 3atemperature1 aMukasa, Daniel1 aRigdon, Katharine H.1 aZhang, Naiyuan1 aBarnett, Brandon R.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Nov. 26, v. 123, no. 50 p.30427-30433dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b093323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245007900173300001400252520141800266592002801684650001601712650002301728650002501751650000901776650001601785650001701801650001001818650001101828650001701839650001901856650000901875650001501884650001101899651001201910653001801922653001101940653001501951653001401966653001701980653002501997700002302022700002202045700002102067700002302088700002402111700001702135700005602152700005802208700001702266700002202283773009602305856008402401852000902485655001202494IND60601732820221118233504.0180706e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060173282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aeolia.2014.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSprigg, William A.10aRegional dust storm modeling for health services: The case of valley fever  ap. 53-73.  aOn 5 July 2011, a massive dust storm struck Phoenix, Arizona (USA), raising concerns for increased cases of valley fever (coccidioidomycosis, or, cocci). A quasi-operational experimental airborne dust forecast system predicted the event and provides model output for continuing analysis in collaboration with public health and air quality communities. An objective of this collaboration was to see if a signal in cases of valley fever in the region could be detected and traced to the storm – an American haboob. To better understand the atmospheric life cycle of cocci spores, the DREAM dust model (also herein, NMME-DREAM) was modified to simulate spore emission, transport and deposition. Inexact knowledge of where cocci-causing fungus grows, the low resolution of cocci surveillance and an overall active period for significant dust events complicate analysis of the effect of the 5 July 2011 storm. In the larger context of monthly to annual disease surveillance, valley fever statistics, when compared against PM10 observation networks and modeled airborne dust concentrations, may reveal a likely cause and effect. Details provided by models and satellites fill time and space voids in conventional approaches to air quality and disease surveillance, leading to land–atmosphere modeling and remote sensing that clearly mark a path to advance valley fever epidemiology, surveillance and risk avoidance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3acoccidioidomycosis 3adisease surveillance 3adust 3adust storms 3aepidemiology 3afungi 3amodels 3aparticulates 3aremote sensing 3arisk 3asatellites 3aspores 3aArizona 0aAirborne dust 0aHaboob 0aDust storm 0aForecasts 0aValley fever 0aDisease surveillance1 aNickovic, Slobodan1 aGalgiani, John N.1 aPejanovic, Goran1 aPetković, Slavko,1 aVujadinovic, Mirjam1 aVukovic, Ana1 aDacic, Milan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1866-90901 aDiBiase, Scott1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6514-09421 aPrasad, Anup1 aEl-Askary, Hesham0 tAeolian research.g2014 Sept., v. 14 p.53-73dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12141x1875-96377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aeolia.2014.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245015200185300001600337520093800353592002801291650002101319650000801340650002501348650002101373650001101394650001001405650000901415650001101424650002501435650000901460650002201469650005401491650002801545650003101573650002601604650004301630650002801673650002201701650005901723650002601782650002101808650001701829700001901846700002101865700002201886700002801908773011301936856008202049852000902131655001202140IND50073417020221120125315.0181002e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007341702DNAL7 a240369562pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-013-1822-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMathur, Chhavi14aThe N-terminal region containing the zinc finger domain of tobacco streak virus coat protein is essential for the formation of virus-like particles  ap. 413-423.  aTobacco streak virus (TSV), a member of the genus Ilarvirus (family Bromoviridae), has a tripartite genome and forms quasi-isometric virions. All three viral capsids, encapsidating RNA 1, RNA 2 or RNA 3 and subgenomic RNA 4, are constituted of a single species of coat protein (CP). Formation of virus-like particles (VLPs) could be observed when the TSV CP gene was cloned and the recombinant CP (rCP) was expressed in E. coli. TSV VLPs were found to be stabilized by Zn²⁺ ions and could be disassembled in the presence of 500 mM CaCl₂. Mutational analysis corroborated previous studies that showed that an N-terminal arginine-rich motif was crucial for RNA binding; however, the results presented here demonstrate that the presence of RNA is not a prerequisite for assembly of TSV VLPs. Instead, the N-terminal region containing the zinc finger domain preceding the arginine-rich motif is essential for assembly of these VLPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aRNA 3aTobacco streak virus 3acalcium chloride 3acapsid 3agenes 3aions 3avirion 3avirus-like particles 3azinc 3azinc finger motif 2aCapsid Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA Mutational Analysis 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aIlarvirusxphysiology 2aProtein Interaction Domains and Motifs 2aProtein Multimerization 2aProtein Stability 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aVirosomesxmetabolism 2aZincxmetabolism 2aZinc Fingers1 aMohan, Kalyani1 aUsha Rani, T.

The ewes were allocated to two homogeneous groups; each ewe received on a daily basis 700 g of hay and 500 g of barley grains starting 3 weeks before or 1 week after rams’ introduction in group 1 and group 2, respectively. Supplementation ended 1 month after rams’ introduction and mating lasted 60 days. Final live weight 30 days after introduction of rams was higher (P < 0.05) for ewes in group1 (39.45 vs. 36.72 kg). Seven days after introduction of rams, ewes in group 1 recorded higher plasma glucose levels than females in group 2 (4.12 and 3.9 S.E.M. 0.05 mmol l⁻¹). Proportions of ewes which displayed estrus between days 16 and 26 were 48 and 38% in group 1 and group 2, respectively (P < 0.05), and those which had a normal induced cycle (16–17 days) were 25 and 11% in group 1 and group 2, respectively (P < 0.05). Fertilities were higher (P < 0.05) for ewes in group 1 than in group 2 (91.17 vs. 75.75% and 97.1 vs. 81.8% for fertility at induced estrus and total fertility, respectively). It is concluded that a timed supplementation starting 3 weeks before introduction of rams is effective in yielding high reproductive performance for the prolific strain of the Barbarine breed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBarbarine 3aadults 3abarley 3ablood glucose 3abody weight 3aestrus 3aewes 3afeed supplements 3ahay 3amating systems 3aram effect 3arams 3areproductive performance1 aKhnissi, S.1 aRekik, M.1 aLassoued, N.0 tTropical animal health and production.g2017 Mar., v. 49, no. 3 p.607-612dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-017-1236-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245012600162300001600288520161300304592002801917650001201945650001201957650001901969650001701988650002402005650001302029650001002042653002202052653001902074653000802093653001302101653001102114700002902125700002402154700001802178700001902196773013102215856007702346852000902423655001202432IND60795161320221122082339.0221001e20220928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079516132DNAL7 a10.3955/046.095.03102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLast, George V.10aCase Report of Traumatic Rib Fracture in Mammoth from Frenchman Hills–Tonnemaker Mammoth Site, Grant County, Washington  ap. 350-359.  aA deformed rib from a Columbian mammoth (Mammuthus columbi) was found among more than 100 mammoth bones excavated from an alfalfa field at the Tonnemaker Hill Farm in the Frenchman Hills north of Royal City, Grant County, Washington. The mammoth remains were deposited within fine-grained Missoula flood sediments sometime after 16 ka. We performed a detailed examination of the rib, including computerized tomography imaging, and investigated the possible etiology of the deformity. The deformity consists of hypertrophic bone formation localized toward the distal (sternal) end of the rib. The circumference of the lesion is nearly twice that of the medial circumference of the rib diaphysis. This lesion is consistent with an incompletely healed fracture or a fracture nonunion with pseudarthrosis (false joint) formation. Gross examination and computerized tomography scan images of the proximal aspect of the rib, as well as cursory inspection of the other skeletal remains, have yet to reveal definitive evidence of other bony abnormalities. We surmise, therefore, that this fracture was the consequence of blunt force trauma in a healthy animal. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a rib fracture with incomplete healing or false joint formation in a M. columbi individual in the Pacific Northwest. We suspect the incidence of rib fractures among M. columbi was greater than the Pacific Northwest literature suggests and encourage examination of existing collections for evidence of similar findings. The incidence and frequency of such injuries may provide insight into M. columbi behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalfalfa 3aanimals 3abone formation 3acase studies 3acomputed tomography 3aetiology 3afarms 0aMammuthus columbi 0apseudarthrosis 0arib 0afracture 0atrauma1 aNewhall-Perry, Katherine1 aFaubion, Rosalie L.1 aMara, Neil L.1 aBarton, Bax R.0 tNorthwest science.g2022 Sept. 28, v. 95, no. 3-4 p.350-359dWashington State University PresswJournal:19722x0029-344X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3955/046.095.03103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100008900148245012800237300001800365520122400383592002801607650001101635650001901646650002301665650001801688650001801706650002201724650001401746650001301760650002801773650002101801651001001822700006701832700005701899773015201956856008302108852000902191655001202200IND60763707620221121013215.0220121e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076370762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16317-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJahanger,

The essence of evolving a low-emission economy is to raise carbon productivity that can be estimated as the cost-effective paybacks of CO₂ emissions. A panel threshold model was applied to approximate the threshold effect of globalization on carbon productivity under the development of human capital by using the panel data of thirty provinces of China from 2009 to 2017. The empirical findings demonstrate that China’s carbon productivity increases, while economic growth shape moves towards sustainable development with low-carbon emission. Moreover, the driving force of globalization on carbon productivity is not tediously decreasing/increasing, but it has a double threshold effect of human capital. In line with this, this study finding found a single and double threshold of 9.3478 and 10.8800, respectively, as a benchmark where the relationship turns positive. The empirical findings have suggested several policy implications for the Chinese Government, policymakers, and regulatory authorities regarding this critical issue.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acost effectiveness 3aglobalization 3ahuman capital 3aissues and policy 3apollution 3aresearch 3asustainable development 3athreshold models 3aChina1 aʻUs̲mān, Muḥammad,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6131-21181 aAhmad, Paiman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5887-37820 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 6 p.8353-8368dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16317-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03867naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245016400206300001800370520168100388592002802069650001502097650002602112650001802138650000902156650002802165650001702193650001402210650001702224650001602241650001402257650001902271650001302290650001202303650001702315651001302332700001902345700001902364700003402383700002702417700002202444700002102466700001902487700001702506700001902523700001802542700002502560700002202585700003102607700002602638700001802664700002002682700001802702700002102720700002502741700002102766700002102787700002302808700002102831700002302852700002002875700001802895773015202913856008303065852000903148655001203157IND60763707720221121013354.0220121e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076370772DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16178-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshraf, Sohaib1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3127-355710aKnowledge, attitude, and practice of clinicians about antimicrobial stewardship and resistance among hospitals of Pakistan: a multicenter cross-sectional study  ap. 8382-8392.  aConsidering that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global challenge, there is a dire need to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of clinicians in AMR endemic countries. The current multicenter, cross-sectional study aimed at highlighting gaps in antimicrobial (AM) stewardship and AMR among practicing doctors working in public tertiary care teaching hospitals of Lahore, Pakistan. A KAP survey, based on a self-administered questionnaire containing 45 questions, was distributed among 336 clinicians in 6 randomly selected hospitals. Overall, 92% of the clinicians considered AMR as a worldwide problem but only 66% disagreed that cold and flu symptoms require antibiotics. Moreover, around 68% of the doctors felt confident about their practice in AM but still, 96% felt the need to get more knowledge about AM drugs. The need for refresher courses on rational antibiotic use was expressed by 84% of the participants. The main contributing factors considered for AMR by the doctors included excessive AM usage in the medical profession (87.1%) and multiple antibiotics per prescription (76.4%). Pharmacologically, AM spectrum was accurately chosen by 1.4% for Ampicillin, 0.003% for Erythromycin and 0% for Levofloxacin. Clinically, more than 50% of the clinicians used miscellaneous AM for empirical therapy of respiratory tract infection and cholecystitis. The data was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25. It is concluded that the knowledge of clinicians is relatively poor for AM spectrum and drugs of choice for certain infections. However, the clinicians are aware of their shortcomings and desire for improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3acholecystitis 3acold 3across-sectional studies 3aerythromycin 3ainfluenza 3alevofloxacin 3aoccupations 3apollution 3aquestionnaires 3aresearch 3asurveys 3atherapeutics 3aPakistan1 aAshraf, Shoaib1 aAshraf, Moneeb1 aʻUmrān, Muḥammad Aḥmad,1 aChoudhary, Zawar Ahmad1 aHafsa, Hadiqa Tul1 aAwais, Abeer Bin1 aKalsoom, Larab1 aFarooq, Iqra1 aHabib, Zaighum1 aAshraf, Sidra1 aIqbal, Qurrat Ul Ain1 aGhufran, Muhammad1 aSherazi, Syed Sami Hussain1 aAkram, Muhammad Kiwan1 aAkmal, Rutaba1 aRafique, Sundas1 aNawaz, Khawar1 aSafdar, Zartasha1 aSiddique, Uzma Nasim1 aHassan, Muhammad1 aArshad, Shahroze1 aVirk, Abdul Rehman1 aAshraf, Muhammad1 aSaboor, Qazi Abdul1 aHumayun, Ayesha1 aIzhar, Mateen0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 6 p.8382-8392dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16178-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03115naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245009100166300001600257520183900273592002802112650002002140650002302160650001202183650000902195650001102204650002202215650001402237650002002251650001002271650001302281650001602294650001902310650001102329650001102340650002002351650001902371700001802390700001902408700001802427773013802445856007702583852000902660655001202669IND60524022920221116200403.0160701e20020628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052402292DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.2002.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSacała, Elżbieta14aThe effects of salt stress on growth and biochemical parameters in two maize varieties  ap. 101-107.  aThe main objective of this study was to examine the influence of salinity on growth and biochemical parameters (NR activity, amino compound accumulation, protein content, some inorganic ion concentrations) of two varieties of maize (Limko and Koka). Salinity (75.0 mol • m-3 NaCl and 37.5 mol • m-3 Na2SO4) significantly reduced fresh and dry weights of the investigated maize varieties. NaCl induced higher reduction in biomass production than Na2SO4. Differences in salt tolerance between Limko and Koka were small.It was found that in both maize varieties the nitrate reductase activity decreased under salt stress (100 mol • m-3 NaCl). This effect was more marked in the Koka variety than Limko. Decrease in nitrate reductase activity had no inhibitory effect on accumulation of protein and free amino compounds. Salinity treatment (100 mol • m-3 NaCl) led to an increase in free amino compound contents in roots and shoots of both investigated maize varieties, but these changes were not very large. The highest increase in amino compound level was observed in roots of Koka and it was 2-fold higher than in control plants. Salt stress did not change soluble protein contents in Limko and Koka varieties with the exception of Limko leaves. There was significant increase in soluble protein content on leaves of Limko and it amounted 128% of the control. Salinity caused a great increase in leaf and root Na+ concentration and a decrease in case of Ca2+ and K+ contents. The declines in Ca2+ content in maize roots were 76 and 70% respectively for Koka and Limko roots. The fall in K+ concentration was high, but not so drastic as in Ca2+. In roots of Koka and Limko the reduction in K+ content was approximately 30%. Higher reduction in K+content showed shoots of Limko. In this case K+ content lowered to 49% of control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino compounds 3abiomass production 3acalcium 3acorn 3aleaves 3anitrate reductase 3apotassium 3aprotein content 3aroots 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3ashoots 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asodium sulfate1 aDemczuk, Anna1 aGrzyś, Edward1 aSobczak, Anna0 tActa Societatis Botanicorum Poloniae.g2002 June 28, v. 71, no. 2 p.101-107dPolish Botanical SocietywJournal:12967x0001-69777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5586/asbp.2002.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245012400169300001400293520151800307592002801825650002501853650001801878650001701896650001701913650001801930650001801948650001701966650001201983650002201995650001402017650002402031650001602055700002402071700002102095700002402116773011102140856008302251990002302334852000902357655001202366IND60099116120221120050013.0141105e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009911612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygcen.2011.01.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMita, Masatoshi10aHormonal action of relaxin-like gonad-stimulating substance (GSS) on starfish ovaries in growing and fully grown states  ap. 85-89.  aGonad-stimulating substance (GSS) of starfish is the only known invertebrate peptide hormone responsible for final gamete maturation, rendering it functionally analogous to gonadotropins in vertebrates. Recently, we purified GSS from the radial nerves of the starfish Asterina pectinifera and identified the chemical structure as a relaxin-like peptide. This study examined the hormonal action of GSS on ovaries in the growing (stage IV) and fully grown states (stage V) of the starfish. The sensitivity of oocytes to 1-methyladenine (1-MeAde) as starfish maturation-inducing hormone was enhanced as oocytes enlarged in stage V. GSS-stimulated 1-MeAde production by ovarian follicle cells was also correlated with the size of oocytes. Although 1-MeAde production was observed in whole ovaries in stage V, GSS failed to induce 1-MeAde production in young ovaries (stage IV). This suggests that follicle cells in ovaries in a growing state (stage IV) are still unresponsive to the hormonal action of GSS. According to competitive experiments using radioiodinated and radioinert GSS, however, dissociation constant (Kd) values and the number of binding sites for GSS were mostly constant in the ovaries from stages IV to V. These results strongly suggest that GSS receptors are expressed in follicle cells of ovaries in the growing state. The failure of GSS to induce 1-MeAde production in young ovaries may be due to the uncoupling of signal transduction from the receptor to 1-MeAde biosynthesis in follicle cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsterina pectinifera 3abinding sites 3abiosynthesis 3adissociation 3agonadotropins 3ainvertebrates 3anerve tissue 3aoocytes 3aovarian follicles 3areceptors 3asignal transduction 3avertebrates1 aYamamoto, Kazutoshi1 aNakamura, Masaru1 aNagahama, Yoshitaka0 tGeneral and comparative endocrinology.g2011 May 15, v. 172, no. 1 p.85-89dElsevier Inc.x0016-64807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2011.01.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003300140245006700173300002000240520127100260592002801531650001601559650001201575650002601587650001501613650001101628650001301639650002101652650002101673700002201694700003101716773012401747856007401871852000901945655001201954IND60640356420221120060131.0190504e20160307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064035642DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra00199h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallardo-Fuentes, Sebastián10aOrigins of the ANRORC reactivity in nitroimidazole derivatives  ap. 25215-25221.  aThe mechanism of the ANRORC-like ring transformation of nitroimidazole derivatives towards aniline has been studied by fully exploring the potential energy surface (PES). For this purpose the reaction of some aniline derivatives towards 1,4-dinitro-1H-imidazole, 2-methyl-1,4-dinitro-1H-imidazole and 5-methyl-1,4-dinitro-1H-imidazole and have been employed as model reactions. The study reveals that the most favorable path involves an initial amine attack at the C(5)–C(4) bond of the imidazole moiety, where the imidazole distortion appears to be the main factor for the favored nucleophilic attack on the C(5) site. We further show that the reaction regioselectivity is independent of the substitution patterns on the aryl moiety. Next, we highlight the key role of the proton transfer along the reaction pathway of the title reactions to allow a successful connection between two energetically lower regions along the PES: an electrophilically activated ring-opening step followed by the favored 5-exo-trig cyclization. Additionally, we show that this 5-exo-trig cyclization step is the rate determining step. Finally the tether strain and steric effects present in the rate determining TS structure are evaluated by means of the distortion/interaction model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aaniline 3acyclization reactions 3aimidazoles 3amodels 3amoieties 3apotential energy 3aregioselectivity1 aContreras, Renato1 aOrmazábal-Toledo, Rodrigo0 tRSC advances.g2016 Mar. 07, v. 6, no. 30 p.25215-25221dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra00199h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245015000177300001600327520120100343592002801544650002701572650002701599650001401626650001201640650001601652650002901668650002501697650001401722650001001736650001801746651001301764700001801777700001901795773008501814856008301899852000901982655001201991IND60086241420221118020231.0141101e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008624142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.limno.2011.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGirma, Misgina Belachew10aDeep underwater seismic explosion experiments and their possible ecological impact – The case of Lake Arenguade – Central Ethiopian highlands  ap. 212-219.  aThe study was conducted in Lake Arenguade (Lake Haro Hadho) from 2008 to 2009 and results were compared with previous studies conducted by different authors since the 1960s. The study included the chemistry and chlorophyll-a biomass in micrograms per liter (μgL⁻¹). Results showed that chlorophyll-a biomass dramatically decreased since the 1960s. Previous studies indicated that the phytoplankton community of Lake Arenguade was dominated by a single cyanobacterium species, Arthrospira fusiformis (Voronichin) Komárek et Lund (syn. Spirulina fusiformis Voronichin) while the present study showed co-dominance of the lake's phytoplankton by another cyanobacterium species, Anabaenopsis elenkinii Miller. The trend shows that A. fusiformis is on the verge of disappearance from Lake Arenguade. While other factors can be responsible for such a change, the contribution of underwater seismological detonation experiments carried out repeatedly cannot be ruled out. Based on the results, recommendations were forwarded for possible full-fledged environmental impact assessment of explosion experiments in Lake Arenguade; and other lakes in which similar explosion experiments were carried out.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnabaenopsis elenkinii 3aArthrospira fusiformis 3aSpirulina 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3ahighlands 3alakes 3aphytoplankton 3aEthiopia1 aKifle, Demeke1 aJebessa, Habte0 tLimnologica.g2012 Sept., v. 42, no. 3 p.212-219dElsevier GmbHx0075-95117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2011.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03629naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245017900169300001600348520187200364592002802236650002202264650001102286650001502297650000902312650001302321650001202334650001102346650001302357650001302370650001502383650001402398650001802412650001202430650001302442650002002455650001602475650001302491650001802504650002202522650001802544653001702562653001802579653002502597653002802622653002902650653001902679700001602698700001802714700001402732700001502746700001802761700001402779700001402793773011302807856008602920852000903006655001203015IND60567241420221121014414.0180831e20160720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056724142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.03.1212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yaogang10aExperimental evaluation of the lubrication properties of the wheel/workpiece interface in minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) grinding using different types of vegetable oils  ap. 487-499.  aGiven the increasing attention to environmental and health problems caused by machining, the development of an environment-friendly grinding fluid has become an urgent task. As an environment-friendly grinding fluid, vegetable oil has gained considerable attention. In this study, seven typical vegetable oils (i.e., soybean, peanut, maize, rapeseed, palm, castor, and sunflower oil) were used as the minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) base oil to conduct an experimental evaluation of the friction properties of the grinding wheel/workpiece interface. With nickel-based alloy GH4169 as workpiece material, the flood grinding working condition and MQL grinding working condition (i.e., using the seven vegetable oils and paraffin oil) were selected. The evaluation of the lubrication property mainly referred to grinding force, friction coefficient, specific grinding energy, and grinding ratio (G-ratio), as well as surface morphology and surface roughness. Experimental results indicated that MQL grinding using vegetable oil achieved a lower friction coefficient, specific grinding energy, and grinding wheel wear than flood grinding. Among the grinding fluids, castor oil achieved the best lubrication property and the best surface quality of workpiece. Castor oil had a friction coefficient and specific grinding energy of 0.30 and 73.47 J/mm³, which decreased by 50.1% and 49.4%, respectively, compared with flood grinding. Moreover, various grinding fluids changed cutting forces through changes in their lubrication property and further changed G-ratio. However, lubrication property was one of factors that influenced the G-ratio. Maize oil had the highest G-ratio of 29.15. Peanut, sunflower, and soybean oil with more saturated fatty acids, castor oil with more castor acids, and palm oil with numerous palmitic acids were suitable as lubricating fluids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aalloys 3acastor oil 3acorn 3acorn oil 3acutting 3aenergy 3afriction 3agrinding 3alubricants 3apalm oils 3apalmitic acid 3apeanuts 3arapeseed 3aricinoleic acid 3asoybean oil 3asoybeans 3asunflower oil 3asurface roughness 3avegetable oil 0aMQL grinding 0aVegetable oil 0aLubricating property 0aCoefficient of friction 0aSpecific grinding energy 0aGrinding ratio1 aLi, Changhe1 aZhang, Yanbin1 aYang, Min1 aLi, Benkai1 aJia, Dongzhou1 aHou, Yali1 aMao, Cong0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 July 20, v. 127 p.487-499dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.03.1213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01326naa a2200241 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024003600099040001800135100001700153245007700170300001600247520052900263592002800792650001800820650002000838700001600858773010600874852000900980856008300989655001201072991632104140742620221118184713.0181010e197801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7890456452DNAL7 a10.1177/0300985878015001122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeyvisch, C.13aAn Electron Microscopic Study of Experimentally-induced HEV Encephalitis  ap. 102-113.  aA gnobiotic piglet, was inoculated intracerebrally with hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (strain VW572).

However, to our knowledge there has been no published work on diel DOC variation within lowland rivers during high flow events. We sampled DOC at 4h intervals from two sites across two distinct flow regimes in the regulated lower Namoi River, Australia. This included a large flood (mean flow 224m³s⁻¹ and a peak flow of 376m³s⁻¹) sampled every 4h for 10 consecutive days. DOC concentrations were significantly greater at night than during the day (P<0.05) and the mean DOC concentration was 23.4mgL⁻¹ at night compared to 18.9mgL⁻¹ during daylight hours. The magnitude and duration of flow within this lowland river system and the mobilisation of large quantities of allochthonous carbon appeared to play a role in increasing DOC concentration and the diel difference.  aPublisher supplied data 3arivers 3adissolved organic carbon 3alotic systems 3aAustralia 0acarbon1 aMitrovic, Simon M.1 aWoodward, K.

Despite this popularity, there have been no publications regarding normal bone density or bone mineral concentration and few publications regarding the normal dietary requirements of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D (25-hydrox-vitamin D₃ [25(OH)D₃]) for the species. A clinical investigation into frequent fractures in a zoo population of 23 adult male Egyptian fruit bats used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to evaluate bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) prior to and after dietary adjustment of calcium and phosphorus. This study documents BMD, BMC, serum trace minerals, and serum levels of 25(OH)D₃ within this population and includes postmortem bone density and bone ash from a subset of bats that died during the study period. A handheld point-of-care analyzer was utilized to assess ionized calcium and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, total CO₂), glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine at each DXA time point to contribute to published reference ranges for this species. This study identified a significant (P < 0.001) increase in BMC over 15 mon (4.71–8.26 g) following additional calcium and phosphorus supplementation in the diet. The BMD also trended toward a significant increase (0.124–0.274 g/cm², P < 0.053). Additional studies documenting normal bone density that include both sexes and possibly free-ranging bats consuming a natural diet are recommended to determine normal values for R. aegyptiacus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRousettus 3aadults 3ablood serum 3abone density 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorides 3acreatinine 3adietary supplements 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3afruits 3aglucose 3ahumans 3aionization 3amales 3amedicine 3amineral content 3aphosphorus 3apoint-of-care systems 3apotassium 3asodium 3aurea nitrogen 3awildlife 3azoos1 aHouseholder, Hilary M.1 aGabler, Nicholas K.1 aOlds, June E.0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2022 Sept. 26, v. 53, no. 3 p.528-536dAmerican Association of Zoo VeterinarianswJournal:jnl43569x1937-28257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1638/2021-00403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245015000154300002000304520122700324592002801551650002201579650003701601650001501638650001401653650001801667650001701685650001301702650001601715650001901731650002101750650001901771650001901790650001801809650002201827650001601849650001601865700003001881700002601911700002201937700001901959700001701978773012401995856007402119852000902193655001202202IND60640356720221120050725.0190504e20160303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064035672DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra00209a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSonia, S.10aSuperhydrophobic and H₂S gas sensing properties of CuO nanostructured thin films through a successive ionic layered adsorption reaction process  ap. 24290-24298.  aSuperhydrophobic surfaces of CuO were synthesized using a successive ionic-layered adsorption reaction technique by varying the number of deposition cycles followed by a thermal annealing process. The prepared superhydrophobic surface was composed of monoclinic CuO, which was confirmed by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Dynamic contact angle measurements were obtained using a droplet evaporation method. The contact angles measured on CuO surfaces after 20, 40, and 60 deposition cycles were similar, all showing hydrophilicity. After the thermal treatment, the prepared films exhibit super-hydrophobicity with a high water contact angle of approximately 157°, which contributed to the stable superhydrophobic surface. A considerable increase in surface roughness (from 23.81 to 74.54 nm) and the conical-shaped CuO nanostructures led to super-hydrophobicity. Also a possible mechanism for the wettability behavior is proposed. Finally, the superhydrophobic CuO surface which was used for the detection of H₂S gas showed a very fast response. These results indicate that the low temperature deposition of CuO nanostructured thin films were promising for reliable high-performance gas sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aannealing 3acontact angle 3acupric oxide 3adroplets 3aevaporation 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen sulfide 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3ananomaterials 3asurface roughness 3atemperature 3awettability1 aSuresh Kumar, Palaniswamy1 aJayram, Naidu Dhanpal1 aMasuda, Yoshitake1 aMangalaraj, D.1 aLee, Chongmu0 tRSC advances.g2016 Mar. 03, v. 6, no. 29 p.24290-24298dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra00209a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01544naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003300143245007300176300001600249520048500265592002800750650002400778650001500802650002100817650002300838650001200861650001200873650002100885650001600906650001600922650001100938700002100949773013800970856007701108852000901185655001201194IND60524023220221116200259.0160701e20061229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052402322DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.2006.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiedźwiedź-Siegień, Irena14aThe effect of cytokinins on flax seed germination at low temperature  ap. 281-284.  aGermination of flax seeds (Linum usitatissimum L., cv.

The optimum conditions for chemical oxygen demand removal were established a pH 3.5, 0.328 g/L dose of K₂FeO₄, and with a process duration of 48 min. At these conditions, chemical oxygen demand, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus decreased by 70.3, 58.9, 73.3, 82.0%, respectively; and the putrid odor was reduced. Simultaneously, the total viable count, total coli count, most probable number of fecal enterococci, and the total proteolytic bacteria count decreased by 89.5, 93.1, 92.9, and 95.0 %, respectively. Comparatively, an application of 0.450 g/L FeCl₃·6H₂O corresponding to the iron content in 0.328 g/L of K₂FeO₄ resulted in a decrease of total viable count, total coli count, most probable number of fecal enterococci and the total proteolytic bacteria count only by 38.1, 31.2, 42.9, and 58.0%, respectively. Therefore, flocculation with polyacrylamide anionic flocculant combined with potassium ferrate (VI) oxidation is a more effective alternative to coagulation with FeCl₃ and the same flocculant. The use of potassium ferrate (VI) is a viable option for the treatment of carwash wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus 3achemical oxygen demand 3acoagulation 3adisinfection 3aflocculants 3aflocculation 3amost probable number technique 3aodors 3aoxidation 3apH 3aplate count 3apolyacrylamide 3apotassium 3aproteolysis 3aresearch 3aresponse surface methodology 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal organic carbon 3atotal phosphorus 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aDrzewicz, Przemysław1 aWięckol-Ryk, Angelika1 aPanneerselvam, Balamurugan0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 6 p.8514-8524dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16278-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245015500209300001600364520193000380592002802310650002502338650001502363650002002378650001302398650001102411650003502422650001502457650001802472650002802490650001302518653003602531653002002567653002102587653003502608653001102643773011302654856008602767852000902853655001202862IND60567241820221121014150.0180831e20160720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056724182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.03.1312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jiekuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0598-058410aWeighing and realizing the environmental, economic and social goals of tourism development using an analytic network process-goal programming approach  ap. 262-273.  aAlthough the sustainable development philosophy has been widely recognized, it is still necessary to weigh the economic, environmental and social implications of tourism development. The decision is often difficult involving typically complex multi-criteria decision making problems. This study aims to contribute a theoretical framework and approach for the determination of top priorities in tourism development and making decisions based upon that approach. Taking Xizang as a case, this study explores the means to weigh and realize tourism development goals during the ‘13th Five-Year Plan’ period, using the analytic network process within a goal programming model. Results show that there are 10 criteria and nine decision variables determined in Xizang's sustainable tourism development and the priorities in Xizang's tourism development should be: 1) economic goals, 2) social goals, and 3) environmental goals. In addition, using the analytic network process-goal programming model, this paper provides the solution of the decision problem for two years, namely 2016 and 2020, and discusses the significance of the results. This study concludes that in a newly-emerging tourism but otherwise economically and socially backward region like Xizang, considering the economy first and the environment last is both appropriate and practicable. It is suggested that Xizang's tourism managers should implement specific strategies to raise the GDP, encourage higher levels of consumption by tourists and appropriately restrict the growth in the number of tourist coming to the area. Other goals should be to improve tourism research and the treatment of tourism employees and provide more support for tourism enterprises. The interdisciplinary approach from a systems perspective used in this study can be used to judge, queen and select numerous goals and criteria to make decisions in sustainable tourism development.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aecotourism 3ahuman resources 3amanagers 3amodels 3amulti-criteria decision making 3aphilosophy 3asocial impact 3asustainable development 3atourists 0aSustainable tourism development 0aDecision-making 0aGoal programming 0aAnalytic network process (ANP) 0aXizang0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 July 20, v. 127 p.262-273dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.03.1313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01995naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245009400152300002000246500001500266520089300281592002801174650001401202650001701216650002001233650001201253650002701265650002701292650002101319650002001340653001001360700001501370700001501385700001401400773012401414856007401538852000901612655001201621IND60640356920221120055939.0190504e20160215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064035692DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra00218h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Di10aUsing POSS–C₆₀ giant molecules as a novel compatibilizer for PS/PMMA polymer blends  ap. 18924-18928.  a2019-12-06  aHerein, we report a novel strategy to use Janus polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS)–[60]fullerene (C₆₀) (JPC) giant molecules as compatibilizer for immiscible polystyrene (PS)/polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blends. It was found that the domain sizes of the dispersed PMMA phase decrease in PS matrix, and tensile strength and elongation of PS/PMMA blends were largely enhanced by adding a small amount of JPC. More importantly, both interfacial tension analyses and elemental Si distribution in the blends suggest a possible location of the JPC at the PS/PMMA interfaces. Our studies provide not only a new idea for the compatibilization of polymer blends, but also for precisely controlling the positions of nanoparticles in a polymer matrix, which is also of great importance for the preparation of polymer nanocomposites with high-performance and excellent functionality.  aPublisher supplied data 3afullerene 3apolystyrenes 3asurface tension 3asilicon 3apolymer nanocomposites 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3atensile strength 3asilsesquioxanes 0aJanus1 aZhang, Qin1 aChen, Feng1 aFu, Qiang0 tRSC advances.g2016 Feb. 15, v. 6, no. 23 p.18924-18928dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra00218h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01685naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245011800165300001600283520063700299592002800936653001800964653001400982653001800996653001601014653002501030700002001055700002401075700002001099700002301119773012901142856007901271852000901350655001201359IND60124599920221122223733.0150427e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012459992DNAL7 a10.1525/abt.2013.75.8.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdler, Jacob J.10aDay as a Pathologist: Utilization of Technology to Guide Students in Exploring Careers in Breast Cancer Pathology  ap. 559-565.  aWe developed an interactive laboratory that allows students to identify and grade tissue samples from human breast biopsies, using techniques similar to those used by actual pathologists.

Forty-eight weaned male Pelibuey lambs (20.6 ± 0.80 kg of BW) were randomly allocated to four groups: (1) supplementing the basal diet with mulberry at 1% (DM basis; M-1), (2) mulberry at 0.75% plus 0.1 kg concentrate fresh matter basis (M-0.75), (3) mulberry at 0.50% plus 0.2 kg concentrate (M-0.50) and (4) basal diet plus 0.3 kg concentrate (control; M-0). During the first 90 days, the basal diet was Pennisetum purpureum forage which was substituted by a mixture of guinea grass and sugarcane from 90 days. Average daily gain (ADG, g/day), dry matter intake (DMI) and feed conversion rate (FCR; DMI/ADG) were determined. The ADG was affected (P < 0.01) by the diet, with the lowest obtained in M-1 lambs (71 ± 6.4 g/day), whereas no differences among the other groups were observed (94 ± 6.4 g DM/lamb). The DMI was higher (P < 0.01) in M-0 (937 g DM/lamb) which concomitantly affected differences in FCR (11.9, 9.9, 10.5 and 9.7 kg DMI/kg BW gain for M-1, M-0.75, M-0.50 and M-0 lambs, respectively). Final BW at slaughtering and hot or cold carcass yields were coherent with growth rate findings. Biological yield (cold carcass weight/empty BW) was higher (P < 0.01) in M-0.75. Without compromising animal productivity, replacing imported concentrate with mulberry reduced the feeding cost. Optimum results were obtained with M-75 diet. Further studies must be conducted for optimizing energy/protein ratios with different ingredients while increasing DMI and lamb growth rates in this tropical genotype.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenchrus purpureus 3aMegathyrsus maximus 3aPelibuey (sheep breed) 3aaverage daily gain 3acarcass weight 3acarcass yield 3adiet 3adry matter intake 3aenergy 3afeed conversion 3aforage 3agenotype 3aingredients 3alambs 3aleaves 3amales 3amulberries 3aslaughter 3asugarcane1 aArece-García, J.1 aEsperance, M.1 aLópez, Y.1 aMolina, M.1 aGonzález-García, E.0 tTropical animal health and production.g2017 Mar., v. 49, no. 3 p.537-546dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-017-1225-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01916naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011600167520077200283592002801055650004401083650002201127650001401149650001201163650002501175650001601200650001601216653001401232653001801246653003501264653000901299700001701308700001501325700001601340773009501356856008201451852000901533655001201542IND60763850020221119171240.0220214e20220226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076385002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2022.1326592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yingying10aRearrangement of α-terpineol by using PTA/TiO2 catalyst synthesized by ultrasonic-assisted impregnation method  a1,8-cineole was synthesized via α-terpineol rearrangement over SiO₂- and TiO₂-supported phosphotungstic acid (PTA) catalysts prepared by ultrasonic impregnation.

Complex 2 also effects the direct reduction of CO₂ to the methoxide complex 5, which is unprecedented in f element chemistry. From the reaction of 2 with excess CO₂, crystals of the bis-formate carbonate complex [K₂{[U(OSi(OᵗBu)₃)₃]₂(μ-CO₃)(μ-HCOO)₂}], 6, could also be isolated.

Our goal was to reconstruct land-cover change from 1770 to 2010 and to evaluate its spatial determinants and underlying drivers for three study sites in diverse agroecological settings in Ryazan province in European Russia. We used historic maps and statistics as well as satellite imagery to reconstruct land-cover change and categorize it into six distinct land-management regimes. We applied spatially-explicit logistic regressions to assess which spatial determinants have had the strongest influences on land cover and how these influences have changed over time. Our results show how long-term land-cover trajectories can be modulated by broad political and economic alterations, rather than through gradual and local demand-side pressures from a rising population density and an increasing local demand for agricultural commodities.  aThis work was supported by the DFF-Danish ERC-programme[N. 9127-00001B.  aPublisher supplied data  aN. 9127-00001BcDFF-Danish ERC-programme 3aagricultural products 3aagroecology 3aanthropogenic activities 3aland cover 3aland use 3aland use and land cover maps 3apolitics 3apopulation density 3aremote sensing 3astatistics 3aRussia 0aLand-system science 0ahistorical analysis 0aspatial analysis 0alogistic regression 0aland management regime1 aPrishchepov, Alexander V.1 aJepsen, Martin Rudbeck1 aMüller, Daniel,0 tJournal of land use science.g2019 Nov. 2, v. 14, no. 4-6 p.362-377dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000108x1747-42487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1747423X.2019.17092243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03381naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245012900184300001600313520162300329592002801952650001401980650002101994650001002015650002102025650002202046650001002068650003002078650001802108650001802126650002602144650002902170650002902199650005102228650002902279650001602308650003402324650001102358650004502369650002602414650002902440650003402469650004902503650003202552700002402584700002002608700002002628700002402648773009802672856004802770852000902818655001202827IND4469778920221122034158.0121003e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446977892DNAL7 a214001162pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-011-2312-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrim, Robert D.10aUse of PCR to detect Entamoeba gingivalis in diseased gingival pockets and demonstrate its absence in healthy gingival sites  ap. 857-864.  aInvestigators using light microscopy have identified the protozoan parasite Entamoeba gingivalis from diseased gingival pockets for nearly 100 years. The objective of the present investigation was to develop a molecular biology approach for determining the presence of E. gingivalis in both diseased gingival pockets and healthy gingival sites. For this, a previously developed conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was evaluated and a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay was developed. Paper points were inserted into the base of the sulcus of both diseased gingival pockets and healthy gingival sites. DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA mini kit, and subsequently analyzed using conventional and real-time PCR analysis. A previously described primer set specific for the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA) of E. gingivalis was used for the conventional PCR. For the real-time PCR, a primer set was designed to amplify a 135-bp fragment inside the SSU rDNA of E. gingivalis. A conventional PCR assay detected E. gingivalis in 27% of diseased gingival pockets. The real-time PCR using a different primer set detected protozoa in 69% of diseased pocket sites. Thus, the latter technique proved more sensitive for detection of E. gingivalis. No E. gingivalis were detected in any of the healthy gingival pocket sites using either type of PCR assay. Results support a concept that the presence of E. gingivalis is associated only with diseased gingival pocket sites. The newly described methodology may also serve to provide a novel eukaryotic cell marker of disease status in gingival pockets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEntamoeba 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3alight microscopy 3amolecular biology 3apaper 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aDNA, Protozoanxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aEntamoebaxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aEntamoebiasisxdiagnosis 2aGenes, rRNA 2aGingival Pocketxparasitology 2aHumans 2aMolecular Diagnostic Techniquesxmethods 2aParasitologyxmethods 2aRNA, Protozoanxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxgenetics 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSensitivity and Specificity1 aSkinner, Michael A.1 aFarone, Mary B.1 aDuBois, John D.1 aNewsome, Anthony L.0 tParasitology research.g2011 Sept., v. 109, no. 3 p.857-864dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-011-2312-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02286naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245006900159300001600228520129400244592002801538650001201566650002201578650001301600650001901613650001701632650002001649650002401669650002101693650001701714700001201731700001401743700001701757773009301774856004801867852000901915655001201924IND4482053320221120212237.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448205332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-011-0158-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThapa, G.13aAn insight into the drought stress induced alterations in plants  ap. 603-613.  aPlants are subjected to several abiotic stresses that adversely affect growth, metabolism and yield. The dynamic research in plant genetics complemented by genome sequencing has opened up avenues to address multiple problems caused by abiotic stresses. Though many drought-induced genes have been phytoengineered in a wide range of plants, the drought signal transduction pathways, and the alteration of plant sensing and signaling systems to adverse environments still remain an intriguing subject for comprehensive investigation. To impart enhanced drought tolerance in plants, a thorough perception of physiological, biochemical and gene regulatory networks is essential. Recent functional genomics tools have facilitated the progress in our understanding of stress signaling and of the linked molecular regulatory networks. This has revealed several stress-inducible genes and various transcription and signaling factors that regulate the drought stress-inducible systems. Translational genomics of these drought specific genes using model plants have provided encouraging outcomes, but the in-depth knowledge of the specific roles of various metabolites in plant stress tolerance will lead to evolvement of strategies for the phytoengineering of drought tolerance in plants in future.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agenomics 3aplant genetics 3aplant stress 3aregulator genes 3asignal transduction 3astress tolerance 3awater stress1 aDey, M.1 aSahoo, L.1 aPanda, S.

We have previously investigated carrion-associated rove beetle communities across various forests and demonstrated that the study regions are the main drivers of the local rove beetle species pool that is, in turn, able to colonize a carcass. Nevertheless, little is known about their temporal variation in community composition during the decomposition process. The aim of our study has been to analyze the temporal changes of the composition of the rove beetle community and to identify new, potentially useful candidate species for forensic entomological evaluations. We determined 80 rove beetle species that were attracted to 60 piglet cadavers across various forest stands in Germany. Both the abundance and the community composition changed over the decomposition process, independently of the species-specific geographical variation across study regions. In the region Schorfheide-Chorin, species from the genus Philonthus proved to be a suitable group for future forensic entomological investigations. They appeared in markedly high numbers at piglet cadavers from the bloated stage until the advanced decay stage. For the study region Schwäbische Alb, we newly describe the species Omalium septentrionis as a member of the carrion-associated rove beetle fauna.

Here, we show that the set of C. reinhardtii signalâmimic compounds that activate the CepR AHL receptor of Burkholderia cepacia are susceptible to inactivation by AiiA, an AHL lactonase enzyme of Bacillus. Inactivation of these algal mimics by AiiA suggests that the CepRâstimulatory class of mimics produced by C. reinhardtii may have a conserved lactone ring structure in common with AHL QS signals. To examine the role of AHL mimic compounds in the interactions of C. reinhardtii with bacteria, the aiiA gene codon optimized for Chlamydomonas was generated for the expression of AiiA as a chimeric fusion with cyan fluorescent protein (AimC). Culture filtrates of transgenic strains expressing the fusion protein AimC had significantly reduced levels of CepR signalâmimic activities. When parental and transgenic algae were cultured with a natural pond water bacterial community, a morphologically distinct, AHLâproducing isolate of Aeromonas veronii was observed to colonize the transgenic algal cultures and form biofilms more readily than the parental algal cultures, indicating that secretion of the CepR signal mimics by the alga can significantly affect its interactions with bacteria it encounters in natural environments. The parental alga was also able to sequester and/or destroy AHLs in its growth media to further disrupt or manipulate bacterial QS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas veronii 3aBurkholderia cepacia 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aagonists 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3aculture filtrates 3aculture media 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahomoserine 3asecretion1 aTeplitski, Max1 aAnil Kumar,1 aKrediet, Cory J.1 aSayre, Richard T.1 aBauer, Wolfgang D.0 tJournal of phycology.g2011 Oct., v. 47, no. 5 p.1219-1227dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-36467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2011.01049.x  aDNAL 7aarticle04144naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245017300170300001600343520269400359592002803053650001403081650001803095650002703113650001103140650002603151650001203177650001303189650001503202650001603217650000903233650001703242653003803259653002303297653001903320653006403339653003003403653001803433700002103451700001803472773011303490856008603603852000903689655001203698IND60567242120221121014202.0180831e20160720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056724212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.03.1402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAfshari, Hamid10aUsing failure mode and effects analysis to evaluate barriers to the greening of existing buildings using the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating system  ap. 195-203.  aDespite a recent increase in the greening of existing buildings, the literature continues to focus on investigating barriers to the greening of new buildings. The goal of this research was to develop a method using failure mode and effects analysis to investigate the barriers to the greening of existing buildings using the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design version 4 for Building Operations and Maintenance: Existing Buildings rating system. Its specific objectives included using this method to 1) investigate potential failure modes when certifying existing buildings using this rating system, as well as their causes and effects, 2) rank failure modes, effects and causes in order of priority and 3) identify opportunities and lessons learned from implementing this method. The research involved bringing together a focus group of five local experts who were familiar with the rating system for a one-day workshop. The experts, along with the research team, were tasked with identifying these potential failure modes along with their causes, effects and detection controls and with rating the probability of occurrence of the failure modes, the severity of the failure effects and the ease of detection of the failure controls. The analysis of the workshop data showed that over half of the identified failure causes were technical in nature, with financial causes and organizational causes representing 14% and 11% of all failure causes, respectively. The analysis also showed the intricate relationship between technical, financial, organizational, social and environmental factors; therefore, these different factors need to be integrated and interlinked, rather than compartmentalized and separated. This research provided a new comprehensive method based on the use of failure mode and effects analysis to evaluate the risks to the greening of existing buildings using the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating system. Workshop participants found failure mode and effects analysis to be an excellent method for identifying, evaluating and ranking green building certification risks because it helped to foster interdisciplinary collaboration between participants from various disciplines, as well as between researchers and industry stakeholders. Nevertheless, there is a need for future applications of the method to limit the scope of the analysis to specific categories or credits of the rating system. This narrow scope would facilitate the analysis of the workshop data and enable a more in-depth and comprehensive analysis of all risks and risk types, including ones that traditionally tend to be ignored, such as organizational and social risks.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acertification 3adesign for environment 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3aexperts 3aindustry 3aleadership 3aresearchers 3arisk 3astakeholders 0aFailure mode and effects analysis 0aExisting buildings 0aGreen building 0aLeadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating system 0aOperation and maintenance 0aRisk analysis1 aIssa, Mohamed H.1 aRadwan, Ahmed0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 July 20, v. 127 p.195-203dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.03.1403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245011700210300001800327520163400345592002801979650001502007650001302022650002002035650002002055650001602075650002702091650001102118650001302129650001402142650001302156650001502169650001602184650001602200650001602216651000902232700006402241700002502305700003002330773015202360856008302512852000902595655001202604IND60763708720221118053233.0220121e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076370872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16242-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGharakezloo,

The main contribution of the paper is developing a hybrid statistical decision-making model for evaluating the vulnerability of Shiraz aquifer, southern Iran, with modified DRASTIC (depth to the water table, net recharge, aquifer media, soil media, topography, impact of the vadose zone, and hydraulic conductivity) by using the genetic algorithm (GA), the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method, and factorial analysis (FA). First, considering the variation of the uncertain parameters, 32 scenarios were defined to perform factorial analysis. Then using the AHP method and GA, DRASTIC parameters were rated and weighted in all scenarios. To achieve the optimal weights for parameters, the objective function in GA was maximizing the correlation coefficient between the vulnerability index and the nitrate concentration. The single and interactive effects of parameters on groundwater vulnerability were analyzed by factorial analysis. The results revealed that the net recharge had the highest single effect, and the resulted effect between net recharge and hydraulic conductivity was the most significant interactive effect on the objective function. Besides, the variation of aquifer media does not change the objective function. The application of the proposed method leads to a precise groundwater vulnerability map. This research provides valuable knowledge for assessing groundwater vulnerability and enables decision-makers to apply groundwater vulnerability information in future water resources management plans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aaquifers 3adecision making 3afactor analysis 3agroundwater 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amodels 3anitrates 3apollution 3aresearch 3atopography 3auncertainty 3avadose zone 3awater table 3aIran1 aNikoo, Mohammad Reza1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3740-43891 aKarimi-Jashni, Ayoub1 aMooselu, Mehrdad Ghorbani0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 6 p.8597-8612dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16242-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245006000174300001600234520104700250536017301297592002801470596009501498650002101593650001701614650001801631650001301649650001201662650001501674650001501689650001501704650001301719650001101732650002401743650001001767651001201777653001701789653002201806653002401828700002901852700002201881773012701903856008502030852000902115655001202124IND60686015320221122004559.0200312e20191102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068601532DNAL7 a10.1080/1747423X.2020.17192242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrăgan, Magdalena10aMountain wood-pastures and forest cover loss in Romania  ap. 397-409.  aCurrently, land cover changes occur in wood-pastures all over Europe driven by abandonment of traditional farming, as well as by management and policy changes. Based on reviewing of official documents, semi-structured interviews and one case study we examined how policies and governance settings for mountain wood-pastures have led to forest cover loss in Romania. In general, wood-pastures are formal agricultural land-use areas subjected to both agriculture and forest policies. A dense tree cover and less strict forestry rules than those for formal forests contributed to the increased vulnerability of mountain wood-pastures towards tree cover loss. Additionally, under the European agricultural regulations, areas covered by trees and shrubs are not subsidized, likely leading to tree cover loss resulting from the clearing of these areas. This paper contributes to the larger discussion about widespread post-communist land cover changes in Europe, by emphasizing the magnitude of this phenomenon in mountain wood-pastures in Romania.  aThis work was supported by a grant from the Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P4-ID-PCCF-2016-0084, within PNCDI III.  aPublisher supplied data  aPN-III-P4-ID-PCCF-2016-0084cRomanian Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI 3aagricultural law 3acase studies 3aforest policy 3aforestry 3aforests 3agovernance 3ainterviews 3aland cover 3aland use 3ashrubs 3atraditional farming 3atrees 3aRomania 0aWood-pasture 0aforest cover loss 0aagricultural policy1 aMureşan, Gabriela-Alina1 aBenedek, József,0 tJournal of land use science.g2019 Nov. 2, v. 14, no. 4-6 p.397-409dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000108x1747-42487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1747423X.2020.17192243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03111naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011600164300001400280520159900294592002801893650002101921650001301942650002301955650002301978650001902001650001402020650001402034650001402048650002102062650001802083650001702101650001402118650002502132650001302157650001202170653001302182653001102195653001102206653001002217653000902227653000902236700001502245700001702260700001502277700001602292700001902308700001402327700001802341773010402359856008502463852000902548655001202557IND60562807120221120231536.0180831e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056280712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2016.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Feng10aCharacterization and distinction of two flagellar systems in extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli PCN033  ap. 69-79.  aExtraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) can invade and colonize multiple extraintestinal tissues and can cause a wide range of infections; however the mechanisms of its pathogenicity are not well understood. Flagella contribute to the infection of E. coli strains by mediating adhesion and invasion. Our previous bioinformatic analysis revealed two flagella gene clusters in the genome of an ExPEC isolate, PCN033. One encodes the conventional flagellum system (Flag-1) and the other encodes the Flag-2 system, whose function is uncharacterized. Here we aimed to characterize these two flagellum systems and determine their contributions to the flagellum formation and certain pathogenicity-associated phenotypes. Our observations support the involvement of Flag-1 system, but not Flag-2 system, in the synthesis and maturation of the flagellum structure, and in mediating bacterial swimming and swarming. Moreover, flgD, which encodes a flagellar-hook scaffolding protein in the Flag-1 system, is required for flagellum assembly by influencing the production of FliC (flagellin). Deletion of flgD attenuated ExPEC strain PCN033 invasion and colonization in vivo, probably by affecting bacterial adhesion and invasion, and by reducing resistance to phagocytosis by circulating monocytes. In contrast, these phenotypes were not observed in the strain with deletion of lfgD, encoding the FlgD-like protein in the Flag-2 system. Taken together, these findings indicate that Flag-1 flagellum system is the determinative component of bacterial flagella that contributes to the infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aadhesion 3abacterial adhesion 3abacterial motility 3abioinformatics 3aflagellin 3aflagellum 3amonocytes 3amultigene family 3apathogenicity 3aphagocytosis 3aphenotype 3ascaffolding proteins 3aswarming 3atissues 0aFlagella 0aFlag-1 0aFlag-2 0aExPEC 0aflgD 0alfgD1 aFu, Jiyang1 aLiu, Canying1 aChen, Jing1 aSun, Minhua1 aChen, Huanchun1 aTan, Chen1 aWang, Xiangru0 tMicrobiological research.g2017 Mar., v. 196 p.69-79dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2016.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012800173500001900301520156200320592002801882650002801910650002001938650001601958650001301974650001001987653002101997653001002018653000902028653003202037653003702069700001802106700002302124700002202147773009902169856008602268852000902354655001202363IND60734911020221120080259.0210603e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073491102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.firesaf.2021.1033532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLouter, Christian10aStructural response of fire-exposed laminated glass beams under sustained loads; exploratory experiments and FE-Simulations  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis paper investigates the structural response of laminated glass beams under combined fire-exposure and sustained in-plane loading. This is done by means of experimental testing and Finite Element (FE) numerical modelling. Firstly, small-scale (1 m long) laminated glass beams are tested under thermal exposure and in-plane loading on a small fire resistance test furnace. From the test results it can be seen that laminated glass beams are able to sustain an imposed in-plane load for a time of 34–51 min before failing according to the limiting rate of deflection as defined in EN 1363–1:2012. It should be noted, however, that the observed failure times are strictly related to the boundary conditions applied in the test, i.e. the magnitude of mechanical loads (in this study a relatively small load of P = 1.15 kN was applied) and the presence of an inherent top zone protection, which may have positively affected the results. Secondly, additional FE thermo-mechanical simulations are performed to further investigate the mechanical response of the laminated glass beams under thermal exposure, with a focus on the effects of the top zone protection and the load magnitude on the performance of the examined laminated glass beams. From the FE study it can be seen that reducing the top zone protection (from 40 mm to 0 mm) results in a reduction in failure time from 45 min to 20 min, while increasing the load with a factor 5 (taking 30 mm top zone protection as a reference) results in a reduction of failure time from 32 to 18 min.  aPublisher supplied data 3afinite element analysis 3afire resistance 3afire safety 3afurnaces 3aglass 0aStructural glass 0aBeams 0aFire 0aFire resistance experiments 0aFE thermo-mechanical simulations1 aBedon, Chiara1 aKozłowski, Marcin1 aNussbaumer, Alain0 tFire safety journal.g2021 July, v. 123 p.103353-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3526x0379-71127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.firesaf.2021.1033533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02167naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013200168300001600300520096600316592002801282650001401310650000901324650002201333650001501355650002201370650001501392651001201407651001801419651001201437700002001449700002301469700002101492700001901513700002201532700001901554773010601573856008101679852000901760655001201769IND60575696620221123030959.0170728e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057569662DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954170100822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhrunyk, Yu.

The analysis of 134 fish samples revealed 30 haplotypes, 23 of which were new. Among haplotypes, previously detected in Eurasia and North America, EB30 was the most frequently found in Western Siberia (45.5% frequency). The results of our study are in agreement with previous research pointing to the genetic differentiation of two burbot subspecies, L. l. lota and L. l. maculosa, and indicate that burbot inhabiting the Ob-Irtysh and Taz river basins belong to the Eurasian-Beringian clade (nominative subspecies L. l. lota). However, a high genetic diversity of burbot in Western Siberia, along with a relatively high differentiation of burbot groups within studied territory, points to a regional specificity of burbot population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLota lota 3afish 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondrial DNA 3awatersheds 3aEurasia 3aNorth America 3aSiberia1 aBogdanov, V.

We found that all investigated coactivator complexes participate in transcription of this gene, as significant level of them were present at the gene promoter in its active state. For most of the coactivators (except for p300/CBP, Set2, and Mediator complex), we also observed a considerable increase of their binding level at the coding region of the gene after activation of its transcription by heat shock. We assume that coactivators CHD1, ISWI, Brm, Kismet-L, INO80, Mi-2, Gcn5, Lid/KDM5, Set1, DART1, DART4, SSRP1, PAF1, and Fs(1)h/Brd4 bind to the promoter of the active hsp70 gene and migrate to its coding region together with elongating RNA polymerase II. It can be suggested that some of these coactivators play an important role in stimulating the transition of the RNA polymerase II complex from transcription initiation to elongation stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3agenes 3aheat stress 3atranscription (genetics)1 aDerevyanko, P.

The results showed that the mercury removal efficiency of [Formula: see text] under simulated flue gas (SFG) conditions at 150 °C could reach 91%, which was higher than [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. Compared with [Formula: see text], the introduction of Fe increased the proportion of [Formula: see text], which was usually linked to [Formula: see text], resulting in the generation of more [Formula: see text](CuᴵSᴵ) species. Meanwhile, the generation of active sulfur sites such as [Formula: see text] was generated, which had a facilitative effect on the oxidation of Hg⁰. Stable [Formula: see text] was the predominant product on the adsorbent surface. The 2% sulfur loadings had significantly improved the sulfur resistance of conventional AC.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019YFE0100100cThe Nation Key Research and Development Program of China 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acoal 3aflue gas 3amercury 3aoxidation 3apollution 3aresearch 3asulfides 3asulfur1 aGuo, Xin1 aWu, Bang0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Sept., v. 29, no. 41 p.62393-62403dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-17409-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03472naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245014700161300002000308520219500328592002802523650001102551650002302562650002302585650002002608650001302628650001402641650001702655650001102672650002202683650001702705650002802722651001802750700001502768700005502783773015602838856008302994852000903077655001203086IND60792900520221119125629.0220911e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079290052DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-20061-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Juan10aEcological efficiency evaluation and driving factor analysis of the coupling coordination of the logistics industry and manufacturing industry  ap. 62458-62474.  aThe coupling coordination of the logistics industry and manufacturing industry is conducive to the sustainable development of logistics and manufacturing and the stability of sustainable supply chain. The logistics and manufacturing industries are not only the basic industries that support social development, but also the industries with high carbon emissions. This paper constructs the measurement system of coupling coordinating ecological efficiency of two industries based on carbon emission constraints and finds out the driving factors affecting ecological efficiency, which is of great significance to the low-carbon coordinated development of the two industries in the future. Firstly, this paper classifies the carbon emissions from the logistics industry and manufacturing industry as undesirable outputs and evaluates the ecological efficiency of the logistics industry (LEE) and manufacturing industry (MEE) in the three urban agglomerations from 2006 to 2019 by using the unexpected slacks-based measure (SBM) model. Secondly, the coupling coordination method is used to analyze the coupling coordination scheduling of industrial ecological efficiency (MLCC). Finally, the spatial econometric model is used to analyze the driving factors of the MLCC. The results show that during the study period, the coupling coordination of the three urban agglomerations continued to grow, the Pearl River Delta coupling coordination is the highest, the Yangtze River Delta coupling coordination grew the fastest, and the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei coupling coordination grew slightly slower. The development during the 13th Five-Year Plan period is obviously faster than that during the 11th and 12th Five-Year Plan. The empirical analysis results of spatial econometrics show that the driving factors have an impact on the coupling coordination degree of the three urban agglomerations, but the significance of each factor is different. The driving factors have significant spatial heterogeneity. The three urban agglomerations should formulate low-carbon industry development policies in line with local development according to the actual situation of each region and local conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aeconometric models 3aempirical research 3afactor analysis 3aindustry 3apollution 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3aspatial variation 3asupply chain 3asustainable development 3aYangtze River1 aShen, Tong1 aJin, Shuxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0425-48630 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Sept., v. 29, no. 41 p.62458-62474dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-20061-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009100166300001300257520103100270592002801301650002101329650003101350650001701381650001101398650003201409650001501441650001101456650001501467650001101482650002201493650000701515650003001522650001501552650001601567650001401583653002201597653003101619653001101650653000901661653002001670700001501690700001601705700001501721700001301736700001301749700001801762773010301780856008501883852000901968655001201977IND60562807420221121054103.0180831e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056280742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2016.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chunyan10aCharacterization and function of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv Lipase Rv1076 (LipU)  ap. 7-16.  aLipids and lipases/esterases are essential for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) survival and persistence, even virulence. Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv Rv1076 (LipU), a member of lipase family, is homologous to the human Hormone Sensitive Lipase (HSL) based on the presence of conserved motif ‘GXSXG’. To define the enzymatic characteristics of rv1076, the gene was cloned, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The protein was purified for enzymatic characterization. LipU showed high specific activity for the hydrolysis of short carbon chain substrates with optimal activity at 40°C/pH 8.0 and stability at low temperature and near-neutral pH. The specific activity, Km and Vmax of LipU was calculated to 176.7U/mg, 1.73μM and 62.24μM/min respectively. Ionic detergents can inhibit its activity. The active-site residues of LipU were determined to be Ser140, Asp244 and His269 by site-directed mutagenesis. The upregulation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis rv1076 under nutritive stress implicates a role in starvation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aactive sites 3acarbon 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3adetergents 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3alipids 3amolecular cloning 3apH 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3astarvation 3atemperature 3avirulence 0aLipases/esterases 0aMycobacterium tuberculosis 0aRv1076 0alipU 0aCharacteristics1 aLi, Qiming1 aZhang, Yuan1 aGong, Zhen1 aRen, Sai1 aLi, Ping1 aXie, Jianping0 tMicrobiological research.g2017 Mar., v. 196 p.7-16dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2016.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245005300165300001400218520144700232592002801679650001901707650001901726650001201745650001301757650001101770650002101781650001001802650001401812650001901826650001001845700002201855773009601877856008101973852000902054655001202063IND50071916820221120145943.0150212e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007191682DNAL7 a10.1007/s11295-013-0662-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAronen, Tuija10aSilver birch telomeres shorten in tissue culture  ap. 67-74.  aShortening of telomeres has been connected with ageing and loss of cell replication or regeneration capacity. The aim of the present study was to examine potential variation in the length of telomeric repeats in silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) using clonal materials consisting of different-aged outdoor trees and tissue cultures of seven genotypes. The overall average length of telomeres was 13.6 kb (±0.3), the minimum length of repeats in the different genotypes varied from 5.9 kb (±0.5) to 9.6 kb (±0.6), and the maximum length varied from 15.3 kb (±1.1) to 22.8 kb (±0.4). When germinated seeds and leaf and cambium samples from 15- and 80-year-old trees were compared, no correlation of ageing and the length of telomeric repeats was found. Positional variation in the telomere length was, however, observed in the cambium of mature trees, the stem base having longer repeats than the upper parts of the tree. Tissue cultures were found to have shorter telomeres than outdoor trees: prolonged culture, callus culture and stressful conditions were all observed to shorten telomeric repeats and should thus be avoided in birch micropropagation. There were significant differences among the studied silver birch genotypes in their telomere length, and these differences were consistent over the sample types. This is the first report on variation of telomeric repeats in a long-living organism studied with clonal materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula pendula 3acallus culture 3acambium 3agenotype 3aleaves 3amicropropagation 3aseeds 3atelomeres 3atissue culture 3atrees1 aRyynänen, Leena,0 tTree genetics & genomes.g2014 Feb., v. 10, no. 1 p.67-74dSpringer-Verlagx1614-29427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11295-013-0662-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015500157300002000312520112000332592002801452650001401480650001101494650001101505650001701516650002601533650002101559650002201580650002201602650001701624650001601641700001601657700001901673773014401692856007401836852000901910655001201919IND60670853020221119100022.0191002e20141118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067085302DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta04252b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Huawei10aTemplate-free method towards quadrate Co₃O₄ nanoboxes from cobalt coordination polymer nano-solids for high performance lithium ion battery anodes  ap. 20597-20604.  aTransition metal oxide hollow architectures are intensively explored for energy conversion and storage applications. Feasible strategies towards various hollow architectures, particularly those with non-spherical skeletons, are especially attractive. Quadrate Co₃O₄ nanoboxes are fabricated through controlled annealing of cobalt coordination polymer nano-solids with tunable dimensions. The cobalt coordination polymer in quadrate wires, cuboids, and cubes is synthesized by temperature and concentration dependent solvothermal method. Evolution of the nanoboxes involves Co₃O₄ shell formation and uniform depletion of the cobalt coordination polymer in the core. Benefitting from the well-defined hollow interior and nanosized crystals, the quadrate nanoboxes have large specific surface and abundant hierarchical pores. When evaluated as anode materials for lithium ion batteries, the boxes exhibited excellent electrochemical properties. Besides a superior storage capability of 1200 mA h g⁻¹ at 0.2 A g⁻¹, a remarkable retention of 625 mA h g⁻¹ at a large rate of 10 A g⁻¹ is also obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3aanodes 3acobalt 3acobalt oxide 3acoordination polymers 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy conversion 3alithium batteries 3ananocrystals 3atemperature1 aShen, Lisha1 aWang, Chengxin0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 Nov. 18, v. 2, no. 48 p.20597-20604dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta04252b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245006300168300001600231520145600247592002801703650001001731650001201741650002501753650001701778650001601795650001601811650001801827650001601845650002101861650002101882650002201903650002901925650001801954650001801972650001701990650000902007650002102016650002202037650001402059651001802073700002202091773012402113856008502237852000902322655001202331IND60548799020221119163205.0160905e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054879902DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM-08-13-0161-RW2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTimm, Derek A.10aREVIEW: Wild Rice: Both an Ancient Grain and a Whole Grain  ap. 207-210.  aWild rice (Zizania spp.) grows in shallow waters of North America and is distinct from brown and white rice (Oryza spp.). The recent trends toward gluten-free foods and ancient grains present an opportunity for increased interest in the health benefits of wild rice. Wild rice is classified as a whole grain and typically contains 75% carbohydrate, 6.2% dietary fiber, 14.7% protein, and 1.1% lipids. Wild rice is a good source of dietary fiber and has nearly double the amount of protein of white rice. The lipid content is low; however, most of the lipids are essential omega-6 (35.0–37.8%) and omega-3 (20.0–31.5%) fatty acids. In addition to macronutrient content, wild rice contains phytosterol levels several times higher than white rice. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity of wild rice is 10–15 times higher than white rice. A series of rat studies in which wild rice was added to a high fat, high cholesterol diet found significant attenuation of serum free fatty acids, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels while maintaining higher high-density lipoprotein levels compared with a control diet. The exact explanation of the protective mechanism of wild rice is uncertain, but the dietary fiber, phytosterol, or antioxidant capacity of wild rice may be the reason for it. Current interest in whole grains and gluten-free diets, as well as antioxidants and phytochemicals, makes wild rice an attractive grain addition to the diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza 3aZizania 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3adietary fiber 3afatty acids 3afree fatty acids 3agluten-free diet 3agluten-free foods 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahigh fat diet 3alipid content 3aphytosterols 3arats 3atriacylglycerols 3awhole grain foods 3awild rice 3aNorth America1 aSlavin, Joanne L.0 tCereal chemistry.g2014 May, v. 91, no. 3 p.207-210dThe American Association of Cereal Chemists, Inc.x0009-03527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FCCHEM-08-13-0161-RW3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245015600206300001600362520095500378592002801333650001801361650003201379650001901411650001001430650002801440650001501468650001701483650001801500650002801518650002001546650001201566650002001578650001601598650001301614650001701627650002601644650001701670650001201687653001301699653002701712653002201739653002001761700003001781700001801811773011201829856008201941852000902023655001202032IND60657104920221121232007.0190916e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065710492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2019.08.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrishnan, Rahul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2492-094X10aFunctional characterization of seven-band grouper immunoglobulin like cell adhesion molecule, Nectin4 as a cellular receptor for nervous necrosis virus  ap. 720-725.  aNectin-4/PVRL4 belonging to the family of immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecules was identified as a potential cellular receptor for several animal viruses. Here we show that nervous necrosis virus that causes viral nervous necrosis in teleosts uses the same receptor in its life cycle. Transfection of SSN-1 cell lines with an expression vector encoding Nectin-4 rendered them to be more susceptible to NNV. Immunofluorescence microscopy on Nectin-4 expressing cells revealed that the protein interacted with NNV specifically. A virus binding assay indicated that Nectin-4 was a bonafide receptor that supported virus attachment to the host cell whereas siRNA directed against Nectin-4 blocked NNV infections in grouper primary brain cells. Results of the present study will improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of NNV infection and provide a target for the development of novel antiviral interventions in marine finfish aquaculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetanodavirus 3aHyporthodus septemfasciatus 3aanimal viruses 3abrain 3acell adhesion molecules 3acell lines 3afish culture 3afish diseases 3afluorescence microscopy 3agenetic vectors 3agrouper 3aimmunoglobulins 3amarine fish 3anecrosis 3apathogenesis 3asmall interfering RNA 3atransfection 3aviruses 0aNectin-4 0aNervous necrosis virus 0aCellular receptor 0asiRNA silencing1 aQadiri, Syed Shariq Nazir1 aOh, Myung-Joo0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2019 Oct., v. 93 p.720-725dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2019.08.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024001800123040001800141100002000159245008800179300001600267520088000283592002801163650002401191650002201215650001101237650001601248650001101264650001801275650001301293650001701306650001801323650001801341650001401359650002201373650001501395650001001410650001001420650001101430650001801441650000901459651001201468653002401480653002001504653001801524653002201542653002201564700002301586700001801609700002601627773015601653856007501809852000901884655001201893IND60595079420221121054843.0180526e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059507942DNAL7 a10.1638/2016-0057.12doi4 azamd-48-03-27  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiley, Jennifer10aDisseminated toxoplasmosis in a captive adult dromedary camel (camelus dromedarius)  ap. 937-940.  aAn 11-yr-old dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) at a zoo in south Florida presented with diarrhea while being treated with enrofloxacin and dexamethasone for a chronic skin condition.

The animal became increasingly debilitated, developed hemorrhagic diarrhea, declined rapidly over the next 3 days, and died despite aggressive fluid therapy and supportive care. Histologic examination revealed intralesional protozoal tissue cysts consistent with Toxoplasma gondii in the intestines, lungs, and liver, as well as lymphoid depletion of the spleen suggesting immunosuppression.

It is concluded that the process by which the White Paper was produced may be of greater long term significance than the document itself. There has recently been a considerable change in the rhetoric of environmental policy and environmental issues are now taken seriously across all Whitehall departments. However, potential conflicts between environmental objectives and energy issues, notably electricity privatisation, mean that it has been difficult for the Government to establish a proactive environmental policy. Consequently, many challenges remain to be faced during the 1990s.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenvironmental policy 3aprivatization0 tEnergy & environment.g, v. 2, no. 2 p.103-114dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26865x2048-40707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0958305X91002002013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04231naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013200170300001600302520253700318592002802855650001102883650002502894650001802919650001702937650002102954650003802975650003403013650001103047650002303058650002003081650002803101650001103129650000803140650001403148650002103162650001903183650001603202650002203218650002603240650001503266650001003281653001603291653002103307653001103328653003103339653001903370700001603389700002303405700002103428700002103449773009203470856008203562852000903644655001203653IND60630395820221123004015.0190321e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063039582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2018.10.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBacchetti, Tiziana10aRelationship of fruit and vegetable intake to dietary antioxidant capacity and markers of oxidative stress: A sex-related study  ap. 164-172.  aOxidative stress contributes to the development of chronic diseases. Fruits and vegetables contain several phytonutrients (carotenoids, polyphenols) that exert antioxidant effects. The aim of this study was to investigate sex differences in fruit and vegetable intake, and the relationship to plasma levels of carotenoids as well as to total antioxidant capacity (pTAC). We studied also sex differences in the relationship between fruit and vegetables intake and plasma levels of lipid hydroperoxides, as well as of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL).This study included 83 healthy adults (35 men and 48 women, mean age 40 ± 10 y). Dietary intake of carotenoids and total antioxidant capacity (dTAC) were evaluated on the basis of a 15-d food frequency questionnaire. Plasma levels of β-carotene, lutein, and pTAC were studied. Moreover, levels of plasma lipid hydroperoxides and ox-LDL were evaluated using the ferrous oxidation-xylenol orange 2 (FOX2) assay and a monoclonal antibody–based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedure, respectively.Dietary habits were sex-related with a higher intake of fruits and vegetables (P < 0.05) and β-carotene (P < 0.001) in women than in men. Mean values of plasma lutein and β-carotene were higher in women than in men. Mean values of ox-LDL and lipid hydroperoxides were higher in men than in women (P < 0.05). Significant negative correlations were established between the individual values of ox-LDL and the levels of lutein versus β-carotene and versus pTAC values in plasma in both groups. Individuals belonging to the tertile with the highest daily intake of fruits and vegetables or the highest daily dTAC showed the lowest levels of plasma ox-LDL. In each category, sex-related differences were observed with men showing higher levels of ox-LDL than women. Moreover, lower levels of plasma β-carotene were observed in men in each tertile of daily intake of fruits and vegetables compared with females.Based on the data obtained, we confirm that high fruit and vegetable consumption exerts a positive effect on antioxidant defenses and decreases oxidative damage of plasma lipoproteins for both sexes. The results suggest that the protective effect can be found to a higher extent in women than in men. Sex-based differences are apparent in many chronic diseases. Thus, a higher consumption of antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables should be recommended in efforts to prevent diseases in which sex-related differences in oxidative stress play a considerable role.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aantioxidant activity 3abeta-carotene 3ablood lipids 3achronic diseases 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afruits 3agender differences 3alipid peroxides 3alow density lipoprotein 3alutein 3amen 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aphytonutrients 3apolyphenols 3aprotective effect 3avegetable consumption 3avegetables 3awomen 0aCarotenoids 0aoxidative stress 0agender 0afruit and vegetable intake 0adietary habits1 aTurco, Imma1 aUrbano, Antonietta1 aMorresi, Camilla1 aFerretti, Gianna0 tNutrition.g2019 May, v. 61 p.164-172dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2018.10.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012500160300001800285520144300303592002801746650002301774650002401797650001301821650001301834650001901847650001401866650001601880650001301896650002201909650001601931650001601947650001501963700001801978700001701996773012202013856007402135852000902209655001202218IND60618214220221119220629.0181029e20180212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061821422DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra13174g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDixit, Tejendra10aInsights into non-noble metal based nanophotonics: exploration of Cr-coated ZnO nanorods for optoelectronic applications  ap. 6820-6833.  aHerein, the room temperature photoluminescence and Raman spectra of hydrothermally grown ZnO nanorods coated with Cr are investigated for optoelectronic applications. A thorough examination of the photoluminescence spectra of Cr coated ZnO nanorods showed the suppression of deep level emissions by more than twenty five times with Cr coating compared to that of pristine ZnO nanorods. Moreover, the underlying mechanism was proposed and can be attributed to the formation of Schottky contacts between Cr and ZnO resulting in defect passivation, weak exciton–plasmon coupling, enhanced electric field effect and formation of hot carriers due to interband transitions. Interestingly, with the increase in sputtering time, the ratio of the intensities corresponding to the band gap emission and deep level emission was observed to increase from 6.2 to 42.7, suggesting its application for UV only emission. Further, a planar photodetector was fabricated (Ag–ZnO–Ag planar configuration) and it was observed that the dark current value got reduced by more than ten times with Cr coating, thereby opening up its potential for transistor applications. Finally, Cr coated ZnO nanorods were employed for green light sensing. Our results demonstrated that ZnO nanorods decorated with Cr shed light on developing stable and high-efficiency non-noble metal based nanoplasmonic devices such as photodetectors, phototransistors and solar cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3achromium 3acoatings 3aelectric field 3aemissions 3agreen light 3ananorods 3aphotoluminescence 3asolar cells 3atransistors 3azinc oxide1 aPalani, I.

For the first time, the role of CH3COOH as a capping agent in the formation of flower-like structure was investigated. The as-prepared flower-like Bi2O3 had a high activity on the degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) under simulated solar light irradiation due to the narrow band gap of 2.69eV, high percentage of β-Bi2O3 as well as high intensity of polar facets (120) and (200). Meanwhile, the photocatalytic degradation followed apparent pseudo-first-order kinetics. The rate constant (k) increased from 0.7×10⁻² to 3.0×10⁻²min⁻¹ with the catalyst loading varying from 0.5 to 2.0gL⁻¹. Increasing pH values from 3 to 11 led to the decrease of k from 2.2×10⁻² to 0.2×10⁻²min⁻¹, which could be attributed to the electrostatic adsorption between SMX molecules and Bi2O3. The radical quenching experiments showed both direct (h⁺) and indirect oxidation (OH and O2-) happened in this process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3airradiation 3alighting 3aoxidation 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3arhodamines 3asolar radiation 3asulfamethoxazole 3asuperoxide anion 0aFlower-like Bi2O3 0aAcetic acid 0aGrowth mechanism 0aPhotocatalytic activity 0aDegradation mechanism1 aLim, Teik-Thye1 aZhong, Ziyi1 aWang, Rong1 aHu, Xiao0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 505 p.489-499dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2017.05.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245011700165300001600282500002000298520105900318592002801377596007801405650001101483650001801494650001001512650001301522650000901535650000901544650001601553650001101569651001001580700001701590700002301607700001901630700002001649700002001669700006001689773012201749856007401871852000901945655001201954IND60787099320221118170242.0220807e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078709932DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.147362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoudhury, Hrishikesh10aDescription of a new species of Mustura Kottelat (Teleostei: Nemacheilidae) from the Brahmaputra drainage, India  ap. 450-461.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMustura subhashi, new species, is described from the Dikal River, a north bank tributary of the Brahmaputra drainage in Arunachal Pradesh. It is distinguished from all its congeners by having a colour pattern of 14–23 dark‐greyish black to dark brown irregular bars on a greyish to pale beige body; pre‐dorsal bars thin, numerous, wider than interspaces, weakly contrasted, uniting dorsally at lateral one‐third or midway on flank to form thicker bars, coalescing further at lateral one‐fifth and continuous on dorsum with contralateral bars; bars below dorsal fin exhibiting similar condition but slightly wider than pre‐dorsal bars; post‐dorsal bars thicker than anterior bars, wider than interspaces, sharply contrasted, rarely coalescing on flank; and a short bar along the caudal mid‐line, rarely forming a blotch.

Correlated response in early embryo survival, embryonic development, size of embryos, and size of embryonic coats after four generations of selection was estimated. A total of 429 embryos from 51 high-line females and 648 embryos from 80 low-line females were used in the experiment. The traits studied were percentage of normal embryos, embryo diameter, zona pellucida thickness, and mucin coat thickness. Traits were measured at 24, 48, and 72 hours postcoitum (hpc); mucin coat thickness was only measured at 48 and 72 hpc. The embryos were classified as zygotes or two-cell embryos at 24 hpc; 16-cell embryos or early morulae at 48 hpc; and early morulae, compacted morulae, or blastocyst at 72 hpc. At 24 hpc, the percentage of normal embryos in the high line was lower than in the low line (−2.5%), and embryos in the high line showed 10% higher zona pellucida thickness than those of the low line. No differences in percentage of zygotes or two-cell embryos were found. At 48 hpc, the high-line embryos were less developed, with a higher percentage of 16-cell embryos (23.4%) and a lower percentage of early morulae (−23.4%). At 72 hpc, high-line embryos continued to be less developed, showing higher percentages of early morulae and compact morulae and lower percentages of blastocyst (−1.8%). No differences in embryo diameter or mucin coat thickness were found at any time. In conclusion, selection for litter size variability has consequences on early embryonic survival and development, with embryos presenting a lower state of development and a lower percentage of normal embryos in the line selected for higher variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablastocyst 3aembryogenesis 3afemales 3alitter size 3amucins 3arabbits 3azona pellucida 3azygote 0aEmbryonic development 0aEmbryonic coat 0aLitter size variability 0aRabbit 0aSelection1 aBlasco, A.1 aArgente, M.J.0 tTheriogenology.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 86, no. 5 p.1247-1250dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2016.04.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02243naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024001800123040001800141100002100159245006900180300001600249520098100265592002801246650001801274650001501292650001401307650002101321650001101342650000901353650000901362650001201371650001101383653003201394653001301426653001201439653001601451653000901467653001201476700003001488700002301518700001701541773015501558856007501713852000901788655001201797IND60595079720221122225241.0180526e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059507972DNAL7 a10.1638/2016-0064.12doi4 azamd-48-01-21  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJames, Lauren E.10aEvaluation of feeding behavior as an indicator of pain in snakes  ap. 196-199.  aThe necessity to prevent and manage pain in reptiles is becoming increasingly important, as their use in scientific research and popularity as exotic pets continues to rise. It was hypothesized that feeding behavior would provide an adequate indicator of pain perception in the ball python (Python regius). Normal feeding was defined the previous week, where a dead rodent was struck within 12 sec (n = 10). Eighteen pythons were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: anesthesia only (AO), chemical noxious stimulus (CS; capsaicin injection), or surgical noxious stimulus (SS; surgical incision). The time to strike was recorded 4 hr after the procedure and weekly during the subsequent 3 wk. Delayed feeding was observed in animals in the CS and SS groups, and normal feeding resumed after 1 and 3 wk, respectively. Spontaneous feeding remained uninterrupted for the AO group. These findings demonstrate feeding behavior as a potential model to assess pain in snakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPython regius 3aanesthesia 3acapsaicin 3afeeding behavior 3amodels 3apain 3apets 3arodents 3asnakes 0aBall python (Python regius) 0abehavior 0afeeding 0anociception 0apain 0areptile1 aWilliams, Catherine J.

Tissue and sediment pesticide concentrations were below detection limits in all samples, whereas sediment and tissue metal concentrations exceeded environmental thresholds at several locations. Tissue MT and ChE biomarkers varied by a factor of 5–6 between locations. Inhibition of cholinesterase activity was negligible for all 5 sites, despite spatial–temporal variation in ChE activity, consistent with below-detection OP concentrations. Tissue MT and ChE biomarkers correlated with tissue and metal sediment concentrations, yet, statistically significant covariance between biomarkers and water chemistry parameters was also observed, indicating that both, metal concentrations and physical–chemical variables, are likely to be responsible for generating the observed spatial–temporal variations in biomarker patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acholinesterase 3acovariance 3adissolved oxygen 3ahydrochemistry 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3apH 3apesticides 3apollution 3aresearch 3asalinity 3asediments 3atemperature 3aCaribbean 3aColombia1 aGómez-Cubillos, Maria Camila1 aLuna-Acosta, Andrea1 aVillamil, Luisa1 aCasseres-Ruiz, Samuel1 aAhrens, Michael J.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Apr., v. 29, no. 17 p.25157-25183dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-17644-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04440naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001900158245018900177300001800366520264000384592002803024650001703052650002003069650001203089650001103101650002303112650001703135650001503152650002003167650002403187650001603211650001503227650001403242650001203256650001303268650001303281650001903294650001103313650002303324650001903347650001603366653001603382653001503398653001303413653001003426653001303436653001203449700003203461700001803493700002003511700002303531700002303554700001903577700001803596773011003614856009303724852000903817655001203826IND60525233320221121005614.0190318e20160915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052523332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2016.04.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLegendre, Marc10aAdaptations of semen characteristics and sperm motility to harsh salinity: Extreme situations encountered by the euryhaline tilapia Sarotherodon melanotheron heudelotii (Dumeril, 1859)  ap. 1251-1267.  aIn most teleost fishes, sperm cells are quiescent in the seminal plasma and are activated by either a drop (fresh water fish) or an increase in osmolality (marine fish) when released in the water. It is most interesting to examine how the mechanisms of sperm motility activation can adapt to a broad range of salinities, as applies to some euryhaline species, and particularly to the tilapia Sarotherodon melanotheron heudelotii, which can reproduce at salinities from 0 up to 120 in the wild. Here, the gonado-somatic index, semen characteristics, and the osmotic and ionic requirements of sperm motility activation were compared in S. m. heudelotii reared in fresh water (FW), sea water (SW), or hypersaline water (HW; salinities of 0, 35, and 70, respectively). No salinity-dependent differences were found in gonado-somatic index or semen characteristics, except for an increase of seminal plasma osmolality with increasing salinity (from 318 to 349 mOsm kg−1 in FW and HW fish, respectively). The osmolality range allowing the highest percentages of sperm activation broadened and shifted toward higher values with increasing fish ambient salinity (150–300, 300–800, and 500–1200 mOsm kg−1, for FW, SW, and HW fish, respectively). Nevertheless, at the three fish rearing salinities, sperm could be activated in media that were hypotonic, isotonic, or hypertonic relative to the seminal plasma, at least when some calcium was present above a threshold concentration. The [Ca2+] required for the activation of S. m. heudelotii sperm is (1) higher in fish reared at a higher salinity (2) higher in hypertonic than that in hypotonic activation media, whatever the fish rearing salinity, and (3) higher in the presence of Na+ or K+, the negative effects of which increased with an increase in fish rearing salinity. The [Ca2+]/[Na+] ​ ratios allowing for maximal sperm motility in SW or HW fish are close to those observed in natural environments, either in sea or hypersaline waters. In comparison to most teleosts with external fertilization, the total duration of sperm motility in S. m. heudelotii was exceptionally long (>2 hours regardless the fish rearing salinities). The decrease in sperm activity with increasing time since activation did not result from limiting energy reserves, as the addition of calcium in the activation medium caused most spermatozoa to become motile again. The comparison of sperm characteristics of S. m. heudelotii acclimated from FW to SW or HW with those of fish maintained all lifelong at their native salinity showed that adaptive responses were completed within 2 months or less.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSarotherodon 3aadverse effects 3acalcium 3aenergy 3aeuryhaline species 3afish culture 3afreshwater 3afreshwater fish 3agonadosomatic index 3amarine fish 3aosmolality 3apotassium 3arearing 3asalinity 3aseawater 3aseminal plasma 3asodium 3asperm capacitation 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 0aAcclimation 0aAdaptation 0aSalinity 0aSperm 0aMotility 0aTilapia1 aAlavi, Sayyed Mohammad Hadi1 aDzyuba, Boris1 aLinhart, Otomar1 aProkopchuk, Galina1 aCochet, Christophe1 aDugué, Rémi,1 aCosson, Jacky0 tTheriogenology.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 86, no. 5 p.1251-1267dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2016.04.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03432naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245015400170300001600324520146700340592002801807650002801835650001901863650001001882650001301892650001001905650001501915650003101930650001001961650001401971650002001985650001402005650001902019650001702038650001402055650001402069650002002083653002302103653001502126653002102141653002302162653001602185653001402201653001802215653000802233653000802241653000802249653000802257700001702265700006002282700002102342700006302363700002102426700002402447700002202471700006202493700002402555773011202579856008202691852000902773655001202782IND60657105520221120164444.0190916e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065710552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2019.08.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahmani, Alexandra10aTranscriptomic analysis of clam extrapallial fluids reveals immunity and cytoskeleton alterations in the first week of Brown Ring Disease development  ap. 940-948.  aThe Brown Ring Disease is an infection caused by the bacterium Vibrio tapetis on the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum. The process of infection, in the extrapallial fluids (EPFs) of clams, involves alteration of immune functions, in particular on hemocytes which are the cells responsible of phagocytosis. Disorganization of the actin-cytoskeleton in infected clams is a part of what leads to this alteration. This study is the first transcriptomic approach based on collection of extrapallial fluids on living animals experimentally infected by V. tapetis. We performed differential gene expression analysis of EPFs in two experimental treatments (healthy-against infected-clams by V. tapetis), and showed the deregulation of 135 genes. In infected clams, a downregulation of transcripts implied in immune functions (lysosomal activity and complement- and lectin-dependent PRR pathways) was observed during infection. We also showed a deregulation of transcripts encoding proteins involved in the actin cytoskeleton organization such as an overexpression of β12-Thymosin (which is an actin sequestration protein) or a downregulation of proteins that closely interact with capping proteins such as Coactosin, that counteract action of capping proteins, or Profilin. We validated these transcriptomic results by cellular physiological analyses that showed a decrease of the lysosome amounts and the disorganization of actin cytoskeleton in infected hemocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRuditapes philippinarum 3aVibrio tapetis 3aactin 3abacteria 3aclams 3acomplement 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahemocytes 3aimmune response 3alysosomes 3amicrofilaments 3aphagocytosis 3aprofilins 3ashellfish 3atranscriptomics 0aBrown ring disease 0aV. tapetis 0aR. philippinarum 0aActin cytoskeleton 0aβ-Thymosin 0aCoactosin 0aResting cells 0aABP 0aBRD 0aEPF 0aFSW1 aCorre, Erwan1 aRichard, Gaëlle1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9080-40741 aBidault, Adeline1 aLambert, Christophe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5885-467X1 aOliveira, Louisi1 aThompson, Cristiane1 aThompson, Fabiano1 aPichereau, Vianney1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1078-94071 aPaillard, Christine0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2019 Oct., v. 93 p.940-948dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2019.08.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01764naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008400173300001600257520055400273592002800827650000900855650001800864650001000882650002800892650001200920650002300932650002700955650001000982700002300992700002201015700001901037700002201056700001901078700002001097700002801117773012501145856008701270852000901357655001201366IND60548799820221119162639.0160905e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054879982DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM-07-13-0133-CESI2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarti, Alessandra10aEffect of High-Pressure Processing on the Features of Wheat Milling By-products  ap. 318-320.  aThe ability of high hydrostatic pressure processing to promote changes in both the structural properties of fiber and the interaction of fiber with water were addressed.

Among different intercropping combinations, millet and peanut intercropping can adapt to most of water limited areas. However, there are few studies on the differences of yield characteristics and nitrogen use efficiency between millet-peanut intercropping and monoculture under different nitrogen (N) application rates. The objective of this study was to determine the yield advantages and economic benefits as well as the appropriate N application rate of millet/peanut intercropping. A two-year field experiment was conducted with three cropping patterns (monoculture millet, monoculture peanut and millet/peanut intercropping) and four N rates (0, 75, 150 and 225 kg ha⁻¹). Results showed that land equivalent ratio (LER) and net effect (NE) of intercropping system reached the highest at N input of 150 kg ha⁻¹ in two years (1.04 for LER, 0.347 Mg ha⁻¹ for NE, averaged across two years). Millet was the dominant crop in intercropping system (Aggressivity of millet and peanut (Amp)<0, Competitive ratio of millet and peanut (CRmp)<1), and millet yields achieved the highest value at N inputs of 225 kg ha⁻¹ for monoculture and 150 kg ha⁻¹ for intercropping. NUE reached the highest at N inputs of 150 kg ha⁻¹ for all planting patterns over two years. Intercropping combined with N input of 150 kg ha⁻¹ achieved the highest net incomes of 2791 $ ha⁻¹, with benefit−cost ratios of 1.56, averaged over two years. From a perspective of economy and agricultural sustainable development, millet/peanut intercropping at 150 kg N ha⁻¹ seems to be a promising alternative to millet or peanut monoculture.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagriculture 3afertilizer rates 3afield experimentation 3amillets 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3apeanuts 0amillet 0apeanut 0aintercropping 0aN input 0ayield 0aeconomics1 aNAN, Zhen-wu1 aLIN, Song-ming1 aYU, Hai-qiu1 aXIE, Li-yong1 aMENG, Wei-wei1 aZhang, Zheng,1 aWAN, Shu-bo0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2022, dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

By using a non-solvent induced phase separation method (NIPS), N-halamine epoxide and siloxane were grafted onto the multi-walled carbon nanotubes (N-Si-MWNTs) to fabricate polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hybrid membranes. The membrane morphology was observed under a field emission scanning electron microscopy. The results demonstrated that the PVDF hybrid membranes had an asymmetrical structure, and their hydraulic permeability was evidently enhanced with the addition of modified MWNTs. When compared with the primitive PVDF membrane, the hybrid membranes presented improved surface hydrophilicity. After three ultrafiltration–regeneration cycles with bovine serum albumin as model biofoulant and pure water as detergent, the PVDF hybrid membranes exhibited a high flux recovery ratio (FRR). Furthermore, when compared with other membranes, the membrane containing N-Si-MWNTs displayed the highest FRR value of above 96.5% after the entire fouling and cleaning experiment. The fabricated PVDF/N-Si-MWNTs hybrid membranes had excellent antibacterial efficacy, presenting maximum antibacterial efficacy of 98.0% and 95.6% against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, respectively. Thus, the PVDF/N-Si-MWNTs membranes fabricated in this study are environment-friendly with both benign antibacterial and self-cleaning properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3abovine serum albumin 3acarbon nanotubes 3acleaning 3adetergents 3afouling 3ahydrophilicity 3amodels 3apermeability 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aseparation 3athermoplastics 3aultrafiltration 3awater treatment 0aN-halamine 0aSiloxane 0amulti-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) 0aAntibacterial 0aSelf-cleaning1 aWang, Zuo-Ming1 aYan, Xi1 aChen, Jun1 aGuo, Ya-Jun1 aLang, Wan-Zhong0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 505 p.38-48dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2017.05.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245009600163300001800259520135700277592002801634650001601662650002201678650003701700650001501737650001401752650001301766650001701779650001701796650001101813700002101824700001801845700001601863773014101879856007402020852000902094655001202103IND60670853920221119095930.0191002e20150127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067085392DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta04291c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStorm, Mie Møller10aCapillary based Li–air batteries for in situ synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction studies  ap. 3113-3119.  aFor Li–air batteries to reach their full potential as energy storage system, a complete understanding of the conditions and reactions in the battery during operation is needed. To follow the reactions in situ a capillary-based Li–O₂ battery has been developed for synchrotron-based in situ X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). In this article, we present the results for the analysis of 1ˢᵗ and 2ⁿᵈ deep discharge and charge for a cathode being cycled between 2 and 4.6 V. The crystalline precipitation of Li₂O₂ only is observed in the capillary battery. However, there are indications of side reactions. The Li₂O₂ diffraction peaks grow with the same rate during charge and the development of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is hkl dependent. The difference in the FWHM of the 100 and the 102 reflections indicate anisotropic morphology of the Li₂O₂ crystallites or defects along the c-axis. The effect of constant exposure of X-ray radiation to the electrolyte and cathode during charge of the battery was also investigated. X-ray exposure during charge leads to changes in the development of the intensity and the FWHM of the Li₂O₂ diffraction peaks. The X-ray diffraction results are supported by ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of discharged cathodes to illuminate non-crystalline deposited materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aanisotropy 3abatteries 3acathodes 3acrystallites 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy1 aJohnsen, Rune E.1 aYounesi, Reza1 aNorby, Poul0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 Jan. 27, v. 3, no. 6 p.3113-3119dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta04291c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03375naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012100169300002000290520168900310592002801999596004902027650002302076650001502099650002002114650001502134650001902149650001502168650002002183650002202203650001502225650002702240650002302267650001402290650002102304650001102325650001902336650001402355650001602369650001302385650001302398700002902411700002502440700002702465700001902492700001802511700006902529773015502598856008302753852000902836655001202845IND60772958020221121182310.0220411e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077295802DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-17593-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrigui, Salsabil10aEffects of olive mill waste (OMW) contaminated soil on biochemical biomarkers and reproduction of Dendrobaena veneta  ap. 24956-24967.  aOlive oil industry is economically important in Mediterranean countries. Disposal of olive mill waste (OMW) presents an environmental concern in those countries due to its high salinity and its high level of polyphenols. In order to reuse OMW, those properties have to change either through the filtration process and addition of adsorbents or by composting. One of the most important organisms in composting of organic wastes is earthworms. However, data on the effects of OMW on earthworms are scarce. The main aim of our study was to investigate whether OMW contaminated soil (OMW CS) causes adverse effects on molecular and organism level in epigeic earthworm Dendrobaena veneta and on microbiological activity. Changes of measured biochemical biomarkers (AChE, CAT, GST, lipids, MDA) varied depending on the quantity of added OMW CS and the exposure duration. Oxidative stress occurred after 7 days of exposure, while in most cases enzyme activity recovered after 28 days. At the highest ratio of contaminated soil (50%), reproduction was completely inhibited. The second aim was to investigate the impact of earthworms on phenol degradation and microbial activity, indicating an important role in the bioremediation of contaminated soils. Our results show that above a certain quantity an OMW CS has an adverse effect on earthworms, while the impact of earthworms on soil microbial activity was positive but transient. Yet, as the results also imply that earthworms have an impact on phenol degradation, they can be used to help remediation of OMW CS and its subsequent usage in agriculture. However, the quantity of OMW CS that can be safely added should be determined first.  aPublisher supplied data  aIP-09-2014-4459cHrvatska Zaklada za Znanost 3aDendrobaena veneta 3aadsorbents 3aadverse effects 3abiomarkers 3abioremediation 3aearthworms 3aenzyme activity 3aexposure duration 3afiltration 3afood processing wastes 3amicrobial activity 3aolive oil 3aoxidative stress 3aphenol 3apolluted soils 3apollution 3apolyphenols 3aresearch 3asalinity1 aHackenberger, Davorka K.1 aKovačević, Marija,1 aStjepanović, Nikolina1 aPalijan, Goran1 aKallel, Amjad1 aHackenberger, Branimir K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4317-20670 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Apr., v. 29, no. 17 p.24956-24967dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-17593-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01939naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245009200170300001600262520081000278592002801088650004201116650002201158650001101180650002501191650003301216653003501249653001701284653004301301653003601344700002401380773010101404856008701505852000901592655001201601IND60630396520221123004104.0190405e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063039652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.01.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoshi, Yatish10aConsumers' Sustainable Purchase Behaviour: Modeling the Impact of Psychological Factors  ap. 235-243.  aThe aim of this study is to investigate the psychological factors that predict the sustainable purchase behaviour of educated young consumers. The study has been performed on 425 young consumers. To predict the power of considered variables, structural equation modeling was employed. Results indicate that the drive for environmental responsibility, spirituality and perceived consumer effectiveness are the key psychological determinants of consumers' sustainable purchase decisions. Outcomes of the study will be valuable to policy strategist and government organizations in designing campaigns to encourage sustainable purchasing practices among young consumers.

Scanning electron microscope, derivative thermogravimetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize the HA-CS-PUF membrane. Results showed that the interaction of HA and CS was mainly through ionic cross-linking between carboxyl and protonated amino groups. Three types of dyes, including positively charged methylene blue (MB), neutrally charged rhodamine B (RB) and negatively charged methyl orange (MO), were used to test membranes properties through static adsorption and membrane filtration experiments. It revealed that adsorption process was better fitted with Pseudo-second-order and Freundlich model. In membrane filtration experiments, we found that the retention rates of membrane 1 (ratio of HA to CS was 0:1) to MO and RB were 99.7% and 65%, respectively, and nearly no retention to MB. While membrane 4 (ratio of HA to CS was 0.2:1) can retain 97.7% of MO, 71.6% of RB and 62.1% of MB. Based on the experimental results, membrane 1 possessed the ability of selectively separating MB from MO/MB and RB/MB solutions, and membrane 4 can simultaneously retain RB and MB from RB/MB solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acrosslinking 3afoams 3agels 3amethyl orange 3amethylene blue 3amicrofiltration 3apolyurethanes 3arhodamines 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asoaking 3asorption isotherms 3athermogravimetry 0aPolyurethane foam membrane 0aChitosan 0aHumic acid 0aSelective removal1 aGong, Ji-Lai1 aZeng, Guang-Ming1 aZhang, Peng1 aZhang, Jian1 aLiu, Hong-Yu1 aHuan, Shuang-Yan0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 505 p.67-78dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2017.05.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245012900165300001400294520178800308592002802096650001602124650001502140650001102155650001002166650001102176650001302187650001502200650001802215650001402233650001302247650001902260650001702279650001202296650002502308650001902333650001102352650000902363650001502372650001502387651001502402651001102417700002302428700002602451773009602477856008202573852000902655655001202664IND4484075420221120095433.0160903e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448407542DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-010-9529-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatten, Jeff A.10aChemical characteristics of particulate organic matter from a small, mountainous river system in the Oregon Coast Range, USA  ap. 43-66.  aTo better understand the transfer of particulate organic matter (POM) by small mountainous river systems (SMRS) to the ocean, we measured the concentration and composition of suspended particles from the Alsea River, a SMRS in the Oregon Coast Range, over a wide range of discharges that included several floods. All particulate constituents measured, including organic carbon, nitrogen and biomarkers such as lignin-derived phenols, cutin acids and amino acid-derived products, displayed concentrations that increased as a power function of discharge. In contrast to other SMRS, virtually all POM in the Alsea River samples was modern and had an average age <60Â year. In spite of their similar Â¹â´C ages, marked contrasts in elemental and biomarker compositions were evident in particles collected at low and high discharges. Particles at low flows were primarily composed of organic detritus from non-vegetation sources (e.g., algal cells) whereas mineral-rich particles containing vegetation and soil-derived POM were predominant at elevated flows. Biomarker compositions of these latter particles suggest most of the POM originated from areas if the watershed with measurable hardwood contributions, which include areas affected by shallow landslides and riparian zones. We infer that the low uplift rates, lush vegetation, high net primary production and relatively thick soils that characterize the Alsea watershed are responsible for these trends. Comparison of our results with those from other systems, including the well-studied Santa Clara River (southern California), demonstrates that SMRS are part of a continuum whereby contrasts in hydroclimate, geology and vegetation lead to significant differences in the age and composition of POM exported to the ocean.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abiomarkers 3acarbon 3acutin 3afloods 3ahardwood 3alandslides 3amass transfer 3amountains 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aparticulates 3aphenols 3aprimary productivity 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3asoil 3avegetation 3awatersheds 3aCalifornia 3aOregon1 aGoÃ±i, Miguel A.1 aWheatcroft, Robert A.0 tBiogeochemistry.g2012 Feb., v. 107, no. 1-3 p.43-66dSpringer Netherlandsx0168-25637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/ 10.1007/s10533-010-9529-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01649naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012200167300001400289520075400303592002801057650002401085650001801109650001701127650001001144700001701154773010901171856008201280852000901362655001201371IND60637292020221119100934.0190417e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063729202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cofs.2018.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStelick, Alina10aThinking outside the booth—the eating environment, context and ecological validity in sensory and consumer research  ap. 26-31.  aFoods are consumed not in perfect isolation, but with company, at events, and in situations where perception, hedonics and eating behaviors may vary.

In the micro-rapid-mix test the dough was mixed for a fixed time at a high speed, whereas the microbaking test used mixing to optimum dough consistency in a microfarinograph. Quality parameters such as sedimentation value, crude protein content, dough and gluten extension data, and microfarinograph data were also determined. Finally, quality-related protein fractions (gliadins, glutenins, SDS-soluble proteins, and glutenin macropolymer) were quantitated by extraction/HPLC methods with reversed-phase and gel-permeation columns. All quality parameters were correlated with the bread volumes of both baking tests. The results demonstrated that the microbaking test (adapted mixing time) was much more closely related to the quality parameters than the micro-rapid-mix test (fixed mixing time), which hardly showed any correlation. Among the standard quality parameters, only the crude protein content showed a medium correlation with the bread volume of the microbaking test (r = 0.71), whereas the contents of gliadins (r = 0.80), glutenins (r = 0.76), and glutenin macropolymer (r = 0.80) appeared to be suitable parameters to predict the baking performance of wheat flour. All other quality parameters were not or were only weakly correlated and unsuitable for predicting baking performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abaking 3abaking quality 3abreads 3acrude protein 3acultivars 3adough 3agliadin 3agluten 3aglutenins 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amixing 3aprediction 3awheat 3awheat flour1 aWieser, Herbert1 aKoehler, Peter0 tCereal chemistry.g2014 July, v. 91, no. 4 p.333-341dThe American Association of Cereal Chemists, Inc.x0009-03527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FCCHEM-09-13-0194-CESI3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01848naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245005600202300001600258520070900274592002800983650001801011650001501029650001701044650001701061650001001078650003101088650002601119650001401145650002301159650001801182650002001200650003501220650001701255773011101272856008201383852000901465655001201474IND60637292120221119101103.0190417e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063729212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cofs.2018.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEck, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2371-977410aNutrigenomics of vitamin C absorption and transport  ap. 100-104.  aAssociations of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genes encoding for the ascorbic acid transporters SLC23A1 and SLC23A2 were reviewed.SNPs in both genes modify circulating ascorbic concentrations, the risks for various cancers, cardiovascular outcomes, inflammatory bowel disease, and ocular diseases.

Historically, the turtles have been raised in tanks without routine access to a shade structure. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of adding a shade structure on curved carapace length (CCL) and weight gain of green sea turtles. In addition, water and cloacal temperatures were compared across treatment groups and shade cover preferences observed. Ninety turtles were split equally into three treatment groups for this 8-wk study. In the first group turtles were kept in tanks in full sun, the second group in half-shaded tanks, and the third group in tanks completely covered with shade cloth. Time-lapse cameras mounted above half-shaded tanks were used to determine turtle shade structure preferences throughout the day. There were no differences in CCL among treatment groups. Significant increases in weights were noted in turtles kept in full sun and half-shaded tanks versus the fully shaded tanks. Significantly higher water and cloacal turtle temperatures were noted in the full-sun tank compared with the half-shaded or completely shaded tanks. A significantly lower number of turtles was observed in the sun in the half-shaded tanks, indicating a possible preference by turtles for a shade structure. Results suggest that providing shade structures for sea turtles results in a significant decrease in both overall water temperature as well as a reduction in maximum high daily temperatures. Results also suggest that turtles exhibit a preference for shade structures when it is provided as an option. From these results, we recommend that a shade structure be provided when housing green sea turtles in outdoor enclosures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChelonia mydas 3aaquaculture 3acameras 3acloaca 3afarms 3aoutdoor enclosures 3asea turtles 3atanks 3awater temperature 0aAnimal welfare 0aChelonia mydas 0agreen sea turtle 0ashade 0aturtle farm1 aMustin, Walter0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2017 Mar., v. 48, no. 1 p.121-130dAmerican Association of Zoo VeterinarianswJournal:jnl43569x1937-28257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638/2016-0072.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02269naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245004900169300001300218520117500231592002801406650001601434650002001450650001601470650001801486650003201504650001301536650001701549650002101566650001701587650002401604650003001628650001501658650002201673773010801695856008301803852000901886655001201895IND60637292220221119100324.0191223e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063729222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cofs.2018.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaarela, Maria H10aSafety aspects of next generation probiotics  ap. 8-13.  aAdvanced knowledge about the importance of gut microbiota for human health has increased the interest towards using new bacteria — besides the traditionally used lactobacilli and bifidobacteria — as probiotics. Currently candidates for next generation probiotics (NGP) have been searched amongst the gut bacteria that are associated with health, including strains from the genera Bacteroides, Clostridium, Faecalibacterium and Akkermansia. Unlike Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp., NGP, especially Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp., seem to be more ambivalent regarding their potential to cause infectious diseases. Therefore thorough safety assessment of NGP strains is vital. One important aspect of the safety assessment, which is sometimes ignored, is the potential to carry and spread antibiotic resistance genes. Because of the technological challenges in the production and formulation of many NGP species, it is likely that these will mainly be sold as supplements. The suitability and safety of novel probiotics to target consumer groups and conditions need to be carefully selected to ensure that the health promoting effects can be obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides 3aBifidobacterium 3aClostridium 3aLactobacillus 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3abacteria 3afood science 3ahealth promotion 3ahuman health 3ainfectious diseases 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aprobiotics 3asafety assessment0 tCurrent opinion in food science.g2019 Dec., v. 30 p.8-13dElsevier LtdwJournal:23210x2214-79937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cofs.2018.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01460naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245005900167300001600226520054700242592002800789650002200817650002000839650001800859650002900877650002700906650001100933651002100944773010200965856008201067852000901149655001201158IND60621094220221120170546.0181115e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062109422DNAL7 a10.1177/0958305X91002004052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRhee, Deok-Gil10aEnvironmental Challenges in the 1990s a Korean Context  ap. 327-338.  aThis paper presents an overview of the energy and environment situation in Korea.

We tested the hypothesis that spawning success and outmigration characteristics of YOY northern pike would vary among natural and anthropogenically modified habitats. Sixteen focal study locations were surveyed, including a restored natural wetland, agricultural drainage ditches, a flooded forested wetland and several unimpounded tributaries. We collected 1469 YOY northern pike with most individuals (N = 1163) originating from a flooded forested wetland on the east shore. Most sites produced YOY in all years (range N = 2–1145 individuals among study years). Outmigration ranged between 1 and 40 days during 2013–2015. Greater production and extended outmigration times occurred at most sites in 2014 (range 17–40 days) when the region experienced a late spring with heavy precipitation. In contrast, the lowest production and shortest outmigration period occurred at most sites in 2015 (range 14–23 days) when environmental conditions reflected regional averages. Outmigration began nearly 3 weeks earlier in 2015 (5/8) than in other study years (8 June 2013 and 25 May 2014). Total length (TL) of outmigrating northern pike ranged between 17 and 138 mm. Total length of YOY was significantly different among sites in 2013 and 2014, with the smallest fish (17 mm TL) outmigrating from agricultural ditches in both years. There were no significant variations in size among sites in 2015 (range 21–95 mm TL). Our results indicate significant variation in YOY northern pike outmigration characteristics within Lower Green Bay that may reflect the interplay between adult spawning site selection and annual weather patterns. Our findings highlight the importance of quantifying overlooked habitats in regions of mixed development.  aPublisher supplied data  cThe authors would like to thank the John G.

We also demonstrate that the same problem occurs for moment conditions proposed by Hayakawa (2012) and Robertson and Sarafidis (2015), since their moment conditions become identical to those of Ahn et al.

Herein, Co/In₂O₃ nanotubes with a double-shell structure, as a highly efficient photocatalyst, are synthesized by a one-step calcination method. The Co/In₂O₃ heterostructure shows an outstanding photocatalytic CO₂ reduction performance of 4902 μmol h–¹ g–¹. Notably, these Co/In₂O₃ photocatalysts also achieve CO₂ self-generation and in situ reduction conversion in acid organic wastewater (phenol solution), in which the high CO₂ (47.5 μmol h–¹ g–¹) and CO (0.9 μmol h–¹ g–¹) evolution rates are demonstrated under solar irradiation.

In this study, we developed a sensitive and reliable method to assay VB₆-metabolizing enzyme activities by monitoring their products visually using high-performance liquid chromatography. With this method, the reactions catalyzed by PL/PM/PN kinase, PMP/PNP oxidase, PM-pyruvate aminotransferase, PL reductase and PLP phosphatase were all nicely detected using crude protein extracts of tobacco leaves. Under optimal in vitro conditions, specific activities of those enzymes were 0.15 ± 0.03, 0.10 ± 0.03, 0.08 ± 0.02, 0.64 ± 0.13 and 23.08 ± 1.98 nmol product/min/mg protein, respectively. This is the first report on the conversion between PM and PL catalyzed by PM-pyruvate aminotransferase in plants. Furthermore, the PL reductase activity was found to be heat inducible. Our study sheds light on the VB₆ metabolism taking place in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrude protein 3aheat 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ametabolism 3aoxidoreductases 3aplant physiology 3apyridoxal 3apyridoxamine 3apyridoxine 3atobacco1 aZeng, HaiBin1 aZhang, Jianyun,1 aWei, Shu1 aHuang, LongQuan0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2011 Nov., v. 49, no. 11 p.1299-1305dElsevier Masson SASx0981-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2011.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01589naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245007600165300001600241520062100257592002800878650002200906650001100928650002500939650002600964650001100990650001601001651001301017700002401030700001601054773010201070856008201172852000901254655001201263IND60621094420221120170553.0181115e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062109442DNAL7 a10.1177/0958305X91002004072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFun, Tham Ah10aEnergy Supply/Demand in Malaysia and The Energy-Environment Interaction  ap. 348-357.  aMalaysia is a rapidly growing middle income country with an abundance of energy resources, particularly natural gas.

On Lϕ-TCO substrates, which were generated by coating a thin layer of polyethylenimine (PEI) onto FTO, a series of inverted Schottky CQD SCs with varied PbS CQD sizes and QD layer thicknesses were fabricated and characterized using capacitance–voltage (C–V), current–voltage (J–V), and external quantum efficiency (EQE). A Schottky junction, of about 180 nm in width, was formed at the front TCO contact, resulting in an EQE of approximately 70% in the short-wavelength region. The champion device reached 3.8% AM1.5 in power conversion efficiency, and retained efficiency over several weeks of air-exposure. A record open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.75 V was achieved by employing PbS CQDs of 1.56 eV in the bandgap. Advantages including the simple device structure, efficient carrier extraction, and air-stability demonstrated in this study suggest that inverted Schottky CQD SCs can reduce the price per Watt ratio and facilitate the development of CQD tandem solar cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3achemistry 3acoatings 3aelectric potential difference 3afilms (materials) 3apolyethyleneimine 3aprices 3aquantum dots 3asolar cells1 aAn, Hey Jin1 aSong, Jung Hoon1 aJang, Jihoon1 aKim, Sungwoo1 aJeong, Sohee0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 Nov. 18, v. 2, no. 48 p.20799-20805dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta04305g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245009000172300002000262520144900282592002801731650002001759650002001779650001201799650001801811650002101829650001201850650001401862650001301876650001301889650002101902700001801923700002401941700002301965700005901988773015502047856008302202852000902285655001202294IND60772958720221120193605.0220411e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077295872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-17515-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParajó, Juan José10aEcotoxicity of binary mixtures of ILs and inorganic salts of electrochemical interest  ap. 24983-24994.  aThe applicability of ionic liquids (ILs) has increased over the last years, and even new opportunities are becoming a reality, i.e. mixtures of pure IL and inorganic salt as electrolytes for smart electrochemical devices, yet the effects on the environment are almost unknown. In this work, the ecotoxicity of two pure protic ILs (Ethylammonium nitrate and Ethylimidazolium nitrate) and two pure aprotic ILs (butylmethylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide and butyldimethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) and that of their binary mixtures with inorganic salts with common cation was tested towards changes in the bioluminescence of the bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri, using the Microtox® standard toxicity test. EC₅₀ of these mixtures was determined over three standard periods of time and compared with the corresponding values to pure ILs. Results indicate that the aprotic ILs are more toxic than protic and that aromatic are more toxic than non-aromatic. The addition of inorganic mono (LiNO₃), di (Ca(NO₃)₂·4H₂O, Mg(NO₃)₂·6H₂O) and trivalent (Al(NO₃)₃·9H₂O) salts in binary mixtures with EAN was analysed first. The latter was found to induce an important increase in toxicity. Finally, mixtures of IL-inorganic lithium salt (LiNO₃, for the protic ILs and LiTFSI for the aprotic ILs) toxicity was also studied, which showed toxicity levels strongly dependent on the IL of the mixture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio fischeri 3abioluminescence 3acations 3aecotoxicology 3aelectrochemistry 3alithium 3apollution 3aresearch 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing1 aVallet, Pablo1 aVarela, Luis Miguel1 aVillanueva, María1 aSalgado, Josefa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6806-580X0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Apr., v. 29, no. 17 p.24983-24994dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-17515-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02009naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245013500153300002000288520085000308592002801158650001501186650001301201650001401214650002301228650002601251650000901277650001101286650001301297650001301310650001401323700001201337700001601349700001801365700001301383773014401396856007401540852000901614655001201623IND60670854520221119100312.0191002e20141118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067085452DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta04311a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuan, Yi10aSynthesis of an amino-functionalized metal–organic framework at a nanoscale level for gold nanoparticle deposition and catalysis  ap. 20588-20596.  aIn this study, highly dispersed Au nanoparticles have been immobilized on amino-functionalized metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) via a novel absorption/reduction method in solution. The amino functionality of the MOF rapidly coordinated with HAuCl₄ and acted as the Au(0) precursor in the absence of protecting agents. The resulting Au@MOF catalyst was well dispersed in aqueous media taking advantage of its well-defined and uniform sizes and nanomorphologies. The as-synthesized Au@MOF catalyst exhibited high catalytic activities in a wide variety of reactions under ambient conditions, such as the base-free aerobic oxidation of alcohols and oxidation/imine formation/reduction reaction sequences. Furthermore, the Au@MOF catalyst can be easily recovered and reused several times without leaching of metals or significant loss of activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aalcohols 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acoordination polymers 3agold 3aimines 3aleaching 3ananogold 3aoxidation1 aQi, Yue1 aGao, Hongyi1 aZheng, Nannan1 aWang, Ge0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 Nov. 18, v. 2, no. 48 p.20588-20596dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta04311a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008700169520153600256592002801792650002001820650001501840650002301855650002101878650000901899650001101908650001501919650001701934650002201951700001901973700001701992700002002009773009902029856008502128852000902213655001202222IND60790064620221120123329.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079006462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoser.2022.1014692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeják, Josef,10aWhy ecosystem services should be counterbalanced by nature’s thermodynamic costs  aThe neoclassical, unilaterally-defined value concept of ecosystem services (ES) as ‘benefits’ must be counterbalanced by a transparent and valid assessment of thermodynamic costs that result from degrading mature climax ecosystems. It is because willingness to pay-based methods of ES valuations produce unsustainable value relations that promote continuation of business-as-usual and further destruction of the fragments of nature. The authors argue that conversions from temperate forest to built environments result in economic losses of supporting and regulating ES that are more than two hundred times greater than the economic benefits. The loss of the cooling effect from evapotranspiration, replaced by warming from sensible heat creation in built environments, results in energetic impacts that are two orders of magnitude greater than those from greenhouse gas emissions. This is why, for sustainable landscape decision-making, the preference method results have to be compared to the costs that nature and humans have to bear due to anthropogenic changes in the natural landscape. Economic agents should start to pay for their ‘heat footprint’, ie. for thermodynamic losses caused by their transformation of natural ecosystems. By incorporating solar energy dissipation losses as costs to ecosystems, the proper value relations can be achieved, with climax forests as the most valuable producers of supporting and regulating ES. Humans are unable to equivalently substitute such forests using human technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aecosystems 3aevapotranspiration 3agreenhouse gases 3aheat 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3asolar energy 3atemperate forests1 aPokorný, Jan,1 aSeeley, Karl1 aSkene, Keith R.0 tEcosystem services.g2022 Oct., v. 57 p.101469-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2022.1014693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003100152245008600183300001600269520126000285592002801545650003001573650002101603650001001624650001301634650001701647650001801664650001001682650001601692650002401708650001901732650002101751650001801772650001901790650001401809650001601823653002301839653001801862653002401880653001801904653001801922700001601940700001801956773010601974856008702080852000902167655001202176IND60562804320221120104343.0180830e20170401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056280432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.01.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThirupathi Kumara Raja, S.10aRedox responsive albumin autogenic nanoparticles for the delivery of cancer drugs  ap. 393-405.  aThe present study explores preparation and characterization of redox sensitive albumin autogenic nanoparticles (ANPs) for drug delivery applications.

ANPs are then subjected to Camptothecin (CPT) drug loading. Experiments on in vitro and in vivo release profile, cytotoxic and cytocompatability, hemocompatability, blood clearance, tracking and bio imaging are studied in detail. The redox sensitive and drug release properties of ANPs studied in the presence of glutathione. Results on the physical, chemical and instrumental characterization warrant the property of the nanoparticles.

This module provides a framework to address both concerns through an inquiry-based approach using a hypothesisdriven set of experiments that draws upon a real-life concern, environmental exposures to lead (Pb²+???). Students learn how scientists use model organisms to understand basic biological concepts, and how these models relate to human and environmental health. Students observe how Pb²⁺ alters fish behaviors. Because many levels of biological organization are involved, this module has application for multiple units within general and advanced biology classes. Beginning with what is known about Pb²⁺ toxicity, students develop testable hypotheses about how it may affect behavior, apply this knowledge to human populations, and identify the “next experiment.”  aPublisher supplied data 0aBehavior 0aenvironmental health 0afish; inquiry-based learning 0alead; minnow 0amodel1 aHesselbach, Renee1 aKane, Andrew S.1 aPetering, David H.1 aPetering, Louise1 aBerg, Craig A.0 tAmerican biology teacher.g2013 Mar., v. 75, no. 3 p.203-209dUniversity of California PresswJournal:19725x0002-76857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1525/abt.2013.75.3.93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03477naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245014400171520198100315592002802296650001202324650002002336650001402356650001202370650001502382650001102397650000902408650001502417650001502432650000902447650001002456650001502466650001102481650001702492650002402509650002002533650000902553650001202562650000902574653001602583653001702599653002602616653002102642653000802663700001702671700002202688700002202710773012102732856008502853852000902938655001202947IND60683566920221123035056.0200809e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068356692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1141322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKastury, Farzana10aInfluence of household smoking habits on inhalation bioaccessibility of trace elements and light rare earth elements in Canadian house dust  aIn this study, total concentration and inhalation bioaccessibility (dissolution in simulated biological solution) of trace elements (TE) and rare earth elements (REE) were assessed in PM₁₀ from Canadian house dust samples with smoking (n = 25) and non-smoking (n = 25) status. Compared to the natural background concentrations in Canadian soils, median Zn, Pb, Cd and Cu concentrations in PM₁₀ were 10–23 fold higher, while median La, Ce and Pr concentrations were 1.6–2.4 fold higher. Mann-Whitney tests (α = 0.05) indicated no difference between the median TE concentrations based on the smoking status of the household; however, median REE concentrations were significantly higher in the PM₁₀ of smoking households. Additionally, Cd and Ni were positively correlated (Spearman r, p < 0.05) to La, Ce and Nd in smoking households, suggesting that tobacco combustion may have contributed REE in the PM₁₀ of these households. Median inhalation-ingestion bioaccessibility assay outcomes of arsenic (As) and lead (Pb) was higher in the non-smoking households when compared to smoking households (Mann Whitney test, α = 0.05), suggesting that tobacco combustion products may be associated with less soluble species of As and Pb. Although REE bioaccessibility was negligible in simulated lung epithelial fluid regardless of the smoking status of the household, bioaccessibility in the lung-gastric phase was 23.6–27.6% in the smoking household and 34.7–36.7% in the non-smoking households, indicating a significantly lower REE dissolution in PM₁₀ of smoking households. In contrast, between 17 and 21.9% bioaccessibility of REE was observed when artificial lysosomal fluid was used, where the outcome was not significantly affected by the smoking status. This study indicates that despite a higher median REE concentration in the PM₁₀ of smoking households, inhalation bioaccessibility may be significantly influenced by the mineralogy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3abioavailability 3abreathing 3acadmium 3acombustion 3acopper 3adust 3aepithelium 3ahouseholds 3alead 3alungs 3amineralogy 3anickel 3aparticulates 3arare earth elements 3asmoking (habit) 3asoil 3atobacco 3azinc 0aLanthanides 0aTrace metals 0aLung bioaccessibility 0aResuspended dust 0aALF1 aRitch, Susie1 aRasmussen, Pat E.1 aJuhasz, Albert L.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 July, v. 262 p.114132-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1141323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012500169520110000294592002801394650002601422650002001448650002301468650001501491650001001506650001701516650004301533650002001576653002001596653001801616653002701634653001501661653002901676700005501705773009101760856008601851852000901937655001201946IND60763847620221122173411.0220222e20220501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076384762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1231862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, So-yŏng,10aFiltration-based LAMP-CRISPR/Cas12a system for the rapid, sensitive and visualized detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7  aEscherichia coli O157:H7 is a major cause of fresh vegetable-associated infections that can threaten human health. A method for rapidly detecting food-borne pathogens should be developed for safe food management. A clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based detection method has the potential to greatly advance biosensing technology through its high sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we developed a rapid, sensitive, and visualized method of detecting E. coli O157:H7 (stx2 gene) based on a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-CRISPR/Cas12a system. The developed method was able to rectify the common false-negative results produced by LAMP, and the detection limit was 1.22 × 10⁰ CFU/mL in pure culture. Furthermore, the LAMP-CRISPR/Cas12a system using filtration enrichment successfully detected 4.80 × 10⁰ CFU/g of E. coli O157:H7 in romaine lettuce without pre-microbial enrichment culture. Consequently, the LAMP-CRISPR/Cas12a system is a useful technique for rapid and sensitive detection of E. coli O157:H7 in fresh products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O157 3adetection limit 3aenrichment culture 3afiltration 3agenes 3ahuman health 3aloop-mediated isothermal amplification 3aromaine lettuce 0aRapid detection 0aCRISPR/Cas12a 0aVisualized LAMP system 0aFiltration 0aEscherichia coli O157:H71 aOh, Se-Wook1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8580-60320 tTalanta.g2022 May 01, v. 241 p.123186-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1231863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008900166300001600255520161500271592002801886650002001914650001201934650001501946650002301961650001601984650002202000650001102022650002202033650001002055650001402065650002402079650002402103650001702127650001102144650002602155650001202181650002302193650001202216650001402228651001102242700002102253700002002274700001702294700001902311773013302330856008202463852000902545655001202554IND60575694220221121065957.0190610e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057569422DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-016-1215-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaterno, F.

The traits studied were the body weight adjusted to 210 (W210) and to 450 (W450) days of age and visual scores for body structure, finishing precocity, and muscling evaluated at weaning (BSW, FPW, and MSW) and yearling (BSY, FPY, and MSY) ages. A total of 33,242, 26,259, 23,075, and 26,057 observations were considered to analyze W210, W450, and visual scores at weaning and yearling. The significant (P < 0.05) fixed effects for all traits were farm, birth season, birth year, sex, and management group. Single-trait analyses were performed to define the most fitting model to our data using the average information restricted maximum likelihood algorithm, for weaning traits. Subsequently, these models were used in single- and two-trait analyses considering the Bayesian inference algorithm. Two-trait Bayesian analyses resulted in average direct heritability estimates for BSW, FPW, MSW, W210, BSY, FPY, MSY, and W450 of 0.28, 0.30, 0.27, 0.28, 0.40, 0.44, 0.39, and 0.50, respectively. Genetic correlations varied from 0.40 to 0.96. Benefits to animal performance can best be achieved by considering body structure, finishing precocity, and muscling as selection criteria in the Nelore breeding programs. The decision to use visual scores measured at weaning should be considered in order to decrease generation interval and assist pre-selecting individuals, expecting carcass improvements in the future progeny.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aNellore 3aalgorithms 3aanimal performance 3abody weight 3abreeding programs 3acattle 3aearly development 3afarms 3afinishing 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic improvement 3aheritability 3amodels 3amunicipal solid waste 3aprogeny 3aselection criteria 3aweaning 3ayearlings 3aBrazil1 aBuzanskas, M.

As a narrow band gap semiconductor, they are expected to show strong second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence. However, there is no report on the NIR-II fluorescence of free-standing BP nanostructures, which have great potential in the NIR-II fluorescence bioimaging because of their excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability. Here, for the first time, we report that the BP nanoparticles modified with cholesterol exhibit strong NIR-II fluorescence and can be encapsulated with the PEGylated lipid to form BP@lipid-PEG nanospheres for in vitro and in vivo NIR-II imaging. The resultant BP@lipid-PEG nanospheres exhibit broad emissions from 900 to 1650 nm under excitation by an 808 nm laser and have 8% quantum yield of that of standard dye IR-26. We also show that the NIR-II fluorescence image acquired with emission beyond 1400 nm has the sharpest contrast and can be used to in situ measure the diameter of blood vessels. In addition to NIR-II fluorescence imaging, we also show the potential of BP@lipid-PEG nanospheres in photoacoustic (PA) imaging. Both the long-wavelength NIR-II fluorescence imaging and PA imaging reveal that the as-fabricated BP@lipid-PEG nanospheres can be gradually metabolized by the liver in 48 h, thus making them promising for bioapplications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3ablood vessels 3acholesterol 3adyes 3aemissions 3aencapsulation 3aenergy conversion 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3aliver 3ananomedicine 3ananoparticles 3ananospheres 3aphosphorus 3asemiconductors 0ablack phosphorus 0acholesterol modification 0ananospheres 0aNIR-II fluorescence 0abioimaging1 aRen, Feng1 aLiu, Hanghang1 aZhang, Hao1 aHan, Yaobao1 aLiu, Zheng1 aWang, Wenliang1 aSun, Qiao1 aZhao, Chongjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1848-00601 aLi, Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0333-76990 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 May 23, v. 11, no. 24 p.21399-21407dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b058253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245009100160300001800251520041000269592002800679596009800707596009800805596009800903596006401001596010401065596010401169596010401273596008901377596004401466650001201510650001601522650001001538650002201548650001901570650002801589700001601617700001601633700001701649700005701666700005901723700005301782773013301835856008001968852000902048655001202057IND60780214220221117223109.0220617e20220525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078021422DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.2c004132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Xuebo10aHalogen-Bonding-Promoted C–H Malonylation of Indoles under Visible-Light Irradiation  ap. 8198-8202.  aHerein, we report a halogen-bonding-based electron donor–acceptor (EDA) complex-promoted photoreaction for the synthesis of C2-malonylated indoles.

Pollen analysis was conducted for lacustrine deposits from two localities (Grudzielec near Kalisz and Lechitów near Góra). The obtained pollen diagrams show diagnostic features of the Eemian. The succession of vegetation in both studied localities is characterised by three distinctive phases: protocratic with dominant pine-birch and birch-pine forest and communities of mixed pine-oak and oak forest. mesocratic with predominant hazel and well developed hornbeam-lime forest, and a telocratic one with widespread fir-spruce and pine forest. Moreover, the vegetation succession in top sections of the studied profiles was recognised as typical of the Early Vistulian. The presence of taxa with higher climatic requirements enabled the assessment of palaeoclimatic conditions in the Eemian climatic optimum of southern Great Poland. The development of vegetation in the Eemian Interglacial corresponds with the changes recorded in the nearby localities of Great Polish Lowland and other regions of Poland, as well as those of neighbouring countries. Some minor differences between the studied profiles result from different geographical location of the localities and various genesis of sedimentation basins.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aconiferous forests 3alacustrine sediments 3apollen 3aPoland0 tActa Societatis Botanicorum Poloniae.g2002 Dec. 30, v. 71, no. 4 p.311-321dPolish Botanical SocietywJournal:12967x0001-69777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5586/asbp.2002.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04296naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009800168300002000266500001100286520249500297592002802792650001502820650001802835650001302853650001402866650001402880650001002894650002702904650001702931650001002948650001802958650001702976650002302993650001103016650001303027650001703040650003103057650001203088650002003100650001303120650002103133650001103154650001703165650002003182650001303202650001703215650001303232650002603245700001703271700001603288700002303304700001603327700002203343700005703365773015603422856008303578852000903661655001203670IND60792897220221119183011.0220911e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079289722DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16693-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTripathi, Rahul10aFree radical biology in neurological manifestations: mechanisms to therapeutics interventions  ap. 62160-62207.  aReview  aRecent advancements and growing attention about free radicals (ROS) and redox signaling enable the scientific fraternity to consider their involvement in the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases, metabolic disorders, and neurological defects. Free radicals increase the concentration of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in the biological system through different endogenous sources and thus increased the overall oxidative stress. An increase in oxidative stress causes cell death through different signaling mechanisms such as mitochondrial impairment, cell-cycle arrest, DNA damage response, inflammation, negative regulation of protein, and lipid peroxidation. Thus, an appropriate balance between free radicals and antioxidants becomes crucial to maintain physiological function. Since the 1brain requires high oxygen for its functioning, it is highly vulnerable to free radical generation and enhanced ROS in the brain adversely affects axonal regeneration and synaptic plasticity, which results in neuronal cell death. In addition, increased ROS in the brain alters various signaling pathways such as apoptosis, autophagy, inflammation and microglial activation, DNA damage response, and cell-cycle arrest, leading to memory and learning defects. Mounting evidence suggests the potential involvement of micro-RNAs, circular-RNAs, natural and dietary compounds, synthetic inhibitors, and heat-shock proteins as therapeutic agents to combat neurological diseases. Herein, we explain the mechanism of free radical generation and its role in mitochondrial, protein, and lipid peroxidation biology. Further, we discuss the negative role of free radicals in synaptic plasticity and axonal regeneration through the modulation of various signaling molecules and also in the involvement of free radicals in various neurological diseases and their potential therapeutic approaches. The primary cause of free radical generation is drug overdosing, industrial air pollution, toxic heavy metals, ionizing radiation, smoking, alcohol, pesticides, and ultraviolet radiation. Excessive generation of free radicals inside the cell R1Q1 increases reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which causes oxidative damage. An increase in oxidative damage alters different cellular pathways and processes such as mitochondrial impairment, DNA damage response, cell cycle arrest, and inflammatory response, leading to pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative disease other neurological defects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aair pollution 3aalcohols 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3abrain 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acircular RNA 3adrugs 3afree radicals 3ainflammation 3alipid peroxidation 3amemory 3amicroRNA 3amitochondria 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurons 3aneuroplasticity 3anitrogen 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3apathogenesis 3apathophysiology 3aresearch 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 3aultraviolet radiation1 aGupta, Rohan1 aSahu, Mehar1 aSrivastava, Devesh1 aDas, Ankita1 aAmbasta, Rashmi K1 aKumar, Pravir1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7444-23440 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Sept., v. 29, no. 41 p.62160-62207dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16693-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03737naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013200164300001600296500001900312520200000331592002802331596005402359596005902413596005902472596006202531650002702593650001202620650002502632650002002657650002202677650002202699650001302721650001502734650002002749650002002769650001802789650002102807650001002828651001002838700001602848700001402864700001802878700001902896700001702915700002302932700005202955773010903007856008203116852000903198655001203207IND60701442720221116145024.0200711e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070144272DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-020-01972-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyu, Jinlin10aSap flow characteristics in growing and non-growing seasons in three tree species in the semiarid Loess Plateau region of China  ap. 943-955.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aKEY MESSAGE: Year-round observation suggests that sap flow in growing season represents species-specific transpiration characteristics and sap flow of deciduous broadleaved species in non-growing season is related to daily changes in stem diameter. Year-round observation is necessary to investigate species-specific characteristics of sap flow and its possible contribution in non-growing season. The middle Loess Plateau in China is characterized by temperate climate and vegetation cover of generally drought-tolerant deciduous broadleaved and some evergreen coniferous trees. In this study, Granier-type thermal dissipation probes were applied to measure year-round xylem sap flow in three species from April 2017 to April 2018. Solar radiation, air temperature, relative air humidity, precipitation, and soil moisture were monitored continuously. The results showed that the peak time of sap flux density (Fd) in the diurnal courses of Robinia pseudoacacia was later than that of Quercus liaotungensis and Platycladus orientalis. The peak time of Fd for R. pseudoacacia was significantly postponed during the period with higher soil moisture when compared with that at lower soil moisture, whereas the peak time was reached slightly earlier in the other two species. Sap flow during the non-growing season was relatively higher in P. orientalis than in the two broadleaved species. The diurnal course of Fd in non-growing season showed high values at nighttime and low values in daytime, opposite to that in growing season. Daily variation in stem diameter was inverse of the change in sap flow in the two broadleaved species, whereas the daily change in stem diameter of P. orientalis was very small and showed no clear relation with sap flow. The results suggest that changes in transpiration characteristics with soil moisture conditions vary with tree species; sap flow in deciduous broadleaved trees in non-growing season is small and closely related to daily changes in stem diameter.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFC0504601cNational Key R&D Program of China  a41171419cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41471440cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41411140035cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aPlatycladus orientalis 3aQuercus 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3aair temperature 3adrought tolerance 3arelative humidity 3asap flow 3asoil water 3asolar radiation 3atemperate zones 3atranspiration 3avegetation cover 3axylem 3aChina1 aHe, Qiu-Yue1 aYang, Jie1 aChen, Qiu-Wen1 aCheng, Ran-Ran1 aYan, Mei-Jie1 aYamanaka, Norikazu1 aDusheng,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5580-399X0 tTrees.g2020 Aug., v. 34, no. 4 p.943-955dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl43090x0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-020-01972-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02056naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245006600206300001600272506007600288520092000364592002801284506003701312650001401349650001601363650003701379650002601416700002501442773017101467856008301638852000901721655001201730IND4481208320221207130448.0120502e20120110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448120832DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11142071082doi7 aPMC32586322pmcid7 a221988412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernÃ©, Olivier10aFormation of buckminsterfullerene (C60) in interstellar space  ap. 401-406.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBuckminsterfullerene (C60) was recently confirmed as the largest molecule identified in space. However, it remains unclear how and where this molecule is formed. It is generally believed that C60 is formed from the buildup of small carbonaceous compounds in the hot and dense envelopes of evolved stars. Analyzing infrared observations, obtained by Spitzer and Herschel, we found that C60 is efficiently formed in the tenuous and cold environment of an interstellar cloud illuminated by strong ultraviolet (UV) radiation fields. This implies that another formation pathway, efficient at low densities, must exist. Based on recent laboratory and theoretical studies, we argue that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are converted into graphene, and subsequently C60, under UV irradiation from massive stars.

QI showed a high prediction accuracy, estimating a rejection point of 10.8 days. Principal component analysis showed the influence of the storage time on sensory, physicochemical (instrumental color and texture profile, total volatile base nitrogen, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, pH), and microbiological (total aerobic mesophilic count and total aerobic psychrotrophic count) quality parameters and the correlations between them. The suitability of the QIM scheme for assessing the freshness of whole tilapia was demonstrated to be a fast and accurate tool to maintain proper quality control along the production chain.  aThis work was supported by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - Brazil (CAPES) under Grant Finance Code 001 and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) [grant number PDJ 151338/2019-1].  aPublisher supplied data  aPDJ 151338/2019-1cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológicodhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003593  aFinance Code 001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superiordhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002322 3aOreochromis niloticus 3acolor 3acommercialization 3afreshness 3aice 3amicrobiological quality 3apH 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquality control 3arefrigeration 3astorage time 3atexture 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3atotal volatile basic nitrogen 3atrophic relationships 0aTilapia 0aquality index method (QIM) 0aphysicochemical parameters 0aice storage1 aGarcía, Eddie Enrique Sanjuanelo1 aGalvão, Juliana Antunes1 aOetterer, Marília0 tJournal of aquatic food product technology.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 29, no. 3 p.307-319dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl47704x1547-06367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10498850.2020.17242223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012000165300001100285520158100296592002801877650000801905650002101913650001401934650002601948650001901974650001601993650002302009650001402032650002502046650001002071650001502081650002102096650001402117650004302131700001402174700001802188700001902206700001702225700001202242700001702254700001302271700001802284773012602302856008302428852000902511655001202520IND60795160020221122025349.0221002e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079516002DNAL7 a10.1186/s13765-022-00729-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Jinlong10aCirc_0000554 is identified as a cancer-promoting circRNA in colorectal cancer by regulating the miR-1205/LASP1 axis  ap. 64.  aBACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent malignant tumor with poor prognosis. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are key regulators in the progression of CRC. Our study aimed to disclose the role of circ_0000554 in CRC. METHODS: The expression of circ_0000554, miR-1205 and LIM and SH3 protein 1 (LASP1) was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell proliferation, invasion and migration were monitored using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, EdU assay, transwell assay and wound healing assay respectively. The protein levels of C-myc, matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP-2) and LASP1 were detected by western blot. Tumor formation assay in nude mice was conducted to explore the role of circ_0000554 in vivo. The association between miR-1205 and circ_0000554 or LASP1 was identified by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. RESULTS: circ_0000554 was upregulated in CRC tissues and cells, high circ_0000554 expression was significantly linked to shorter overall survival. Downregulation of circ_0000554 restrained cell growth and metastasis while promoted apoptosis in vitro, and suppressed tumorigenesis of CRC in vivo. Furthermore, mechanism study and rescue experiments confirmed miR-1205 could be sponged by circ_0000554 and its inhibitor reversed the inhibitory effect of circ_0000554 silencing on CRC progression. LASP1 was a target gene of miR-1205 and the upregulation of LASP1 overturned miR-1205-induced effects on CRC cells. Circ_0000554 could elevate LASP1 expression via interacting with miR-1205.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3abioluminescence assay 3acarcinogenesis 3acell growth 3acell proliferation 3achemistry 3acolorectal neoplasms 3agenes 3ametastasis 3aprecipitin tests 3aprognosis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction1 aYang, Hua1 aPeng, Xuefeng1 aZhang, Faqiang1 aShu, Shilong1 aLan, Ke1 aTu, Shengjin1 aLu, Gai,1 aCha, Xiaoying0 tApplied biological chemistry.g2022 Dec., v. 65, no. 1 p.64-64dSpringer Nature SingaporewJournal:27084x2468-08347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13765-022-00729-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02273naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245014700171300001400318520125800332592002801590650001401618650000901632650001201641650001301653650001001666650001701676650001501693650001401708650002301722651001601745773008201761856008301843852000901926655001201935IND60086239720221118020318.0141101e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008623972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.limno.2011.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNevalainen, Liisa10aDistribution of benthic microcrustaceans along a water depth gradient in an Austrian Alpine lake – Sedimentary evidence for niche separation  ap. 65-71.  aDistribution of benthic microcrustacean (Crustacea: Cladocera) was investigated with paleolimnological approach by using their fossil surface sediment assemblages within a thermally extreme lake in the Niedere Tauern, Austrian Alps. The results from 20 surface sediment samples suggested that the spatial distribution of chydorids is clearly heterogeneous along the water depth gradient (1.8–6.1m); Alona quadrangularis dominated in shallow (warm, minerogenic) habitats, Chydorus sphaericus-type succeeded at intermediate depths, and Alona affinis dominated in deep (cold, organic) sites. Apparently, these benthic cladocerans exhibit clear habitat and resource segregation. The distributional patterns revealed local community thresholds at approximately 2.5 and 4.5m water depths and these thresholds were likely to be forced by variances in habitat quality (minerogenic–organic), food resources (periphyton/detritus), thermal properties (warm–cold), and UV-exposure (high–low). The results emphasize the usability of the paleolimnological approach in distributional investigations and its applicability in providing information on species–environmental relationships for environmental change evaluations and paleoecological interpretations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladocera 3acold 3afossils 3ahabitats 3alakes 3apaleoecology 3aperiphyton 3asediments 3athermal properties 3aAlps region0 tLimnologica.g2012 Feb., v. 42, no. 1 p.65-71dElsevier GmbHx0075-95117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2011.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03492naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245011500209300001800324500001900342520188000361592002802241596005702269596005702326596005702383650001002440650001202450650001102462650002102473650001702494650001602511650002202527650001802549650001302567650002102580650001502601650002502616650001002641650001502651700002302666700001702689700002102706700002302727700001802750700001602768773011102784856008202895852000902977655001202986IND60701442920221116144915.0200711e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070144292DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-020-01980-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTateno, Ryunosuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8461-369610aNitrogen source utilization in co-existing canopy tree and dwarf bamboo in a northern hardwood forest in Japan  ap. 1047-1057.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aKEY MESSAGE: Understory dwarf bamboo mitigated soil N competition with co-existing canopy oak trees by foraging in deeper soils and increasing dependence on N forms that differ from those used by canopy trees. Nitrogen (N) competition among co-existing plant species utilizing different mycorrhiza types was explored through the investigation of N sources of oak trees and dwarf bamboo. Vertical distribution of fine roots, soil N pools, δ¹⁵N of leaves, and possible soil N sources and nitrate reductase activity (NRA) were all quantified. The fine roots of canopy trees were more concentrated in the surface soils than roots of the understory dwarf bamboo. Soil NH₄⁺ and extractable organic N (EON) content (based on unit weight) decreased from the organic horizon (O horizon) to the deep soils, the size of the NH₄⁺ pool per unit volume increased with soil depth, and the EON was approximately constant. Soil NO₃⁻ was not detected at any soil depth or was not significant in value, while NO₃⁻ captured by ion-exchange resin (IER) buried at a 10 cm soil depth and net nitrification were observed via laboratory incubation at all soil depths. The δ¹⁵N of the NH₄⁺ and EON pools increased with soil depth and the δ¹⁵N of NO₃⁻ of IER was lower than that of other N forms, except for the δ¹⁵N of NH₄⁺ in the O horizon. Furthermore, root NRA tended to be lower in canopy trees than in the understory, implying lower dependency on NO₃⁻ by canopy trees. The pattern of root distribution and mycorrhizal fungi association of the understory vegetation (as well as the high root NRA) suggested that dependence on N in deeper soils was higher in understory plants than in canopy trees. These findings indicate that understory vegetation mitigates soil N competition against co-existing canopy trees via the use of alternative N sources.  aPublisher supplied data  a26292085cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a16H04937cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a18H02241cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aJapan 3abamboos 3acanopy 3ahardwood forests 3aion exchange 3amycorrhizae 3anitrate reductase 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3aorganic horizons 3asoil depth 3aspatial distribution 3atrees 3aunderstory1 aNakayama, Masataka1 aYano, Midori1 aFukuzawa, Karibu1 aInagaki, Yoshiyuki1 aKoba, Keisuke1 aUgawa, Shin0 tTrees.g2020 Aug., v. 34, no. 4 p.1047-1057dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl43090x0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-020-01980-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245005600162300002000218520112700238592002801365650002201393650002601415650001301441650001301454650002201467650002401489650001101513650002001524650001601544650001201560653002101572653002801593653002601621653001301647653001801660653001501678700002301693700001401716700005701730700001901787700006501806700006701871773014101938856007802079852000902157655001202166IND60647722120221119095551.0190620e20190522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064772212DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b063702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrvis, Thomas10aElectron Doping BaZrO₃ via Topochemical Reduction  ap. 21720-21726.  aWe report the topochemical reduction of epitaxial thin films of the cubic perovskite BaZrO₃. Reduction with calcium hydride yields n-type conductivity in the films, despite the wide band gap and low electron affinity of the parent material. X-ray diffraction studies show concurrent loss of out-of-plane texture with stronger reducing conditions. Temperature-dependent transport studies on reduced films show insulating behavior (decreasing resistivity with increasing temperature) with a combination of thermally activated and variable-range hopping transport mechanisms. Time-dependent conductivity studies show that the films are stable over short periods, with chemical changes over the course of weeks leading to an increase in electrical resistance. Neutron reflectivity and secondary ion mass spectrometry indicate that the source of the carriers is most likely hydrogen incorporated from the reducing agent occupying oxygen vacancies and/or interstitial sites. Our studies introduce topochemical reduction as a viable pathway to electron-dope and meta-stabilize low electron affinity and work function materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aelectrical resistance 3ahydrides 3ahydrogen 3amass spectrometry 3aneutron diffraction 3aoxygen 3areducing agents 3atemperature 3atexture 0abarium zirconate 0apulsed laser deposition 0alow electron affinity 0ahydrogen 0acomplex oxide 0aperovskite1 aSurendran, Mythili1 aLiu, Yang1 aNiu, Shanyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0559-34611 aMuramoto, Shin1 aGrutter, Alexander J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6876-76251 aRavichandran, Jayakanth1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5030-91430 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 May 22, v. 11, no. 24 p.21720-21726dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b063703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245010000168300001300268520147900281592002801760650001701788650001201805650001801817650001001835650001901845650002201864650001101886650001801897650001801915650001401933651001001947700001701957700002001974773008101994856008302075852000902158655001202167IND60086239820221118020031.0141101e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008623982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.limno.2011.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jiacong10aHydrodynamic-phytoplankton model for short-term forecasts of phytoplankton in Lake Taihu, China  ap. 7-18.  aPhytoplankton biomass is an important factor for short-term forecasts of algal blooms. Our new hydrodynamic-phytoplankton model is primarily intended for simulating the spatial and temporal distribution of phytoplankton in Lake Taihu within a time frame of 1–5 days. The model combines two modules: a simple phytoplankton kinetics module for growth and loss; and a mass-transport module, which defines phytoplankton transport horizontally with a two dimensional hydrodynamic model. To adapt field data for model input and calibration, we introduce two simplifications: (a) exclusion of some processes related to phytoplankton dynamics like nutrient dynamics, sediment resuspension, mineralization and nitrification, and (b) use of monthly measured data of the nutrient state. Chlorophyll-α concentration, representing phytoplankton biomass, is the only state variable in the model. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify the most sensitive parameter set in the phytoplankton kinetics module. The model was calibrated with field data collected in 2008 and validated with additional data obtained in 2009. A comparison of simulated and observed chlorophyll-α concentration for 33 grid cells achieved an accuracy of 78.7%. However, mean percent error and mean absolute percent error were 13.4% and 58.2%, respectively, which implies that further improvement is necessary, e.g. by reducing uncertainty of the model input and by an improved parameter calibration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgal blooms 3abiomass 3ahydrodynamics 3alakes 3amineralization 3amodel uncertainty 3amodels 3anitrification 3aphytoplankton 3asediments 3aChina1 aGao, Junfeng1 aHörmann, Georg0 tLimnologica.g2012 Feb., v. 42, no. 1 p.7-18dElsevier GmbHx0075-95117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2011.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024003600099040001800135100001900153245009000172300001600262520121900278592002801497650002701525650001801552650002001570700003201590700002401622700002501646700003701671700001601708700002001724773010501744852000901849856008201858655001201940991632118680742620221118183757.0181010e197209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7391872792DNAL7 a10.1177/0300985872009005042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWentink, G. H.10aMyopathy with a Possible Recessive X-Linked Inheritance in a Litter of Irish Terriers  ap. 328-349.  aFive male Irish Terrier puppies had a stiff gait, difficulty in swallowing, dirty cheeks because of food residues, an enlarged tongue and atrophic muscles. At electromyographical examination high-frequency discharges suggestive of myotonia were present. The values for serum creatine-phosphokinase and aldolase were extremely high. Serum vitamin E values were normal. At necropsy the muscles were pale with yellowish white streaks. Histologically there was a patchy distribution of the lesions. Granular and floccular changes (Zenker's degeneration) with phagocytosis, giant cells and calcification were found. Histochemical changes were the same in all muscles investigated, but were not equally pronounced. In the muscle specimens with greatest change the distinction between type I and type II fibres was largely lost. Rounded hypertrophic fibres contained no glycogen, and most did not show activity of phosphorylase, dehydrogenases, and oxidases. Activity of glyccrol-3-phosphate oxidase and acid phosphatase was markedly increased. Abnormal mitochondria and unknown electron-dense bodies were found. The tubular system seemed to be reduced in some abnormal fibres. The disease is probably recessive X-linked.  aPublisher supplied data 3anoninfectious diseases 3aanimal health 3aanimal diseases1 avan der Linde-Sipman, J. S.1 aMeijer, A. E. F.

Overall size and particularly wing loading appear predictably to be related to speed range. In Anisoptera at least, relatively short bodies and long wings should favour high speed manoeuvrability, though further information is needed. Medium and low aspect ratio wings are associated with gliding and soaring, but the significance of aspect ratio in flapping flight is less straightforward, and much depends on kinematics. Narrow wing bases, petiolation, basal vein fusion, distal concentration of area and a proximally positioned nodus – described by a newly defined variable, the “nodal index” – all allow high torsion between half-strokes and favour habitually slow flight, while broad wing bases are useful at higher speeds. The “basal complex” in all families seems to be a mechanism for automatic lowering of the trailing edge and maintenance of an effective angle of attack, but the relative merits of different configurations are not yet clear. There is serious need for more quantitative information on a wider range of species and families.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcFederal State Funding at Kiel University  aBB/R002657/1aBB/R002509/1aBB/J001244/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000268  aKAKENHI JP18H05468cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  a2018-04292a2013-4838cVetenskapsrådetdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004359 3aAnisoptera (Odonata) 3ainsect flight 3akinematics 3awings 0aOdonata diversity 0aflight behaviour 0aflight performance capabilities 0asize 0abody proportions 0awing shape 0aaspect ratio 0afirst moment of area 0avenation0 tInternational journal of odonatology.g2020 Jan. 2, v. 23, no. 1 p.31-39dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2155x2159-67197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13887890.2019.16879913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245012500168300001600293500001500309520152400324592002801848650001901876650002701895650001401922650002101936650001201957650001501969650001601984650001202000650001602012650002002028650001102048651001402059653001602073700003002089773008302119856008302202852000902285655001202294IND60086240020221118020341.0141101e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008624002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.limno.2011.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrand, Cecilia10aLife cycle phenology, secondary production, and trophic guilds of caddisfly species in a lake-outlet stream of Patagonia  ap. 108-117.  a2019-12-06  aLake-outlets are transitional areas recognized as highly productive ecosystems in terms of density and biomass of aquatic insects. Life cycle, secondary production, trophic guilds and environmental constraints of caddisfly assemblages were investigated on a natural lake-outlet stream (Nant y Fall) in Patagonia, Argentina. We investigated the site monthly from May 2007 to April 2008 by recording environmental data and sampling caddis larvae using a Surber sampler at riffle areas (n=36). Mastigoptila longicornuta, Smicridea annulicornis, Smicridea frequens, Brachysetodes quadrifidus and Parasericostoma ovale displayed well synchronized univoltine life cycles, while Neoatopsyche brevispina, Neopsilochorema tricarinatum, showed an asynchronous development pattern, although most of them had an extended recruitment, similar to those reported for non lake-outlet streams in the area. Annual secondary production per species varied from 8.22 (B. quadrifidus) to 3568.83mgm⁻²y⁻¹ (P. ovale), with overall caddisfly production amounting to 4.8gm⁻²y⁻¹. Shredder/collector-filterer ratio was 3.3/1 suggesting that the system was detrital based. Redundancy analysis indicated that seasonally dynamic variables such as discharge, benthic particulate organic matter and temperature were the main predictors of seasonal caddisfly assemblage variation. We propose that the variety of food resources and the significant spatial heterogeneity at lake-outlet streams contribute to sustain a rich caddisfly community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aorganic matter 3asecondary productivity 3aphenology 3aunivoltine habit 3astreams 3aecosystems 3atemperature 3abiomass 3aTrichoptera 3aaquatic insects 3alarvae 3aArgentina 0arecruitment1 aMiserendino, María Laura0 tLimnologica.g2012 May, v. 42, no. 2 p.108-117dElsevier GmbHx0075-95117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2011.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245014800174500001400322520135600336592002801692650003001720650000801750650001101758650001701769650001601786650001401802650002201816650001101838650001701849650001501866650001301881650001101894650001301905650002001918650001201938650001901950650000901969650001801978653000901996653001102005653001602016653000602032653000702038653000702045653000802052653000802060653000902068653000602077653000702083653000802090653000802098653000802106653000802114653000602122653000802128653000802136653000802144653000802152653000702160653000802167653000702175653000702182653000802189653000902197653001002206653000802216653000802224700005302232700001302285700002102298700002402319700001902343700001502362773011602377856008702493852000902580655001202589IND60684138520221118053709.0200804e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068413852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1126112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBamisile, Olusola10aModelling and performance analysis of an innovative CPVT, wind and biogas integrated comprehensive energy system: An energy and exergy approach  aNAL-light  aOne of the challenges faced by renewable energy (RE) powered multigeneration system is the unavailability of RE resources at different times. In this research, a novel comprehensive energy system powered with wind turbines, concentrated photovoltaic/thermal and biogas is modelled and analyzed using energy and exergy approach. Multiple useful products such as electricity, hot air, hydrogen, fresh water, cooling effect and hot water will be produced by the system. Four different operational scenarios namely; CPVT/wind, wind/biogas, CPVT/biogas, and biogas only are considered for this comprehensive energy system. Thermal energy storage is incorporated with the system, in order to save thermal energy that will be used during hours without solar radiation. Furthermore, the CO2 emissions saved, in comparison with the use of different fossil fuel sources is analyzed. The maximum productions from the comprehensive system are: 3.4 MW of electricity; 12.41 L/sec of Hydrogen; 279.4 kW of cooling effect; 17.546 kg/s of hot air; 144.18 L/min of hot water and 10.31 L/min of fresh water. The overall energetic efficiency of the system considering all the case studies ranges from 64.91% to 71.06% while the exergetic efficiencies ranges from 31.80% to 53.81%. The CO2 emission analysis results show that the system is environmentally friendly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aair 3abiogas 3acase studies 3aelectricity 3aemissions 3aenergy efficiency 3aexergy 3afossil fuels 3afreshwater 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3aresearch 3asolar radiation 3astorage 3athermal energy 3awind 3awind turbines 0aCPVT 0aEnergy 0aWind Energy 0aA 0aAC 0aAM 0aCog 0aCOP 0aCPVT 0aD 0aDC 0aEES 0aHEX 0aHHV 0aLHV 0am 0aMSF 0aORC 0aPCM 0aPEM 0aPr 0aPTC 0aPV 0aRE 0aRES 0aSEAC 0aS.

Two types of colloidal nanocrystal assemblies (CNAs) of MnFe₂O₄ had been investigated as the electrode materials by using aqueous electrolytes containing bivalent and trivalent metal ions. Experimental results showed that CNAs assembled by 16 nm nanocrystals (MnFe-1Sf) displayed specific capacitance of about 32.0 F g⁻¹ and 43.2 F g⁻¹ at 0.1 A g⁻¹ in aqueous solutions containing Mg²⁺ or Al³⁺ ions, respectively. However, the capacitances of CNAs composed of large nanoparticles (MnFe-2 Ac) increased respectively up to around 58.2 F g⁻¹ and 45.1 F g⁻¹ at 0.1 A g⁻¹. MnFe-1Sf delivered the specific capacitance of 30.6 F g⁻¹ and 51.7 F g⁻¹ in electrolytes of Na₂SO₄ mixed MgSO₄ and MgSO₄ mixed ZnSO₄ at 0.1 A g⁻¹ while 36.2 F g⁻¹ and 44.4 F g⁻¹ for MnFe-2 Ac, respectively. MnFe-1Sf showed a better cycle stability than MnFe-2 Ac either in MgSO₄ or in Al₂(SO₄)₃ electrolytes. The wide potential window during cyclic voltammetry brings the electrochemical diversification of the CNAs based electrodes in various electrolytes. Based on the experimental data and crystalline features of the CNAs, the structure-property relationship has been discussed and analyzed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aaluminum sulfate 3aaqueous solutions 3acapacitance 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aferrimagnetic materials 3amagnesium 3amagnesium sulfate 3amanganese 3ametal ions 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3asodium sulfate 3azinc sulfate 0aAssembly 0aFerrite 0aElectrochemistry 0aSupercapacitor 0aMultivalence1 aSun, Yunchang1 aLi, Zhen1 aLi, Hongliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4417-71531 aGuo, Peizhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8773-21960 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 July 05, v. 572 p.326-332dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.04.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005800149245009800207300001800305520154900323592002801872650003001900650001601930650001401946650001601960650002301976650000901999700006002008773011802068856008302186852000902269655001202278IND60750404420221121225547.0210915e20210830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075040442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.1c004152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Gaurav1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1031-537810aFormation of the Metal-Binding Core of the ZRT/IRT-like Protein (ZIP) Family Zinc Transporter  ap. 2727-2738.  aZinc homeostasis in mammals is constantly and precisely maintained by sophisticated regulatory proteins. Among them, the Zrt/Irt-like protein (ZIP) regulates the influx of zinc into the cytoplasm. In this work, we have employed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the Zn²⁺ transport mechanism in prokaryotic ZIP obtained from Bordetella bronchiseptica (BbZIP) in a membrane bilayer. Additionally, the structural and dynamical transformations of BbZIP during this process have been analyzed. This study allowed us to develop a hypothesis for the zinc influx mechanism and formation of the metal-binding site. We have created a model for the outward-facing form of BbZIP (experimentally only the inward-facing form has been characterized) that has allowed us, for the first time, to observe the Zn²⁺ ion entering the channel and binding to the negatively charged M2 site. It is thought that the M2 site is less favored than the M1 site, which then leads to metal ion egress; however, we have not observed the M1 site being occupied in our simulations. Furthermore, removing both Zn²⁺ ions from this complex resulted in the collapse of the metal-binding site, illustrating the “structural role” of metal ions in maintaining the binding site and holding the proteins together. Finally, due to the long Cd²⁺–residue bond distances observed in the X-ray structures, we have proposed the existence of an H₃O⁺ ion at the M2 site that plays an important role in protein stability in the absence of the metal ion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBordetella bronchiseptica 3aX-radiation 3acytoplasm 3ahomeostasis 3amolecular dynamics 3azinc1 aMerz, Kenneth M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9139-58930 tBiochemistry.g2021 Aug. 30, v. 60, no. 36 p.2727-2738dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.1c004153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04225naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245010700172300001600279520286000295592002803155650001203183650001903195650001403214650001903228650004103247650000903288650002103297650001903318650001303337650001403350650001303364650001103377650001903388650001503407650001503422651002203437700002303459700002003482700001703502700001703519700001803536773011003554856008203664852000903746655001203755IND60085335920221120224920.0141101e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008533592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2013.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLockhart, Robert S.10aAnalytical pyrolysis for determining the molecular composition of contemporary monosulfidic black ooze  ap. 640-652.  aOn-line flash pyrolysis, micro-scale sealed vessel (MSSV) pyrolysis and catalytic hydropyrolysis (HyPy) were used to characterise the insoluble, macromolecular organic component of monosulfidic black oozes (MBO) which have accumulated within the contemporary eutrophic environment of the Peel–Harvey estuary system (Geographe Bay, Western Australia). Pyrolysates were analysed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and the relative characterisation potential of the three pyrolysis techniques were evaluated with a particular interest in their sensitivity to organic sulfur compounds (OSCs). A similarity of results obtained from three different parts of the ∼1m cores sampled suggests a largely homogenous organic composition throughout the unit. The different pyrolysis techniques did, however, show several notable product differences, particularly the gaseous products detected by the on-line methods of flash- and MSSV-pyrolysis. The very high (i.e., ballistic) heating rate of flash-Py produced very high proportions of gaseous products (e.g., CO₂, H₂S and SO₂). A strong terrestrially sourced product component was reflected in all three pyrolysates profiles: flash-Py showed relatively high concentrations of lignocellulose products, while MSSV-Py and HyPy produced an abundance of plant wax (>n-C₂₀) n-alkanes. Additionally, quantitatively significant levels (7–14% of total GC product signal) of several higher plant derived terpenoids (e.g., cadalene, p-cymene and calamanene) were identified by MSSV-Py. MSSV-Py also produced far greater overall concentrations of GC-amenable products than flash-Py, including a 14-fold increase of OSCs, which comprised nearly 10% of the total sulfur signal (i.e., organic plus ‘inorganic’ sulfur; cf. 4% of flash pyrolysis). An extended series of alkyl (<C₉) substituted thiophenes were the main OSCs. HyPy, in contrast, showed no evidence of OSCs – confirmed by GC-flame photometric detection (FPD). HyPy is renowned for its capacity to preserve primary structural units, so its failure to detect thiophenes and other OSCs abundant in the corresponding analysis, suggests these are not indigenous to the macromolecular fraction of the MBO. The detection of these products by MSSV-Py, and to a lesser extent flash-Py, suggests these pyrolysis methods initiate a restructuring of sulfur species towards more thermally stable secondary configurations. One explanation for the limited diagnostic S-speciation data obtained from the present analysis may be the existence of most of the S in the MBO as bridging units between covalently bound organic structures. These relatively weakly bound associations may form on the reaction of reduced sulfur species (from bacterial sulfate reduction) with highly functionalised organic compounds during the early stages of diagenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3acarbon dioxide 3aestuaries 3aeutrophication 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheat 3ahydrogen sulfide 3alignocellulose 3ap-cymene 3apyrolysis 3asulfates 3asulfur 3asulfur dioxide 3aterpenoids 3athiophenes 3aWestern Australia1 aBerwick, Lyndon J.1 aGreenwood, Paul1 aGrice, Kliti1 aKraal, Peter1 aBush, Richard0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2013 Nov., v. 104 p.640-652dElsevier B.V.x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2013.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03948naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111024002100146040001800167072000900185100002000194245008500214300001600299500002400315500002400339520190200363650001002265650002002275650002502295650002202320650001402342650001202356650001002368650001102378650003802389650003702427650002602464650002302490650001802513650002202531650005202553650001302605650001302618650001202631650002902643650001002672650003802682650003602720650003402756653002902790700002902819700002102848700002102869773011802890852000903008856008503017856011203102930003303214945002503247946001303272961001303285655001203298IND4422903520221120223233.0090707e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442290352DNAL7 a196302362pmid7 a10.1637/8520-111708-Reg.12doi7 a10113/324532hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aSpackman, Erica13aAn Evaluation of Avian Influenza Diagnostic Methods with Domestic Duck Specimens  ap. 276-280.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  aMonitoring of poultry, including domestic ducks, for avian influenza (AI) virus has increased considerably in recent years. However, the current methods validated for the diagnosis and detection of AI virus infection in chickens and turkeys have not been evaluated for performance with samples collected from domestic ducks. In order to ensure that methods for the detection of AI virus or AI virus antibody will perform acceptably well with these specimens, samples collected from domestic ducks experimentally infected with a U.S. origin low pathogenicity AI virus, A/Avian/NY/31588-3/00 (H5N2), were evaluated. Oropharyngeal (OP) and cloacal swabs were collected at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 21 days postinoculation (PI) for virus detection by virus isolation, which was considered the reference method, and real-time RT-PCR. In addition, two commercial antigen immunoassays were used to test swab material collected 2-7 days PI. Virus isolation and real-time RT-PCR performed similarly; however, the antigen immunoassays only detected virus during the peak of shed, 2-4 days PI, and both kits detected virus in fewer than half of the samples that were positive by virus isolation. Cloacal swabs yielded more positives than OP swabs with all virus detection tests. To evaluate AI virus antibody detection serum was collected from the ducks at 7, 14, and 21 days PI and was tested by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) assay, a commercial blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and homologous hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, which was used as the reference method. Results for the ELISA and HI assay were almost identical with serum collected at 7 and 14 days PI; however, by 21 days PI 100% of the samples were positive by HI assay and only 65% were positive by ELISA. At all time points AGID detected antibody in substantially fewer samples than either ELISA or HI assay. 3aducks 3aavian influenza 3adisease surveillance 3adisease detection 3abioassays 3apharynx 3amouth 3acloaca 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahemagglutination inhibition test 3aimmunodiffusion tests 3aantibody detection 3aserodiagnosis 3aInfluenza A virus 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3avalidity 3aaccuracy 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxblood 2aDucks 2aImmunoassayxmethodsxveterinary. 2aInfluenza A Virus, H5N2 Subtype 2aInfluenza in Birdsxdiagnosis 0aagar gel immunodiffusion1 aPantin-Jackwood, Mary J.1 aSwayne, David E.1 aSuarez, David L.0 tAvian diseases.g2009 June, v.  53, no.  2 p.276-280dAmerican Association of Avian Pathologistsx0005-20867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637/8520-111708-Reg.13Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/324533Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100728b20100807c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/08/06  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01752naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245008900158300001600247500002000263520077100283592002801054650000901082650001901091650001201110650001301122650001401135651001801149700001801167700001801185773014301203856007101346852000901417655001201426IND60680412220221121045517.0200105e199911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068041222DNAL7 a10.2307/12443282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJust, Richard E.10aAdverse Selection in Crop Insurance: Actuarial and Asymmetric Information Incentives  ap. 834-849.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAdverse selection is often blamed for crop insurance indemnities exceeding premiums plus subsidies. However, nationwide empirical evidence has been lacking or based on inadequate county‐level data. This article uses nationwide farm‐level data on corn and soybeans to decompose incentives for participation in U.S. multiple peril crop insurance into a risk‐aversion incentive (the conventional justification for insurance), an actuarial or subsidy incentive (reflecting government subsidization), and an asymmetric information incentive (which reflects farmers' information advantage). Results show that the risk‐aversion incentive is small. Farmers participate in crop insurance primarily to receive the subsidy or because of adverse selection possibilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3acrop insurance 3afarmers 3asoybeans 3asubsidies 3aUnited States1 aCalvin, Linda1 aQuiggin, John0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1999 Nov., v. 81, no. 4 p.834-849dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12443283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02530naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010800161300001600269520127300285592002801558650001601586650001201602650001301614650001501627650002801642650002301670650001201693650001001705650001301715650001001728650001501738650001201753650001401765650002701779650002001806650002101826700001401847700001601861773013501877856007502012852000902087655001202096IND60764820720221121035933.0220409e20090818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076482072DNAL7 a10.17221/1661-cjas2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVykoukalová, Z.10aPorcine <I>perilipin (PLIN)</I> gene: Structure, polymorphism and association study in Large White pigs  ap. 359-364.  aPerilipin, encoded by the <I>PLIN</I> gene, is a lipid droplet-associated phosphoprotein that functions as a key regulator of triacylglycerol storage and hydrolysis in adipocytes. In this study, structure and variability of the porcine <I>PLIN</I> gene were characterised. PCR fragments encompassing exons 1 to 9 and interspersed introns were sequenced and the obtained sequence was deposited in EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ databases (AM931171). Seven silent polymorphisms and one nonsynonymous polymorphism were detected in the coding sequence. The nonsynonymous polymorphism g.627G>A causing an amino acid substitution p.Val3Ile was found only in Meishan and Meishan × Piétrain cross. Associations were studied between loci g.4119A>G and g.7966T>C, and average daily gain (ADG), backfat thickness (BFT) or lean meat content (LMC) in 166 gilts from two herds. Due to supposed complete linkage disequilibrium between loci g.4119A>G and g.7966T>C only genotype combinations <I>AA-TT, AG-TC</I> and <I>GG-CC</I> were detected. A significant difference (<I>P</I> = 0.0290) between <I>GG-CC</I> and <I>AG-TC</I> genotype combinations for BFT in herd 2 and a suggestive difference (<I>P</I> = 0.0516) between <I>GG-CC</I> and <I>AA-TT</I> genotypes for ADG in herd 1 were detected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarge White 3aMeishan 3aPietrain 3aadipocytes 3aamino acid substitution 3aaverage daily gain 3abackfat 3aexons 3agenotype 3aherds 3ahydrolysis 3aintrons 3alean meat 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aphosphoproteins 3atriacylglycerols1 aKnoll, A.1 aČepica, S.0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 54, no. 8 p.359-364dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/1661-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245014400167300001400311520159700325592002801922650001501950650002701965650001201992650001302004650001902017650001702036650001202053650001702065650002402082650000902106650001102115650001102126650001002137650003302147650001302180650001802193650001402211653001702225653001802242653001702260653001502277653001702292653001902309653001202328653000802340700002002348700002502368700001802393773012002411856008302531852000902614655001202623IND60684138720221118053729.0210121e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068413872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2020.01.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandey, Janhvi10aSub-cellular localization and quantitative estimation of heavy metals in lemongrass plants grown in multi-metal contaminated tannery sludge  ap. 74-83.  aMajor objective of the study was to assess the localization pattern of heavy metals in different parts of lemongrass plant when grown in multi-metal contaminated sites. Microscopic and quantitative investigations (by ICP-OES) were carried out in root and leaves of plant to examine the compartmentalization of heavy metals. Along with it, the morphological variations in the size of trichomes in test plants were also perceived. Differential distribution of Cr, Pb, Ni and Cd was observed in root and leaf sections. Localization of these heavy metals in different parts of the plant cultivated in sole tannery sludge was compared with the plants grown in garden soil; which served as control. Histochemical methods for Pb, Cd and Ni detection revealed their significant accumulation in the root and leaf sections. Cr accumulation in roots of test plants was confirmed by fluorescence staining. Translocation factor <1 was recorded for Cr but greater than 1 for Ni and Pb. Moreover, Bioaccumulation factor >1 was observed for Ni and Pb. SEM studies revealed that the size of trichomes enlarged in plants grown in tannery sludge. Hence, our study provides an insight into the localization pattern of heavy metals in lemongrass plants and suggests that lemongrass can serve as a Ni and Pb phytoextractor when grown in multi- metal contaminated sites. In addition, enhancement in the size of trichomes was detected due to heavy metal stress which may prompt increment in essential oil yield thus; cultivation of lemongrass in heavy metal contaminated sites can also prove profitable economically.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCymbopogon 3abioaccumulation factor 3acadmium 3achromium 3aessential oils 3afluorescence 3agardens 3aheavy metals 3ahorticultural soils 3alead 3aleaves 3anickel 3aroots 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astaining 3atannery waste 3atrichomes 0aHeavy metals 0aHistochemical 0aFluorescence 0aLemongrass 0aLocalization 0aPhytoextractor 0aICP-OES 0aSEM1 aSarkar, Sougata1 aKumar Verma, Rajesh,1 aSingh, Saudan0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2020 July, v. 131 p.74-83dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2020.01.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03451naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008900173520185300262592002802115650001602143650001502159650001602174650001302190650001602203650001002219650001602229650001402245650001802259650001102277650001002288650001702298650001602315650000902331650001702340650001402357650000902371650001702380653001402397653001302411653001202424653001202436653001402448700002402462700005802486700005402544700002102598700002302619700005802642773010202700856008602802852000902888655001202897IND60748283420221118055739.0211007e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074828342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.1071482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiaz, Joscelin T.10aFoaming and sensory characteristics of protein-polyphenol particles in a food matrix  aAs food ingredients, protein-polyphenol aggregate particles provide a combination of structural and health-relevant functional benefits. Particles made by complexing whey (WPI) or rice (RPI) protein isolates and blueberry (BB) extracts were evaluated for foaming properties (foam volume, stability, and yield stress) using a high energy-input foaming operation (with an Ultra Power Mixer), and then also compared at low energy-input (foamed using a hand-held mixer). In the high energy-input foaming operation, whey protein rapidly formed foams (within 2 min). Whey protein-blueberry (WPI-BB) particles significantly improved yield stress and foam stability (2-fold) as compared to foams made with unmodified WPI. Rice protein required longer (>8 min) to produce foams, but foams were significantly more stable (longer drainage half-life) both when the protein was unmodified (RPI) or formulated as particles (RPI-BB). Protein-polyphenol particle foams (WPI-BB or RPI-BB) had a much greater proportion of smaller sized bubbles than polyphenol-free foams. WPI foams formed for descriptive analysis using the low energy-input method rapidly produced structures with fine, stable bubbles resistant to breakdown in the mouth, while those made with RPI had fewer, larger and looser bubbles which broke more easily after mixing and in the mouth. Inclusion of WPI-BB or RPI-BB particles enhanced palatability of protein isolates in a model (protein bars) food system as compared to non-complexed proteins. The complexed aggregate particles also provided sweetness, dark berry and dried fruit flavors and minimized bitterness and astringency. This work provides a context for understanding the utilization of protein-polyphenol particles as multifunctional ingredients that simultaneously deliver concentrated polyphenols associated with health benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aastringency 3abitterness 3ablueberries 3adrainage 3adried fruit 3afoams 3afood matrix 3ahalf life 3ahydrocolloids 3amodels 3amouth 3apalatability 3apolyphenols 3arice 3arice protein 3asweetness 3awhey 3awhey protein 0aParticles 0aProteins 0aFoaming 0aSensory 0aStructure1 aFoegeding, E.

Resident dissatisfaction with municipal water service delivery is evidenced by frequent civil protests. We consider how gathering and understanding the lived experiences of citizens could influence official responses to water interruptions. We take a transdisciplinary, problem-focussed, research approach to the experience of, and responses to, water interruptions, reflecting on the limitations of research to effect change in the lived experience. As transdisciplinary research praxis increasingly seeks expression in social outcomes, it is vital to confront both opportunities and limitations.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrinking water 3aissues and policy 3apublic water supply 0aCitizen voice 0aparticipation 0adysfunctional municipalities 0awater service delivery 0atransdisciplinarity1 aLipile, Liema1 aLipile, Mbulelo1 aMolony, Lara1 aNzwana, Xolelwa1 aO’Keeffe, Jay1 aShackleton, Sheona E.1 aWeaver, Matthew1 aPalmer, Carolyn G.0 tWater international.g2018 July 4, v. 43, no. 5 p.603-619dRoutledgewJournal:J000000164x1941-17077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02508060.2018.14978633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001900135245008200154300001500236520134600251592002801597650001501625650002801640650002501668650001301693650002501706700002701731700001601758700001401774700002501788700001901813700001801832773015201850856006902002856010202071990002302173852000902196655001202205IND60644393820221119060056.0190516e20181117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064439382DNAL7 a10.3791/586832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Yanqing10aVisualization of 3d white adipose tissue structure using whole-mount staining  ap. e58683.  aAdipose tissue is an important metabolic organ with high plasticity and is responsive to environmental stimuli and nutrient status. As such, various techniques have been developed to study the morphology and biology of adipose tissue. However, conventional visualization methods are limited to studying the tissue in 2D sections, failing to capture the 3D architecture of the whole organ. Here we present whole-mount staining, an immunohistochemistry method that preserves intact adipose tissue morphology with minimal processing steps. Hence, the structures of adipocytes and other cellular components are maintained without distortion, achieving the most representative 3D visualization of the tissue. In addition, whole-mount staining can be combined with lineage tracing methods to determine cell fate decisions. However, this technique has some limitations to providing accurate information regarding deeper parts of adipose tissue. To overcome this limitation, whole-mount staining can be further combined with tissue clearing techniques to remove the opaqueness of tissue and allow for complete visualization of entire adipose tissue anatomy using light-sheet fluorescent microscopy. Therefore, a higher resolution and more accurate representation of adipose tissue structures can be captured with the combination of these techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3afluorescence microscopy 3aimmunohistochemistry 3astaining 3awhite adipose tissue1 aYeung, Joanna Lan-Hing1 aLee, Ju Hee1 aAn, James1 aSteadman, Patrick E.1 aKim, Jae-Ryong1 aSung, Hoon-Ki0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Nov. 17, , no. 141 p.e58683-e58683dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/586833Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/58683/visualization-3d-white-adipose-tissue-structure-using-whole-mount  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008400168300001800252520114800270592002801418650001301446650002101459650001901480650002401499650003301523650002601556650002001582650001501602650003001617650001801647650002301665650001401688650001801702650001901720650003401739653002201773653002101795653002401816653001601840653002601856653002901882700002301911700001601934700002101950700002301971700002201994700001702016700001702033700002002050773010602070856008402176852000902260655001202269IND60340713720221119225830.0150808e20150818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034071372DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2014.9839192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJadhav, Nutan10aAntimicrobial activity of plant extracts against sexually transmitted pathogens  ap. 1562-1566.  aComprehensive management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) using vaginal or rectal microbicide-based intervention is one of the strategies for prevention of HIV infection.

Spreng. extracts was found to inhibit N. gonorrhoeae at lowest concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBridelia 3aCandida albicans 3aHIV infections 3aHaemophilus ducreyi 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aNeisseria gonorrhoeae 3aSyzygium cumini 3aTerminalia 3aanti-infective properties 3aethyl acetate 3agrowth retardation 3apathogens 3aplant anatomy 3aplant extracts 3asexually transmitted diseases 0aanti-STI activity 0aCandida albicans 0aHaemophilus ducreyi 0amicrobicide 0aNeisseria gonorrhoeae 0aplant extracts/fractions1 aKulkarni, Sangeeta1 aMane, Arati1 aKulkarni, Roshan1 aPalshetker, Aparna1 aSingh, Kamalinder1 aJoshi, Swati1 aRisbud, Arun1 aKulkarni, Smita0 tNatural product research.g2015 Aug. 18, v. 29, no. 16 p.1562-1566dTaylor & Francisx1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2014.9839193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245014700172500002200319506010400341506007600445520116600521592002801687506003701715650002301752650002101775650001001796650001101806650001201817653001201829653001101841653001601852653001001868700005901878700006001937700002501997700001702022700005702039700005702096700001602153700006002169773008602229856005202315852000902367655001202376IND60795634320221207142217.0221004e20220928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079563432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e109202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerlinawati, Eva10aDynamic analysis of Tapping Panel Dryness in Hevea brasiliensis reveals new insights on this physiological syndrome affecting latex production  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTapping Panel Dryness (TPD) is a physiological disorder affecting natural rubber production in Hevea brasiliensis. TPD is associated with clonal susceptibility and overexploitation of rubber trees. Most studies are based on a binary point view of the absence or presence of TPD. This study sets out to characterize the dynamic of the TPD onset through the monthly monitoring of the dry cut length. This reveals the presence of dry spots on the tapped panel of any trees. The frequency of these dry spots increases dramatically in trees developing high level of TPD. Brown bast is an irreversible form of TPD. Brown bast is correlated to a high level of dry cut length. Application of an intensive harvesting system induces early TPD occurrence, which facilitates the study of TPD. Among latex diagnosis parameters, only sucrose content is significantly associated with TPD. Other parameters are more prone to environmental effects and are not reliable as physiological markers. These findings explain the contradictory conclusions of some papers. This study suggests to use intensive harvesting system and monitor the dry cut length for genetic analysis of TPD.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHevea brasiliensis 3agenetic analysis 3alatex 3arubber 3asucrose 0aDry cut 0aMarker 0aPhenotyping 0aYield1 aMontoro, Pascal1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8002-09141 aIsmawanto, Sigit1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3519-40631 aSyafaah, Afdholiatus1 aAji, Martini1 aGiner, Michel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9310-23771 aFlori, Albert1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6962-57921 aGohet, Eric1 aOktavia, Fetrina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0271-62000 tHeliyon.g2022 Sept. 28,  p.e10920-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10920  aDNAL 7aarticle04758naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002200169245010900191300001600300520379300316592002804109653001704137653002404154653002304178653001304201653001804214653001004232700002004242773006804262856011704330852000904447655001204456IND60125725820221121065527.0150428e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012572582DNAL7 a10.1650/0010-5422(2003)105[0288:RBCSIP]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHennings, Lori A.10aRiparian bird community structure in portland, oregon: habitat, urbanization, and spatial scale patterns  ap. 288-302.  aAbstractIn 1999, we surveyed breeding bird and plant communities along 54 streams in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan region to link bird community metrics with structural and spatial characteristics of urban riparian areas. Canonical correspondence analysis produced two explanatory axes relating to vegetation and road density. Total and non-native bird abundance was higher in narrow forests. Native bird abundance was greater in narrow forests surrounded by undeveloped lands; native species richness and diversity were greater in less-developed areas. Native resident and short-distance-migrant abundance was higher in narrow forests, and diversity was positively associated with developed lands. Neotropical migrant abundance, richness, and diversity were greater in open-canopied areas with fewer roads. We examined spatial relationships by regressing bird variables on satellite-derived forest canopy cover, area of undeveloped lands, and street density in a series of 50-m buffers within a 500-m radius around study sites. Non-native bird abundance decreased with increasing canopy cover within 450 m, but most other relationships were strongest at smaller scales (50––100 m). Our results suggest that increasing urban canopy cover is the most valuable land management action for conserving native breeding birds. A hierarchical scheme for Neotropical migrant conservation might include increasing forest canopy within 450 m of streams to control non-native species and cowbirds; reducing street density within a 100-m radius of streams; and conserving or planting onsite native trees and shrubs.Estructura de Comunidades Riparias de Aves en Portland, Oregon: Háábitat, Urbanizacióón y Patrones de Escala EspacialResumen.  Censamos las comunidades de aves reproductivas y plantas a lo largo de 54 arroyos en el áárea metropolitana de Portland, Oregon en 1999 para conectar medidas de comunidades de aves con caracteríísticas estructurales y espaciales de zonas riparias urbanas. Anáálisis de correspondencia canóónica produjeron dos ejes explicativos relacionados con la vegetacióón y la densidad de carreteras. La abundancia total de aves y la de aves no nativas fueron mayores en bosques estrechos. La abundancia de aves nativas fue mayor en bosques estrechos rodeados por terrenos rurales y la riqueza y diversidad de especies fueron mayores en ááreas menos desarrolladas. La abundancia de residentes nativas y migratorias de corta distancia fue mayor en bosques estrechos y su diversidad estuvo asociada positivamente con terrenos desarrollados. La abundancia, riqueza y diversidad de las migratorias neotropicales fueron mayores en ááreas de dosel abierto y con pocas carreteras. Examinamos las relaciones espaciales mediante regresiones entre variables de aves y la cobertura del dosel derivada de imáágenes satelitales, el áárea de terrenos sin desarrollar y la densidad de calles en una serie de ááreas de 50 m de ancho en un radio de 500 m alrededor de los sitios de estudio. La abundancia de aves no nativas disminuyóó con aumentos en la cobertura del dosel hasta 450 m, pero la mayoríía de las demáás relaciones fueron máás fuertes a escalas menores (50––100 m). Nuestros resultados sugieren que el incremento de la cobertura del dosel en ááreas urbanas es la estrategia de manejo máás valiosa para conservar las aves nativas que se reproducen en el áárea. Un esquema jeráárquico para la conservacióón de las migratorias neotropicales podríía incluir aumentar la cobertura de bosque a menos de 450 m de los arroyos para controlar a las especies no nativas y a los Molothrus, reducir la densidad de calles dentro de un radio de 100 m alrededor de los arroyos y conservar o plantar áárboles y arbustos nativos.  aPublisher supplied data 0aedge effects 0aNeotropical migrant 0anon-native species 0ariparian 0aspatial scale 0aurban1 aEdge, W.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the teratogenic effects of 4‐MI during zebrafish embryogenesis. Zebrafish embryos were treated with different dosages of 4‐MI (0‐120 mM) for different exposure durations (12‐60 hours). The percentages of embryos with malformed phenotypes increased as the exposure dosages and duration time of 4‐MI increased. We also used immunofluorescence and transmission microscopy to evaluate the subtle changes in the myofibril alignment and ultrastructure of muscle organization. Our data showed that 4‐MI treatment disturbs muscle fiber alignment. Electron microscopy data indicated that Z‐lines were undetectable in the 4‐MI‐treated embryos. Although the thick and thin filaments were visible, they were all disorganized. In addition, zebrafish embryos treated by 4‐MI exhibited aberrant expression of 2 muscle‐specific genes, myod and myogenin. Taken together, we concluded that early exposure to 4‐MI affects zebrafish myogenesis, especially in myofibril alignment.  aPublisher supplied data  aNSC 103‐2321‐B‐001‐050cMinistry of Science and Technology (MOST)  aNSC 101‐2313‐B032‐001‐MY3cMinistry of Science and Technology (MOST) 3aDanio rerio 3abeers 3acolor 3aelectron microscopy 3aembryo (animal) 3aembryogenesis 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agenes 3aingredients 3amanufacturing 3amuscle development 3amuscle fibers 3amuscles 3amyogenin 3aorganic compounds 3aphenotype 3araw materials 3asoft drinks 3asoybeans 3ateratogenicity 3aultrastructure1 aSun, Chiao‐Yin1 aDing, Yu‐Ju1 aWang, Yun‐Hsin1 aLo, Kang‐Chieh1 aWen, Chi‐Chung1 aLin, Jia‐Wei1 aChang, Chiung‐Fang1 aHsu, Li‐Sung1 aChen, Hui‐Min1 aFong, Tsorng‐Harn1 aChen, Yau‐Hung1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4436-74640 tEnvironmental toxicology.g2018 Dec., v. 33, no. 12 p.1321-1328dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl57773x1520-40817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tox.226403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011400169300001600283520132300299592002801622650002301650650001201673650002201685650002301707650004101730650001501771650001201786650001801798650001201816650001301828650001101841653003701852653001701889653002501906700001501931700001801946700001901964700001401983700001401997700001602011773011602027856008602143852000902229655001202238IND60529375420221118023843.0161019e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052937542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.11.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhaofeng10aAsp577 mutations enhance the catalytic efficiency of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase from Bacillus circulans  ap. 111-116.  aThe amino acid residue Asp 577 is located in calcium-binding site III (CaIII) of the cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.19, CGTase) from Bacillus circulans STB01. In the present study, the effects of replacing Asp577 with glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine on the catalytic efficiency of this CGTase were investigated. Two of these replacements, D577G and D577A, increased the β-cyclization activity of CGTase. Kinetic studies showed that the Km values of D577G and D577A were 36.1% and 18.0% lower and the kcat/Km values were 43.9% and 23.0% higher than those of the wild-type enzyme, respectively. These mutations increased both the affinity of CGTase for maltodextrin and the catalytic efficiency of the cyclization reaction. Furthermore, although D577G and D577A only slightly enhanced β-cyclodextrin production, compared with the wild-type enzyme, their higher β-cyclization activities resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of mutant protein required during the cyclodextrin production process. Thus, the two mutants are more suitable for the industrial production of β-cyclodextrin than the wild-type enzyme. The enhancement of catalytic efficiency may be due to the smaller size of the glycine and alanine side chains, which may weaken the impact of this residue on CaIII.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus circulans 3aalanine 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3acatalytic activity 3acyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase 3aisoleucine 3aleucine 3amaltodextrins 3amutants 3amutation 3avaline 0aCyclodextrin glycosyltransferase 0aCyclodextrin 0aCalcium-binding site1 aHuang, Min1 aGu, Zhengbiao1 aHoller, Tod P.1 aCheng, Li1 aHong, Yan1 aLi, Caiming0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2016 Feb., v. 83 p.111-116dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.11.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245009200175300001400267520110200281592002801383650004401411650001201455650002201467650001001489650001101499650001101510650001801521650002001539650001201559650001701571650001801588650003301606653001301639653002401652653001701676700002201693700001701715700002101732700002701753700002301780773011401803856008601917852000902003655001202012IND60529375620221118023835.0161019e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052937562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.11.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasnain, M.

Goatgrass has been crossed with tetraploid durum wheat (Triticum turgidum var. durum L.) and hexaploid bread wheat (T. aestivum L. ssp. aestivum) to broaden the genetic base of bread wheat. We examined the contribution of main stem water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) and current assimilates to grain yield in one goatgrass relative to those in one durum and four cultivars of bread wheat under well-watered and droughted field conditions across two years. Drought reduced grain yield and its components. Number of tillers per plant was higher in goatgrass, but 55% of tillers produced were sterile. Number of grains per spike was lower in goatgrass. Grain weight was the component severely limiting potential yield in goatgrass. Main stem WSC and concentration was lowest in goatgrass. Linear rate of grain growth in goatgrass was 20 and 17 mg spike⁻¹ day⁻¹ under well-watered and droughted conditions, whereas those in durum and bread wheats ranged from 55 to 73 and from 37 to 60 mg spike⁻¹day⁻¹, respectively. Current assimilates were the major source of carbon to fill the grains under both irrigation regimes. A large number of goatgrass accessions and adapted durum cultivars should be examined for grain yield and its components to identify promising accessions to be used in producing synthetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAegilops tauschii 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3abreads 3acarbon 3acultivars 3adiploidy 3adrought 3adurum wheat 3agenetic background 3agrain yield 3ahexaploidy 3aresearch 3asynthetic products 3atetraploidy 3awater solubility 0aTriticum aestivum 0acurrent assimilates 0agrain yield potential1 aWaines, J.0 tCereal research communications.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 41, no. 4 p.626-635dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:J000000058x1788-91707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/crc.2013.00273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011700171300001600288520107500304592002801379650002001407650002201427650002101449650001301470650001901483650002101502650002301523650001701546650002201563650001301585650001101598650002101609650002201630650001601652653001101668653002501679653001901704700001601723700001401739700001601753700001501769773013101784856008701915852000902002655001202011IND60529375720221118023857.0220628e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052937572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.11.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Xiancai10aStudies of the plasticizing effect of different hydrophilic inorganic salts on starch/poly (vinyl alcohol) films  ap. 223-230.  aThe effects of different inorganic salts LiCl, MgCl₂·6H₂O, CaCl₂, and AlCl₃·6H₂O on the crystalline, thermal, water vapor barrier, and tensile properties of starch/PVA films were studied. The high plasticizing efficiency of all these four inorganic salts for starch/PVA film was confirmed by the obtained results. These four salts all had a good compatibility with starch/PVA within the content of 15 wt% and starch/PVA became completely miscible with the addition of 15 wt% inorganic salts. All these four salts had a strong destroying effect on the crystals of starch and PVA. Among these four salts, AlCl₃·6H₂O had the largest negative effect on the thermal stability of starch/PVA and LiCl had the largest improving effect on the water sorption rate of starch/PVA film. On the whole MgCl₂·6H₂O and CaCl₂ were the more suitable plasticizer for starch/PVA film among these four inorganic salts. With the addition of 15 wt% MgCl₂·6H₂O and CaCl₂, the elongation at break of starch/PVA film could reach to 418.83% and 434.80%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aaluminum chloride 3acalcium chloride 3acrystals 3ahydrophilicity 3alithium chloride 3amagnesium chloride 3aplasticizers 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3asorption 3astarch 3atensile strength 3athermal stability 3awater vapor 0aStarch 0aPoly (vinyl alcohol) 0aInorganic salt1 aLi, Hongmei1 aLuo, Yong1 aZhao, Yulai1 aHou, Linxi0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2016 Jan., v. 82 p.223-230dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.11.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03646naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006700139245017900206300001800385500002000403520187100423592002802294650001702322650002102339650001602360650001902376650001102395650000902406650001202415650001602427650002102443650001202464650001202476650001602488650001202504650003302516650001102549650001002560650001202570650001402582650001202596650002502608650001002633650001702643650001702660700002202677700002002699700005902719700006102778700002402839773013502863856007302998852000903071655001203080IND60677776120221121202329.0191213e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067777612DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.135682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosales Nieto, Cesar A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3414-338X10aPre‐pubertal growth, muscle and fat accumulation in male and female sheep—Relationships with metabolic hormone concentrations, timing of puberty and reproductive outcomes  ap. 1596-1603.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMetabolic homeostasis is aligned with changes in growth and body composition, through processes mediated by circulating metabolites and metabolic hormones, and is eventually linked to reproductive success. In the present study with sheep, we determined the relationships among phenotypic and genotypic rates of growth, muscle and fat accumulation, and the circulating concentrations of metabolic and tested for relationships with the timing of puberty and subsequent reproductive outcomes. We used 64 females and 62 males with known phenotypic values for depth of eye muscle (EMD) and fat (FAT) and known Australian Sheep Breeding Values at post‐weaning age for live weight (PWT), depth of eye muscle (PEMD) and depth of fat (PFAT). Blood plasma sampled every 20 min for 8 hr via was assayed for growth hormone (GH), insulin‐like growth factor I (IGF‐I), insulin, leptin, ghrelin, follistatin, glucose and non‐esterified fatty acids (NEFA). In males, PWT was positively related to the concentrations of GH, follistatin and glucose, whereas FAT and PFAT were positively related to IGF‐I concentrations (p < .01). Testosterone concentration was negatively related to muscle variables (p < .001) and to PFAT (p < .05). In females, the only significant relationship detected was the positive link between EMD and insulin concentrations (p < .05). Reproductive variables were only measured in females. Live weight at first oestrus was related positively to insulin concentration and negatively to GH concentration (p < .05). No other relationships with reproductive variables were significant. The relationships that were detected suggest subtle differences between the sexes in the way their metabolic homeostasis responds to changes in the rates of growth, and muscle and fat accumulation, perhaps due to interference by testosterone in the males.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood plasma 3abody composition 3abody weight 3abreeding value 3aestrus 3aeyes 3afemales 3afollistatin 3afree fatty acids 3aghrelin 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3aleptin 3amales 3amuscles 3aphenotype 3apuberty 3areproductive success 3asheep 3asomatotropin 3atestosterone1 aFerguson, Mark B.1 aBriegel, Jan R.1 aHedger, Mark P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0602-37241 aMartin, Graeme B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1905-79341 aThompson, Andrew N.0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2019 Dec., v. 54, no. 12 p.1596-1603dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.135683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03571naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245010300164300001600267520216400283592002802447650001302475650002602488650001302514650001902527650001002546650001502556650001402571650002302585650001502608650001202623650001802635650001402653650001402667650001602681650002402697650001202721650001602733650001002749651001702759651001302776700002202789700002602811700001802837700001802855773010402873856007902977852000903056655001203065IND60519468820221118182655.0160429e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051946882DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.125632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuleta, Daniel10aLocal and regional determinants of vascular epiphyte mortality in the Andean mountains of Colombia  ap. 841-849.  aWe present the first large‐scale assessment of vascular epiphyte mortality in the neotropics. Our goals were to explore the primary types of vascular epiphyte death and to identify local and regional determinants of epiphyte mortality in natural forests located 60 to 2900 m a.s.l. in the Colombian Andes. Based on two consecutive annual surveys, we followed the fate of 4247 epiphytes to estimate the epiphyte mortality rate on 116 host trees at nine sites. A logistic regression analysis for proportional data with a binomial distribution of the error was applied to determine the probability of epiphyte death in relation to local and regional explanatory variables. The overall epiphyte mortality rate was 7.5 ± 1.1% year⁻¹ (mean ± standard error). Non‐mechanical factors, such as desiccation, accounted for a mortality rate of 1.9 ± 0.3% year⁻¹. Mechanical factors, such as falling branches, accounted for a mortality rate of 5.6 ± 1.1% year⁻¹. According to generalized linear modelling analyses, both local and regional factors played key roles in determining epiphyte mortality. The actual evapotranspiration (regional factor) and the mean epiphyte attachment height (local factor) were both consistently positively associated with the probability of epiphyte death. Additional variables identified as possible determinants of the epiphyte mortality were the temperature seasonality, annual temperature range, the height and number of branches of the tree and the abundance of large trees (DBH ≥10 cm). Synthesis. The recorded high mortality rate indicates that natural epiphyte assemblages must be highly dynamic to avoid local extinction of species. Our study identifies actual evapotranspiration as an important driver of epiphyte mortality, and we highlight its importance in determining the fate tropical epiphyte communities may experience if evapotranspiration increases due to climate change. We hope our study addresses the paucity of research on non‐tree growth forms, typically ignored in vegetation dynamics, and encourages their inclusion in future studies that investigate the function of tropical ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3abinomial distribution 3abranches 3aclimate change 3adeath 3aecosystems 3aepiphytes 3aevapotranspiration 3aextinction 3aforests 3alinear models 3amortality 3amountains 3aprobability 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3atemperature 3atrees 3aAndes region 3aColombia1 aBenavides, Ana M.1 aLópez‐Rios, Victor1 aDuque, Alvaro1 aZotz, Gerhard0 tjournal of ecology.g2016 May, v. 104, no. 3 p.841-849dBlackwell Scientific Publ.x0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.125633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245014200166300001800308520125700326592002801583650002201611650002301633650001101656650001201667650002101679650002201700650002401722650001701746650001301763650001201776650001101788650000801799653001701807653002201824653002601846653001701872700001801889700001301907700002101920700001501941700001601956700001501972773016801987856008502155852000902240655001202249IND60637137520221121095248.0190416e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063713752DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(18)62059-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Gang,10aEndogenous nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide detection in indole-3-butyric acid-induced adventitious root formation in Camellia sinensis  ap. 2273-2280.  aNitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are essential signaling molecules with key roles in auxin induced adventitious root formation in many plants. However, whether they are the sole determinants for adventitious root formation is worth further study. In this study, endogenous NO and H2O2 were monitored in tea cutting with or without indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) treatment by using the fluorescent probes diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF-2DA) and 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA), respectively. The overproduction of NO and H2O2 was detected in the rooting parts of tea cuttings treated with or without IBA. But little NO and H2O2 was detected before the initiation phase of tea cuttings even with IBA treatment indicating that they might be not directly induced by IBA. Further carbon and nitrogen analysis found that the overproduction of NO and H2O2 were coincident with the consumption of soluble sugars and the assimilation of nitrogen. These results suggest that rooting phases should be taken into consideration with the hypothesis that auxin induces adventitious root formation via NO- and H2O2-dependent pathways and sink establishment might be a prerequisite for NO and H2O2 mediated adventitious root formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3aadventitious roots 3acarbon 3acutting 3afluorescent dyes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aindole butyric acid 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen 3arooting 3asugars 3atea 0anitric oxide 0ahydrogen peroxide 0aindole-3-butyric acid 0atea cuttings1 aWANG, Li-yuan1 aRUAN, Li1 aZHANG, Cheng-cai1 aWu, Liyun,1 aLI, Hai-lin1 aCHENG, Hao0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2018 Oct., v. 17, no. 10 p.2273-2280dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

We compared the distribution and abundance of target mycorrhizal fungi detected in the soil using DNA‐based molecular techniques and germination in seed packets of Goodyera pubescens, Liparis liliifolia and Tipularia discolor. We further examined Tulasnella spp. associated with G. pubescens to determine whether areas with abundant host fungi resulted from multiple genets of the same species or from a single widespread fungal genet. We found that target fungi were more likely to be detected using soil DNA assays than by seed germination. Based on soil DNA, fungi were more widespread than suggested by seed germination, which most often reflected the presence of abundant mycorrhizal fungi in the soil. Fungi were more likely to be abundant close to established orchids. Established plants of G. pubescens that were < 50 cm apart associated with a single abundant fungal genet, while those > 50 cm apart associated with multiple fungal genets. Synthesis. This study demonstrates the importance of using multiple methods to detect the distribution and abundance of target fungi and suggests that fungal ‘hot spots’ may be keys to the dynamics of orchid populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aGoodyera 3aTipularia discolor 3aTulasnella 3amycorrhizal fungi 3apopulation dynamics 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3asoil1 aTaylor, D.

Melatonin can be metabolized by free radical interaction, but also pseudo‐enzymatically or by enzymatic pathways. We have previously detected the existence of melatonin‐synthesizing enzymes and melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 in the ram reproductive tract; thus, in order to start to elucidate melatonin catabolism in these organs, we have investigated the presence of the melatonin‐catabolizing enzymes indoleamine 2,3‐dioxygenase (IDO, both IDO1 and IDO2 isoforms) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in testis, epididymis and accessory glands. Gene expression analyses by real‐time PCR showed the presence of MPO, IDO1 and IDO2 in all the organs of the ram reproductive tract and revealed that MPO is the main melatonin‐catabolizing enzyme, which is mainly expressed in the testis and the bulbourethral glands (p < .05). These results were further corroborated by immunohistochemical staining, and by Western blot. Likewise, MPO was also evidenced in epididymal and ejaculated spermatozoa by indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot. In conclusion, melatonin‐catabolizing enzymes MPO, IDO1 and IDO2 are expressed in the ram reproductive tract, and MPO is the most expressed one, mainly in the testis and the bulbourethral glands. The presented results warrant further studies on the function of these enzymes and their melatonin‐metabolizing activity.  aPublisher supplied data  aCICYT‐FEDER AGL 2013‐43328‐PcMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad  aCICYT‐FEDER AGL 2014‐57863‐RcMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad  a110 157 635 854 ProjectcDepartamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación 3aWestern blotting 3aepididymis 3afluorescent antibody technique 3afree radicals 3agene expression 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aindoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 3amelatonin 3ametabolism 3amyeloperoxidase 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arams 3areceptors 3aspermatozoa 3astaining 3atestes1 aCarvajal‐Serna, Melissa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3929-50641 aLázaro‐Gaspar, Sofía1 aPérez‐Pé, Rosaura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2312-64021 aMuiño‐Blanco, Teresa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1306-85171 aCebrián‐Pérez, José A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9842-61971 aCasao, Adriana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1997-42620 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2019 Dec., v. 54, no. 12 p.1643-1650dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.135743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005500139245024000194300001800434500002000452520205700472592002802529650002102557650000902578650001002587650001702597650001002614650001602624650001302640773013502653856007302788852000902861655001202870IND60677776420221121202413.0191213e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067777642DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.135672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatts, John1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0777-332710aMeasurement of membrane integrity in canine spermatozoa using a fluorescent computer‐assisted spermatozoal quantification method and manual counting after eosin‐nigrosin staining compared with manual counting after CFDA/PI staining  ap. 1583-1595.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe aim of this study was to compare measurement of spermatozoal membrane status using computer‐assisted spermatozoal quantification (CASQ) and eosin‐nigrosin (EN) staining with manual counting after CFDA/PI staining. Analysis was performed on both fresh and thawed cryopreserved canine semen. Membrane‐disrupted spermatozoa (MDS) were counted using CASQ (n = 311) in an untreated sample and a completely membrane‐disrupted sample, and the percentage of membrane‐intact spermatozoa (MIS) calculated: (Total count − Untreated sample count) ÷ Total count × 100. Spermatozoa were stained with a one‐step EN stain (n = 501), and then, at least 100 spermatozoa were manually examined under ×1,000 magnification and classified as MDS (stained with eosin) or MIS (non‐stained). Spermatozoa from the same samples were also stained with CFDA/PI, and then, at least 200 spermatozoa were manually examined under ×1,000 magnification and classified as MIS (completely stained by CFDA) or MDS. The percentage of progressively motile spermatozoa (PMS) was determined by both computer‐assisted semen analysis (CASA) and subjective methodologies, and the data were subsequently analysed to measure the agreement between the CASQ and EN methods with the CFDA/PI technique using Bland–Altman methodology. Pearson's correlation was measured between the MIS and PMS percentage samples and correlation coefficients compared. The mean MIS percentage was lower for CASQ and higher for EN than in CFDA/PI for all comparisons. The agreement of MIS percentage between CASQ and CFDA/PI was −20.2% to 32.0%, and between EN and CFDA/PI was −32.9% to 14.9%. In all methods, the MIS and PMS percentages were correlated (p < .001). Measurement of CFDA/PI appeared to be the most reliable and accurate method of determining MIS percentage in dogs. Further investigation is required to determine whether the CASQ technique can be improved. Eosin‐nigrosin staining also appeared to be unreliable at MIS <80% and overestimated the MIS percentage.  aPublisher supplied data 3acryopreservation 3adogs 3aeosin 3afluorescence 3asemen 3aspermatozoa 3astaining0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2019 Dec., v. 54, no. 12 p.1583-1595dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.135673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02062naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245003700174300001600211500031700227520079000544592002801334650001101362650002501373650001501398650001301413650000901426650002001435650001001455700002301465773012101488856008301609990002301692852000901715655001201724IND60612795820221118064436.0180907e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061279582DNAL7 a10.1097/NT.0b013e31826266892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKavouras, Stavros A.10aHydration Status in Active Youth  ap.

It is well documented that dehydration increases physiologic strain and decreases athletic performance, especially in hot environments. Although there are numerous studies evaluating hydration status in adults, limited data concerning hydration levels in athletic youth exist. Nevertheless, most of these studies clearly indicate that (a) dehydration is a major and common problem within children exercising in the heat; and (b) children do not have the capacity to translate hydration awareness to successful hydration strategies. Further research is needed, and constant efforts must be made toward the development of more efficient hydration strategies in order to educate young people about the benefits of optimal hydration status.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aathletic performance 3abody water 3achildren 3aheat 3ahuman nutrition 3ayouth1 aArnaoutis, Giannis0 tNutrition today.g2012 , v. 47, no. 4 Suppl p.S11-S13dLippincott Williams & WilkinswJournal:13904x1538-98397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/NT.0b013e31826266893Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100005700137245011600194300001800310500002000328520150100348592002801849596006001877650004901937650002301986650001502009650002802024650001702052650001302069650001102082650002102093650001002114650001302124650001502137650002602152650001902178650000902197650001302206650001502219650001802234650001802252650001802270650001102288650001402299651003302313700002302346700002102369700002202390700002402412773012602436856007102562852000902633655001202642IND60620637120221118003833.0181114e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062063712DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.50612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorran, Sarah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5739-106010aMultiple target site resistance to glyphosate in junglerice (Echinochloa colona) lines from California orchards  ap. 2747-2753.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: In California specialty cropping systems such as vineyards and orchards, Echinochloa colona is present as a summer annual weed. It is able to germinate throughout the growing season whenever favorable conditions are present, and management relies heavily on glyphosate applications. Glyphosate‐resistant (GR) E. colona biotypes are present in the state, but the levels of resistance observed suggest that there may be differences in mechanisms of resistance among populations. RESULTS: Echinochloa colona lines collected from different regions of California's Central Valley presented resistance levels ranging from 1.4 to 4.3‐fold compared to susceptible lines. No differences in the absorption and translocation of [¹⁴C]‐glyphosate were observed among lines. Resistant lines accumulated eight‐fold less shikimic acid after treatment with 435 and 870 g a.e. ha⁻¹ glyphosate compared to the most susceptible line. Sequencing of a region of the EPSPS gene revealed three single nucleotide changes leading to amino acid substitutions at Proline 106, including Pro106Leu, Pro106Thr and Pro106Ser. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that an altered target site in EPSPS is contributing to resistance in these lines and resistance has evolved independently, multiple times in the Central Valley of California. Additional research is needed to further understand the genomic contributions of resistance loci in this polyploid weed species. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  aSCB13057cCalifornia Department of Food and Agriculture 3a3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyltransferase 3aEchinochloa colona 3aabsorption 3aamino acid substitution 3aannual weeds 3abiotypes 3acarbon 3acropping systems 3agenes 3agenomics 3aglyphosate 3aglyphosate resistance 3agrowing season 3aloci 3aorchards 3apolyploidy 3aradiolabeling 3aradionuclides 3ashikimic acid 3asummer 3avineyards 3aCentral Valley of California1 aMoretti, Marcelo L1 aBrunharo, Caio A1 aFischer, Albert J1 aHanson, Bradley D.,0 tPest management science.g2018 Dec., v. 74, no. 12 p.2747-2753dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.50613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02087naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245006000165300001600225500013300241520090000374592002801274650002101302650001101323650001301334650002001347650001801367650001801385650001601403650001201419650001601431650001101447651001901458773012101477856008301598990002301681852000901704655001201713IND60612795920221118064516.0180907e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061279592DNAL7 a10.1097/NT.0b013e31826265e32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGandy, Joan10aFirst Findings of the United Kingdom Fluid Intake Study  ap.

National dietary surveys are valuable tools for identifying sources of energy, including sugar, in a population. However, these surveys use diaries that aim to capture food intake rather than fluid intake and may underestimate beverage and therefore energy intakes. A study of 1456 children and adults was conducted in the United Kingdom using a 7-day fluid specific intake diary. Total daily intakes of beverages were higher in all ages compared with previous surveys. However, 30% of adults and more than 50% of children did not meet European adequate intake for total water. Children consumed on average 175 kcal/d as still or carbonated soft drinks. This fluid-specific survey raises concerns about the total and type of fluids consumed by both adults and children in the United Kingdom.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdequate Intakes 3aadults 3achildren 3adietary surveys 3aeating habits 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3aobesity 3asoft drinks 3asugars 3aUnited Kingdom0 tNutrition today.g2012 , v. 47, no. 4 Suppl p.S14-S16dLippincott Williams & WilkinswJournal:13904x1538-98397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/NT.0b013e31826265e33Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245010300176300001400279520156900293592002801862650001901890650001501909650001301924650001901937650001301956650002001969650001101989650000702000650001102007650002002018650001302038650001302051650001302064653001302077653001902090653004502109653001302154653001802167653001702185700002902202773009402231856008402325852000902409655001202418IND60565413720221116140707.0170325e20170303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056541372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2017.01.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFumes, Bruno Henrique10aUse of graphene supported on aminopropyl silica for microextraction of parabens from water samples  ap. 64-71.  aThis paper describes the synthesis, characterization and use of graphene supported on aminopropyl silica through covalent bonds (Si-G) as a sorbent for microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS). Five parabens (methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and benzyl) present in water matrices were used as model compounds for this evaluation. The Si-G phase was compared to other sorbents used in MEPS (C18 and Strata™-X) and also with graphene supported on primary-secondary amine (PSA) silica, where Si-G showed better results. After this, the MEPS experimental parameters were optimized using the Si-G sorbent. The following variables were optimized through univariate experiments: pH (4,7 and 10), desorption solvent (ACN:MeOH (50:50), ACN:H2O (40:60), MeOH and ACN) and ionic strength (0, 10 and 20% of NaCl). A factorial design 26−2 was then employed to evaluate other variables, such as the sample volume, desorption volume, sampling cycles, wash cycles and desorption cycles, as well as the influence of NaCl% on the extraction performance. The optimized method achieved a linear range of 0.2–20μg/L for most parabens; weighted calibration models were employed during the linearity evaluation to reduce the absolute sum of the residue values and improve R2, which ranged from 0.9753 to 0.9849. The method’s accuracy was 82.3–119.2%; precision, evaluated as the coefficient of variance for intraday and interday analysis, ranged from 1.5 to 19.2%. After evaluation of the figures of merit, the method was applied to the determination of parabens in water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatography 3adesorption 3agraphene 3aionic strength 3amethanol 3amicroextraction 3amodels 3apH 3asilica 3asodium chloride 3asolvents 3asorbents 3avariance 0aGraphene 0aGraphene oxide 0aMicroextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS) 0aParabens 0aWater samples 0aHPLC–MS/MS1 aLanças, Fernando Mauro,0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017 Mar. 03, v. 1487 p.64-71dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2017.01.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002100169245006000190300001600250520194400266592002802210653001502238653002502253653002502278653001402303653001502317653001102332773006802343856011702411852000902528655001202537IND60125726820221120202715.0151104e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012572682DNAL7 a10.1650/0010-5422(2003)105[0378:SRDIIT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWallander, Johan10aSex roles during incubation in the common ringed plover  ap. 378-381.  aParental behavior during incubation is an important aspect of the breeding system, which varies greatly among shorebirds. There are, however, few studies of incubation sex roles in shorebirds during darkness. In Charadrius species, males are believed to perform most of the incubation during the night. In this study of night- and daytime incubation sex roles in the Common Ringed Plover (Charadrius hiaticula), males tended to do more of the nighttime incubation (58%%) than did females; during the day the roles tended to be reversed (males 45%%), but the differences were not statistically significant. The reasons why mates of the Common Ringed Plover seem to share nocturnal incubation more equally than do other Charadrius species are not clear but may involve differences in food levels and day length between areas.Papel de los Sexos durante la Incubacióón en Charadrius hiaticulaResumen. El comportamiento parental durante la incubacióón es un aspecto importante del sistema reproductivo, el cual varíía considerablemente entre las aves playeras. Sin embargo, los estudios sobre el papel de los sexos en la incubacióón nocturna en las aves playeras son escasos. En las especies de Charadrius, se cree que los machos realizan la mayor parte de la incubacióón nocturna. En este estudio, sobre el papel de los sexos durante los periodos de incubacióón nocturnos y diurnos en Charadrius hiaticula, los machos tendieron a realizar una mayor parte de la incubacióón nocturna (58%%) que las hembras; durante el díía los papeles tendieron a revertirse (machos 45%%), pero las diferencias no fueron significativas estadíísticamente. Las razones por las cuales las parejas de C. hiaticula parecen compartir máás equitativamente la incubacióón nocturna que otras especies de Charadrius no estáán claras pero pueden estar relacionadas con diferencias en los niveles de alimento y duracióón del díía entre ááreas.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCharadrius 0aCommon Ringed Plover 0anocturnal incubation 0asex roles 0ashorebirds 0awaders0 tThe Condor.g2003 May, v. 105, no. 2 p.378-381x1938-54227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1650%2F0010-5422%282003%29105%5B0378%3ASRDIIT%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03586naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245004700171300002000218520209800238592002802336650002202364650002602386650001402412650001502426650001102441650001902452650002502471650002002496650002002516650002202536650001902558650002902577650001102606650001502617650001302632650001902645650002202664650001302686650001802699650002602717650001402743700001802757700001702775700006402792773013102856856008402987852000903071655001203080IND60677839220221116231712.0191213e20191111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067783922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b032912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelasco, Vanessa10aPersonalized Drug Efficacy Monitoring Chip  ap. 14927-14935.  aCancer drug resistance mechanisms such as tumor heterogeneity and adaptable feedback loops are prevalent issues facing cancer therapy development. Drug resistance can be unique to a cancer type and, most importantly, to each individual cancer patient. Consequently, testing different dosages and therapeutics directly on each individual patient sample (i.e., tumor and cancer cells) has compelling advantages compared to large scale in vitro drug testing and is a step toward personalized drug selection and effective treatment development. Recently, microfluidic-based chemo-sensitivity assays on patient biopsies have been proposed. Despite their novelty, these platforms usually rely on optical labels, optical equipment, or complex microfabricated channel geometries and structures. In this work, we proposed a novel lab on a chip platform capable of real-time and continuous screening of drug efficacy on (cancer) cell subpopulations without the need of labels or bulky readout optical equipment. In this platform, several label-free and rapid techniques have been implemented for the precise capturing of cells of interest in parallel with the real-time measurement and characterization of the effectiveness of candidate therapeutic agents. To demonstrate the utility of the platform, the effect of an apoptotic inducer, topoisomerase I inhibitor, 7-ethyl-10-hydrocamptothecin (SN38) on human colorectal carcinoma cancer cells (HCT 116) was used as a study model. Additionally, electrical results were optically verified to examine the continuous measurements of the biological mechanisms, specifically, apoptosis and necrosis, during therapeutic agent characterizations. The proposed device is a versatile platform which can also be easily redesigned for the automated and arrayed analysis of cell–drug interaction down to the single cell level. Our platform is another step toward enabling the personalized screening of drug efficacy on individual patients’ samples that potentially leads to a better understanding of drug resistance and the optimization of patients’ treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA topoisomerase 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3aautomation 3abiopsy 3acancer therapy 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adrug evaluation 3adrug resistance 3aenzyme inhibitors 3ahuman diseases 3alab-on-a-chip technology 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anecrosis 3aneoplasm cells 3aoptical equipment 3apatients 3arapid methods 3aresistance mechanisms 3ascreening1 aJoshi, Kushal1 aChen, Jiamin1 aEsfandyarpour, Rahim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4528-36010 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Nov. 11, v. 91, no. 23 p.14927-14935dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b032913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03678naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245019000214300001800404520210900422592002802531650001102559650001502570650001802585650002202603650001502625650002102640650001302661650001802674650001102692650001602703650001802719650001502737650002102752650002502773651001302798653002702811653001902838653001602857653001902873653001702892653001802909700001802927700002102945773012102966856008803087852000903175655001203184IND60628246820221118124607.0190404e20190410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062824682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.01.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGebremicael, T.G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0494-436X10aAttributing the hydrological impact of different land use types and their long-term dynamics through combining parsimonious hydrological modelling, alteration analysis and PLSR analysis  ap. 1155-1167.  aUnderstanding the relationship between hydrological processes and environmental changes is important for improved water management. The Geba catchment in Ethiopia, forming the headwaters of Tekeze-Atbara basin, was known for its severe land degradation before the recent success in integrated watershed management. This study analyses the hydrological response attributed to land management change using an integrated approach composed of (i) simulating the hydrological response of Land Use/Cover (LULC) changes; (ii) assessing the alteration of streamflow using Alteration of Hydrological Indicators (IHA); and (iii) quantifying the contribution of individual LULC types to the hydrology using Partial Least Square Regression model (PLSR).The results show that the expansion of agricultural and grazing land at the expense of natural vegetation has increased the surface runoff 77% and decreased dry season flow by 30% in the 1990s compared to 1970s. However, natural vegetation started to recover from the late 1990s and dry season flows increased by 16%, while surface runoff declined by 19%. More pronounced changes of the streamflow were noticed at sub-catchment level, mainly associated with the uneven spatial distribution of land degradation and rehabilitation. However, the rate of increase of low-flow halted in the 2010s, most probably due to an increase of water withdrawals for irrigation. Fluctuations in hydrological alteration parameters are in agreement with the observed LULC change. The PLSR analysis demonstrates that most LULC types showed a strong association with all hydrological components.These findings demonstrate that changing water conditions are attributed to the observed LULC change dynamics. The combined analysis of rainfall-runoff modelling, alteration indicators and PLSR is able to assess the impact of environmental change on the hydrology of complex catchments. The IHA tool is robust to assess the magnitude of streamflow alterations obtained from the hydrological model while the PLSR method is useful to zoom into which LULC is responsible for this alteration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3adry season 3agrazing lands 3ahydrologic models 3airrigation 3aland degradation 3aland use 3aleast squares 3arunoff 3astream flow 3asubwatersheds 3avegetation 3awater management 3awatershed management 3aEthiopia 0aHydrological processes 0aLand use/cover 0aWflow model 0aGeba catchment 0aIHA analysis 0aPSLR analysis1 aMohamed, Y.A.1 aVan der Zaag, P.0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Apr. 10, v. 660 p.1155-1167dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.01.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245005700173300001600230500071800246520112900964592002802093650002702121650002002148650002002168650002102188650001302209650001302222650001202235650002002247650001702267650002002284650001202304650003002316650001202346650001602358650003002374650001402404700002002418700002302438773012102461856008302582990002302665852000902688655001202697IND60612796120221118064444.0180907e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061279612DNAL7 a10.1097/NT.0b013e31826266402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Richard J.10aImpact of Beverage Content on Health and the Kidneys  ap.

Miguel A. Lanaspa, PhD, is an assistant professor in the Division of Renal Diseases at the University of Colorado in Denver and an expert on the biologic effects of fructose and uric acid.  aThe last 50 years have witnessed an epidemic rise in obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and chronic kidney disease. Some animal research suggests the epidemic may in part be triggered by sugar. Sugar contains glucose and fructose, and studies suggest it is the fructose component that may have a role in chronic disease development. Animal studies indicate that fructose is distinct from other sugars by its ability to cause transient adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion in the cell with uric acid generation. The administration of fructose, or the raising of uric acid, can induce kidney disease and accelerate established kidney disease in animals. Therefore, we believe that the greatest risk from sugar is when it is given as a soft drink, as the rapidity of ingestion relates directly to the concentration of fructose that the cells are exposed to and hence govern the degree of ATP depletion and uric acid generation. Restricting sugar-sweetened beverages may be one strategy to combat obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and kidney disease, but human intervention studies are needed to support the theory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aanimal diseases 3aanimal research 3achronic diseases 3adiabetes 3afructose 3aglucose 3ahuman nutrition 3ahypertension 3akidney diseases 3akidneys 3anutrition risk assessment 3aobesity 3asoft drinks 3asugar sweetened beverages 3auric acid1 aThomas, Jeffrey1 aLanaspa, Miguel A.0 tNutrition today.g2012 , v. 47, no. 4 Suppl p.S22-S26dLippincott Williams & WilkinswJournal:13904x1538-98397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/NT.0b013e31826266403Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009600171300002000267520169900287592002801986650002002014650001702034650002102051650002502072650001102097650001502108650001502123650002202138650001502160700001402175700001802189700001702207700001202224700001802236700001802254700001402272700001702286700001402303700001302317700005702330700005802387773013102445856008402576852000902660655001202669IND60677839320200410000000.0191213e20191031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067783932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b033052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Shen-Ming10aGenetically Encoded Fluorescent Amino Acid for Monitoring Protein Interactions through FRET  ap. 14936-14942.  aFörster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a well-established method for studying macromolecular interactions and conformational changes within proteins. Such a method normally uses fluorescent proteins or chemical-labeling methods which are often only accessible to surface-exposed residues and risk-disturbing target protein structures. Here, we demonstrate that the genetic incorporation of a synthetic fluorescent amino acid, L-(7-hydroxycoumarin-4-yl) ethylglycine (Cou) and natural endogenous fluorophore Tryptophan (Trp) residues of a protein could serve as an efficient FRET pair to monitor protein interactions, using the signaling transducer β-arrestin-1 as a model system. We used this technology to record the dynamic spectra in both binding and competition experiments of β-arrestin-1, the contribution of each specific phosphate in ternary complex formation, in a rapid and efficient manner. The determined Kd value for the association between the active arrestin and Fab30 is 0.68 μM in the three-component interaction system. Moreover, we were able to determine the contributions of the site 3 phospho-site and the site 6 phospho-site binding, each contributing to the high affinity ternary complex assembly as 2.7 fold and 15.5 fold, respectively, which were never determined before. These results thus highlighted the potential usage of this new method in measurement of the allosteric-induced enhanced affinity with small amount proteins and in a fast manner and in a complex system. Collectively, our newly developed Trp:Cou FRET system based on genetic expansion technology has extended the molecular toolboxes available for biochemical and structural biology studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3afluorescent proteins 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aphosphates 3aprotein structure 3atryptophan1 aYang, Fan1 aCai, Bai-Yang1 aHe, Qing-Tao1 aLiu, Qi1 aQu, Chang-Xiu1 aHan, Ming-Jie1 aKong, Wei1 aJia, Ying-Li1 aLi, Fahui1 aYu, Xiao1 aSun, Jin-Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3572-15801 aWang, Jiangyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9748-88980 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Oct. 31, v. 91, no. 23 p.14936-14942dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b033053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04901naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245012100174300001600295500084500311520260701156592002803763650002003791650002203811650001303833650001103846650001903857650002303876650001703899650001003916650002003926650001803946650001903964650001903983650001604002650001304018650001604031650001504047700001704062700002104079700002804100700002004128700002304148773012104171856008304292990002304375852000904398655001204407IND60612796220221118064334.0180907e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061279622DNAL7 a10.1097/NT.0b013e318264ef5b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuckelbauer, Rebecca10aPromotion and Provision of Drinking Water in Schools for Overweight Prevention: Randomized, Controlled Cluster Trial  ap.

Intervention trials have shown that schools are a promising setting for overweight prevention. To date, no particular intervention has been proved to be effective in overweight prevention. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study showed that a simple intervention with the sole focus of promoting water consumption effectively prevented overweight among children in elementary schools in socially deprived urban areas. OBJECTIVE: The study tested whether a combined environmental and educational intervention solely promoting water consumption was effective in preventing overweight among children in elementary school. METHODS: The participants in this randomized, controlled cluster trial were second- and third-graders from 32 elementary schools in socially deprived areas of 2 German cities. Water fountains were installed and teachers presented 4 prepared classroom lessons in the intervention group schools (N = 17) to promote water consumption. Control group schools (N = 15) did not receive any intervention. The prevalence of overweight (defined according to the International Obesity Task Force criteria), BMI SD scores, and beverage consumption (in glasses per day; 1 glass was defined as 200 mL) self-reported in 24-hour recall questionnaires, were determined before (baseline) and after the intervention. In addition, the water flow of the fountains was measured during the intervention period of 1 school year (August 2006 to June 2007). RESULTS: Data on 2950 children (intervention group: N = 1641; control group: N = 1309; age, mean ± SD: 8.3 ± 0.7 years) were analyzed. After the intervention, the risk of overweight was reduced by 31% in the intervention group, compared with the control group, with adjustment for baseline prevalence of overweight and clustering according to school. Changes in BMI SD scores did not differ between the intervention group and the control group. Water consumption after the intervention was 1.1 glasses per day greater in the intervention group. No intervention effect on juice and soft drink consumption was found. Daily water flow of the fountains indicated lasting use during the entire intervention period, but to varying extent. CONCLUSION: Our environmental and educational, school-based intervention proved to be effective in the prevention of overweight among children in elementary school, even in a population from socially deprived areas.

An APTS group of an oligosaccharide derivative has triply negative charges, which forced saccharide derivatives to anode with fast mobility and pass through the enzyme plug, which are detected at the anodic end. If the terminal monosaccharides of APTS-labeled oligosaccharides are released by the action of an exoglycosidase, the migration times of the oligosaccharides shift to those of digested oligosaccharides. We examined β-galactosidase, α-mannosidase, β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, α-neuraminidase, and α-fucosidase, and found only β-galactosidase and α-neuraminidase showed good reactivity toward APTS-labeled oligosaccharides; the reaction was completed by injecting a 3.6cm long plug of 200 and 50mU/mL concentration of exoglycosidases. In contrast, other exoglycosidases could not react with APTS labeled oligosaccharides at a concentration up to 5U/mL. The β-N-acetylhexosaminidase reaction was successively followed by the electrophoretic mobility of APTS oligosaccharides and stopped for 10min when saccharide derivatives were achieved in the enzyme plug. The reaction of α-fucosidase and α-mannosidase was completed by decreasing the electrophoretic voltage to −2kV when the APTS oligosaccharides were passing through an exoglycosidase plug. We established the CE conditions for all of the glycosidic linkage analysis of glycoprotein glycans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-L-fucosidase 3aalpha-mannosidase 3aanodes 3abeta-N-acetylhexosaminidase 3abeta-galactosidase 3acapillary electrophoresis 3achromatography 3aglycoproteins 3aglycosidic linkages 3aoligosaccharides 3apolysaccharides 0aPlug-plug kinetic capillary electrophoresis 0aExoglycosidase digestion 0aProfiling of glycans 0aGlycoprotein-derived oligosaccharides1 aMatsui, Yurie1 aHayakawa, Takao1 aYamamoto, Sachio1 aKinoshita, Mitsuhiro1 aSuzuki, Shigeo0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017 May 05, v. 1496 p.157-162dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2017.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245008300173520106800256592002801324650002401352650002401376650001201400650001601412650001101428650002501439650002101464650001101485650001601496650002501512653003001537653001101567653001801578653001501596653001501611700002301626700002301649700002501672773012401697856005001821852000901871655001201880IND60795635620221118085750.0221004e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079563562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biteb.2022.1012312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCallahan, Jennie L.10aBioWin® modeling of anaerobic sludge blanket treatment of domestic wastewater  aAnaerobic bioreactors treating wastewater have lower operating costs and waste sludge generation and produce more energy-rich methane than traditional aerobic systems. The ability to simulate performance of anaerobic mainstream treatment allows for comparison to the existing aerobic treatment paradigm. Required modifications were determined for a computer simulation tool, BioWin, to predict wastewater treatment performance of a multi-compartment anaerobic baffled reactor system. The model was calibrated using one month of data and validated using two years of data pooled into three temperature regimes. The validation results were within 10 % of actual, measured values recorded from a multi-year study of a pilot-scale anaerobic bioreactor treating domestic wastewater. Sensitivity analysis showed the simulation was most sensitive to changes to the influent wastewater characteristics and acetogen and methanogen kinetic parameters. Thus, using BioWin, anaerobic domestic wastewater treatment can be integrated into wastewater facility design scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digesters 3acomputer simulation 3amethane 3amethanogens 3amodels 3amunicipal wastewater 3asewage treatment 3asludge 3atemperature 3awastewater treatment 0aAnaerobic Baffled Reactor 0aBioWin 0aPsychrophilic 0aSimulation 0aWastewater1 aPfluger, Andrew R.1 aFigueroa, Linda A.1 aMunakata-Marr, Junko0 tBioresource technology reports.g2022 Dec., v. 20 p.101231-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:26760x2589-014X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biteb.2022.101231  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001700135245012600152300001500278520164000293592002801933650001101961650001301972650001101985650001801996650002002014700002602034773015202060856006902212856009902281990002302380852000902403655001202412IND60644394620221119060344.0190516e20181207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064439462DNAL7 a10.3791/586942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsang, Vicky10aComparing eye-tracking data of children with high-functioning asd, comorbid adhd, and of a control watching social videos  ap. e58694.  aChildren with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are known to have sensory-perceptual processing deficits that weaken their abilities to attend and perceive social stimuli in daily living contexts. Since daily social episodes consist of subtle dynamic changes in social information, any failure to attend to or process subtle human nonverbal cues, such as facial expression, postures, and gestures, might lead to inappropriate social interaction. Traditional behavioral rating scales or assessment tools based on static social scenes have limitations in capturing the moment-to-moment changes in social scenarios. An eye-tracking assessment, which can be administered in a video-based mode, is therefore preferred, to augment clinical observation. In this study, using the single-case comparison design, the eye-tracking data of three participants, a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), another with comorbid attention deficit-hyperactive disorder (ADHD), and a neurotypical control, are captured while they view a video of social scenarios. The eye-tracking experiment has helped answer the research question: How does social attention differ between the three participants? By predefining areas of interest (AOIs), their visual attention on relevant or irrelevant social stimuli, how fast each participant attends to the first social stimuli appearing in the videos, for how long each participant continues to attend to those stimuli within the AOIs, and the gaze shifts between multiple social stimuli appearing concurrently in the same social scene are captured, compared, and analyzed in a video-based eye-tracking experiment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautism 3achildren 3ahumans 3arating scales 3asocial behavior1 aChu, Patrick Chun Kau0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Dec. 07, , no. 142 p.e58694-e58694dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/586943Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/58694/comparing-eye-tracking-data-children-with-high-functioning-asd  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245015400174520139500328592002801723650002101751650001301772650001901785650002101804650001101825650002101836650001401857650001801871650001901889650002401908650001401932650001301946650001701959650001301976700002501989700002502014700002502039700003302064700002602097773012702123856008502250852000902335655001202344IND60703367220221116224301.0200721e20200429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070336722DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms80506502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJamaledin, Rezvan 10aRecombinant Filamentous Bacteriophages Encapsulated in Biodegradable Polymeric Microparticles for Stimulation of Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses  aEscherichia coli filamentous bacteriophages (M13, f1, or fd) have attracted tremendous attention from vaccinologists as a promising immunogenic carrier and vaccine delivery vehicle with vast possible applications in the development of vaccines. The use of fd bacteriophage as an antigen delivery system is based on a modification of bacteriophage display technology. In particular, it is designed to express multiple copies of exogenous peptides (or polypeptides) covalently linked to viral capsid proteins. This study for the first time proposes the use of microparticles (MPs) made of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) to encapsulate fd bacteriophage. Bacteriophage–PLGA MPs were synthesized by a water in oil in water (w₁/o/w₂) emulsion technique, and their morphological properties were analyzed by confocal and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Moreover, phage integrity, encapsulation efficiency, and release were investigated. Using recombinant bacteriophages expressing the ovalbumin (OVA) antigenic determinant, we demonstrated the immunogenicity of the encapsulated bacteriophage after being released by MPs. Our results reveal that encapsulated bacteriophages are stable and retain their immunogenic properties. Bacteriophage-encapsulated PLGA microparticles may thus represent an important tool for the development of different bacteriophage-based vaccine platforms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantigens 3abacteriophages 3abiodegradability 3acapsid 3achemical bonding 3aemulsions 3aencapsulation 3aimmunogenicity 3aoil-water interface 3aovalbumin 3apolymers 3apolypeptides 3avaccines1 aSartorius, Rossella 1 aDi Natale, Concetta 1 aVecchione, Raffaele 1 aDe Berardinis, Piergiuseppe 1 aNetti, Paolo  Antonio0 tMicroorganisms.g2020 Apr. 29, v. 8, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms80506503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03402naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245011200169300001600281520227300297592002802570650002302598650001002621650002402631650001502655650002602670650001802696650002802714650002302742650002302765700002302788700001702811700002002828773010402848856007902952852000903031655001203040IND60519469520221118182702.0160429e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051946952DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.125332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMrowicki, Robert J.10aTemporal variability of a single population can determine the vulnerability of communities to perturbations  ap. 887-897.  aMany aspects of global change affect the variability of species population densities, in terms of both the magnitude and pattern of density fluctuations. However, we have limited empirical understanding of the consequences of altered temporal variability of populations, independent of changes in their mean densities, for the structure and stability of natural communities and the responses of ecosystems to additional stressors. We used a field experiment to test the effects of altered temporal variability of a single consumer species on community structure and stability. Specifically, we manipulated the temporal variability of populations of a key grazer species on temperate rocky shores (Littorina littorea), independent of their mean densities, over 12 months and measured the responses of algal communities in terms of multiple measures of structure and stability. Further, we tested whether consumer variability determined the effects of an additional perturbation, elevated sedimentation, on algal communities. The effects of sedimentation on the structure and stability of algal communities were regulated by the temporal variability of consumer populations. In particular, elevated sedimentation led to a decrease in algal evenness, but only when consumer densities were held constant, and resulted in a decrease in the rate of local algal extinctions, but only when consumer temporal variability was increased. Independent of sedimentation, increased temporal variability of consumer populations led to a shift in algal assemblage structure and affected the stability of algal communities in terms of both compositional turnover and resistance to environmental perturbations. Further, these effects varied according to the temporal pattern of consumer density fluctuations. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate that changes in the temporal variability of a single species can modify multiple aspects of both the structure and stability of natural communities and alter their responses to perturbations. However, the effects of consumer variability cannot be predicted without knowledge of the temporal pattern of density fluctuations. These findings have profound implications for our understanding of the effects of multiple disturbances on ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLittorina littorea 3aalgae 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3afield experimentation 3aglobal change 3ainterspecific variation 3apopulation density 3atemporal variation1 aO'Connor, Nessa E.1 aDonohue, Ian1 aThornber, Carol0 tjournal of ecology.g2016 May, v. 104, no. 3 p.887-897dBlackwell Scientific Publ.x0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.125333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03945naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013000167300002000297520221700317592002802534596005902562596006502621650001802686650001802704650001902722650001502741650001202756650001702768650002002785650001202805650001602817650001602833650001502849650001302864650002502877650001602902650000702918650001402925650001202939650001702951650001602968650001302984650001602997650001403013700001503027700001703042700001603059700001203075700001803087700001603105773015503121856008203276852000903358655001203367IND60743453720221121163020.0210707e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074345372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-12868-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jun-Feng10aNitrogen fertilizer management affects remobilization of the immobilized cadmium in soil and its accumulation in crop tissues  ap. 31640-31652.  aImmobilization of soil cadmium (Cd) has been the strategy mostly used in remediation of Cd-contaminated arable soil. However, Cd might be remobilized after the immobilization process through the acid-soluble and complexation effects. Development of agronomic management technologies to prevent soil Cd remobilization after the immobilization process was an important pathway to control the food safety of agricultural products in soils with the immobilized Cd. In this study, the ammonia (NH₄⁺-N) and nitrate (NO₃⁻-N) forms with concentrations of 60, 90, and 150 mg-N kg⁻¹ soil were performed for evaluating their effects on Cd remobilization with planted or unplanted treatments and Cd accumulation in tissues of edible amaranth (Liuye). With an initial soil palygorskite-bound fraction Cd concentration of 0.6 mg kg⁻¹, bioavailable Cd in rhizosphere soils and Cd in crop shoots respectively increased from 11.4 to 20.6 μg kg⁻¹ (dry soil weight) and 6.92 to 14.92 mg kg⁻¹ (dry plant weight) in planted NH₄⁺-N treatments, while significantly lower concentrations of bioavailable Cd in rhizosphere soils and Cd in crop tissues were observed with planted NO₃⁻-N treatments. Compared with that of planted NO₃⁻-N treatments, decreasing pH value (i.e., 7.64 to 7.18) induced by root proton efflux during the absorption of NH₄⁺-N, enhancive organic/amino acid (oxalic acid, lactic acid, L-proline, and so on) secretion from roots, and increasing abundance of bacteria distributed in phyla Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Bacteroidetes with Cd mobilization ability in rhizosphere soils were the main reasons found in this study for the higher Cd remobilization in soils and Cd accumulation in crop under NH₄⁺-N treatments. Moreover, the direct effect of NH₄⁺-N on remobilization of immobilized Cd by upregulating the expression abundances of genes associated with pyruvate metabolism and amino acids metabolism was more significant than that of NO₃⁻-N.

Incubation of malignant HeLa and HepG2 cells overexpressing IDO1 with the associative biosensor resulted in its spontaneous uptake and a fluorescence switch-on response in situ, which can be traced to the displacement of tryptophan from CB[8] upon IDO1-catalyzed oxidation. The results, for the first time, establish a supramolecular sensing concept for the detection of intracellular enzymatic activity in live cells, thus allowing direct cell-based analysis and inhibitor screening compatible with commercial instruments including microplate reader, fluorescent microscopy, and flow cytometry.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acatalytic activity 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3afluorescent dyes 3ahuman cell lines 3amacrocyclic compounds 3aoxidation 3ascreening 3atryptophan1 aWen, Huilin1 aZhao, Sibo1 aWang, Lancheng1 aQiao, Haishi1 aShen, Haowen1 aYu, Ziyi1 aDi, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1907-17361 aXu, Lili1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6899-971X1 aHu, Chi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9720-27620 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Nov. 12, v. 91, no. 23 p.14943-14950dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b033873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01922naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245010100176300001400277520069300291592002800984650002401012650001401036650001301050650003701063650005801100650004101158650002301199653002001222653002101242653002001263653002701283653003101310700002101341773009301362856008401455852000901539655001201548IND60565414120221116141049.0170711e20170505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056541412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2017.03.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwietniewski, Ludomir14aThe use of Ościk’s equation to describe the retention in reversed phase liquid chromatography  ap. 45-50.  aThe Ościk’s equation based on the theory of conformal solutions was used to describe the chromatographic process in RP-HPLC.

In birds, overall body size has also been found to correlate positively with size dimorphism. In this study, we describe variation in morphology and mating system across six populations of the endemic Galáápagos Hawk (Buteo galapagoensis). Galáápagos Hawks exhibit cooperative polyandry, a mating system in which long-term social groups contain a single female and multiple males. Comparisons among islands revealed significant differences in overall body size for both adults and immatures. Populations ranged from completely monogamous to completely polyandrous, with varying mean group sizes. Data did not support our prediction that sexual size dimorphism would increase with the degree of polyandry (number of males per group) or with body size; there was no correlation between mating system and sexual dimorphism. We did find a significant negative relationship between degree of polyandry and body size among islands, opposite of the pattern predicted.Variacióón en Morfologíía y Sistema de Apareamiento entre Poblaciones de Buteo galapagoensisResumen.  Variacióón interespecíífica en dimorfismo sexual ha sido atribuíída comúúnmente a variaciones del sistema social de apareamiento, de tal manera que el dimorfismo aumenta conforme aumenta la competencia intrasexual por parejas reproductivas. Tambiéén se ha encontrado que el tamaño corporal se correlaciona positivamente con el dimorfismo. En este estudio describimos la variacióón morfolóógica y el grado de poliandríía de seis poblaciones de Buteo galapagoensis, una especie que exhibe un sistema de apareamiento denominado poliandríía cooperativa. En este sistema los grupos de individuos reproductivos incluyen una sola hembra y múúltiples machos. Se comprobóó que existen diferencias significativas en el tamaño del cuerpo de adultos y juveniles entre islas. Las poblaciones muestreadas variaron entre monóógamas y completamente poliáándricas, y el tamaño promedio de los grupos fue variable. Los datos no apoyaron las predicciones establecidas inicialmente pues el grado de dimorfismo sexual no aumentóó con el nivel de poliandríía (núúmero de machos por grupo) ni con el tamaño corporal, ni hubo una correlacióón entre el sistema de apareamiento y el dimorfismo sexual. La relacióón entre el tamaño corporal y el sistema de apareamiento fue contraria a la que se predijo: hubo una correlacióón negativa significativa entre el grado de poliandríía y el tamaño corporal entre islas.  aPublisher supplied data 0abody size 0aButeo galapagoensis 0acooperative polyandry 0aGaláápagos Hawk 0aprincipal components analysis 0asexual size dimorphism1 aSanchez, Tania1 aCannon, Michelle Donaghy1 aSanchez, Didier1 aCannon, Brian1 aBednarz, James C.1 aVries, Tjitte de,1 aStruve, M.

They cause harm through feeding on the plant and transferring dangerous pathogens, and the rapid evolution of pesticide resistance in mites highlights the need for novel control methods. Currently, RNA interference (RNAi) shows great potential for insect pest control. Here, we review the literature regarding RNAi in mite pests. We discuss different target genes and RNAi efficiency in various mite species, a promising Varroa control program using RNAi, the synergy of RNAi with plant defense mechanisms and microorganisms, and current understanding of systemic movement of double‐stranded RNA (dsRNA). On the basis of this evidence, we can conclude that there is clear potential for application of RNAi‐based mite control, but further research on several aspects of RNAi in mites is needed, including: (i) the factors influencing RNAi efficiency, (ii) the mechanism of environmental RNAi and cross‐kingdom dsRNA trafficking, (iii) the mechanism of possible systemic and parental RNAi, and (iv) non‐target effects, specifically in predatory mites, which should be considered during RNAi target selection. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0200900cNational Key R&D Program of China  aXDJK2017C070cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  aSWU114049cFoundation Project of Southwest University  aSWU116036cFoundation Project of Southwest University  a2016M600715cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation Grant  cResearch Foundation–Flanders (FWO Vlaanderen) 3aRNA interference 3aVarroa 3acontrol methods 3acrops 3adefense mechanisms 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aevolution 3ainsect pests 3amicroorganisms 3amite control 3apathogens 3apesticide resistance 3apredatory mites1 aShen, Guangmao1 aChristiaens, Olivier1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5850-340X1 aSmagghe, Guy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8334-33131 aHe, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5491-53751 aWang, Jinjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8777-52680 tPest management science.g2018 Dec., v. 74, no. 12 p.2680-2687dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.50713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009300172300002000265520128900285592002801574650003401602650001801636650001501654650002101669650001501690650000701705650001601712650001601728650001601744700005901760700006001819700006101879773013101940856008402071852000902155655001202164IND60677839620221116232022.0191213e20191106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067783962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b034022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiorek, Alexander10aPolyaniline Films as Electrochemical-Proton Pump for Acidification of Thin Layer Samples  ap. 14951-14959.  aHere, we provide the first experimental evidence of proton release from polyaniline (PANI) films subjected to anodic potentials at environmental pHs. We conducted an extensive characterization of unpolarized/polarized PANI films—synthesized by traditional sequential voltammetric scanning—by using spectroelectrochemistry, synchrotron radiation-X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, near edge X-ray absorption fine structure, and potentiometric pH sensing in the vicinity of the PANI layer. This new insight enables the utilization of PANI as a proton pump, which is actively tuned through an electrochemical pulse, so as to controllably acidify well-confined thin layer samples. Furthermore, we demonstrate the analytical significance of this system by measuring the alkalinity of artificial and natural water samples by using two faced planar PANI electrodes, one working as a proton source and the other one as pH electrode. Finally, the impact of this approach is 2-fold: (i) all-solid-state electrode materials may be used with devisible consequences in miniaturized and implementable submersible probes, and (ii) rapid determination of alkalinity as compared to traditional approaches together with a versatility in pH adjustment in any kind of sample, among other applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aacidification 3aalkalinity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3apH 3apolyaniline 3aproton pump 3avoltammetry1 aCuartero, Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3858-84661 aDe Marco, Roland1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1357-37271 aCrespo, Gaston A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1221-39060 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Nov. 06, v. 91, no. 23 p.14951-14959dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b034023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012200169500001900291520155000310592002801860650000801888650001201896650001001908650001001918650002701928650002301955650002201978650001902000650002402019650001302043650001602056650001302072651000902085653001002094653001102104653001102115653001702126653001202143700003302155773011502188856008302303852000902386655001202395IND60729120620221119063830.0210428e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072912062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2021.1017052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOcaña, Frank A.10aUsing indirect methods to estimate population parameters of the Atlantic ghost crab from beaches in Northeastern Cuba  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSandy beaches are dynamic systems that harbor diverse macrofauna species, such as the ghost crab Ocypode quadrata, which has a wide distribution and it is considered useful in ecological evaluations. Population parameters of O. quadrata based on indirect methods were assessed at four tourist sandy beaches at northeastern Cuba from September 2010 to August 2011. Monthly samplings were carried out early in the morning. At each beach, five cross-shore transects were set at 50–60 m intervals, and consecutively 2x2 m quadrats were set from the upper swash level to the landward edge. Active burrows were counted and measured to the nearest millimeter using a caliper. Burrow density showed differences among beaches and a negative relation to the number of visitors. Burrow size showed differences among beaches as well as a positive relation to temperature, and non-significant relations to salinity and number of visitors. Burrow size frequency distribution showed a unimodal pattern skewed toward smaller sizes at the four beaches. Growth rates ranged from 0.57–1.4 year−1 and the growth performance was high (Φ′>3) at the four beaches. Growth performance was compared with other ocypodid populations (Uca spp., O. quadrata and Ucides spp.) inhabiting tropical coastal ecosystems using an auximetric plot. All ocypodid populations clustered forming one single ellipsoid in the auximetric plot supporting the use of borrows count and size as a reliable, non-invasive method to estimate population dynamics of this indicator species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUca 3aburrows 3acrabs 3afauna 3afrequency distribution 3agrowth performance 3aindicator species 3amarine science 3apopulation dynamics 3asalinity 3atemperature 3atourists 3aCuba 0aBeach 0aBurrow 0aGrowth 0aInvertebrate 0aOcypode1 ade Jesús-Navarrete, Alberto0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2021 Mar., v. 43 p.101705-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2021.1017053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245013300211300002000344520156100364592002801925650002501953650001201978650001201990650002502002650002202027650001202049650001002061650001002071650002202081650001202103650001402115650001302129650001302142650001302155650002002168650001102188650002302199650001102222650001502233651001802248700001802266700001802284700002402302700002302326700002602349700002202375700002802397773015502425856008202580852000902662655001202671IND60743453920221120053557.0210707e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074345392DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-12890-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCáceres-Saez, Iris1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6454-149610aTrace elements in subantarctic false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens) tissues, including the skin as an offshore bioindicator  ap. 31746-31757.  aOn a global scale, cetaceans are recognized well indicators of marine ecosystem health. Trace elements accumulate in their bodies and potentially constitute a toxicological threat. Here, the concentrations of essential Se; unknown physiological elements Br, Rb, Cs, Ni, and Sr; and pollutants arsenic, Cd, Hg, and Ag were assessed in the skin of false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) stranded at Estrecho de Magallanes, South America, and next, tissue comparisons and relationships between elemental concentrations in the skin and internal tissues (liver, kidney, spleen, lung, skeletal muscle, and testis) were assessed. Results showed elemental concentration variations among tissues. Selenium concentration was found to be higher in the liver 398 (75) μg g⁻¹ dry weight (DW) (standard deviation in parenthesis), followed by skin. Rubidium and Br concentrations were higher in testis 7.92 (0.42) and 99.1 (5.4) μg g⁻¹ DW, respectively, and Cs in muscle 0.36 (0.12) μg g⁻¹ DW, while Ni concentrations range (<0.05–0.91 μg g⁻¹ DW) did not show differences among tissues. Cadmium and arsenic were found to be higher in kidneys, 71.2 (17.6) and 2.54 (1.77) μg g⁻¹ DW, respectively, while Hg was highest in the liver 1068 (234) μg g⁻¹ DW. Concerning inter-tissue relationships, a positive skin-to-kidney and skin-to-muscle correlations were observed for Cs concentrations, and also Hg showed positive skin-to-spleen, skin-to-kidney, and skin-to-testis correlations, which support its use as potential offshore marine biomonitor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudorca crassidens 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3aenvironmental health 3aindicator species 3akidneys 3aliver 3alungs 3amarine ecosystems 3amuscles 3apollution 3aresearch 3arubidium 3aselenium 3askeletal muscle 3aspleen 3astandard deviation 3atestes 3atoxicology 3aSouth America1 aHaro, Daniela1 aBlank, Olivia1 aAguayo-Lobo, Anelio1 aDougnac, Catherine1 aArredondo, Cristóbal1 aCappozzo, H.

Cheese trials were carried out in triplicate under identical conditions and compared with a control without an added enzyme preparation. All enzyme preparations were incorporated according to manufacturers' guidelines. The flavour of the Cheddar cheese was accelerated by the inclusion of each enzyme preparation, evident by more complex volatile profiles and the development of sensory attributes associated with aged Cheddar. Compositional parameters were not adversely impacted. Instrumental and descriptive textural analyses indicated some adverse rheological effects in cheeses produced by both Accelase blends, attributed to excessive primary proteolysis, and higher levels of moisture. The study has highlighted the potential of commercial accelerating ripening systems, but also identified that compositional and proteolytic indices need to be optimised to maximise their potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCheddar cheese 3aaccelerated ripening 3aadverse effects 3acheese ripening 3aenzymes 3aflavor 3aguidelines 3aproteolysis1 aNongonierma, A.B.1 aHannon, J.A.1 aDoolan, I.A.1 aWilkinson, M.G.0 tInternational dairy journal.g2012 Sept., v. 26, no. 1 p.50-57dElsevier Ltdx0958-69467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.03.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245010900167300001400276520153500290592002801825650001501853650002701868650002401895650001501919650001301934650001101947650001101958650002101969650001901990653002402009653001302033653001702046653003202063653001502095653001902110700002602129700003802155700001802193700002402211700002702235773010402262856007802366852000902444655001202453IND60556201320221122122832.0161031e20161008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055620132DNAL7 a10.1515/hepo-2016-00172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGłogowski, Adrian10aMorphological and pharmacokinetic properties of oral solid dietary supplements containing plant extracts  ap. 49-62.  aIntroduction: Dietary supplements are a good way to supplement the deficiency of certain micronutrients and organic components (therapeutic agents) in human body. They are most often available in concentrated form as tablets, capsules, powder or liquid.Objective: To investigate morphological parameters and the pharmaceutical availability of coated tablets – dietary supplements – that contain selected pharmacopeial titrated dry plant extracts.Methods: Testing of the effective time of the tablet surface erosion was performed in model acceptor fluids using pharmacopeial methods in static (Erweka apparatus) and dynamic (unlimited diffusion method) conditions. Furthermore, morphological parameters of tablets (the original shape of an ellipse) as well as their hardness were determined.Results: The effective erosion time was determined by conductometric method using carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt (NaCMC) contained in the tablet. The content of gum arabic and NaCMC in the tablet testifies that the granulate was produced using the “wet granulation” technique which resulted in high hardness of original, esthetic, elliptical tablets and in prolonged disintegration time (erosion).Conclusions: The used excipients: gum arabic and NaCMC for the production of the tested tablets containing selected dry plant extracts result in their high hardness. The tested dietary supplements are characterized by esthetic design, original shape, and prolonged disintegration time which affects the pharmaceutical availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3adietary supplements 3agum arabic 3ahardness 3ahumans 3amodels 3apharmacokinetics 3aplant extracts 0adietary supplements 0aextracts 0aerosion rate 0apharmaceutical availability 0aflavonoids 0acoated tablets1 aMarczyński, Zbigniew1 aKołodziejczyk, Michał Krzysztof1 aJambor, Jerzy1 aStefan, Marta Kinga1 aZgoda, Marian Mikołaj0 tHerba Polonica.g2016 Oct. 8, v. 62, no. 3 p.49-62dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:17307x0018-05997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hepo-2016-00173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04034naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245007800173300001800251500001500269520193200284592002802216650001102244650001402255650001502269650001702284650002602301650001802327650001402345650001302359650000902372650001102381650001302392650002202405650002202427650002302449650002102472650003902493650001402532650004702546650002302593650002902616650001902645650002302664650004102687650003802728650003902766650001502805651001002820651001802830651001002848651001302858653001802871653001602889653004202905653003602947653002502983653002103008653001403029700001703043700001803060700001703078773013303095852000903228856007503237655001203312IND4474203420221122062611.0160905e20131002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447420342DNAL7 a240162622pmid7 a10.1021/jf402576a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBi, Xiaolong10aPlasticizer Contamination in Edible Vegetable Oil in a U.S. Retail Market  ap. 9502-9509.  a2019-12-05  aWith the wide application of plastics, the contamination of plasticizers migrating from plastic materials in the environment is becoming ubiquitous. The presence of phthalates, the major group of plasticizers, in edible items has gained increasingly more concern due to their endocrine disrupting property. In this study, 15 plasticizers in 21 edible vegetable oils purchased from a U.S. retail market were analyzed using gas chromatograph–mass spectrometry. Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP) were detected in all oil samples. Benzylbutyl phthalate (BzBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and diethyl phthalate (DEP) were detected at a rate of 95.2, 90.5, and 90.5%, respectively. The detection rates for all other plasticizers ranged from 0 to 57.1%. The content of total plasticizers in oil samples was determined to be 210–7558 μg/kg, which was comparable to the content range in oil marketed in Italy. Although no significant difference (p = 0.05) in the total content of plasticizer was observed among oil species (soybean, canola, corn, and olive), the wider range and higher average of total content of plasticizers in olive oil than other oil species indicated the inconsistence of plasticizer contamination in olive oil and a possible priority for quality monitoring. No significant difference (p = 0.05) in the total content of plasticizers was found among glass-bottle (n = 4), plastic-bottle (n = 14), and metal-can (n = 3) packaging, implying that oil packaging is not the major cause of plasticizer contamination. The daily intake amount of plasticizers contained in edible oil on this U.S. retail market constituted only a minimum percentage of reference dose established by US EPA, thus no obvious toxicological effect might be caused. However, the fact that DEHP content in two olive oils exceeded relevant special migration limits (SMLs) of Europe and China might need attention.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanola 3apackaging 3amonitoring 3aplasticizers 3acooking fats and oils 3avegetable oil 3aolive oil 3asoybeans 3acorn 3aolives 3aplastics 3adibutyl phthalate 3amass spectrometry 3agas chromatography 3aretail marketing 2aDietary Fatsxanalysisxeconomics. 2aDiffusion 2aEndocrine Disruptorsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aFood Contamination 2aFood Inspectionxmethods 2aFood Packaging 2aLimit of Detection 2aPhthalic Acidsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aPlant Oilsxchemistryxeconomics. 2aPlasticizersxanalysisxchemistry. 2aSolubility 3aItaly 3aUnited States 3aChina 0aDelaware 0acontamination 0aplasticizer 0agas chromatograph−mass spectrometry 0aEnvironmental Protection Agency 0aedible vegetable oil 0aUS retail market 0aphthalate1 aPan, Xiaojun1 aYuan, Shoujun1 aWang, Qiquan0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2013 Oct. 02, v. 61, no. 39 p.9502-9509dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf402576a3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02982naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009200176300001400268520152100282592002801803650004401831650002201875650002101897650002501918650002301943650002501966650001101991650001802002650001502020650001702035650003302052650003302085650002102118650002002139650002102159650001702180650001602197653001102213653002102224653001302245653000902258700002202267773011602289856008602405852000902491655001202500IND60638032920221116212319.0190523e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063803292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.03.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPonomarev, Nikolaĭ,10aCombined chemical-templated activation of hydrolytic lignin for producing porous carbon  ap. 30-38.  aChemical activation and template method using lignin have been considered efficient for producing microporous activated carbon. However, the limited accessibility of micropores and significant chemical consumption hinder the application of aforementioned methods. In order to save attractive properties of both activation routes and to overcome environmental impact, novel combined chemical-templated activation was investigated. A mixture of NaOH and NaCl was employed to produce carbon, which possessed high surface area and versatile porous structure. The process was optimised and described by mathematical models using the response surface method (RSM). The BET surface area and yield were selected as output performances (responses), whilst temperature, time and chemical ratio were chosen as variable inputs (factors). Macropore sizes were of the same NaCl crystal size confirmed by XRD and SEM indicating a template mechanism. Micropore origin was suggested by chemical reactions between NaOH and carbon with a formation of Na2CO3 confirmed by XRD standard patterns and corresponding FTIR peaks. According to RSM design, the most significant factor is chemical ratio for both responses. The experimental data of the BET surface area is in a good validity of the quadratic model, while yield matched the linear model well according to the ANOVA test. In this study, porous carbon was produced by new method overcoming the major challenges of templated and chemical activation and brings added value of lignin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivated carbon 3aanalysis of variance 3achemical reactions 3aenvironmental impact 3alignin 3alinear models 3amicropores 3aporous media 3aresponse surface methodology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium carbonate 3asodium chloride 3asodium hydroxide 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aLignin 0aActivated carbon 0aTemplate 0aNaCl1 aSillanpää, Mika0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 135 p.30-38dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.03.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02715naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245012600165520159100291592002801882650001701910650001501927650001101942650001501953650000901968650001601977650001601993650000902009653002502018653001002043653003602053653002002089700001702109700001402126773010502140856008702245852000902332655001202341IND60684135620221118053556.0200405e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068413562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2020.1049122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yali10aImproving forecasts of a record-breaking rainstorm in Guangzhou by assimilating every 10-min AHI radiances with WRF 4DVAR  aOn 6 May 2017, a record-breaking warm-sector torrential rainfall (WSTR) event initiated over Guangzhou city around 1600 UTC and lasted for 20 h. To replicate this rainfall event, both three-dimensional and four-dimensional variational (3DVAR/4DVAR) data assimilation (DA) strategies were used to initialize a convection-allowing configuration of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in an attempt to evaluate precipitation forecasts with or without the assimilation of Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) radiances from three water vapor (WV) channels. This case study yielded impressions that both the 4DVAR experiments with and without the assimilation of AHI radiances prominently improved convection initiation (CI) forecasts, and replicated the observations accurately in predicting hourly area precipitation totals. Due to the small spatial scale of this event, the impacts of assimilating every 10-min AHI radiances on the convection evolution and hourly precipitation forecasts were subjectively small to be seen, but the equitable threat score (ETS) and fractions skill score (FSS) did show slight improvement for both hourly and 20-h accumulated precipitation. For example, the 4DVAR technique combined with AHI radiances improved the FSS of 20-h accumulated precipitation forecasts by 2%–4.5%, 1%–3%, 6%–20%, and 8%–24% for 5 mm, 20 mm, 50 mm, and 80 mm thresholds, respectively, over those with only conventional observations assimilated. Reasons for these improvements were attributed to better analyses and forecasts of temperature, moisture, and wind.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aconvection 3amodels 3aprediction 3arain 3atemperature 3awater vapor 3awind 0a10-min AHI radiances 0a4DVAR 0aWarm-sector torrential rainfall 0aRecord-breaking1 aLiu, Zhiquan1 aLi, Deqin0 tAtmospheric research.g2020 July 15, v. 239 p.104912-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2020.1049123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01491naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245007800157300001600235500002000251520061000271592002800881650002000909650002700929650002400956650001100980773014200991856007101133852000901204655001201213IND60680409420221119135043.0200105e199805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068040942DNAL7 a10.2307/12445062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShampine, Allan10aCompensating for Information Externalities in Technology Diffusion Models  ap. 337-346.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe role of information in the adoption of new technologies is discussed, focusing on the role of information externalities when nonadopters observe adopters in order to gather information.

Preliminary analysis showed the presence of significant amounts of nine emerging pollutants (order of magnitude of ng/l): trimethoprim, ofloxacin, enrofloxacin, clarithromycin, acetaminophen, diclofenac, caffeine, thiabendazole and carbamazepine; and trace amounts of another two were detected, namely acetamiprid and erythromycin. Irradiation of the effluent in the presence of TiO₂ resulted in a significant removal of all the emerging pollutants, as most of them were detected only at trace amounts after the treatment. In addition to this, percentages of faecal bacteria elimination were close to 100%. Finally, experiments carried out using caffeine as model compound showed that a mild photo-Fenton process might be employed at neutral media in the presence of humic acids, although the performance was worse than photo-Fenton at acidic pH or TiO₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3aacetamiprid 3abacteria 3acaffeine 3acatalytic activity 3aclarithromycin 3aeffluents 3aenrofloxacin 3ahumic acids 3airradiation 3aofloxacin 3apH 3athiabendazole 3atrimethoprim 3awastewater treatment 3aSpain1 aVercher, R.F.1 aSantos-Juanes, L.1 aSimón, P.J.1 aLardín, C.1 aMartínez, M.A.1 aVicente, J.A.1 aGonzález, R.1 aLlosá, C.1 aArques, A.1 aAmat, A.M.0 tCatalysis today.g2011 Mar. 17, v. 161, no. 1 p.235-240dElsevier B.V.x0920-58617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cattod.2010.09.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011300166300001800279520118900297592002801486596009601514596011301610596004101723596007901764596007901843596007501922596007501997650002302072650001202095650002602107650001002133650002102143650001102164650001202175650001302187650001402200650001702214650002002231650000902251650001402260700001602274700001802290700001802308700001602326700001702342700001702359700005702376773012502433856008302558852000902641655001202650IND60784283720221120115843.0220726e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078428372DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-021-10450-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Dongqing12aA 2-Mb Chromosome Inversion Interrupted Transcription of LAX2-4 and Generated Pleiotropic Phenotypes in Rice  ap. 2328-2337.  aThe number of grains per panicle is one of the most important factors of rice yield and determinated by branch and spikelet number. Genetic and molecular mechanisms responsible for panicle branching and spikelet development remain unclear in rice. Here, we report a mutant lax2-4 mainly showing lax panicle, longer grains, a little abnormal spikelet, lower setting rate and abaxial curled leaf. Genetic analysis indicated that the defective panicle phenotype of lax2-4 was controlled by single recessive gene. Further mapping and re-sequencing revealed that the fourth exon of LAX2 was lost caused by an approximately 2-Mb INV in lax2-4, thus LAX2-4 could be a new allele of LAX2. Overexpression assays showed that lax panicle was rescued in correspondence with the gradually increased expression level of wild-type LAX2-4 transcript. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of the fourth exon verified that LAX2-4 participates the regulation of sterile lemma and lemma development in rice. LAX2-4 could interact with an E-class gene, OsMADS1, and the fourth exon was necessary for its function. Collectively, we proposed that LAX2-4 plays a dual role in lateral spikelet and lemma development.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo.CPSIBRF-CNRRI-202105cCentral Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund  aCAAS-ASTIP-2016-CNRRIcScience and Technology Innovation Project of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences  a2014AA10A604-15cChinese 863 Program  a31501288cNational Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China  a31701398cNational Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China  a20190110cOpen Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology  a20200104cOpen Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aalleles 3achromosome inversions 3aexons 3agenetic analysis 3aleaves 3amutants 3apanicles 3aphenotype 3aplant growth 3arecessive genes 3arice 3aspikelets1 aChen, Junyu1 aDu, Chengxing1 aLiang, Minmin1 aWu, Mingyue1 aMou, Tongmin1 aZhang, Huali1 aMa, Liangyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9322-00740 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2022 Aug., v. 41, no. 6 p.2328-2337dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-021-10450-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245010500163520176800268592002802036650001702064650001102081650002002092650001302112650002202125650002102147650001702168650001302185650001002198651001002208653001102218653001802229653002302247700001702270700001502287700001802302700001602320700001402336700001702350700002002367773010402387856008502491852000902576655001202585IND60744470420221121031509.0210806e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074447042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sedgeo.2021.1059632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Wei10aNitrogen isotopes as paleoenvironmental proxies in marginal-marine shales, Bohai Bay Basin, NE China  aNitrogen isotopes have been widely used as indicators of depositional conditions in studies of ancient sediments. Bohai Bay Basin is a major continental hydrocarbon province in NE China, but nitrogen isotopic signatures of this lacustrine system (connected with the open ocean occasionally) have barely been investigated. We report a study of paleoenvironmental information recorded by N isotopic variations in the lower third member (Es3L) and upper fourth member (Es4U) of the Eocene Shahejie Formation in the Jiyang Sub-basin, southern Bohai Bay Basin. Paleosalinity (B/Ga, Sr/Ba, and S/TOC) and paleoredox (Cₒᵣg/P, DOP, UEF, and Fe/Al) proxies and δ¹³Cₒᵣg values were used to elucidate paleoenvironmental factors that affect N isotopic signals in the study core. Results indicate that δ¹⁵N values are positively correlated with paleosalinity proxies in the Luo-69 and Niu-1 drill-cores. Two possibilities may account for this: (1) a paleosalinity surge caused by marine transgression events led to stratification of the water column, creating an anoxic–suboxic deep-water layer and promoting denitrification in sediments; or (2) strong stratification of the water column impeded the upwelling process that brought nutrients to the upper water layer, weakening nitrogen fixation there. In marginal-marine intervals such as the Eocene Shahejie Formation, water-column salinity may play a critical role in regulating the δ¹⁵N signal. This study indicates that nitrogen isotopic compositions may aid paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic interpretations of marginal-marine shale, particularly when applied together with multiple paleoenvironmental proxies to improve the understanding of ancient sedimentary conditions in marginal-environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEocene epoch 3abasins 3adenitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3asalinity 3ashale 3aChina 0aEocene 0aPaleosalinity 0aShahejie Formation1 aLu, Yongchao1 aMa, Yiquan1 aZhang, Jingyu1 aSong, Huyue1 aChen, Lin1 aLiu, Huiming1 aZhang, Shoupeng0 tSedimentary geology.g2021 July 15, v. 421 p.105963-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11737x0037-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2021.1059633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01622naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024002200123024001900145040001800164100001800182245007600200300001800276506007600294520026900370592002800639506003700667650002500704650001900729650000900748650001100757650002500768650001400793650001400807651001000821700001800831700001500849700001800864700001400882700001600896700001900912700001300931700001400944773012200958856007501080852000901155655001201164IND60118353120221207115127.0141126e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011835312DNAL7 a10.1128/JB.01759-122doi7 aPMC34975162pmcid7 a231443962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yucong10aDraft Genome Sequence of the Fish Pathogen Vibrio harveyi Strain ZJ0603  ap. 6644-6645.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVibrio harveyi is an important pathogen that causes vibriosis in various aquatic organisms.

Under drought stress, melatonin and the signaling calcium (Ca²⁺) are involved in plant defense and stress responses by controlling phytohormone and antioxidant machineries. Exogenous melatonin (MT) promotes drought stress tolerance in plants. As an essential second messenger, the signaling molecule Ca²⁺ is necessary in the stress tolerance of plants and might increase stress tolerance induced by exogenous melatonin. The present study elucidated the effects of Ca²⁺-MT on Dalbergia odorifera seedlings under drought stress. Results showed increases in growth traits and photosynthesis indexes (pigments, net photosynthetic rate, water use efficiency, stomatal conductance, and transpiration) by MT and Ca²⁺ under non stress and stress conditions. Under drought stress, the water status in leaves was slightly ameliorated by MT and Ca²⁺ treatments, whereas the Ca²⁺-MT combination strongly improved water status. Comparison between combined Ca²⁺-MT and single Ca²⁺/MT treatments showed that superoxide anion was significantly lower in Ca²⁺-MT-treated seedlings. Lipid peroxidation was lower in Ca²⁺-MT-treated seedlings under drought stress. Further, relative conductivity was significantly decreased by Ca²⁺ and MT treatments under stress compared with seedlings untreated with Ca²⁺ or MT under drought. The accumulation of proline decreased by Ca²⁺ and MT under stress, but the carbohydrates and protein contents were increased by exogenous MT and Ca²⁺. Under drought, antioxidant systems (peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities, and glutathione [GSH] and ascorbic acid [ASA] levels) were significantly increased by the Ca²⁺ and MT treatments. The combined treatment showed better performance in increasing GSH and ASA levels than single MT or Ca²⁺ treatment. The gibberellin GA₃ and cytokine ZR increased significantly under non stress and stress conditions, but exogenous Ca²⁺ or MT did not increase their activities compared with those in the control groups. Exogenous Ca²⁺ and Ca²⁺-MT enhanced indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content in D. odorifera leaves under stress compared with the control. Moreover, abscisic acid (ABA) level is downregulated by MT and Ca²⁺-MT treatments compared with the control. The seedlings treated with Ca²⁺ only showed increase in ABA concentration under drought stress. This study provides an insight into a possible coordination between Ca²⁺ and melatonin and into drought tolerance in woody plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a320RC507 and 317052cHainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China  aNo. 32060240cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  akyqd1573cScientific Research Starting Foundation of Hainan University 3aDalbergia odorifera 3aabscisic acid 3aascorbic acid 3acalcium 3acatalase 3acytokines 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aglutathione 3aindole acetic acid 3alipid peroxidation 3amelatonin 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3aproline 3asecond messengers 3astomatal conductance 3astress tolerance 3asuperoxide anion 3asuperoxide dismutase 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency1 aZhang, Li-Jia1 aPu, Yu-Jin1 aMiao, Ling-Feng1 aLi, Da-Dong1 aZhang, Juan1 aYang, Fan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0049-54590 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2022 Aug., v. 41, no. 6 p.2359-2374dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-021-10449-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03597naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011200169300001600281520227300297592002802570650000802598650001302606650002202619650000902641650001802650650002402668650001702692650001702709650001802726650001602744653003402760653000902794653001202803653002602815653001102841700001502852700001602867700002502883700001202908700001102920773011202931856008703043852000903130655001203139IND60582046120221116141307.0180830e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058204612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Chaobin10aComparison of compressed air energy storage process in aquifers and caverns based on the Huntorf CAES plant  ap. 342-356.  aCAESA (compressed air energy storage in aquifers) attracts more and more attention as the increase need of large scale energy storage. The compassion of CAESA and CAESC (compressed air energy storage in caverns) can help on understanding the performance of CAESA, since there is no on running CAESA project. In order to investigate the detail thermodynamic process, integrated wellbore-reservoir (cavern or aquifer) simulations of CAES (compressed air energy storage) are carried out based on parameters of the Huntorf CAES plant. Reasonable matches between monitored data and simulated results are obtained for the Huntorf cavern systems in the wellbore and cavern regions. In this study, the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic behaviors of CAES in cavern and aquifer systems are investigated, such as pressure and temperature distribution and variation in both the wellbore and cavern regions of the CAES systems. Performances of CAESA are investigated with numerical models and compared with the performances of CAESC. The comparisons of CAESC and CAESA indicate that the pressure variation in CAESA shows a wider variation range than that in CAESC, while the temperature shows a smooth variation due to the large grain specific heat of the grains in the porous media. The simulation results confirm that the CAES can be achieved in aquifers, and further that the performance of energy storage in aquifers can be similar to or better than CAESC, if the aquifers have appropriate reservoir properties, which means the gas bubble can be well developed in an aquifer with such properties and the aquifer should have closed or semi-closed boundaries. The impacts of gas-bubble volume, formation permeability, and aquifer boundary permeability on storage efficiency are investigated and the simulation results indicate that the increase of gas bubble volume and permeability can improve the efficiency, but the effect is not significant. The gas bubble boundary permeability has a small effect on the energy efficiency of the sustainable daily cycle but can significantly affect total sustainable cycle times. The analysis of thermodynamic behaviors in CAESA suggests that more attention should be paid to the heat storage, reservoir properties and two-phase flow processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aaquifers 3aenergy efficiency 3aheat 3ahydrodynamics 3amathematical models 3apermeability 3aporous media 3aspecific heat 3atemperature 0aCompressed air energy storage 0aCAES 0aAquifer 0aThermodynamic process 0aCavern1 aPan, Lehua1 aZhang, Keni1 aOldenburg, Curtis M.1 aLi, Cai1 aLi, Yi0 tApplied energy.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 181 p.342-356dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03742naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006500151245013600216300001400352520188500366592002802251650002802279650003002307650002402337650001002361650002302371650002302394650002302417650001402440650001802454650002202472650002602494650001302520650001202533650002102545650001902566650001602585650001002601650001202611650000902623653001002632653001502642653001502657653001302672653001902685653001702704700006502721700006502786700006402851700001902915700001902934773011602953856008603069852000903155655001203164IND60638033220221116212011.0190523e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063803322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.04.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStolarski, Mariusz J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0712-967810aEnergy efficiency indices for lignocellulosic biomass production: Short rotation coppices versus grasses and other herbaceous crops  ap. 10-20.  aPlantations of perennial industrial crops (PIC) could be important sources of lignocellulosic biomass. These crops can be classified into three groups: short rotation coppice (SRC) – wood, herbaceous crops (semi–wood) and grasses (straw). Comparing various PIC genotypes directly under similar environmental conditions over many successive harvest rotations is necessary to accurately determine the yielding potential and energy efficiency of lignocellulose biomass production. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the energy input, energy yield value and the energy efficiency indices of biomass production for 26 PIC genotypes (fifteen SRC, six herbaceous crops and five grasses) harvested in six successive annual rotations.The significantly highest energy yield value throughout the experiment (2012–2017) was obtained from the Ekotur willow variety (1857 GJ ha–1). Among the 26 PIC, the top ten for energy yield value and energy gain in the six successive rotations included five SRC willow (Salix spp.) genotypes: (Ekotur, Start, Żubr, Turbo, UWM 095), three grass genotypes: Miscanthus sacchariflorus ((Maxim.) Hack.), M. sinensis ((Thunb.) Andersson), Spartina pectinata Bosc ex Link and two herbaceous crops: Sida hermaphrodita Rusby L., Helianthus salicifolius A. Dietr. The significantly highest energy ratio (22.3) was obtained for the production of M. sacchariflorus. The next three places were occupied by willows, Ekotur, Żubr and Start and the index for them was 8–10% lower than for M. sacchariflorus. This research should be continued for the entire lifetime of a plantation, which is set up for at least 15 years even though some SRC may be exploited for more than 20 years. Therefore, it is important to assess individual PIC genotypes in later years of their cultivation in terms of their productivity and energy efficiency indices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus salicifolius 3aMiscanthus sacchariflorus 3aMiscanthus sinensis 3aSalix 3aSida hermaphrodita 3aSpartina pectinata 3abiomass production 3acoppicing 3acrop rotation 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental factors 3agenotype 3agrasses 3aindustrial crops 3alignocellulose 3aplantations 3astraw 3awillows 3awood 0aSalix 0aMiscanthus 0aHelinathus 0aSilphium 0aEnergy balance 0aEnergy ratio1 aKrzyżaniak, Michał,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8195-51801 aWarmiński, Kazimierz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1674-23191 aOlba-Zięty, Ewelina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1236-07191 aPenni, Dumitru1 aBordiean, Anna0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 135 p.10-20dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.04.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100006400141245006100205300001400266520118500280592002801465650001301493650001901506650001201525650002201537650002501559650001501584650001201599651001801611653001901629653001501648653001601663700002101679700001901700700002001719700002201739700002901761700002101790700002301811700001801834700002001852773014901872856007602021852000902097655001202106IND60672583020221118233833.0191016e20190309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067258302DNAL7 a10.1093/aesa/say0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElsensohn, Johanna E1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1013-251X10aFrom Research to Policy: Scientists Speaking for Science  ap. 75-78.  aMuch of the scientific research in the United States is conducted in the public interest and funded through tax dollars, with exact funding allocations controlled through a variety of high-level processes, including through legislation. Scientists can provide expert opinions to government officials and their staff in this and other processes of establishing and enforcing governmental legislation, policies, and regulations, although such expertise is often underutilized. This is partly due to the paucity of scientists who have training to engage policymakers. To address this deficit, many scientific societies now provide organized training in science policy, including how to seek out opportunities to engage with policymakers. One such example is the Entomological Society of America’s Science Policy Fellowship (ESA SPF) program. This article is written by ESA SPF members and discusses the importance of interfacing with policymakers, some challenges this group encountered, and lessons learned through our experiences in the program. Through efforts like this, we hope to inspire other scientists to engage their societies in advocacy work and make their voice heard.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvocacy 3aexpert opinion 3afunding 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3ascientists 3asociety 3aUnited States 0ascience policy 0aengagement 0apolicymaker1 aAnderson, Thomas1 aCryan, Jason R1 aDurham, Timothy1 aGandhi, Kamal J K1 aLovett, Jennifer Gordon,1 aKrell, Rayda K.,1 aPimsler, Meaghan L1 aRivers, Ariel1 aSpafford, Helen0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2019 Mar. 09, v. 112, no. 2 p.75-78dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44731x1938-29017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aesa/say0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005300188245008000241300001600321500001100337506007600348520111100424592002801535596005601563506003701619650002201656650001201678650001701690650002401707650002501731650001201756650003001768650001501798650001301813650002501826650002101851650001901872650001901891650001801910650001201928650001101940700002601951700002101977700001601998700002502014700002302039700002302062700002502085700001902110700001702129700002402146700002002170773010302190856008102293852000902374655001202383IND60613032220221207131717.0180911e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061303222DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-018-1012-42doi7 aPMC61311352pmcid7 a293975472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4199-129612aA review of regulations and guidelines related to winter manure application  ap. 657-670.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWinter manure application elevates nutrient losses and impairment of water quality as compared to manure applications in other seasons. In conjunction with reviewing global distribution of animal densities, we reviewed worldwide mandatory regulations and voluntary guidelines on efforts to reduce off-site nutrient losses associated with winter manure applications. Most of the developed countries implement regulations or guidelines to restrict winter manure application, which range from a regulative ban to guidelines based upon weather and field management conditions. In contrast, developing countries lack such official directives, despite an increasing animal production industry and concern over water quality. An analysis of five case studies reveals that directives are derived from a common rationale to reduce off-site manure nutrient losses, but they are also affected by local socio-economic and biophysical considerations. Successful programs combine site-specific management strategies along with expansion of manure storage to offer farmers greater flexibility in winter manure management.  aPublisher supplied data  aRD 83556801-0cU.S. Environmental Protection Agency0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal production 3aanimals 3acase studies 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3afarmers 3ageographical distribution 3aguidelines 3aindustry 3alaws and regulations 3amanure spreading 3amanure storage 3asocioeconomics 3awater quality 3aweather 3awinter1 aKleinman, Peter J.

The experiment was laid out in a Randomized complete block design (RCBD) with factorial arrangement and was replicated three times. Four Zn levels (0, 5, 10, and 15 kg Zn ha⁻¹) and four S levels (0, 30, 60 and 90 kg S ha⁻¹) were used. Wheat plant biomass, grain yield and straw yield were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) affected by different levels of Zn and S. Plant biomass (8514 kg ha⁻¹), grain yield (3887 kg ha⁻¹) and straw yield (4531 kg ha⁻¹) were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) greater with combine application of Zn at 15 kg ha⁻¹ and S at 60 kg ha⁻¹. The interaction (Zn x S) was found significant for all the above-mentioned parameters including S and Zn content in plant and post-harvest soil. It can be concluded that application of Zn at 15 kg ha⁻¹ and S at 60 kg ha⁻¹ has the potential to enhance wheat yield and yield components in the prevailing soil and environmental condition.  aPublisher supplied data  a1292cDepartment of Science and Technology 3aagricultural colleges 3aenvironmental factors 3afarms 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3anutrition 3aphytomass 3aplant growth 3asoil 3astraw 3asulfur 3awheat 3azinc 3aPakistan1 aKhan, Nadeem1 aShah, Fahad,1 aAlam, Syed Sartaj1 aKhan, Shadman1 aMian, Ishaq Ahmad1 aAkbar, Waqas Ali0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2022 Aug., v. 41, no. 6 p.2338-2346dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-021-10440-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245013900164520116000303592002801463650002201491650002001513650001201533650001501545650001401560650002101574650002201595650001701617650002101634650000901655650001001664653001901674700001701693700001501710700002001725700001701745700001501762700001701777700002001794700001701814700001301831700002001844700001801864700001701882700001301899773011101912856008402023852000902107655001202116IND60684136120221118053541.0200427e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068413612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2020.1531312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dongxu10aMagnesium reduces cadmium accumulation by decreasing the nitrate reductase-mediated nitric oxide production in Panax notoginseng roots  aPanax notoginseng is a traditional medicinal herb in China. However, the high capacity of its roots to accumulate cadmium (Cd) poses a potential risk to human health. Our previous study showed that nitrate reductase (NR)-dependent nitric oxide (NO) production promoted Cd accumulation in P. notoginseng root cell walls. In this study, the role of Mg in the regulation of NO production and Cd accumulation in P. notoginseng roots was characterized. Exposure of P. notoginseng roots to increasing concentrations of Cd resulted in a linear increase in NO production. The application of 2 mM Mg for 24 h significantly alleviated Cd-induced NO production and Cd accumulation in roots, which coincided with a significant decrease in the NR activity. Western analysis suggested that Mg increased the interaction between the 14-3-3 protein and NR, which might have been a reason for the Mg-mediated decrease in NR activity and NO production under Cd stress. These results suggested that Mg-mediated alleviation of Cd-induced NO production and Cd accumulation is achieved by enhancement of the interaction between the 14-3-3 protein and NR in P. notoginseng roots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax notoginseng 3abioaccumulation 3acadmium 3acell walls 3amagnesium 3amedicinal plants 3anitrate reductase 3anitric oxide 3aplant root cells 3arisk 3aroots 0a14-3-3 protein1 aXiao, Shuhui1 aMa, Wen-Na1 aPeng, Zhongping1 aKhan, Dawood1 aYang, Qian1 aWang, Xinxun1 aKong, Xiangying1 aZhang, Baige1 aYang, En1 aRengel, Zdenko,1 aWang, Jianmin1 aCui, Xiuming1 aChen, Qi0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2020 May, v. 248 p.153131-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2020.1531313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03805naa a2200913 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245016400170500002200334520146800356592002801824650001801852650002201870650002801892650001801920650001401938650001501952650001301967650001601980650003701996650003802033650001902071650001902090650001902109650002102128650002502149650000902174650001102183650002102194650002202215650001102237653000802248653001602256653000802272653000802280653001002288653000702298653000702305653000902312653000802321653000902329653000902338653000802347653000902355653000802364653000902372653000702381653001002388653001102398653000702409653000802416653000802424653000902432653000802441653000702449653000802456653000802464653001602472653003802488653001702526653002002543700001802563700001302581700001802594700001702612700001202629700001702641700002002658700001802678700001902696773007002715856008502785852000902870655001202879IND60582046520221116141447.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058204652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2017.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Yanlong10aMolecular mechanisms underlying protection against H9N2 influenza virus challenge in mice by recombinant Lactobacillus plantarum with surface displayed HA2-LTB  aPre-press version  aIt has been considered that the Avian influenza virus (AIV) causes severe threats to poultry industry. In this study, we constructed a series of recombinant Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) with surface displayed hemagglutinin subunit 2 (HA2) alone or together with heat-labile toxin B subunit (LTB) from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. Balb/c mice were used as model to evaluate the protective effects of recombinant L. plantarum strains against H9N2 subtype challenge.The results showed that the presence of LTB significantly increased the percentages of CD3+CD4+IL-4+, CD3+CD4+IFN-γ+ and CD3+CD4+IL-17+ T cells, as well as CD3+CD8+IFN-γ+ T cells in spleen and MLNs determined by Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting assay. Similar increased production of serum IFN-γ was also confirmed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The L. plantarum with surface displayed HA2-LTB also dramatically increased the percentages of B220+ IgA+ B cells in peyer patch, in consistent with elevated production of mucosal SIgA antibody determined by ELISA. Finally, the orally administrated HA2-LTB expressing strain efficiently protected mice against H9N2 subtype AIV challenge shown by increased survival percentages, body weight gains and decreased lung lesions in histopathologic analysis. In conclusion, this study provides more detail mechanisms underlying the adjuvant effects of LTB on heterologous antigen produced in recombinant lactic acid bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aInfluenza A virus 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadjuvants 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3aenterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aflow cytometry 3ahemagglutinins 3ahistopathology 3ainterferon-gamma 3alactic acid bacteria 3amice 3amodels 3apoultry industry 3aprotective effect 3aspleen 0aAIV 0aL.plantarum 0aHA2 0aLTB 0aELISA 0aHA 0aNA 0aVLPs 0aKLH 0aETEC 0aGRAS 0aLAB 0apgsA 0aPGA 0admLT 0aCT 0aPBMCs 0aE.coli 0aLB 0aerm 0aPBS 0aMLNs 0aBWG 0aHE 0aTMB 0aAIV 0aHA2 protein 0aHeat-labile toxin B subunit (LTB) 0aL. plantarum 0aImmune response1 aYang, Guilian1 aWang, Qi1 aWang, Zhannan1 aYang, Wentao1 aGu, Wei1 aShi, Chunwei1 aWang, Jianzhong1 aHuang, Haibin1 aWang, Chunfeng0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2017.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01664naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245009400159300001600253500002000269520064200289592002800931650002700959650002700986650002201013650001301035650001301048650002001061651001301081700002201094773014201116856007101258852000901329655001201338IND60680409920221119134950.0200105e199805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068040992DNAL7 a10.2307/12445092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtwood, Joseph A.10aExamining Quantity and Quality Effects of Restricting Nitrogen Applications to Feedgrains  ap. 369-381.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRestricting the timing and level of nitrogen applications has been proposed as a response to nitrate contamination in Nebraska. Agronomic research indicates that reducing available nitrogen reduces both the yield (quantity) and protein content (quality) of feedgrains. A differential system is developed to estimate the social costs of regulation while simultaneously considering both quantity and quality effects of a tax and/or a rationing policy. The results indicate that ignoring the quality effects of a proposed policy can lead to erroneous estimates of changes in factor use, output responses, and the social costs of regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3afertilizer application 3aissues and policy 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aprotein content 3aNebraska1 aHelmers, Glenn A.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1998 May, v. 80, no. 2 p.369-381dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12445093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011800167300002000285520144100305592002801746650000801774650002501782650002101807650001001828650001301838650001301851650001801864700001601882700001701898700005501915700001701970773013201987856008402119852000902203655001202212IND60750401920221120135812.0210915e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075040192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c021042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhai, Fuheng10aIntraparticle and Interparticle Transferable DNA Walker Supported by DNA Micelles for Rapid Detection of MicroRNA  ap. 12346-12352.  aSynthetic DNA walkers are artificially designed DNA self-assemblies with the capability of performing quasi-mechanical movement at the micro/nanoscale and have shown extensive promise in biosensing, intracellular imaging, and drug delivery. However, DNA walkers are usually constructed by covalently or coordinately binding DNA strands specifically to hard surfaces, thereby greatly limiting their movement efficiency. Herein, we report an intraparticle and interparticle transferable DNA walker (dynamic micelle-supported DNA walker, DM-walker) constructed by immobilizing walking tracks and walking arms onto the corona of DNA micelles according to the principle of Watson–Crick base pairing. The DNAzyme-powered walking arm can drive the intraparticle and interparticle movements of the DM-walker due to the fact that the dynamic structure of the DNA micelle helps overcome the spatial barrier between the arms and tracks in the system, resulting in high walking efficiency. Moreover, the whole DM-walker can be constructed by self-assembly, getting rid of the tedious process and low efficiency of fixing DNA strands on hard surfaces. Taking miRNA-10b as a model target, the DM-walker demonstrates high walking efficiency (reaction duration of 20 min) and high sensitivity (LOD of 87 pM). The proposed DM-walker provides an avenue to develop novel DNA walkers on dynamic interfaces and holds great potential in clinical diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanalytical chemistry 3achemical bonding 3adrugs 3amicelles 3amicroRNA 3arapid methods1 aGuan, Yufei1 aZhu, Binbing1 aChen, Shuai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9950-60491 aHe, Ronghuan0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 93, no. 36 p.12346-12352dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c021043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016900168300001400337520133900351592002801690650002101718650001501739650000801754650001601762650002301778650001501801650001901816650001501835650001901850650002001869650002101889650002601910650001601936700001901952700002401971773009001995856008402085990002302169852000902192655001202201IND60092412720221121063310.0141103e20110317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009241272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cattod.2010.09.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYap, Pow-Seng10aNitrogen-doped TiO₂/AC bi-functional composite prepared by two-stage calcination for enhanced synergistic removal of hydrophobic pollutant using solar irradiation  ap. 46-52.  aSol–gel method with the incorporation of two-stage calcination protocol was developed to synthesize a bi-functional composite, viz. nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide supported on activated carbon (N-TiO₂/AC). Various types of N-TiO₂/AC composites produced using different calcination conditions were characterized using XRD, porosimetry, XPS, SEM and TEM. All the N-TiO₂/AC composites exhibited good adsorption of a hydrophobic pollutant (bisphenol-A (BPA) as model pollutant) in water. The effects of calcination conditions, light wavelength and composite dosage on photocatalytic degradation (PCD) performance were investigated. N-TiO₂/AC (400M-700T) composite produced from two-stage calcination (400°C in air with subsequent 700°C in NH₃/N₂ atmosphere) was comprised of anatase–rutile phase and this composite exhibited significant PCD efficiency for removing BPA under simulated solar irradiation, with initial pseudo first-order rate constant of ca. 0.67h⁻¹. In addition, the N-TiO₂/AC composite exhibited satisfactory BPA removal performance over several series of reuse. Photostability of the N-TiO₂/AC composite was also examined to address its durability under prolonged exposure of UV irradiation. The amount of carbon being leached in water was found to be less than 0.1% after 6h of UV irradiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aair 3abisphenol A 3acatalytic activity 3adurability 3ahydrophobicity 3aphotolysis 3aphotostability 3asolar radiation 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation 3awavelengths1 aLim, Teik-Thye1 aSrinivasan, Madhavi0 tCatalysis today.g2011 Mar. 17, v. 161, no. 1 p.46-52dElsevier B.V.x0920-58617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cattod.2010.09.0243Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03383naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245008600163300001800249520157500267592002801842596006401870596006401934596006601998596006602064650001202130650001702142650002102159650001302180650003102193650001002224650001502234650001202249650001702261650001702278650002402295650001802319650002002337650002302357700001502380700001502395700001402410700002002424700001402444700001702458700001502475700002002490700001902510700001602529700005502545773012502600856008302725852000902808655001202817IND60784284420221120181631.0220726e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078428442DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-021-10447-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Biao10aPlant Hormone Metabolome and Transcriptome Analysis of Dwarf and Wild-type Banana  ap. 2386-2405.  aGibberellin (GA), auxin (IAA) and brassinosteroid (BR) are indispensable in the process of plant growth and development. Currently, research on the regulatory mechanism of phytohormones in banana dwarfism is mainly focused on GA, and few studies are focused on IAA and BR. In this study, we measured the contents of endogenous GA, IAA and BR and compared the transcriptomes of wild-type Williams banana and its dwarf mutant across five successive growth periods. We investigated the relationship between hormones and banana dwarfism and explored differential gene expression through transcriptome analysis, thus revealing the possible metabolic regulatory mechanism. We inferred a complex regulatory network of banana dwarfing. In terms of endogenous hormone levels, GA and IAA had significant effects on banana dwarfing, while BR had little effect. The key gene in GA biosynthesis of is GA2ox, and the key genes in IAA biosynthesis are TDC and YUCCA. The differential expression of these genes might be the main factor affecting hormone levels and plant height. In terms of hormone signal transduction, DELLA and AUX/IAA repressor proteins were the core regulators of GA and IAA, respectively. They inhibited the process of signal transduction and had feedback regulation on hormone levels. Finally, the transporter protein PIN, AUX1/LAX protein family and ABCB subfamily played supplementary roles in the transport of IAA. These results provide new insights into GA and IAA regulation of banana growth and a reliable foundation for the improvement of dwarf varieties.  aPublisher supplied data  aAA17204026cScience and Technology Major Project of Guangxi  aAA17204045cScience and Technology Major Project of Guangxi  a2011-G16c‘948’ Project of Agricultural Ministry of China  a2016-X22c‘948’ Project of Agricultural Ministry of China 3abananas 3abiosynthesis 3abrassinosteroids 3adwarfing 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ametabolome 3amutants 3aplant growth 3aplant height 3asignal transduction 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3atransport proteins1 aWang, Xuan1 aLong, Xing1 aFang, Ren1 aZhou, Shuangyun1 aZhang, Ji1 aPeng, Xiaolu1 aAn, Zhenyu1 aHuang, Weixiong1 aTang, Wenzhong1 aGao, Yining1 aYao, Jinyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4597-272X0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2022 Aug., v. 41, no. 6 p.2386-2405dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-021-10447-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03639naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002900141245017100170300001600341520177100357592002802128596005202156596002602208596002102234596010902255650001902364650002702383650001402410650001102424650001402435650002502449650001002474650002002484650002202504650001502526650001702541650001702558650001502575650001402590650002302604651001302627653001602640653001602656653002502672700001802697700002802715700001902743700002802762700002602790700002202816773015002838856007602988852000903064655001203073IND60672583520221118233826.0191016e20190507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067258352DNAL7 a10.1093/aesa/saz0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParedes-Montero, Jorge R10aDemographic Expansion of the Predominant Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) Mitotypes Associated With the Cotton Leaf Curl Virus Epidemic in Pakistan  ap. 265-280.  aThe association between Bemisia tabaci mitotypes and cotton leaf curl outbreaks in Pakistan was investigated using the mitochondria cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) as a molecular marker. The 3′-651 base fragment has been used to resolve B. tabaci phylogenies. However, the 5′-618 base fragment was nearly unexplored. Phylogenetic analysis for 829 whiteflies from 11 districts in two provinces of Pakistan, indicated all haplotypes grouped on the Asia II major clade, with Asia II-1 mitotype predominating, at 84%, compared to Asia II-5 and II-7, at ~16%, combined. The 3′- and 5′-fragment tree topologies were similar, while the concatenated topology was unique in some respects. Comparisons of segregating sites within the 3′- and 5′-loci, at third codon positions, 71 and 47, and of transitions to transversions (Ti/Tv) ratio of 2.93 and 5.9, respectively, showed the 3′-locus was most informative, while nucleotide diversity (π) was highest for the 5′-end, indicating both fragments contributed to concatenated tree structure. The extent of haplotype diversity, measured by Tajima’s D, R², and Fu’s F analyses, revealed significant demographic expansion for Asia II-1 and II-7 mitotypes. The bottleneck that preceded the expansions was evident in the temporal changes in mtCOI polymorphisms beginning in ~1990s, a timeframe known to have coincided with the adoption of a high-yield whitefly-susceptible cultivar in 1988, followed by pesticide overuse. These two cooperating phenomena appear to have exerted selection on the cotton leaf curl disease (CLCuD)-whitefly complex, resulting in the emergence of a resistance-breaking begomovirus as the polyphagous Asia II-1 mitotype underwent a genetic expansion that led to ‘a perfect storm’.  aPublisher supplied data  cSENESCYTdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004299  cGovernment of Ecuador  cESPOL University  a58-6402-0-178FcPakistan-U.S. Cotton Productivity Enhancement Program USDA Agricultural Research Service 3aBemisia tabaci 3aCotton leaf curl virus 3aGossypium 3acotton 3acultivars 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3aleaf curling 3amitochondria 3apesticides 3aphylogeny 3atemporal variation 3aPakistan 0aAleyrodidae 0abegomovirus 0apopulation expansion1 aHameed, Usman1 aZia-Ur-Rehman, Muhammad1 aRasool, Ghulam1 aHaider, Muhammad Saleem1 aHerrmann, Hans-Werner1 aBrown, Judith K.,0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2019 May 07, v. 112, no. 3 p.265-280dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44731x1938-29017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aesa/saz0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009300169520105300262592002801315650002201343650001001365650001701375650001401392650002501406650001501431650001501446650001301461650001501474650001401489650001801503650001501521653002601536653001701562653002001579653002201599653001201621700002001633700002201653773011701675856008601792852000901878655001201887IND60779152720221122064356.0220719e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077915272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1151392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSood, Aakriti10aSustainable production of azelaic acid from vegetable oils over a heterogeneous catalyst  aThe sustainable and eco-compatible valorization of renewable feedstocks to synthesize important chemicals is an intense area of research. Currently, ozonolysis is the sole industrial process for the sustainable synthesis of azelaic acid, predominately utilizing oleic acid. Here, the work described the utilization of a non-edible Triadica sebifera seed oil and other vegetable oils to synthesize azelaic acid in 48–72% yields. The process utilized a recyclable WO₃-Na₂SnO₃ based commercial heterogeneous catalytic system and a greener oxidant (30% aq·H₂O₂), which resulted in a less harmful impact on the environment. The catalytic system was also utilized to synthesize other commercially important dicarboxylic acids, such as succinic acid with 58% yield and suberic acid with 56–60% yields. A non-fatty acid-containing oil (anise oil) was used to synthesize p-anisic acid at the gram scale in a 76% yield. A range of benzoic acid derivatives has also been synthesized by utilizing various substituted styrenes in 52–88% yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriadica sebifera 3aanise 3abenzoic acid 3acatalysts 3aenvironmental impact 3afeedstocks 3aoleic acid 3aoxidants 3aozonolysis 3aseed oils 3asuccinic acid 3avegetables 0aSustainable synthesis 0aAzelaic acid 0aCarboxylic acid 0aTriadica sebifera 0aOlefins1 aUpadhyay, Rahul1 aMaurya, Sushil K.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 186 p.115139-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1151393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245011600151300001600267520158800283592002801871650002201899650001001921650002201931650001601953650001101969650001801980650001801998650001102016650002102027650001802048650001802066650000902084650001602093650001702109650001702126651001002143700001302153773013102166856007402297852000902371655001202380IND60764818420221116143446.0220714e20090505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076481842DNAL7 a10.17221/1643-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, H.10aInfluence of uniconazole and plant density on nitrogen content and grain quality in winter wheat in South China  ap. 159-166.  aSuperior protein quality and consistent processing quality is needed for winter wheat marketing in South China. It has been shown that uniconazole concentration and plant density are certainly related to crop growth. An experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of uniconazole concentration and plant density on nitrogen content and grain quality in winter wheat (<I>Triticum aestivum</I> L.). Trials were managed to provide three levels of density (90 × 10<sup>4</sup>, 180 × 10<sup>4</sup>, and 270 × 10<sup>4</sup> per ha) over plots receiving four levels of uniconazole concentrations (0, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) which were applied to seeds before sowing. The results revealed that the contents of N accumulated in ear, stem, and leaf were higher in uniconazole concentrations than that in control, and the effect of uniconazole on main stem was bigger than that on tillers. The grain protein was significantly (LSD, <I>P</I> < 0.05) higher in uniconazole concentrations than that in control. Uniconazole at 20 mg/kg was the most favorable for improving grain protein and protein fractions. Application of uniconazole concentrations also significantly (LSD, <I>P</I> < 0.05) increased WGC (wet gluten content) and SDS (sedimentation volumes), prolonged DDT (dough development time) and DST (dough stable time), and improved WA (water absorption), increased VV (valorimeter value), and subsequently improved the processing quality of wheat grains. These results suggest that a combination of uniconazole concentration and plant density should be applied in South China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3adough 3adough development 3aenvironment 3agluten 3agrain protein 3agrain quality 3aleaves 3anitrogen content 3aplant density 3aprotein value 3asoil 3auniconazole 3awater uptake 3awinter wheat 3aChina1 aYang, W.0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 55, no. 4 p.159-166dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/1643-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245012200162300002000284520169700304592002802001650002502029650001102054650001302065650001002078650001602088650002902104650001402133650001202147650001302159700001502172700001602187700001602203700005802219700005602277773013202333856008402465852000902549655001202558IND60750402220221117163607.0210915e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075040222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c021842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yue10aDual-Mode Sensing Platform for Electrochemiluminescence and Colorimetry Detection Based on a Closed Bipolar Electrode  ap. 12367-12373.  aDevelopment of sensors uniting different sensing principles is in line with the concept of reliable, comprehensive, and diversified equipment construction. However, the current exploration in this field is obstructed by compromise of reaction conditions and inevitable mutual interference arising from different sensing modes. This work reported a closed bipolar electrode (c-BPE) strategy for dual-modality detection or dual-target detection. To this end, a c-BPE sensing platform installed in physically separated anode and cathode compartments was well designed and carefully optimized. If luminol was present in the anode section and Prussian blue (PB) was at the cathode part, single stimulation could realize electrochemiluminescence (ECL) from luminol at the anode and conversion of PB to Prussian white (PW) at the cathode. The latter reaction helped elevate the ECL signal and also prepared for colorimetric detection as color change from PW to PB under the trigger of oxidant (like H₂O₂) was used to track the content of the oxidant. Thus, dual signals were obtained for dual-modality detection of single target or the detection of different targets was realized at different poles. Detection of glucose was carried out to validate the application for dual-modality detection, while VLDL/AChE and NADH/H₂O₂ assays illustrated the potential of dual-target detection. The proposed platform possesses outstanding sensing performance including selectivity, repeatability, long-term stability, accuracy, and so forth. This work implements a breakthrough in designing dual-mode sensors and is expected to present a rational basis for development of a diversified sensing platform.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aanodes 3acathodes 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aequipment 3aglucose 3aoxidants1 aZhu, Liang1 aMei, Xuecui1 aLiu, Jinsen1 aYao, Zhongping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3555-96321 aLi, Yingchun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5371-35870 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 93, no. 36 p.12367-12373dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c021843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100006900141245010000210300001600310520145700326592002801783650001301811650001301824650001301837650001401850650001201864650001101876650001201887650001001899650002301909650001601932650001001948650001901958651001401977651001501991651001902006651001402025651001102039651001202050651001102062651001102073651002602084651003102110653002002141653001702161653001702178653002102195700002402216773015002240856007602390852000902466655001202475IND60672583620221118233948.0191016e20190507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067258362DNAL7 a10.1093/aesa/saz0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDietrich, Christopher H.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4005-430510aEight Leafhoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) Newly Recorded From Hawaii, Including a New Species  ap. 281-287.  aEight exotic species of Cicadellidae apparently recently established in Hawaii are newly recorded.

The focus of the present paper is a soil block decay test with exposure to the brown rot fungus Gloeophyllumtrabeum, where the changes in elasticity and strength were compared in both the radial and tangential directions as a function of the decay degree. The stress-strain analysis was employed by a transverse compression (transC) testing technique in which a load was applied over the specimen’s tangential or radial surface. It was found that early effects of decay were detected in either direction of loading, but the overall reduction in elasticity and compression strength after 7 days of exposure to the fungus was approximately two times greater in the radial direction. This difference is interpreted that decay occurs mainly in the earlywood (EW). Significant strength loss at 5% compression was detected after 2 days of exposure to the fungus. However, 3 days of exposure was required before significant strength loss was evident as a result of the reduction in modulus of elasticity (MOE) or mass loss (ML). In comparison to ML, the compression strength loss was found to be a more sensitive measure of wood decay.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus glabra 3abiodegradation 3abrown-rot fungi 3acompression strength 3adecayed wood 3aearlywood 3amodulus of elasticity 3asoil 0abrown rot 0asoil block test 0aspruce pine 0atransverse compression (transC) 0awood decay1 aNicholas, Darrel D.0 tHolzforschung.g2016 June 16, v. 70, no. 11 p.1067-1071dDe Gruyterx1437-434X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hf-2016-00043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01541naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002900137245005600166300001600222500002000238520060300258592002800861650002700889650002100916650002000937650001600957650002100973700002300994773014201017856007101159852000901230655001201239IND60680410420221120170816.0200105e199805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068041042DNAL7 a10.2307/12445082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVariyam, Jayachandran N.10aFringe Benefits Provision by Rural Small Businesses  ap. 360-368.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe examine the relationship between employer size and the provision of fringe benefits in a large sample of rural businesses.

To overcome the situation, macro-propagation efforts of commercially important Bambusa tulda Roxb. and Bambusa nutans Wall. have been endeavored. Season and cuttings’ thickness is influential in determining rooting ability in culm-branch cuttings of these two species. Age of donor culm, treatment concentration and duration, rooting substratum, temperature, and humidity are other affecting factors. Present study exhibited initiation of sprouts within a week after planting of cuttings, whereas adventitious rooting initiates in 20 days after planting. Culm-branch cuttings planted during spring–summer in March and sampled after 60 days reveals 63.39% and 72.68% rooting ability, respectively in ≤ 2.0 cm diameter (thin) and > 2.0 cm diameter (thick) cuttings of Bambusa tulda and 73.60% and 69.02% rooting ability, respectively in thin and thick cuttings of Bambusa nutans. Rooting ability of branch cuttings decline in rainy season followed by autumn–winter in two diameter classes of both species. Sprout number, sprout length, number of primary adventitious roots, and root length of the longest root was comparatively higher during spring–summer than rainy and autumn–winter season in thin and thick cuttings of both species. Propagation through culm-branch/sub-branch cuttings is without hampering economic value of culms and therefore, a non-destructive, cheap, and easy to handle technique of large scale production of planting stock. Strong relationship between season and rooting ability will help in achieving planting stock production targets of forest nurseries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBambusa tulda 3abamboos 3aculms 3adecline 3aeconomic valuation 3aforests 3ahumidity 3aplant growth 3arhizomes 3atemperature 3awet season1 aMishra, J.

All analytes, including critical isomeric pairs of Tyr, o-Tyr, m-Tyr, and dioxyindolylalanine diastereomers were chromatographically resolved to obtain high selectivity, without the need for derivatizing or ion pairing agents. The results of method validation showed adequate retention time reproducibility [0.1–0.6% coefficient of variation (CV) for over 224 injections], accuracy (within ±1–20% of the nominal concentration), and precision (1–17% CV) for all target analytes. The lower limit of quantification was calculated in different matrices using both the Hubaux-Vos approach and accuracy and precision data showing values in the range of 0.2–15 ng/mL. Use of stable isotope-labelled internal standards compensated errors due to matrix effects and artefactual degradation of analytes. Both acid and enzymatic hydrolyses were tested to obtain the best possible results for the quantification of protein oxidation products, demonstrating the stability of target analytes under hydrolytic conditions. The method was successfully applied to quantify target analytes in serum, tissue, milk, infant formula, pork liver pâté, chicken meat and fish. The method was also applied to assess the role of Fenton's reagent in oxidizing Trp, Phe and Tyr residues in different proteins, with results showing o-Tyr, dioxyindolylalanine diastereomers, kynurenine, dityrosine being the main oxidation products. The Fenton chemistry favored the formation of o-Tyr over m-Tyr from Phe with 2–36 folds higher yields. 3-Nitrotyrosine, a marker of protein nitration, was also detected in samples treated with Fenton's reagent.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3achemical species 3achicken meat 3adiastereomers 3afish 3ainfant formulas 3aisotope dilution technique 3aisotope labeling 3akynurenine 3aliver 3amilk 3aoxidation 3apork 0aProtein oxidation 0aProtein nitration 0aReactive oxygen species 0aProtein hydrolysis 0aTryptophan metabolism 0aAnalytical method validation1 aTiwari, Brijesh K.1 aLund, Marianne N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8708-22100 tTalanta.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 234 p.122700-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1227003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01340naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024002200123024001900145040001800164100002000182245005900202300001300261506007600274520017500350592002800525506003700553650002800590650001300618650001100631650002500642700001900667700002000686700001800706700001700724700001900741773012200760856007500882852000900957655001200966IND60118354220221207115128.0141126e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011835422DNAL7 a10.1128/JB.01846-122doi7 aPMC34974672pmcid7 a231444072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgeow, Yun Fong10aGenome Sequence of Mycobacterium abscessus Strain M152  ap. 6662.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMycobacterium abscessus is an environmental bacterium with increasing clinical relevance.

In this process, waste jasmine flower was first used for producing cellulase and xylanase with Trichoderma reesei. The activities of cellulase and xylanase in waste jasmine flower reached 66.54 U/g and 107.25 U/g, respectively. Waste jasmine flower was hydrolyzed enzymatically on-site and the resulting hydrolysate was used for BC production. The highest BC yield from supplemented jasmine flower hydrolysate (SJFH) was 4.78 g/L, 2.1 times higher than that from Hestrin and Schramm (HS) medium. BC samples were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and antibacterial analysis. The results showed that both the nano structure and thermal property of BC from SJFH medium (BC-JF) were similar to those of BC from HS medium (BC-HS). Furthermore, BC-JF composite displayed excellent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Considering the good biocompatibility of BC-JF to human umbilic vein endothelial cells, this antibacterial BC-JF, which was bioconverted from waste jasmine flower, shows great medical and pharmaceutical application potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aTrichoderma reesei 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3abiocompatibility 3acellulose 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afermentation 3aflowers 3afungi 3ahumans 3ahydrolysates 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry 3axylanases 0aBacterial cellulose 0aJasmine flower 0aTaonella mepensis 0aBiotransformation 0aAntibacterial properties1 aGu, Feng1 aYang, Hongjun1 aCao, Gang1 aXu, Weilin1 aSun, Su1 aZhang, Yanbo0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 185 p.115147-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1151473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245017400166300001600340520135500356592002801711650002501739650001201764650000901776650002901785650001701814650001701831650001501848650001501863650002501878650002401903650001301927650002101940650001501961650001301976650001501989650001102004650001202015650001902027650001402046650002402060650001002084650001302094651000902107651001602116700002002132773011602152856008102268852000902349655001202358IND60613033220221123041323.0180911e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061303322DNAL7 a10.1007/s13364-018-0370-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarashi, Azita10aEvaluation of the role of the national parks for Persian leopard (Panther pardus saxicolor, Pocock 1927) habitat conservation (case study: Tandooreh National Park, Iran)  ap. 425-432.  aHaving knowledge of the habitat requirements of top predators is important for their conservation and also for the stability of wildlife communities since they are keystone species of ecosystems. This study aims to predict suitable habitats for the Persian leopard (Panther pardus saxicolor, Pocock 1927) in Tandooreh National Park, Iran. This species is the largest leopard subspecies in the Middle East and is at high risk of extinction. Presence points for the species have been obtained from field data, literature review, atlas data, and IUCN records. Variables related to human disturbance, terrain, land use/land cover, and the leopards’ prey were used to predict the habitat selection of the Persian leopard by employing binary logistic regression. Our model predicted that the presence of Persian leopards is restricted to the southern, north-western, and western areas of the park which are under severe fragmentation threat. Moreover, leopards avoided areas near human development such as roads. We have also found that the availability of prey such as Capra aegagrus, Ovis vignei, and Ovis orientalis is one of the important parameters to predict habitat suitability for leopards. Our model provides a suitable tool for national park managers to identify biodiversity hotspots since leopards are often associated with high biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapra hircus aegarus 3aFelidae 3aOvis 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3aecosystems 3aextinction 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3akeystone species 3aland cover 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amouflon 3anational parks 3apredators 3aregression analysis 3aroads 3awildlife 3aIran 3aMiddle East1 aShariati, Mitra0 tMammal research.g2018 Oct., v. 63, no. 4 p.425-432dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:12555x2199-24017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13364-018-0370-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245008100166300001600247520144100263592002801704650002501732650002601757650002001783650001201803650001101815650001201826650002201838650001801860651001501878700001801893773012801911856008402039852000902123655001202132IND60764818920220422000000.0220422e20141021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076481892DNAL7 a10.17221/165/2013-agricecon2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDjurovic, G.10aProposal for the EU CAP compliant agricultural budgeting model in Montenegro  ap. 479-487.  aAfter the official start of the Montenegrin accession negotiations with the EU in June 2012, it is important to plan a significant increase in the agricultural budget financing well ahead of the accession. Considering the structure and economic importance of agriculture for the generation of Montenegrin GDP, the balanced trade deficit, the reduction of poverty and the regional disparities in development and reversing the negative demographic trends, the proposed reformed agricultural budget of Montenegro in the period 2014&ndash;2018 outlines significantly higher levels of the funding both as a share of the state budget and the GDP. The proposed proportions of financing of the key measure groups in the subsequent tables utilize as a starting point the model defined in the Montenegrin National Program of Food Production and Rural Development 2009&ndash;2013. Some changes in the proportion of the measures are also proposed according to the agricultural sector needs and the institutional capacity building for the next phase of the EU accession negotiations. In order to prepare the Montenegrin agriculture to cope with the competitive pressures of the EU single market, the indisputable conclusion of this study is that the proposed future levels of agricultural funding in the agricultural budget should be at least near to those (in the relative terms) of the comparable economies of the Western Balkans countries. &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural budgets 3aagricultural industry 3afood production 3amarkets 3amodels 3apoverty 3arural development 3atrade deficit 3aMontenegro1 aBulatovic, B.0 tZemědělská ekonomika.g, v. 60, no. 10 p.479-487dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:22848x0139-570X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/165/2013-agricecon3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04204naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245014900170300001600319520206500335592002802400650001102428650001702439650001902456650002102475650001102496650002002507650002502527650002902552650002402581650002902605650002102634650001602655650000902671650002102680650002202701650000902723650001102732650002502743650001802768650001902786650001602805650001702821650001702838651001102855651000902866651001402875651001102889651001802900653001902918653004202937653001602979653002602995653001803021653003203039700002203071700002003093700001603113700005703129700005803186700001403244700001403258700001603272773009803288856008703386852000903473655001203482IND60582047220221116141215.0180830e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058204722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Mengshan10aWater-energy nexus for urban water systems: A comparative review on energy intensity and environmental impacts in relation to global water risks  ap. 589-601.  aThe importance of the interdependence between water and energy, also known as the water-energy nexus, is well recognized. The water-energy nexus is typically characterized in resource use efficiency terms such as energy intensity. This study aims to explore the quantitative results of the nexus in terms of energy intensity and environmental impacts (mainly greenhouse gas emissions) on existing water systems within urban water cycles. We also characterized the influence of water risks on the water-energy nexus, including baseline water stress (a water quantity indicator) and return flow ratio (a water quality indicator). For the 20 regions and 4 countries surveyed (including regions with low to extremely high water risks that are geographically located in Africa, Australia, Asia, Europe, and North America), their energy intensities were positively related to the water risks. Regions with higher water risks were observed to have relatively higher energy and GHG intensities associated with their water supply systems. This mainly reflected the major influence of source water accessibility on the nexus, particularly for regions requiring energy-intensive imported or groundwater supplies, or desalination. Regions that use tertiary treatment (for water reclamation or environmental protection) for their wastewater treatment systems also had relatively higher energy and GHG emission intensities, but the intensities seemed to be independent from the water risks. On-site energy recovery (e.g., biogas or waste heat) in the wastewater treatment systems offered a great opportunity for reducing overall energy demand and its associated environmental impacts. Future policy making for the water and energy sectors should carefully consider the water-energy nexus at the regional or local level to achieve maximum environmental and economic benefits. The results from this study can provide a better understanding of the water-energy nexus and informative recommendations for future policy directions for the effective management of water and energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogas 3adesalination 3adrainage water 3aemissions factor 3aenergy 3aenergy recovery 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental protection 3afinancial economics 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3agroundwater 3aheat 3ahydrologic cycle 3aissues and policy 3arisk 3awastes 3awastewater treatment 3awater quality 3awater quantity 3awater reuse 3awater stress 3awater supply 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aAustralia 3aEurope 3aNorth America 0aWater scarcity 0aWater supply and wastewater treatment 0aWater reuse 0aEnvironmental impacts 0aEnergy demand 0aLife cycle assessment (LCA)1 aKeller, Arturo A.1 aChiang, Pen-Chi1 aDen, Walter1 aWang, Hongtao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8066-475X1 aHou, Chia-Hung1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5149-40961 aWu, Jiang1 aWang, Xin1 aYan, Jinyue0 tApplied energy.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 205 p.589-601dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02298naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245014100165520101400306592002801320650001601348650002001364650001401384650001401398650001101412650001401423650001601437650001101453650001401464653002701478653002001505653001701525653001801542653002701560700001301587700001701600700001801617700005401635773009201689856008601781852000901867655001201876IND60744471720221121000430.0210806e20211101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074447172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1227022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Ling10a3D microfluidic tumor models for biomimetic engineering of glioma niche and detection of cell morphology, migration and phenotype change  aIn this work, an integrated 3-dimensional microfluidic device was developed for simulation of the immune microenvironment of glioma niche through the co-culture of three kinds of related cells. Glioma cells, endothelial cells and macrophages were co-cultured together in the microfluidic device, spatially separated by the design of a coffer structure and the use of hydrogel.

Sol application was carried out by inkjet printing using a modified office inkjet printer equipped with piezoelectric print head. The grey level of the printed image was varied in order to control the sol loading of the resulting printed pattern. The effect of PEG addition on the precursor and prepared layer properties was studied. Also, the influence of sol loading on physical properties and on photocatalytic activity of the printed layers was investigated. The thickness of prepared layer was studied by NanoCalc 2000 and the structure of prepared layers was evaluated by optical microscopy, AFM and SEM. The hydrophilic properties of TiO₂ thin films were studied by examining the contact angle of water on these films. Photocatalytic activity was investigated as a rate of 2,6-dichloroindophenol (DCIP) decomposition. In all cases, we prepared transparent thin layers of TiO₂ with varying thickness and surface morphology. PEG proved to be an efficient agent suppressing the formation of cracks.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3acontact angle 3aglass 3amicroscopy 3aphysical properties 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolyethylene glycol 3atitanium dioxide1 aVeselý, Michal1 aDzik, Petr0 tCatalysis today.g2011 Mar. 17, v. 161, no. 1 p.97-104dElsevier B.V.x0920-58617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cattod.2010.11.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245010500161300001800266520104100284592002801325596006301353596008601416596009601502596011201598596002401710596004001734596008801774650002301862650001201885650001601897650001501913650001001928650002301938650001501961650001801976650001801994650001702012650001902029700001902048700001902067700002002086700005502106773012502161856008302286852000902369655001202378IND60784285120221120172153.0220726e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078428512DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-021-10430-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yali10aFungal Endophytes Help Grasses to Tolerate Sap-Sucking Herbivores Through a Hormone-Signaling System  ap. 2122-2137.  aPlants possess a sophisticated hormone-signaling system, which includes salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), to defend themselves from herbivores. In addition, this immune system is modulated by nonpathogenic microbes that live asymptomatically within intercellular spaces of host grasses. We investigated the resistance triggered by defense hormones, and that provided by endophyte Epichloë gansuensis against aphid Rhopalosiphum padi, and how the endophyte regulates this tripartite interaction. We detected that endophyte-induced plant tolerance to the aphid feeding and exogenous SA increased plant shoot biomass, root biomass, plant length, and chlorophyll content. Endophyte colonization induces the WRKY54 factor that overrides negative effects on plant growth and possibly suppresses SA accumulation. In addition, the endophyte promotes a level of JA that is antagonistic to the SA pathway. By disabling the SA mechanism for herbivore-mediated plant growth inhibition, the endophyte induces plant tolerance to herbivory.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014CB138702cthe National Basic Research Program of China  a2019QZKK0302che Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP)  aIRT17R50cProgram for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University, China  aLZUJBKY-2020-kb10cFundamental Research Funds for Central Universities of the Central South University (CN)  aB12002c111 Project  aW4147cUSDA-NIFA Multistate Project  aXDA26020202cthe Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences 3aRhopalosiphum padi 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3aendophytes 3afungi 3agrowth retardation 3aherbivores 3aimmune system 3ajasmonic acid 3aplant growth 3asalicylic acid1 aChen, Taixiang1 aZhang, Haijuan1 aWhite, James F.1 aLi, Chunjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3287-21400 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2022 Aug., v. 41, no. 6 p.2122-2137dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-021-10430-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001300143245014200156300001600298520128800314592002801602650003501630650001201665650002001677650003201697650001601729650001001745650002901755650001301784650002201797650004301819650000901862650001801871650000901889650001801898700001401916700001101930700001401941700001301955773013101968856007802099852000902177655001202186IND60764819020221116143452.0220904e20130905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076481902DNAL7 a10.17221/165/2013-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXX, Dong14aThe response of nitrifier, N-fixer and denitrifier gene copy numbers to the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate &nbsp;  ap. 398-403.  aA laboratory incubation experiment was conducted to examine the effects of 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) on the transformation of urea-N and associated microbial communities in a low-fertility brown soil. The soil was supplied with urea at 180 kg N/ha and DMPP at 0, 1.8 or 18 kg/ha, while soil that was not supplied with urea and DMPP was treated as the control. Soil mineral nitrogen (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>-N) was measured at regular intervals, and temporal variations in the population sizes of nitrogen-cycling microbes were determined using real-time PCR. Compared to the urea-alone treatment, the additional application of DMPP maintained significantly higher (P < 0.05) NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N concentrations and lower NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>-N (P < 0.05) concentrations in the soil and decreased the population sizes of ammonia oxidizing and denitrifying microbes but promoted the growth of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The results suggest that the application of DMPP is beneficial in improving the availability of fertilizer-N for plant uptake. This study is the first comprehensive investigation to examine the effects of DMPP on the functional microorganisms that are important in nitrogen-cycling processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate 3aammonia 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3aenvironment 3agenes 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asoil 3asoil minerals 3aurea 3aurea nitrogen1 aLL, Zhang1 aZJ, Wu1 aHW, Zhang1 aGong, P.0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 59, no. 9 p.398-403dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/165/2013-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011900165520131300284592002801597650001601625650001501641650002201656650001401678650001701692650003501709650001701744650001901761650000901780650001601789650001701805650001701822653002001839653001701859653001401876700001401890700001601904700001801920700001301938700001401951700001801965700001801983700001602001773009202017856008602109852000902195655001202204IND60744471820221121011316.0210806e20211101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074447182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1227032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiao12aA highly sensitive and dual-readout immunoassay for norfloxacin in milk based on QDs-FM@ALP-SA and click chemistry  aA dual-readout immunoassay based on QDs-FM@ALP-SA and click chemistry was developed for quick and sensitive detection of norfloxacin (NOR), which is an important fluoroquinolone antibiotic. In the system, the NOR-biotin conjugate (NOR-Biotin) was synthesized by click chemistry for signal transformation, and alkaline phosphatase–labeled streptavidin (ALP-SA) was attached to quantum dot fluorescence microspheres (QDs-FM) by an activated ester method to form QDs-FM@ALP-SA for signal amplification. Here, QDs-FM was a dual-functional carrier: it was used not only as a chemiluminescence signal amplification carrier but also as a fluorescent signal due to its fluorescence character. The NOR antibody was coated on a 96-well chemiluminescence microtiter plate, and NOR-Biotin was bound to the antibody specifically. Then, QDs-FM@ALP-SA was combined with NOR-Biotin to develop a direct competition chemiluminescence/fluorescence immunoassay (dc-CLIA/FIA). The IC₅₀ values were 0.345 and 1.206 ng/mL for dc-CLIA/FIA, respectively. The linear range was 0.013–12.48 ng/mL and 0.042–39.86 ng/mL, respectively. The recovery from the standard fortified blank milk samples was in the range of 86.44%–101.3%. Therefore, this method could be a useful tool for routine screening of NOR residues in milk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3aantibodies 3achemiluminescence 3achemistry 3afluorescence 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aimmunoassays 3amicroparticles 3amilk 3anorfloxacin 3aquantum dots 3astreptavidin 0aClick chemistry 0aDual-readout 0aDetection1 aXu, Zehua1 aHan, Zhenyu1 aFan, Longxing1 aLiu, Sha1 aYang, Han1 aChen, Zongfen1 aSun, Tieqiang1 aNing, Baoan0 tTalanta.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 234 p.122703-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1227033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02069naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245010400165300001800269520090800287592002801195650002301223650002101246650001901267650000901286653002101295653003301316653002301349653004901372653004501421653003301466700001701499700001901516773008701535856007601622852000901698655001201707IND60556203420221122134351.0161031e20160503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055620342DNAL7 a10.1515/hf-2016-00252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshihara, Hiroshi10aFour-point bending strength of key-hole side-edge-notched western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) wood  ap. 1073-1079.  aThe four-point bending strength of key-hole side-edge-notched (4KHSENB) western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla Sarg.) has been determined with a focus on the effects of the notch length and hole size on the results. A hole notch with various lengths and hole diameters was cut at the mid-length in the longitudinal-radial plane. Bending loads were applied to the specimen along the depth direction at the two trisectional points of the span, and the nominal bending stress in general and at the onset of non-linearity was determined. The effects of the input parameters were analysed based on the elementary beam theory (EBT), the point stress criterion (PSC), and linear-elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). It was found that the PSC and LEFM methods are effective for fitting the relationships between the side-edge-notched strength and notch length in the longitudinal and radial directions, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTsuga heterophylla 3abending strength 3abending stress 3awood 0abending strength 0aelementary beam theory (EBT) 0afour-point bending 0akey-hole side-edge-notched samples (4KHSENB) 0alinear-elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) 0apoint stress criterion (PSC)1 aAtaka, Naoki1 aMaruta, Makoto0 tHolzforschung.g2016 May 3, v. 70, no. 11 p.1073-1079dDe Gruyterx1437-434X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hf-2016-00253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02715naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245013100209300001600340520124700356592002801603650002201631650001601653650002501669650001501694650002001709650001601729650002501745650001801770650001401788650002201802650002101824650001801845650001601863650001601879653001701895653002001912653002101932653003101953653001201984700001901996700001402015773011902029856008802148852000902236655001202245IND60628243920221118124759.0190404e20190410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062824392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.01.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yiwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2806-374610aCharacterization of allelochemicals of the diatom Chaetoceros curvisetus and the effects on the growth of Skeletonema costatum  ap. 269-276.  aAllelopathy has been regarded as chemical weapons for marine phytoplankton that enhanced competition ability in stressful conditions, especially during blooms. In a previous study, Chaetoceros curvisetus achieved growth advantage to Skeletonema costatum by producing allelochemicals. However, C. curvisetus allelochemicals have never been isolated and characterized until now. In this study the extraction and purification conditions were systematically optimized and C. curvisetus filtrate extracts were used to assess bioactive effects on the growth of S. costatum. The preliminary results showed that filtrates of C. curvisetus in exponential phase extracted under a temperature lower than 50°C could ensure a stronger activity of allelochemicals. Ethyl acetate extraction showed significant allelopathic effect and the wavelength of characteristic absorption was 255–260nm. Then C. curvisetus allelochemicals were isolated by Si-SPE, Sephadex-25 columns and C18 column and identified by HPLC-electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI TOFMS). It was found that the molecular weight of C. curvisetus allelochemicals was 314 and the allelochemical was supposed to be 2- ((2-cyanophenyl) amino)-2-oxoethyl,3-cyclohexyl propanoate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aChaetoceros 3aSkeletonema costatum 3aabsorption 3aallelochemicals 3aallelopathy 3abioactive properties 3aethyl acetate 3afiltrates 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3aphytoplankton 3atemperature 3awavelengths 0aAlgal blooms 0aAllelochemicals 0aCharacterization 0aChromatographic techniques 0aDiatoms1 aWang, Jiangtao1 aTan, Liju0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Apr. 10, v. 660 p.269-276dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.01.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002500176245010200201300001500303520109500318592002801413650000901441650001401450650002201464650001201486650001401498650001601512650001001528650001101538650000901549650002001558700001901578700002401597773015201621856006901773856009201842990002301934852000901957655001201966IND60644392920221119060325.0190516e20181022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064439292DNAL7 a10.3791/586742doi7 aPMC62355772pmcid7 a303943992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Jennifer E.13aAn optimized rhizobox protocol to visualize root growth and responsiveness to localized nutrients  ap. e58674.  aRoots are notoriously difficult to study. Soil is both a visual and mechanical barrier, making it difficult to track roots in situ without destructive harvest or expensive equipment. We present a customizable and affordable rhizobox method that allows the non-destructive visualization of root growth over time and is particularly well-suited to studying root plasticity in response to localized resource patches. The method was validated by assessing maize genotypic variation in plasticity responses to patches containing 15N-labeled legume residue. Methods are described to obtain representative developmental measurements over time, measure root length density in resource-containing and control patches, calculate root growth rates, and determine 15N recovery by plant roots and shoots. Advantages, caveats, and potential future applications of the method are also discussed. Although care must be taken to ensure that experimental conditions do not bias root growth data, the rhizobox protocol presented here yields reliable results if carried out with sufficient attention to detail.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3aequipment 3agenetic variation 3alegumes 3anutrients 3aroot growth 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil 3astable isotopes1 aLowry, Carolyn1 aGaudin, Amelie C.M.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Oct. 22, , no. 140 p.e58674-e58674dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/586743Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/58674/an-optimized-rhizobox-protocol-to-visualize-root-growth  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100002100185245016100206300001200367520133800379592002801717650002901745650001301774650001701787650001801804650001101822650001901833650001101852650001301863650002701876650001401903650001801917650001201935650001401947650001201961650001501973650001501988651002302003651001702026700002202043700002002065773012802085856008102213852000902294655001202303IND60519466720221118183123.0160614e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051946672DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-016-5522-82doi7 a10.1007/s12665-016-5522-82chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Rohit K.10aStream sediment geochemistry of the upper Cheyenne River watershed within the abandoned uranium mining region of the southern Black Hills, South Dakota, USA  ap. 823.  aAbandoned uranium (U) mine workings and tailings deposits are found throughout the southern Black Hills of South Dakota. The close proximity of the mine sites to the Cheyenne River (CR) appears to promote elevated metal and radionuclide transport within the watershed, however, the extent of their contribution is unknown. Sixty sediment and soil samples were collected from potentially impacted locations within the watershed to elucidate contaminant occurrence and transport mechanisms. The degree of sediment contaminant impacts were assessed by establishing enrichment factors (EF) and pollution load indices (PLI) criterion as compared to non-mining impacted reference sites. Herron classifications suggest that the sediments collected from the southern Black Hills are immature, consistent with the presence of detrital feldspar. Generally, sediment Sr content were found depleted and intermittently enriched in Rb/Sr ratios compared to upper continental crust concentrations, suggesting physical weathering mechanisms predominate within the CR catchment up gradient of the Angostura Reservoir. Increasing EF and PLI indices coupled with low strontium (Sr) values suggest sediment contamination found along the CR and Angostura Reservoir delta appear attributed to anthropogenic activities and not natural weathering processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3afeldspar 3ageochemistry 3amine tailings 3amining 3apollution load 3arivers 3arubidium 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3asoil sampling 3astreams 3astrontium 3auranium 3awatersheds 3aweathering 3aBlack Hills region 3aSouth Dakota1 aPutirka, Keith D.1 aStone, James J.0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 May, v. 75, no. 9 p.823-823dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:26771x1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-5522-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245007300174520161400247592002801861650002201889650001601911650002001927650001001947650001401957650001801971650001901989650001102008650002302019650001402042650001402056650002302070650001202093651001002105700002202115773012602137856008502263852000902348655001202357IND60703364220221116224213.0200721e20200521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070336422DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms80507782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBisset, Andrew  T.10aEvolution and Adaptation of the Avian H7N9 Virus into the Human Host  aInfluenza viruses arise from animal reservoirs, and have the potential to cause pandemics. In 2013, low pathogenic novel avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses emerged in China, resulting from the reassortment of avian-origin viruses. Following evolutionary changes, highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses emerged in late 2016. Changes in pathogenicity and virulence of H7N9 viruses have been linked to potential mutations in the viral glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), as well as the viral polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2). Recognizing that effective viral transmission of the influenza A virus (IAV) between humans requires efficient attachment to the upper respiratory tract and replication through the viral polymerase complex, experimental evidence demonstrates the potential H7N9 has for increased binding affinity and replication, following specific amino acid substitutions in HA and PB2. Additionally, the deletion of extended amino acid sequences in the NA stalk length was shown to produce a significant increase in pathogenicity in mice. Research shows that significant changes in transmissibility, pathogenicity and virulence are possible after one or a few amino acid substitutions. This review aims to summarise key findings from that research. To date, all strains of H7N9 viruses remain restricted to avian reservoirs, with no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, although mutations in specific viral proteins reveal the efficacy with which these viruses could evolve into a highly virulent and infectious, human-to-human transmitted virus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aamino acids 3aavian influenza 3abirds 3aevolution 3aglycoproteins 3ahemagglutinins 3ahumans 3arespiratory system 3asialidase 3avirulence 3avirus transmission 3aviruses 3aChina1 aHoyne, Gerard  F.0 tMicroorganisms.g2020 May 21, v. 8, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms80507783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03604naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245016900172500002200341506010400363506007600467520195200543592002802495506003702523650002302560650001402583650002902597650002402626650002502650650001202675653002102687653001302708653002802721653002002749653001502769700006202784700002802846700006002874700002002934700005702954773008603011856005203097852000903149655001203158IND60795632520221207141908.0221004e20220928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079563252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e108982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Kahtani, Nouf10aSustaining blended and online learning during the Normal and New Normal conditions in a Saudi Higher Education Institution: Health Science Students’ perspectives.  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHigher education institutions (HEIs) shifted from in-person attendance to blended and online learning due to the COVID-19 lockdowns. This study investigated the students' perception of satisfaction, convenience, engagement, and learning towards blended and online courses conducted before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdowns. A longitudinal study design was adopted to examine the students' perception of online and blended learning courses before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdowns. The subjects consist of Health science students (N=130) belonging to two different colleges of a public university and the study period includes three academic years (i.e., six semesters) (2018-2021). A survey tool was developed to collect data from students studying the computer fundamentals course through blended and online learning modes from 2018 to 2021. Over 95% of students have been satisfied with the course offered through various blended learning formats since 2018. The blended 0.50-course format is the most preferred one for the students; however, the Blended 0.75-course format is highly rated by the students regarding their satisfaction and engagement than other learning formats during the COVID-19 lockdowns. Following adaption after COVID-19, the students reported a high perception of learning towards the course when delivered through 100% online learning mode. Students' achievement is significantly associated with the learning modes, exam modes, and various student batches. The blended 0.75-course format group shows a higher achievement than the other three-course format groups. Likewise, those students who appeared in their exams online showed higher achievement than those who appeared physically. Further, the students felt equally convenient with Blended 0.75 and 100% online learning course formats. These findings would also help HEIs choose appropriate learning and examination modes while designing courses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCOVID-19 infection 3acomputers 3aeducational institutions 3aexperimental design 3alongitudinal studies 3asurveys 0aBlended learning 0aCOVID-19 0aHealth science students 0aOnline learning 0aPerception1 aAlmurayh, Abdullah1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3471-49871 aSubbarayalu, Arun Vijay1 aSebastian, Tunny1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3363-97781 aAlkahtani, Hend1 aAljabri, Duaa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2161-99320 tHeliyon.g2022 Sept. 28,  p.e10898-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10898  aDNAL 7aarticle02088naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245011300170300001600283520081700299592002801116650001501144650002001159650001301179650001701192650001301209650001801222650002601240650001301266650002001279650001601299650001701315650001401332700002101346700002701367700002601394700002201420773010901442856008301551990002301634852000901657655001201666IND60098065220221116184519.0141104e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009806522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yexmp.2011.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarr, Charles M.12aA comparative evaluation of microarray slides as substrates for the development of protease assay biosensors  ap. 714-717.  aThe application of commercially available microarray slides as substrates for fluorogenic protease assays has been explored in terms of binding efficiency, stability, and activity.

In Escherichia coli, the nucleosidase PpnN (YgdH) regulates purine homeostasis by cleaving nucleoside monophosphates and specifically binds (p)ppGpp. Here, we show that (p)ppGpp stimulates the catalytic activity of PpnN both in vitro and in vivo causing accumulation of several types of nucleobases during stress. The structure of PpnN reveals a tetramer with allosteric (p)ppGpp binding sites located between subunits. pppGpp binding triggers a large conformational change that shifts the two terminal domains to expose the active site, providing a structural rationale for the stimulatory effect. We find that PpnN increases fitness and adjusts cellular tolerance to antibiotics and propose a model in which nucleotide levels can rapidly be adjusted during stress by simultaneous inhibition of biosynthesis and stimulation of degradation, thus achieving a balanced physiological response to constantly changing environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aactive sites 3aantibiotics 3abinding sites 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3aenzymes 3ahomeostasis 3amicrobial physiology 3amodels 3anucleobases 3anucleosides 3astress response 0aYgdH 0aPpnN 0aallosteric enzyme 0anucleotide metabolism 0astringent response 0aantibiotic tolerance 0apersistence 0afluoroquinolone1 aBærentsen, René Lysdal1 aFuhrer, Tobias1 aSauer, Uwe1 aGerdes, Kenn1 aBrodersen, Ditlev Egeskov0 tMolecular cell.g2019 June 20, v. 74, no. 6 p.1239-1249.e4dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2019.03.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007600167300001800243520119200261592002801453650002101481650001301502650001801515650001201533650001801545650002001563650001001583650001201593650001301605650001101618650002901629700002001658700001901678773010501697856004801802852000901850655001201859IND50060889420221121095605.0130318e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006088942DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954121100992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeregina, T.

It was shown that in the case of wild bacteria, the addition of butanol to the growth medium results in an increased level of ompC transcription. However, OmpC porin is not detected in the membrane fraction of cells. ButR mutant exhibits a higher level of ompC gene expression. A direct correlation is observed between the level of OmpC porin expression and its content in the membrane fraction of ButR mutant cells. In the regulatory region of the ompC gene of the ButR mutant, three nucleotide substitutions located in the binding sites of OmpR and CpxR activator proteins were identified. It was shown that mutations in the regulatory region of the ompC gene in the ButR mutant are responsible for the decreased level of OmpC porin expression under normal growth conditions. However, these mutations lead to an increased level of OmpC porin synthesis in the presence of butanol. These data suggest an additional mechanism of ompC gene regulation with the participation of butanol as a positive transcription effector.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteria 3abinding sites 3abutanol 3aculture media 3agene expression 3agenes 3amutants 3amutation 3aporins 3atranscription (genetics)1 aShakulov, R.

Bromide and ammonia react with chlorine and are promptly transformed into bromine and chloramines, respectively. Rate constants of chlorine, bromine, and monochloramine with MP were determined under different pH conditions. At pH 8.5, the apparent second-order rate constants of MP reactions with chlorine and bromine were found to be 3.37(±0.50) × 10¹ and 2.37 (±0.11) × 10⁶ M⁻¹.s⁻¹ for kCₕₗₒᵣᵢₙₑ/MP and kBᵣₒₘᵢₙₑ/MP, respectively, yet there was low reactivity with monochloramine ([Formula: see text] = 0.045 M⁻¹.s⁻¹). Regarding chlorination and bromination, in order to gain further insight into the observed pH-dependence of the reaction, the elementary reactions were considered and the corresponding second-order rate constants were calculated. The experimental and modeled values were quite consistent under these conditions. Then, chlorination experiments with different bromide and/or ammonia concentrations were performed to assess the impact of inorganic water content on MP elimination and a kinetic model was designed to assess MP degradation. Under these conditions, MP degradation was found to be enhanced in the presence of bromide whereas it was inhibited in the presence of ammonia, and the overall impact was pH dependent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3abromination 3abromine 3achlorination 3achlorine 3akinetics 3amethylparaben 3apH 3apharmacokinetics 3apollution 3awater content1 aDossier-Berne, Florence1 aKarpel Vel Leitner, Nathalie1 aDeborde, Marie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8487-42980 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 June, v. 28, no. 24 p.31256-31267dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11503-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01816naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245012000167300002000287520085200307592002801159650001701187650001401204650001601218650001101234700003101245700002301276773013601299856008201435852000901517655001201526IND60558121720180413000000.0161109e20161109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055812172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.6b009072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBotelho, Viviane10aDiagnosis of Poor Performance in Model Predictive Controllers: Unmeasured Disturbance versus Model–Plant Mismatch  ap. 11566-11582.  aPoor model quality in model predictive controller (MPC) is often an important source of performance degradation. A key issue in MPC model assessment is to identify whether the bad performance comes from model–plant mismatches (MPM) or unmeasured disturbances (UD). This paper proposes a method for distinguishing between such degradation sources, where the main idea is to compare the statistical distribution of the estimated nominal outputs with the actual modeling error. The proposed approach relies on the assessment of three case studies: a simple SISO Linear MPC and two multivariable cases, where the linear controller is subject to a linear and nonlinear plant, respectively. Results show that the proposed method provides a good indicator of the model degradation source, even when both effects are present but one of them is dominant.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3achemistry 3acontrollers 3amodels1 aTrierweiler, Jorge Otávio1 aFarenzena, Marcelo0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2016 Nov. 09, v. 55, no. 44 p.11566-11582dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.6b009073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245009500201300001600296500002000312520107400332592002801406596006001434650001401494650002101508650001001529650001101539650002301550650002001573650001801593650002201611650001601633650001301649650001801662650001001680650002601690700001901716700002001735700002001755700001801775700006401793773015001857856007402007852000902081655001202090IND60627780420221119055731.0190128e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062778042DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.139512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoscetti, Roberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2034-853610aEffects of hot‐water and steam blanching of sliced potato on polyphenol oxidase activity  ap. 403-411.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe worldwide potato production is considered the fourth‐most important food sector due to the increasing use of potatoes as raw materials for high‐convenience food. Enzymatic browning, due to polyphenol oxidase (PPO), is related to unacceptability by consumer. Among antibrowning agents, thermal treatments are viable alternatives. In this study, the efficacy of hot‐water and steam blanching at 80–90 °C of potato slices (1‐cm thick) was evaluated in terms of colour changes as well as PPO inactivation kinetics, substrate specificity and transition state parameters. In general, all treatments [1] bleached the slices, [2] inactivated PPO and [3] reduced its kinetic efficiency. Results from thermal inactivation kinetics promoted hot‐water blanching at 90 °C for approx. 2 min as the fastest treatment to obtain enzymatic‐stable potato slices. Moreover, steam blanching required more energy (53.93 ± 1.24 kJ mol⁻¹) than hot‐water treatment (41.41 ± 4.51 kJ mol⁻¹) to reach the transition state and then to unfold the PPO enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data  aD.M. 20/12/2017, n. 92350cCORE Organic Plus Consortium 3ablanching 3acatechol oxidase 3acolor 3aenergy 3aenzymatic browning 3aenzyme activity 3afood industry 3aheat inactivation 3apolyphenols 3apotatoes 3araw materials 3asteam 3asubstrate specificity1 aRaponi, Flavio1 aMonarca, Danilo1 aBedini, Giacomo1 aFerri, Serena1 aMassantini, Riccardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6517-31620 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2019 Feb., v. 54, no. 2 p.403-411dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.139513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02215naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002100136245008400157300001600241520117700257592002801434650001601462650001401478650001601492650002501508650001301533650002301546650001201569650001401581650001401595650001201609650000901621651000901630700001901639773010201658856007201760852000901832655001201841IND60466573520221118002122.0151126e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046657352DNAL7 a10.2984/69.3.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorley, Craig G.10aVulnerability of Skinks to Predation by Introduced Mongoose in the Fiji Islands  ap. 313-317.  aSkinks are successful colonizers and are commonly found throughout the Pacific islands, but introduced predators such as mongoose are known to threaten their survival. The two most abundant skinks found within the Fiji Islands are Emoia cyanura and E. impar. Abundance of these species encountered during visual transect counts on 16 islands within four habitats formed the basis of this study. Half of these islands had mongoose present, and the other half were known to be mongoose free. Our results showed that skink abundance under mongoose-free conditions was approximately five times higher than when mongoose were present. We conclude that it is very likely that mongoose severely supress even commonly found skink species across all the habitat types on these small islands, and it is likely that they impact even more severely on rarer species. Conservation actions that could protect these native species include biosecurity mechanisms to prevent secondary invasion of introduced predators, habitat protection and management, and captive rearing programs. Failure to implement such actions is likely to result in even common species being at risk of extirpation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHerpestidae 3aScincidae 3abiosecurity 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aislands 3apredation 3apredators 3arearing 3arisk 3aFiji1 aWinder, Linton0 tPacific science.g2015 July, v. 69, no. 3 p.313-317dUniversity of Hawai'i Pressx1534-61887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2984%2F69.3.23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005400140245013100194300001600325500002000341520097300361592002801334596005901362596008201421596008201503596011001585596008601695596008801781650004401869650002301913650002501936650002201961650001301983650000701996650003302003650001102036650002702047700001702074700001802091700001702109700001502126773015002141856007402291852000902365655001202374IND60627780520221119055506.0190128e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062778052DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.139732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Yizhe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0190-347410aInfluence of atmospheric pressure plasma jet on the structure of microcrystalline starch with different relative crystallinity  ap. 567-575.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study demonstrated the effect on microcrystalline starch (MS) with different relative crystallinity (RC) by atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) treatment for 1, 3, 5 or 7 min. The morphology of MS granules was destroyed according to Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. APPJ treatment did not change the crystalline type of MS, but obviously decreased the RC of MS. Short‐range molecular order of MS was clearly decreased after APPJ treatment though the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy. Notably, the effect of APPJ on crystalline and short‐range order structure of MS was gradually increased with the increase of RC, which revealed that the crystalline region of MS might be destroyed by APPJ. Furthermore, the pH of MS was decreased while water binding capacity (WBC) and swelling volume (SV) of MS were increased. Therefore, the APPJ treatment could be used as an alternative physical technology for starch modification.  aPublisher supplied data  a21502177cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a182102110248cScience and Technology Basic Research Program of Henan Province  a182102310903cScience and Technology Basic Research Program of Henan Province  a19zx012cBasic Research Plan of Higher Education School Key Scientific Research Project of Henan Province  cHigher Education School Young Backbone Teacher Training Program of Henan Province  a2014BSJJ032cDoctoral Research Foundation of Zhengzhou University of Light Industry 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aatmospheric pressure 3acrystal structure 3agranules 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astarch 3awater binding capacity1 aZhou, Yaping1 aShi, Miaomiao1 aLiu, Hualing1 aLiu, Yanqi0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2019 Feb., v. 54, no. 2 p.567-575dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.139733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100006200143245012000205520148600325592002801811596005201839650001301891650002501904650001101929650001401940650001001954650001401964650002001978650002201998650001302020650001202033650002702045650002402072650001402096651001302110653002202123653001702145653002102162653002202183653002002205700002702225700001802252773011602270856007702386852000902463655001202472IND60673362920221120093808.0191018e20180810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067336292DNAL7 a10.1093/femsec/fiy1592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelinchón, Rocío1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6326-905310aClimate-woodland effects on population genetics for two congeneric lichens with contrasting reproductive strategies  aGenetic variation is expected to be influenced by the interaction between reproductive mode and dispersal traits on the one hand and environmental and habitat setting affecting establishment success on the other. We evaluated how environmental/habitat setting affects population genetic variation (i.e. variation in genetic diversity and structure) when regulated by contrasting dispersal traits. We used fungus-specific microsatellite markers to examine genetic diversity and structure of two closely related epiphytic lichen fungi that differ in their primary reproductive mode: Nephroma laevigatum (sexually reproducing, n = 191, 10 microsatellites) and N. parile (asexually reproducing, n = 182, 12 microsatellites), along a steep climatic gradient in Scotland. Despite their reproductive differences, we found a high proportion of clones in both species and a background pattern of genetic structure related to climatic gradients. We also demonstrated that woodland connectivity, rather than geographic distance, explained genetic diversity in both species. Environmental/habitat setting, modulated by the reproductive mode of the species, affects genetic diversity and structure, but the putative dissimilarity in their reproductive mode is less important than has been previously assumed. We reinforce the importance of protecting highly connected populations, positioned along a gradient capturing the segregation of gene pool differences in response to climatic variation.  aPublisher supplied data  aPIEF-GA-2011-299330cMarie Curie Intra-European 3aNephroma 3aasexual reproduction 3aclones 3aepiphytes 3afungi 3agene pool 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3alichens 3amicrosatellite repeats 3asexual reproduction 3awoodlands 3aScotland 0aclimatic gradient 0aconnectivity 0adispersal traits 0aepiphytic lichens 0amicrosatellites1 aEllis, Christopher J.,1 aYahr, Rebecca0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2018 Aug. 10, v. 94, no. 11dOxford University PresswJournal:1989x1574-69417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiy1593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03344naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100004000144245010300184300001600287520180300303592002802106650002202134650001002156650002802166650001802194650002002212650001602232650003202248650003102280650001102311650001702322650001202339650001002351650001602361650001402377650001502391650001802406650000902424650001902433650001102452650001802463653003002481653002202511653001202533653001802545653002302563653002002586773012002606856007902726852000902805655001202814IND60593645120221116154651.0180620e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059364512DNAL7 a10.1515/aopf-2017-00202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNapiórkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka10aPhytoplankton response to fish-induced environmental changes in a temperate shallow pond-type lake  ap. 211-262.  aSince 1967, the temperate, shallow, pond-type Lake Warniak has been subjected to different biomanipulation methods including the introduction of common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella (Val.), silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Val.), and bighead carp, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis (Richardson) and then their removal in an effort to control macrophytes and phytoplankton. Recently, pilot stocking with predatory fish, particularly pike, Esox lucius L., has also been conducted. Hence, an examination of the long-term response patterns of phytoplankton to multiple fish-induced stressors was undertaken. In recent years, Chara domination (2000-2004) has helped to stabilize a clear-water state, high/good ecological status, and meso-eutrophic conditions. After the disappearance of Charales in 2004, the rapid, unstable changes in phytoplankton biomass, structure, and biodiversity suggested a shift toward a turbid-water state. As a result, the phytoplankton assemblages changed from those dominated by cryptophytes Y+X2+X1+LO (2000-2004) through those dominated by cyanobacteria K (2005-2008), dinoflagellates LO+Y (2009-2011), and cryptophytes Y+LO+F+X2 (2012), to those dominated by diatoms D+K+P+A (2013-2014) with representative taxa that occur in nutrient-rich and/or nutrient-poor water bodies. The 1967-2014 changes indicated that four periods, two with clear-water state and two with turbid-water state, alternately, one after the other, resulted from different fish pressure. Higher autochthonous fish biomass was usually accompanied by lower phytoplankton biomass. In contrast, the introduction of Cyprinidae fish had a stimulating effect on summer phytoplankton dominated by cyanobateria. Among the nutrients, only phosphorus played an important role.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aChara 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aCyanobacteria 3aCyprinus carpio 3aEsox lucius 3aHypophthalmichthys molitrix 3aHypophthalmichthys nobilis 3aMiozoa 3abiodiversity 3abiomass 3alakes 3amacrophytes 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aphytoplankton 3apike 3apredatory fish 3asummer 3asurface water 0aalternative stable states 0adomination shifts 0abiomass 0acyanobacteria 0aautochthonous fish 0aintroduced fish0 tArchiwum rybactwa polskiego =.g2017 Dec. 1, v. 25, no. 4 p.211-262dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:2133x2083-61397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/aopf-2017-00203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02071naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245006500167300001400232520109400246592002801340650001901368650002101387650001501408650001101423651001301434653001501447653001201462653001701474653001601491653001301507773012501520856007901645852000901724655001201733IND60593645220221116154724.0180620e20171127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059364522DNAL7 a10.1515/aree-2017-00062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLazíková, Zuzana10aDevelopment of Incomes and Expenditures in Slovak Households  ap. 37-44.  aThe household income is one of the basic indicators of the human living standard in the countries or their regions. The indicator of income is very closely connected to the indicator of expenditures, which completes the view of the living standard of households. During the last two decades, there were some important events that have influenced the development of household incomes and expenditures in Slovakia, such as accession of the Slovak Republic into the EU, adoption of the common currency euro or economic crisis as well. In the last years, the net incomes as well as the net expenditures of the Slovak households have increased. According to the results, this trend will continue; however, the net expenditures will increase faster than the net incomes of households. Therefore, we can expect that the savings rate will decrease. On the other hand, the differences of net household income and expenditures among the regions of Slovakia were not eliminated. There is still a high difference of the net household income mainly between the Bratislava region and the Prešov region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3ahousehold income 3ahouseholds 3ahumans 3aSlovakia 0ahouseholds 0aincomes 0aexpenditures 0adevelopment 0aforecast0 tActa regionalia et environmentalica.g2017 Nov. 27, v. 14, no. 2 p.37-44dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:6155x1336-92537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/aree-2017-00063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005700140245015100197500001900348500002000367520141100387592002801798596007501826596004501901650002701946650001601973650001401989650001702003650001602020650002202036650002102058650004302079650001002122650002102132650002102153650001202174650001302186700001502199700001402214700001602228700001702244700001802261700001402279700001602293773012802309856007402437852000902511655001202520IND60717625120221118192224.0201114e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071762512DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.134682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Mingliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6201-223214aThe beneficial effect of oyster peptides and oyster powder on cyclophosphamide‐induced reproductive impairment in male rats: A comparative study  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study aimed to evaluate the effect of oyster peptides and oyster powder on the procreative capacity of rats displaying reproductive dysfunction induced by cyclophosphamide (CTX). The amino acid composition and relative molecular mass of the oyster peptides and oyster powder were detected using an automatic amino acid analyzer and high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). After 5 d of exposure to CTX and six weeks of oyster peptide and oyster powder treatment, the biochemical serum indexes of the rats, the expression of related genes and proteins in the testes, as well as the antioxidant status and pathological state of the testes and kidneys were examined. The results showed that oyster peptides could effectively improve the biochemical blood indexes of rats, and increase the level of androgen in the blood, while improving the pathological state and oxidative stress state of the kidneys and testes, therefore, exhibiting a beneficial effect on reproductive injury. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study examined the activity of oyster peptides and their ability to enhance the procreative capacity of rats with reproductive dysfunction induced by CTX while analyzing the amino acid composition and relative molecular mass of the oyster peptides. The results of this experiment provided a preliminary theoretical basis for the development of new functional foods using oyster peptides.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0400604cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a2016YFD0400604cResearch and Development 3aamino acid composition 3aamino acids 3aandrogens 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3acomparative study 3acyclophosphamide 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amales 3amolecular weight 3aoxidative stress 3aoysters 3apeptides1 aZhou, Ming1 aWei, Ying1 aJia, Fuhuai1 aYan, Yongqiu1 aZhang, Ruixue1 aCai, Muyi1 aGu, Ruizeng0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2020 Nov., v. 44, no. 11 p.e13468-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.134683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245010600161300001400267520114500281592002801426650002201454650002501476650001301501650001001514651001301524653002301537653003301560653002201593653002101615700002101636700002501657773012501682856007901807852000901886655001201895IND60593645320221116154729.0180620e20171127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059364532DNAL7 a10.1515/aree-2017-00072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaduš, Ján14aThe Cultivation of Fast-Growing Trees on Agricultural Land in Slovakia and Czechia : Legal Comparison  ap. 45-51.  aThe paper analyses the legal regulation of the cultivation of fast-growing trees on agricultural land in Slovakia and Czechia. The focus is on the differences in the legislation of the two countries, the application of the regulations of cultivation of fast-growing trees in practice, the level of protection of agricultural land, and the support system for the cultivation of fast-growing trees. Comparison of national legislation dealing with the issue of planting fast-growing trees, taking into consideration the protection of agricultural land and the legislation on granting the state support has also been investigated in the context of European legislation. The procedure before the start of planting, the permission conditions for planting of fast-growing trees, the conditions and the process of support provision have been studied. The result of the documents analysis is a comprehensive comparative overview of the above-mentioned areas of legislation on the cultivation of fast-growing trees in Slovakia and Czechia and the identification of differences, benefits and practical impacts on the cultivation of fast-growing trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3alaws and regulations 3aplanting 3atrees 3aSlovakia 0afast-growing trees 0aagricultural land protection 0aagricultural land 0alegal regulation1 aMelišková, Ina1 aRoháčiková, Oľga0 tActa regionalia et environmentalica.g2017 Nov. 27, v. 14, no. 2 p.45-51dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:6155x1336-92537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/aree-2017-00073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03385naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001300156245015000169300001600319520146800335592002801803650001401831650002501845650001001870650002401880650001101904650001401915650002101929650001301950650002101963650001001984650001001994650005202004650004502056650002102101650005002122650002002172650001102192650002102203650005702224650002502281650002102306650001302327650002402340650002402364650006402388700001902452700001402471700001302485700001702498700001602515700001602531700001402547700001702561773013202578856004002710852000902750655001202759IND4468467820221120231144.0120727e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446846782DNAL7 a218151562pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.45482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wan10aComparative proteome analysis of glutenin synthesis and accumulation in developing grains between superior and poor quality bread wheat cultivars  ap. 106-115.  aBACKGROUND: Wheat glutenins are the major determinants of wheat quality. In this study, grains at the development stage from three wheat cultivars (Jimai 20, Jin 411 and Zhoumai 16) with different bread‐making quality were harvested based on thermal times from 150 °Cd to 750 °Cd, and were used to investigate glutenin accumulation patterns and their relationships with wheat quality. RESULTS: High and low molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW‐GSs and LMW‐GSs) were synthesised concurrently. No obvious correlations between HMW/LMW glutenin ratios and dough property were observed. Accumulation levels of HMW‐GSs and LMW‐GSs as well as 1Bx13 + 1By16 and 1Dx4 + 1Dy12 subunits were higher in superior gluten quality cultivar Jimain 20 than in poor quality cultivar Jing 411 and Zhoumai 16. According to the results of two‐dimensional gel electrophoresis, six types of accumulation patterns in LMW‐GSs were identified and classified. The possible relationships between individual LMW‐GSs and gluten quality were established. CONCLUSION: The high accumulation level of HMW‐GSs and LMW‐GSs as well as 1Bx13 + 1By16 and 1Dx4 + 1Dy12 subunits contributed to the superior gluten quality of Jimai 20. Two highly expressed and 16 specifically expressed LMW glutenin subunits in Jimain 20 had positive effects on dough quality, while 17 specifically expressed subunits in Zhoumai 16 and Jing 411 appeared to have negative effects on gluten quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3adevelopmental stages 3adough 3agel electrophoresis 3agluten 3aglutenins 3amolecular weight 3aproteome 3aseed development 3awheat 2aBread 2aEdible Grainxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aDietary Proteinsxmetabolismxstandards. 2aFlourxstandards 2aGlutensxbiosynthesisxmetabolismxstandards. 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aMolecular Weight 2aPlant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxmetabolismxstandards. 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aProtein Subunits 2aProteome 2aProteomicsxmethods 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTriticumxclassificationxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aZhang, Yanzhen1 aGao, Xuan1 aWang, Ke1 aWang, Shunli1 aZhang, Yong1 aHe, Zhonghu1 aMa, Wujun1 aYan, Yueming0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 92, no. 1 p.106-115dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.4548  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001900176245009200195300001500287520124400302592002801546650001301574650001901587650002401606650002801630650001501658650001101673650002101684650001401705650001101719650002301730650001301753650001701766650001801783650002101801650001901822650001501841700002101856700002001877700002101897700002101918773015101939856006902090856010102159990002302260852000902283655001202292IND60643418120221118085035.0190510e20130227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064341812DNAL7 a10.3791/502972doi7 aPMC36221082pmcid7 a234860762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGondoni, Paolo10aFabrication of nano-engineered transparent conducting oxides by pulsed laser deposition  ap. e50297.  aNanosecond Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) in the presence of a background gas allows the deposition of metal oxides with tunable morphology, structure, density and stoichiometry by a proper control of the plasma plume expansion dynamics. Such versatility can be exploited to produce nanostructured films from compact and dense to nanoporous characterized by a hierarchical assembly of nano-sized clusters. In particular we describe the detailed methodology to fabricate two types of Al-doped ZnO (AZO) films as transparent electrodes in photovoltaic devices: 1) at low O2 pressure, compact films with electrical conductivity and optical transparency close to the state of the art transparent conducting oxides (TCO) can be deposited at room temperature, to be compatible with thermally sensitive materials such as polymers used in organic photovoltaics (OPVs); 2) highly light scattering hierarchical structures resembling a forest of nano-trees are produced at higher pressures. Such structures show high Haze factor (>80%) and may be exploited to enhance the light trapping capability. The method here described for AZO films can be applied to other metal oxides relevant for technological applications such as TiO2, Al2O3, WO3 and Ag4O4.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3aambient temperature 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrodes 3alasers 3alight scattering 3ananopores 3aoxygen 3aphotovoltaic cells 3apolymers 3asolar energy 3astoichiometry 3atitanium dioxide 3atungsten oxide 3azinc oxide1 aGhidelli, Matteo1 aDi Fonzo, Fabio1 aLi Bassi, Andrea1 aCasari, Carlo S.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2013 Feb. 27, , no. 72 p.e50297-e50297dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/502973Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/50297/fabrication-nano-engineered-transparent-conducting-oxides-pulsed  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010400168520139100272592002801663650002601691650002401717650002401741650001701765650002001782650002501802650001501827650001201842650001201854650001101866651001301877653002301890653002101913653001601934653002501950653001501975653001701990700001602007773010202023856008702125852000902212655001202221IND60770829920221119133938.0220509e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077082992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2022.1074022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Feroz10aMoving towards a sustainable circular bio-economy in the agriculture sector of a developing country  aTo achieve higher standards of sustainability, Pakistan has to shift towards the adoption of the Circular Bio-Economy (CBE) approach in its agriculture sector. However, to aid this transition, the determination of a sustainable waste management technology and supporting strategies is very essential. For this purpose, a hybrid methodology based on fuzzy Strength, Weakness, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) and fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is developed. The fuzzy approach used in both the cases is to address any sort of ambiguity during the decision-making process. From the fuzzy SWOT analysis, the decision-makers allocated the most importance to the “ease of adoption” criteria, among the list of internal factors. Whereas, from the list of external factors, the most importance was allocated to the “price competitiveness with respect to fossil feedstock” criteria. Also, composting and anaerobic digestion are considered to be the most sustainable technologies for valorizing the agricultural waste of Pakistan. However, composting showcases more opportunities for its adoption as compared to anaerobic digestion. Whereas, results from fuzzy TOPSIS suggest the provision of financial support to both the local farmers and investors to be the top-ranked strategy for the successful implementation of the CBE approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aagricultural wastes 3aanaerobic digestion 3abioeconomics 3adecision making 3aecological economics 3afeedstocks 3afossils 3afunding 3aprices 3aPakistan 0aDeveloping country 0aWaste management 0aAgriculture 0aCircular bio-economy 0aFuzzy SWOT 0aFuzzy TOPSIS1 aAli, Yousaf0 tEcological economics.g2022 June, v. 196 p.107402-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2022.1074023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01960naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245012000161300001600281520091400297592002801211653003001239653002001269653001601289653001301305653001901318653001501337700001701352700001701369700001601386700001701402773011301419856008101532852000901613655001201622IND60516628520221120150003.0160326e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051662852DNAL7 a10.1017/S09502688130012712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMU, J.-J.14aThe occurrence of melioidosis is related to different climatic conditions in distinct topographical areas of Taiwan  ap. 415-423.  aThis study assessed the correlations between the incidence of melioidosis and rainfall, wind strength and wind direction in both the flat and hilly regions of Taiwan.

With the inclusion of a lag time accounting for a possible incubation period for melioidosis, the daily rainfall and wind-speed data were correlated with the number of confirmed melioidosis cases. The incidence of melioidosis in the flat region was related to the wind speed (>19 m/s) and the specific angle (150°, 220°, 280°) of the wind direction. Rainfall is a common environmental factor that contributes to an increase in the incidence of melioidosis in both areas; however, the contribution of wind strength or wind direction to the spread of melioidosis was restricted to areas with specific topographical characteristics, such as hills.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBurkholderia pseudomallei 0aextreme climate 0amelioidosis 0arainfall 0awind direction 0awind speed1 aCHENG, P.-Y.1 aChen, Y.

In this paper, a 3D urchin-like Ti₀.₈Sn₀.₂O₂–rGO hybrid nanostructure was successfully fabricated by a one-step hydrothermal process based on the coordination principle and molecular self-assembly theory. This novel graphene-supported Ti₀.₈Sn₀.₂O₂ solid solution material efficiently combined the mechanical stability of TiO₂ and high capacity of SnO₂, leading to excellent electrochemical activity and superior cycling stability. High specific capacities of about 430 mA h g⁻¹ at a current density of 0.5 A g⁻¹ and 400 mA h g⁻¹ after 500 cycles at 1 A g⁻¹ with an efficiency of nearly 100% were achieved. This strategy could be applied to develop novel structures as electrode materials with facile synthesis, low cost, and high performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3aelectrochemistry 3alithium batteries 3ananomaterials 3atin dioxide 3atitanium dioxide1 aLi, Dan1 aGao, Chengwei1 aLiu, Yushan1 aZhang, Jianmin0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 May 3, v. 5, no. 17 p.8087-8094dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta01211j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005400094040001800148100003500166245010800201300001600309506002800325520148400353592002801837506003701865650002401902650002401926650001201950650001601962650001801978650000901996650001402005650001602019650001802035650001502053650001002068650002302078650003102101650002602132650002102158650002402179650001402203650001002217651000902227653001002236653001202246653002102258653001602279653001602295653001902311653001402330653001402344653001502358700002902373700002902402773011102431856010102542852000902643655001202652IND60773791520221207092249.0201005e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077379152DNAL7 ahttp://dx.doi.org/10.7770/safer-V0N0-art20422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVictoria, Ailenokhuoria Bukola10aPhysicochemical comsposition of Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) seed under different storage temperature  ap. 229-242.  aResource is Open Access  aKenaf is an annual plant grown for its fibre which basically depend on the seed viability, for its maximum growth and production. The seed viability and vigor in turn depend on storage condition. There is insufficient information on physicochemical composition of kenaf seed in relation to seed viability. The present study was performed to know the physicochemical composition of the kenaf seed at different storage temperature in other to improve upon rapid loss of seed viability in kenaf. Four varieties of kenaf seed were obtained from I.A.R. & T seed unit. The seeds were stored at 00C (Unviable seed), 2.20C (Lower temperature), 350C (Ambient temperature), 280C (Cold room temperature which serve as control) for period of 8 months. Seed germination test and weight was performed before and after the experiment. Proximate analysis (Crude protein, Moisture, Carbohydrate, Ash, Crude fibre, Crude fat) and Phytochemicals (Total phenolics, Steroid and Total Flavonoids were also determined). The result shows that there is significant difference in all the parameters studied, for all the storage temperatures as compared with the control (280C) among the varieties except from ifeken 100 where the was no significant difference in Crude fibre and Ash content for seed under ambient temperature as compared with the control.

Two experiments were conducted to compare the energy partitioning and evapotranspiration of hot pepper (Capsicum annum L.) between furrow and drip irrigation methods under two adjacent solar greenhouses in northwest China. Results indicate that irrigation method affected the energy partitioning and evapotranspiration of hot pepper plants and these results were corroborated in a greenhouse study. Compared to drip irrigation, furrow irrigation increased daytime average net radiation (Rₙ), latent (λET) and sensible (H) heat fluxes by 12–29, 37–53 and 9–23%, respectively, but decreased soil heat flux (G) by 7–19%. Furrow irrigation also resulted in higher λET/Rₙ and lower H/Rₙ and G/Rₙ and increased total evapotranspiration by 55.5% and produced a higher crop coefficient. Total evapotranspiration was 562.3 and 361.6mm over whole growth stage for furrow and drip irrigation methods, respectively. And drip irrigation increased the total yield and water use efficiency by 18.2 and 80.4%, respectively, before late fruit bearing and harvesting stage. In conclusion, drip irrigation is an effective and water-saving irrigation method in hot pepper production to be used in greenhouse.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3acrop coefficient 3adevelopmental stages 3aenergy 3aenergy crops 3aevapotranspiration 3afruits 3afurrow irrigation 3agreenhouse production 3agreenhouses 3aheat transfer 3ahot peppers 3airrigation scheduling 3amicroirrigation 3anitrogen content 3asoil 3awater use efficiency 3awildlife management 3aChina1 aKang, Shaozhong1 aLi, Fusheng1 aDu, Taisheng1 aTong, Ling1 aWang, Feng1 aChen, Renqiang1 aLiu, Junqi1 aLi, Sien0 tScientia horticulturae.g2011 July 27, v. 129, no. 4 p.790-797dElsevier B.V.x0304-42387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2011.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245009600206300001600302520110700318592002801425653002201453653001401475653002301489653001401512653003901526700001701565700001901582700001801601700001601619700001501635700001801650773011301668856008101781852000901862655001201871IND60516628620221120145920.0160326e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051662862DNAL7 a10.1017/S09502688130010272doi7 aPMC39157542pmcid7 a237593672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrice, M.

We developed two independent estimates of CT incidence in women in England: one based on an incidence study, with estimates ‘recalibrated’ to the general population using data on setting-specific relative risks, and allowing for clearance and re-infection during follow-up; the second based on UK prevalence data, and information on the duration of CT infection. The consistency of independent sources of data on incidence, prevalence and duration, validates estimates of these parameters. Pooled estimates of the annual incidence rate in women aged 16–24 and 16–44 years for 2001–2005 using all these data were 0·05 [95% credible interval (CrI) 0·035–0·071] and 0·021 (95% CrI 0·015–0·028), respectively. Although, the estimates apply to England, similar methods could be used in other countries. The methods could be extended to dynamic models to synthesize, and assess the consistency of data on contact and transmission rates.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBayesian analysis 0aChlamydia 0aevidence synthesis 0aincidence 0amulti-parameter evidence synthesis1 aAdes, A.

In the current study we identified the tac3 gene in a representative species of Pleuronectiformes, the half-smooth tongue sole. The full-length cDNA sequence of tongue sole tac3 was 742 base pairs (bp) in length with an open reading frame of 372 bp that encoded a 123-amino acids preprohormone. The TAC3 precursor contained NKB and an additional peptide NKB-related peptide (NKBRP), both of which had an –FVGLM motif at the C-termini. Tissue distribution analysis indicated that tac3 transcripts were highly expressed in the brain, intestine and gonads of both sexes, and to a lesser extent in other tissues. Among various brain regions, tac3 transcripts were most abundant in the hypothalamus. In addition, the expression profiles of tac3 mRNA were also evaluated along the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis during tongue sole ovarian maturation. The brain tac3 mRNA levels remained unchanged, however, in both pituitary and ovary, the mRNA expression of tac3 increased significantly to the maximal levels at stage III and then declined back to basal levels. Taken together, our results encompass the first study reporting the existence of tac3 gene in a flatfish species and suggest its possible involvement in the control of reproduction in the half-smooth tongue sole.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCynoglossus semilaevis 3aCypriniformes 3aPerciformes 3aaquaculture 3afish 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahypothalamus 3aintestines 3apeptides 3atissue distribution 0atac3 0aNKB 0aNKBRP 0aOvarian maturation 0aFlatfish1 aCui, Aijun1 aZhang, Yaxing1 aXu, Yongjiang1 aWang, Weixin1 aJiang, Yan1 aLiu, Xuezhou0 tAquaculture reports.g2021 July, v. 20 p.100651-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.1006513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03573naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245017500162300001800337520161700355592002801972650002402000650001102024650001902035650001602054650001502070650003802085650001202123650000902135650001902144650001702163650002002180650002102200650002102221650002202242650001802264650001002282650001402292650001702306650001402323650002202337650002202359650001402381653002402395653002102419653002102440653001902461653002202480700001402502700005302516700001402569700001502583700001702598700002002615700001202635700001702647700005402664773011402718856008202832852000902914655001202923IND60629338420221116225740.0190411e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062933842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2018.12.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Han10aSex-biased regulation of respiratory burst, phagocytic activity and plasma immune factors in lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus) after subchronic benzo[a]pyrene exposure  ap. 1162-1168.  aBoth wild and aquacultured seahorses are currently under great threat from marine pollution, notably from the potent contaminant and carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BaP). However, very little data are available regarding the immunomodulating effects of BaP in seahorses. Therefore, in this study, we exposed lined seahorses (Hippocampus erectus) for 7 d to BaP at three dosages (0.5, 5, and 50 μg/L) to evaluate sexual dimorphism in immune response. We measured eight immune parameters in the blood, including respiratory burst (RB), phagocytic activity (PA), monocytes/leucocytes, immunoglobulin M, complement 3, complement, interferon-a, and interleukin-2. Male seahorses had significantly higher parameters than females, except in terms of monocytes/leucocytes (P < 0.05). Although flow cytometry showed that RB and PA variation per BaP dose were roughly similar across sexes, RB and PA exhibited distinct patterns. Additionally, fluorescence intensity and leucocyte percentage were positively correlated in PA but not RB for all treatment and sex combinations. Through ELISA, we showed that the other six parameters had complex responses that nevertheless varied in a BaP-dosage and sex-dependent manner. Overall, adult male seahorses had higher immunocompetence than females before BaP exposure, and sexual dimorphism continued to be apparent during BaP exposure. Furthermore, all eight parameters were sensitive to BaP. Based on these results, we highly recommend H. erectus as a sentinel species for crude contamination, whereas PA and RB are valuable bioindicators of marine contaminants such as BaP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHippocampus erectus 3aadults 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3acarcinogens 3acomplement 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afemales 3afish 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3aimmune response 3aimmunocompetence 3aimmunoglobulin M 3aindicator species 3ainterleukin-2 3amales 3amonocytes 3aphagocytosis 3apollution 3arespiratory burst 3asexual dimorphism 3ashellfish 0aHippocampus erectus 0aImmunocompetence 0aMarine pollution 0abenzo[a]pyrene 0aSexual dimorphism1 aWang, Kai1 aFang, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4526-76441 aChen, Jun1 aLi, Yanmin1 aXia, Guangbo1 aZhang, Yingfeng1 aLiu, Yu1 aRen, Chuanbo1 aLin, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6031-22470 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2019 Mar., v. 86 p.1162-1168dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2018.12.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245013000160300001600290520171100306536011902017592002802136650002102164650002002185650001002205650001902215650002302234650001302257650001302270650000902283650001902292650001802311650001702329650001502346650001402361650001802375650004402393653002302437653003102460653001302491653001502504700002002519700001402539773010602553856008002659852000902739655001202748IND60614952220221122221024.0181003e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061495222DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858103634842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVogel, P.10aSpontaneous Acute Tumor Lysis Syndrome as a Cause of Early Deaths in Short-Term Carcinogenicity Studies Using p53⁺/– Mice  ap. 719-724.  aAcute tumor lysis syndrome (ATLS) is a potentially lethal condition precipitated by the massive release of intracellular components such as nucleic acids, potassium, and phosphorus, following a rapid and widespread lysis of tumor cells. Herein, the authors describe the high incidence and characteristic histopathologic lesions of acute ATLS in p53-deficient mice used in 2 short-term carcinogenicity studies. ATLS was a frequent cause of early death in p53 ⁺/– mice in these studies and was consistently associated with the presence of disseminated lymphoma and leukemia. Although a heavy tumor burden and leukemia were present in all affected mice, the absence of ATLS in other mice with equally severe lymphoma and leukemia indicates that these tumor burdens are necessary but insufficient to cause ATLS in mice. The hallmark histopathologic findings of ATLS in mice are the disseminated microemboli composed of nuclear and cytoplasmic debris derived from lysed tumor cells. The mechanical obstruction of capillary beds by these microemboli appeared to be the proximate cause of the early deaths of mice in these studies. Microemboli may contribute to the pathogenesis of acute renal failure and other clinical signs associated with ATLS in other species. Recognition of ATLS in laboratory animals is critical in studies intended to evaluate the efficacy and/or toxicity of anticancer treatments, where early deaths due to ATLS might otherwise be attributed to test article toxicity. Further studies on the role of microemboli in the pathogenesis of ATLS may elucidate pathogenetic mechanisms and lead to improved approaches to clinical management and treatment of this potentially lethal condition.  aThe authors declared that they received no financial support for their research and/or authorship of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal pathology 3acarcinogenicity 3adeath 3ahistopathology 3alaboratory animals 3aleukemia 3alymphoma 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3anucleic acids 3apathogenesis 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3arenal failure 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 0ap53-knockout mouse 0aacute tumor lysis syndrome 0alymphoma 0aDNA emboli1 aPletcher, J.

Due to many reasons i.e. climate changes, several dam constructions, building a bridge across the Lake, extra agricultural consumption and improper management of water resources, the water level of the lake has been decreased since 1997 and thousand hectares of emerged salty land has made numerous ecological and environmental problems. Therefore, an accurate forecast of the entrance runoff to the lake is important in managing the river flow and water transfer within basins. There are various methods for time-series based forecasting; in the presented study Feed-forward Neural Network and Autocorrelation Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were applied to forecast the monthly rainfall in Urmia lake basin. The results showed that the estimated values of monthly rainfall through Feed-forward NN were close to ARIMA model with coefficient of correlation 0.62 and the root mean square error of 12.43mm over the 6 years test period; then rainfall amount were predicted for a 6-year period starting from 2012 (2012–2017). Using the runoff coefficient regime which was calculated from parallel data of rainfall over the basin and resulted runoff for the period of 39 years, the future runoff were obtained through predicted rainfall over that period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3abasins 3aclimate change 3amodels 3arain 3ariver flow 3arunoff 3asalt lakes 3atime series analysis 3awater management 3awatersheds 3aIran 0aTime series forecasting 0aFeed-forward neural network 0aARIMA model 0aFlow coefficient regime 0aUrmia lake basin1 aFakheri Fard, Ahmad1 aLotfi, Saeed0 tWater resources and industry.g2014 Sept., v. 7-8 p.38-48dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23294x2212-37177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wri.2014.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006100149245014200210300001600352520138600368592002801754650001701782650002101799650001601820650001301836650003901849650001001888650002301898650001401921650002501935650001401960650001801974650001401992650002202006653000802028653000802036653000802044653000702052653000702059653001402066653000802080653000802088653001202096653001202108653000802120653000902128653001102137653004202148653005502190653001902245653002302264700002302287700002302310700001402333700003602347700001802383700002402401773012602425856008402551852000902635655001202644IND60564659520221119041405.0190405e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056465952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.syapm.2016.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKleindienst, Sara1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8304-914910a‘Candidatus Dichloromethanomonas elyunquensis’ gen. nov., sp. nov., a dichloromethane-degrading anaerobe of the Peptococcaceae family  ap. 150-159.  aTaxonomic assignments of anaerobic dichloromethane (DCM)-degrading bacteria remain poorly constrained but are important for understanding the microbial diversity of organisms contributing to DCM turnover in environmental systems. We describe the taxonomic classification of a novel DCM degrader in consortium RM obtained from pristine Rio Mameyes sediment. Phylogenetic analysis of full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences demonstrated that the DCM degrader was most closely related to members of the genera Dehalobacter and Syntrophobotulus, but sequence similarities did not exceed 94% and 93%, respectively. Genome-aggregate average amino acid identities against Peptococcaceae members did not exceed 66%, suggesting that the DCM degrader does not affiliate with any described genus. Phylogenetic analysis of conserved single-copy functional genes supported that the DCM degrader represents a novel clade. Growth strictly depended on the presence of DCM, which was consumed at a rate of 160±3μmolL−1 d−1. The DCM degrader attained 5.25×107±1.0×107 cells per μmol DCM consumed. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed rod-shaped cells 4±0.8μm long and 0.4±0.1μm wide. Based on the unique phylogenetic, genomic, and physiological characteristics, we propose that the DCM degrader represents a new genus and species, ‘Candidatus Dichloromethanomonas elyunquensis’.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDehalobacter 3aSyntrophobotulus 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenes 3amethylene chloride 3anew genus 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asediments 3asequence homology 0aDCM 0aANI 0aAAI 0aCM 0aCF 0a1,1,1-TCA 0aPCE 0aTCE 0a1,1-DCA 0a1,2-DCE 0aBES 0aFISH 0aRDases 0aAnaerobic dichloromethane degradation 0a‘Candidatus Dichloromethanomonas elyunquensis’ 0aPeptococcaceae 0aMetagenome binning1 aHiggins, Steven A.1 aTsementzi, Despina1 aChen, Gao1 aKonstantinidis, Konstantinos T.1 aMack, E.

Indeed, societies which appear at first glance to be flourishing may in fact be hiding a deep-seated fragility. This phenomenon is illustrated by the results of an archaeological dig in La Graufesenque, an ancient Roman city located in the south of France, which suffered a sudden and brutal demise following years of economic prosperity built on its ceramics trade. In our study, we develop a model to show how forest exploitation at the time can go a good way to explaining this collapse. We combine different data from archaeology, history and economics to show how the case of La Graufesenque allows us to better understand the dynamics of our modern world, which is also faced with dwindling reserves of certain natural resources.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarchaeology 3aecological economics 3aforests 3anonrenewable resources 3atrade 3aFrance 0aRoman 0aArcheology 0aExhaustible 0aResources 0aForest 0aHotelling0 tEcological economics.g2022 June, v. 196 p.107412-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2022.1074123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245010100164300001600265506002800281520146600309592002801775506003701803650001101840650001601851650001401867650001101881650001301892650001101905650001701916650001001933650001801943651001401961653003301975653001102008653003402019700001902053700001902072773013502091856008002226852000902306655001202315IND60773791820221207082946.0161129e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077379182DNAL7 a10.18343/jipi.21.2.104	2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarianto, Deni10aDampak pertambangan nikel terhadap daerah penangkapan ikan di perairan kabupaten halmahera timur  ap. 104-113.  aResource is Open Access  aEast Halmahera District is one of the mining central areas Nickel in North Moluccas. This mining had a great impact on water quality changes. The aims of this study were to determine the content of Suspended Particulate Matter in East Halmahera waters, determine the water quality level, and determine fishing ground degradation level. The results showed the suspended solids in East Halmahera waters were above NAB, which had been set by Ministry of Environment those were less than 25 mg/l. While the average of SPM content in East Halmahera waters were above 25 mg/l except Wasile. The content of nickel in waters were known under NAB, but it had approached the NAB value which it means nickel had impacted the waters. Water quality changes had given impact to the fish degradation in waters, which the fish were captured by lift netwere classified in ilegal size (IS), that Stolephorus spp 62%, Loligo spp 67%. The number of IS for anchovy and squid were caused by lift net operation which were located near the coastal area where this area has been pressed by mining activities. This condition did not happen on purse seine and gillnet which legal size (LS) of Decaptrus spp 96% and Rastrilliger spp 90%. It was caused by fishing gear which operated far from coastal area. Based on the analysis, can be concluded that the mines Ni has a considerable effect on the degradation of water quality and reduction in size of a decent fish caught mainly lift nets.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLoligo 3aStolephorus 3aanchovies 3acoasts 3agillnets 3anickel 3aparticulates 3asquid 3awater quality 3aIndonesia 0asuspended particulate matter 0anickel 0alength at first maturity (LM)1 aSimbolon, Domu1 aWiryawan, Budi0 tJurnal Ilmu Pertanian Indonesia.g2016 Aug., v. 21, no. 2 p.104-113dBogor Agricultural UniversitywJournal:27739x2443-34627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18343/jipi.21.2.104	3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02086naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245012100204300001800325520077500343592002801118650002301146650005201169650001301221650002401234650002301258650002201281650002101303650001601324650001401340700006901354700001901423700006001442773013301502856008001635852000901715655001201724IND60770543220221119202417.0220318e20220228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077054322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.1c022372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoghimi, Parvin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5583-211710aPyrido[1,2-e]purine: Design and Synthesis of Appropriate Inhibitory Candidates against the Main Protease of COVID-19  ap. 3922-3933.  aA series of tricyclic and polycyclic pyrido[1,2-e]purine derivatives were designed and synthesized via a two-step, one-pot reaction of 2,4-dichloro-5-amino-6-methylpyrimidine with pyridine under reflux conditions. Various derivatives of pyrido[1,2-e]purine were also synthesized by substituting the chlorine atom with secondary amines.

The in silico results revealed that among all of the studied compounds, the morpholine/piperidine-substituted pyrido[1,2-e]purine derivatives are the best candidates as effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3achlorine 3acomputer simulation 3amolecular dynamics 3aorganic chemistry 3apharmacokinetics 3aproteinases 3apyridines1 aSabet-Sarvestani, Hossein1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5461-28681 aKohandel, Omid1 aShīrī, ʻAlī,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5736-62870 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2022 Feb. 28, v. 87, no. 6 p.3922-3933dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.1c022373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02473naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245009600178300001800274520143600292592002801728650001401756650001901770650000801789650001301797650001001810650001901820650001601839700001301855700001801868700001701886773009901903856008902002990002302091852000902114655001202123IND60098675420221116145253.0141105e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009867542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.07.20002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamplaski, Mary K.10aFinasteride use in the male infertility population: effects on semen and hormone parameters  ap. 1542-1546.  aOBJECTIVE: To determine the degree of improvement in semen parameters after finasteride discontinuation. DESIGN: A prospective database of men presenting for a fertility evaluation was analyzed for semen and hormone parameters before and after discontinuation of finasteride. SETTING: A male infertility specialty clinic. PATIENT(S): Men presenting for fertility evaluation from 2008–2012 on finasteride. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Semen and hormone parameters before and after discontinuation of finasteride. RESULT(S): At presentation, 27 (0.6%) of 4,400 men on finasteride. The mean duration of treatment with finasteride was 57.4 months, and mean dose was 1.04 mg/day. There was an average 11.6-fold increase in sperm counts after finasteride discontinuation. Of the men with severe oligospermia (<5 M/mL), 57% had counts increase to >15 M/mL after finasteride cessation. No man had a decrease in sperm count. There was no change in hormone parameters, sperm motility, or sperm morphology. CONCLUSION(S): Finasteride, even at low doses, may cause reduced sperm counts in some men. In this population, counts improved dramatically for the majority of men after finasteride discontinuation. The hormone parameters, sperm motility, and sperm morphology were unchanged after cessation. Finasteride should be discontinued in subfertile men with oligospermia, and used with caution in men who desire fertility.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3amale fertility 3amen 3apatients 3asemen 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa1 aLo, Kirk1 aGrober, Ethan1 aJarvi, Keith0 tFertility and sterility.g2013 Dec., v. 100, no. 6 p.1542-1546dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.07.20003Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03384naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245011700172300001600289520132000305592002801625650002501653650002401678650002701702650002901729650002801758650002201786650002801808650001201836650002901848650002801877650001201905650001601917650001701933650000901950650002101959650004301980650001102023650001202034650002102046650001202067650006602079650002102145650003902166650001402205650001102219653001802230653002402248653002202272653002702294653002602321700001602347700006902363700003102432700001802463700006202481773011202543856008202655852000902737655001202746IND60629338620221116225051.0191227e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062933862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2018.12.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRubeena, Abdul Salam10aAntimicrobial and biochemical characterization of a C-type lectin isolated from pearl spot (Etroplus suratensis)  ap. 202-211.  aThe present study reveals purification and characterization of a C-type lectin from the serum of pearl spot, Etroplus suratensis (Es-Lec).

It was hypothesized that the presence of slowly digested pea starch in broiler diets will increase net energy and the efficiency of energy utilization in broilers. Two experiments were performed to investigate starch digestibility of pea at different incubation times (in vitro study) and the effect of dietary pea on heat increment and net energy in broilers using an open-circuit respiratory calorimetry system (in vivo study). One-day-old Ross 308 male broilers were fed a common starter crumble from d 1 to 10 and standard grower diets thereafter. At d 21, birds were transferred to the chambers each housing 2 birds. Each treatment was replicated 6 times with 2 identical runs of 3 replicates per treatment. A wheat-soybean meal-based diet was used as a control and the treatment diet contained 500 g of pea/kg pea. In vitro study showed that pellet processing increased (P < 0.001) starch digestibility, particularly at shorter times for wheat and a much larger response for pea. Birds offered the pea-based diet had lower (P = 0.002) feed intake, lower (P = 0.020) body weight gain, but a similar (P > 0.05) FCR compared to those offered the wheat-based diet. Net energy (NE) and apparent metabolizable energy (AME) values were higher in the pea-based diet than in the wheat-based diet (P = 0.037 for NE and P = 0.018 for AME). Heat production, respiratory quotient, heat increment of feed, efficiency of utilization of gross energy for AME, and efficiency of utilization of AME for NE did not differ (P > 0.05) between the 2 treatments. There was no effect (P > 0.05) of pea on the total tract digestibilities of dry matter, crude protein and ash, but the total tract digestibility of starch was higher (P = 0.022) in the pea-based diet compared to the wheat-based diet. This study provides insight into the energy metabolism of broilers offered a pea-based diet and indicates that dietary pea supplementation increases dietary AME and NE but has no effect on heat increment of feed and the efficiency of energy utilization in broilers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamylopectin 3abody weight changes 3acalorimetry 3acrude protein 3adigestibility 3adigestible carbohydrates 3aenergy metabolism 3afeed intake 3aheat production 3amales 3ametabolizable energy 3anitrogen 3apea starch 3apeas 3arespiratory quotient 3athermic effect of food 3awheat 0aSlowly digested starch 0aPea 0aHeat increment 0aNet energy 0aBroiler1 aBan, Zhibin1 aClassen, Hank L.1 aYang, Huaming1 aYan, Xiaogang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0234-69641 aChoct, Mingan1 aWu, Shu-Biao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1790-60150 tAnimal nutrition.g2021 June, v. 7, no. 2 p.506-511dElsevier B.V.aChinese Association of Animal Science and Veterinary MedicinewJournal:23216x2405-65457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aninu.2020.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010300167506011700270506007600387520137000463592002801833506003701861650002001898650001601918650002301934650002201957650001201979650001501991650001302006650002302019650002002042650001802062650002502080650001602105653001902121653002302140653001402163653001302177700001602190700001302206700001402219700001602233700001602249700001202265773010102277856008602378852000902464655001202473IND60776149120221207081815.0220704e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077614912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1089372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Xinlei10aComparison of two isotope-based methods used in determining forest evapotranspiration partitioning  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA comprehensive understanding of the changing patterns and the contribution of each component of the forest ecosystem to evapotranspiration is necessary for an accurate assessment of biological quality, terrestrial ecosystem production, energy exchange, and water use efficiency. In this study, two methods (i.e., the sap-flow and lysimeter methods) were used to partition evapotranspiration (ET) into evaporation(E) and transpiration(T) components using stable isotope techniques. The factors affecting the contribution of T to ET (FT) were evaluated. The results showed that FT presents seasonal variation patterns throughout the year. Both methods accurately simulated the ET partitioning and its seasonal variation. The ET value estimated by the sap-flow method was less than that estimated by the lysimeter method. In contrast, the simulated value of T calculated using the lysimeter method was higher than that calculated by the sap-flow method. However, this was within allowable limits. The lysimeter method is more accurate and suitable for monitoring forest ecosystem evapotranspiration in practical experiments. This study provides a technical reference for the optimal calculation method of ET partitioning using a stable isotope-based technique. It provides baseline information to better understand water vapour exchange in forest ecosystems in China.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aenergy transfer 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3alysimeters 3asap flow 3aseasonal variation 3astable isotopes 3atranspiration 3awater use efficiency 3awater vapor 0aStable isotope 0aEvapotranspiration 0aLysimeter 0aSap-flow1 aJia, Jianbo1 aChen, Yu1 aHu, Yuwen1 aWang, Yifan1 aWu, Ruiqiao1 aHu, Lei0 tEcological indicators.g2022 June, v. 139 p.108937-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1089373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245010100175300001400276520178200290592002802072650002002100650001402120650001002134650001202144650001402156650004302170650001702213650001902230650001202249650001802261650001202279650001802291650001602309700003002325700001602355700002702371773010402398856008302502990002302585852000902608655001202617IND60099184320221117030453.0141105e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009918432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygcen.2012.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWebster, Simon George10aBursicon and neuropeptide cascades during the ecdysis program of the shore crab, Carcinus maenas  ap. 54-64.  aVery little is known regarding the release patterns of neuropeptides involved in ecdysis of crustaceans compared to insects. In particular, the dynamics of release of the insect cuticle hardening hormone bursicon, which has only recently been discovered in crustaceans, is unknown. Bursicon has not previously been identified as a circulating neurohormone in these animals. Since patterns of release were likely to be ephemeral, bursicon, as well as two other neurohormones involved in the ecdysis program in crustaceans, crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) and crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone (CHH) were measured in single haemolymph samples in Carcinus maenas. For bursicon, an ultrasensitive time resolved-fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA) was developed, which firstly involved its characterisation by HPLC, bioassay and immunoassay. Simultaneous measurement of three neurohormones was performed at unparalleled levels of resolution, which has not previously been reported in any invertebrate. Additionally, expression patterns and architecture of neurones expressing both bursicon and CCAP were determined in the CNS during the moult cycle. Bursicon and CCAP are released in a massive surge, likely a single global exocytotic event on emergence, just after release of CHH. Despite co-localisation of CCAP and bursicon in neurones of the CNS, observations suggest that differential packaging of CCAP can occur in the pericardial organs in a small population of secretory boutons, thus accounting for observations showing release of some CCAP during the penultimate stages of the ecdysis program. The results obtained vividly illustrate the dynamism of neuropeptide cascades occurring during crustacean ecdysis, and also allow proposal of a hypothesis of its endocrine control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarcinus maenas 3abioassays 3acrabs 3aecdysis 3ahemolymph 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aimmunoassays 3ainsect cuticle 3ainsects 3aneurohormones 3aneurons 3aneuropeptides 3apericardium1 aWilcockson, David Charles1 aMrinalini, 1 aSharp, Jasmine Heloise0 tGeneral and comparative endocrinology.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 182 p.54-64dElsevier Inc.x0016-64807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2012.11.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04165naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006100149245010900210300001600319506011700335506007600452520220900528592002802737506003702765650003202802650001302834650001602847650001802863650001102881650002002892650001502912650002502927650001202952650001302964650005302977650001603030653003403046653001503080653002403095653002003119653002803139700005903167700006003226700002103286700002503307700005603332773016603388856008403554852000903638655001203647IND60729680020221207065054.0220815e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072968002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aninu.2020.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusigwa, Sosthene1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1089-078610aMulti-carbohydrase enzymes improve feed energy in broiler diets containing standard or low crude protein  ap. 496-505.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study evaluated the effect of multi-carbohydrase (MC) on energy and nitrogen (N) balance and gene expression in broilers fed diets with different crude protein (CP) contents. The study employed a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. The factors were presence or absence of MC, and standard (SCP) or low (LCP) dietary CP concentration. A 3-phase feeding program was used, including starter (0 to 7 d), grower (8 to 17 d) and finisher (18 to 28 d) phases. The study was undertaken in closed calorimetry chambers. Each of the 4 dietary treatments was replicated 8 times in total across 2 runs, with 2 birds per replicate (n = 64). Data for energy partitioning and N balance were collected from d 25 to 28. On d 28, birds were euthanized to collect muscle and intestinal tissue samples for gene expression. The results showed that the MC increased apparent metabolizable energy (AME, P < 0.01) and net energy (NE, P < 0.05), and reduced the feed conversion ratio (FCR, P < 0.01) in all diets. The proportion of energy retained as fat per total energy retention (REf/RE) was positively correlated with feed AME and NE (r = 0.541, P < 0.01 and r = 0.665, P < 0.001, respectively), suggesting that feed energy augmented with increased fat gain. Muscle ATP synthase subunit alpha (ATP5A1W) gene expression had a positive correlation with REf/RE and feed NE (r = 0.587, P < 0.001 and r = 0.430, P < 0.05, respectively). Similarly, muscle peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1A) expression was negatively correlated with weight gain and positively correlated with FCR (r = −0.451, P < 0.05 and r = 0.359, P < 0.05, respectively). These correlations show that over-expressions of muscle genes related to energy production reduce bird performance. This study demonstrated that MC increase dietary energy utilization, regardless of dietary CP concentration. However, the energy released by the enzymes increases feed energy-to-CP ratio, meaning there is excess energy that is then deposited as body fat. This suggests that supplemental MC in broiler feeds is beneficial if diets are formulated to contain marginal energy levels.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3abody fat 3acalorimetry 3acrude protein 3aenergy 3afeed conversion 3aintestines 3ametabolizable energy 3amuscles 3anitrogen 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 3aweight gain 0aApparent metabolizable energy 0aNet energy 0aNitrogen efficiency 0aGene expression 0aEnergy-to-protein ratio1 aMorgan, Natalie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9663-23651 aSwick, Robert A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3376-16771 aCozannet, Pierre1 aKheravii, Sarbast K.1 aWu, Shu-Biao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1790-60150 tAnimal nutrition.g2021 June, v. 7, no. 2 p.496-505dElsevier B.V.aChinese Association of Animal Science and Veterinary MedicinewJournal:23216x2405-65457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aninu.2020.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245007800176520134200254592002801596650002401624650001701648650001901665653002201684653001601706653001201722653002201734700001501756700002101771700002201792773009601814856008501910852000901995655001202004IND60776149220221119212857.0220606e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077614922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eatbeh.2022.1016322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeek, Melanie Rebecca14aThe effect of a healthy food cue on choices from an online fast-food menu  aThe prevalence of unhealthy food cues in our environment is a major contributor to poor dietary behaviours. Emerging research has shown that changing the food environment through the co-presentation of a healthy food cue may subtly ‘nudge’ individuals towards making healthier choices. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of a healthy food cue on subsequent food and drink choices from an online fast-food ordering menu. Participants (N = 291 women) were first presented with a cue displaying either a healthy or unhealthy meal, or no cue control. They were then shown a pictorial menu with items presented in one of two orders - menu 1 (first item healthy), menu 2 (first item unhealthy) - and asked to choose one item from each of three sections (mains, drinks, desserts). Participants also completed a questionnaire measure of dietary restraint. Overall, participants made more healthy choices from menu 1 than 2. For menu 1, there was a significant interaction between experimental condition and restraint status, whereby restrained eaters made relatively more healthy choices following the healthy cue. This was particularly the case for ‘main’ meal items. The findings have real world implications for digital businesses on how to present food and drink items to nudge individuals towards healthier choices.  aPublisher supplied data 3adietary restriction 3ahealthy diet 3aquestionnaires 0aFood-cue exposure 0aFood choice 0aNudging 0aDietary restraint1 aKemps, Eva1 aPrichard, Ivanka1 aTiggemann, Marika0 tEating behaviors.g2022 Apr., v. 45 p.101632-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12066x1471-01537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2022.1016323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245009400169300001600263520106600279592002801345650001101373650001501384650001701399650001601416650003001432650001401462650001301476650002101489650001101510650001001521650002101531650000901552650002501561653001701586653003301603653001701636653002101653653001601674700001801690700001701708700001701725773007701742856008901819852000901908655001201917IND60524641520221120082802.0160726e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052464152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.06.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Dali10aEnantioselective environmental behavior and cytotoxicity of chiral acaricide cyflumetofen  ap. 167-173.  aEnantioselective dissipation behavior of the new acaricide cyflumetofen (CYF) in citrus and soil, and its cytotoxicity to human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells was investigated for the first time. The results of degradation experiment showed that roughly similar half-lives of (−)-CYF and (+)-CYF were achieved in citrus (16.5 and 19.8 d) and soil (6.37 and 6.99 d), respectively. EF values varied from 0.50 to 0.42 in citrus and from 0.49 to 0.48 in soil, indicating that slightly enantioselective degradation happened during experiment period. Moreover, indexes of MTT, LDH, ROS, MDA, SOD, and CAT were used to evaluate enantioselective cytotoxicity and oxidative stress of CYF enantiomers to HepG2 cells. Dose- and structure form-dependent phenomenon was observed with toxicity orders of (−)-CYF > rac-CYF > (+)-CYF. Despite the similar environmental degradation behavior, the toxicities of CYF enantiomers showed great difference, suggesting that (+)-CYF might be developed as potential substitute of rac-CYF for safety consideration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aacaricides 3acytotoxicity 3aenantiomers 3aenvironmental degradation 3ahalf life 3ahepatoma 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3aliver 3aoxidative stress 3asoil 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aCyflumetofen 0aEnantioselective degradation 0aCytotoxicity 0aOxidative stress 0aEnantiomers1 aPang, Junxiao1 aZhou, Zhiqin1 aJiao, Bining0 tChemosphere.g2016 Oct., v. 161 p.167-173dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.06.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245003100179300001600210520139500226592002801621650001901649650001001668650002201678650002301700650001601723650001201739650001701751650001501768650001401783650001901797650001201816650004301828650002301871650001401894700001801908700001601926700002301942700002101965773010701986856004802093852000902141655001202150IND4467391620221120221138.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446739162DNAL7 a219222472pmid7 a10.1007/s10695-011-9547-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllis, Tim10aMortality and fish welfare  ap. 189-199.  aMortality has received insufficient attention as a fish welfare topic. Here, we aim to prompt fish farming stakeholders to discuss fish mortalities in relation to welfare. Mortality in farmed fish populations is due to a variety of biotic and abiotic causes, although it is often difficult to differentiate between underlying and immediate causes of mortality. Most mortality appears to occur during episodes associated with disease outbreaks and critical periods (in development or production). Most causes of mortality can be assumed to be associated with suffering prior to death. As mortality rates in farmed fish populations are suspected to rank amongst the highest in commonly farmed vertebrate species, mortality should be a principal fish welfare issue. Long-term mortality rates can be used as a retrospective welfare performance indicator and short-term mortality rates as an operational welfare indicator. Scrutiny of mortality records and determining causes of death will enable action to be taken to avoid further preventable mortality. The welfare performance of fish farms should only be judged on levels of predictable and preventable mortality. Fish farmers will already be monitoring mortality due to commercial and legal requirements. As profitability in fish farming is directly linked to survival, confronting mortality should ultimately benefit both fish and farmers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3adeath 3adisease outbreaks 3afarm profitability 3afarmed fish 3afarmers 3afish culture 3afish farms 3amortality 2aAnimal Welfare 2aAnimals 2aFisheriesxstatistics & numerical data 2aFishesxphysiology 2aMortality1 aBerrill, Iain1 aLines, Jeff1 aTurnbull, James F.1 aKnowles, Toby G.0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2012 Feb., v. 38, no. 1 p.189-199dSpringer-Verlagx0920-17427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-011-9547-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03324naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245012500206300002000331506007600351520172200427592002802149506003702177650003602214650001802250650001102268653002002279653001402299653001302313653002002326653003102346700002302377700002202400700001902422700002002441700002402461700002002485700002402505700002102529700002202550773019402572856007902766852000902845655001202854IND60230286220221207060131.0150614e20141230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023028622DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14212851112doi7 aPMC42845522pmcid7 a255125032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, Ana C.10aGlutamatergic regulation prevents hippocampal-dependent age-related cognitive decline through dendritic spine clustering  ap. 18733-18738.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe dementia of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) results primarily from degeneration of neurons that furnish glutamatergic corticocortical connections that subserve cognition. Although neuron death is minimal in the absence of AD, age-related cognitive decline does occur in animals as well as humans, and it decreases quality of life for elderly people. Age-related cognitive decline has been linked to synapse loss and/or alterations of synaptic proteins that impair function in regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. These synaptic alterations are likely reversible, such that maintenance of synaptic health in the face of aging is a critically important therapeutic goal. Here, we show that riluzole can protect against some of the synaptic alterations in hippocampus that are linked to age-related memory loss in rats. Riluzole increases glutamate uptake through glial transporters and is thought to decrease glutamate spillover to extrasynaptic NMDA receptors while increasing synaptic glutamatergic activity. Treated aged rats were protected against age-related cognitive decline displayed in nontreated aged animals. Memory performance correlated with density of thin spines on apical dendrites in CA1, although not with mushroom spines. Furthermore, riluzole-treated rats had an increase in clustering of thin spines that correlated with memory performance and was specific to the apical, but not the basilar, dendrites of CA1. Clustering of synaptic inputs is thought to allow nonlinear summation of synaptic strength. These findings further elucidate neuroplastic changes in glutamatergic circuits with aging and advance therapeutic development to prevent and treat age-related cognitive decline.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acentral nervous system diseases 3aglutamic acid 3amemory 0acognitive aging 0aglutamate 0ariluzole 0aneuroplasticity 0adendritic spine clustering1 aLambert, Hilary K.1 aGrossman, Yael S.1 aDumitriu, Dani1 aWaldman, Rachel1 aJannetty, Sophia K.1 aCalakos, Katina1 aJanssen, William G.1 aMcEwen, Bruce S.1 aMorrison, John H.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Dec. 30, v. 111, no. 52 p.18733-18738dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14212851113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02167naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002300176245007900199300001500278520100300293592002801296650002201324650001801346650001401364650000901378650000901387650001701396700002301413700002301436773015101459856006901610856009401679990002301773852000901796655001201805IND60643418520221118085030.0190510e20130617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064341852DNAL7 a10.3791/503032doi7 aPMC37275022pmcid7 a238516632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFleming, Sheila M.10aAssessment of sensorimotor function in mouse models of parkinson's disease  ap. e50303.  aSensitive and reliable behavioral outcome measures are essential to the evaluation of potential therapeutic treatments in preclinical trials for many neurodegenerative diseases. In Parkinson's disease, sensorimotor tests sensitive to varying degrees of nigrostriatal dysfunction are fundamental for testing the efficacy of potential therapeutics. Reliable and quite elegant sensorimotor measures exist for rats, however many of these tests measure sensorimotor asymmetry within the rat and are not entirely suitable for the newer genetic mouse models of PD. We have put together a battery of sensorimotor tests inspired by the sensitive tests in rats and adapted for mice. The test battery highlighted in this study is chosen for a) its sensitivity in a wide variety of mouse models of PD, b) its ease in implementing into a study, and c) its low expense. These tests have proven useful in characterizing novel genetic mouse models of PD as well as in testing potential disease-modifying therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParkinson disease 3aanimal models 3aasymmetry 3amice 3arats 3atherapeutics1 aEkhator, Osunde R.1 aGhisays, Valentins0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2013 June 17, , no. 76 p.e50303-e50303dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/503033Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/50303/assessment-sensorimotor-function-mouse-models-parkinson-s  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245017200169300001600341520102900357592002801386653002901414653001701443653003001460653005601490653002601546700002101572700001801593700001701611773011301628856008101741852000901822655001201831IND60516629220221120134531.0160326e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051662922DNAL7 a10.1017/S09502688130012952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerrano, Ernesto,14aThe use of null models and partial least squares approach path modelling (PLS-PM) for investigating risk factors influencing post-weaning mortality in indoor pig farms  ap. 530-539.  aAlthough post-weaning mortality (PWM) in pig farming is mainly due to the effect of pathogens, farm type or swine management are also directly or indirectly involved. In this work, we used null models and the partial least squares approach (PLS) to structural equation modelling, also known as PLS path modelling (PLS-PM), to explore whether farm type, swine management and pathogens, including porcine circovirus type 2, swine influenza virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and Aujeszky's disease virus, directly or indirectly influenced PWM in 42 Spanish indoor pig farms. The null model analysis revealed that contact with multiple combinations of viruses could occur by chance. On the other hand, PLS-PM showed that farm characteristics do not influence virus infections, and thus neither farm type nor associated management practices shaped PWM due to pathogens. Accordingly, preventive programmes aimed at controlling PWM in intensive farming should prioritize the control of major pig pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAujeszky's disease virus 0aco-infection 0aporcine circovirus type 2 0aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 0aswine influenza virus1 aLÓPEZ-SORIA, S.1 aTRINCHERA, L.1 aSEGALÉS, J.0 tEpidemiology and Infection.g2014 Mar., v. 142, no. 3 p.530-539dCambridge University Pressx1469-44097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S09502688130012953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001500187245008200202300001600284500001500300506007600315520112100391536011901512592002801631506003701659650002101696650001401717650001201731650001701743650002401760650001401784650002001798650001401818650001901832650000901851650001801860650002501878650000901903650001201912650003201924650001701956650003401973653003402007653002702041653002502068700001502093700001402108700001602122700002102138700001802159773010602177856008002283852000902363655001202372IND60614952820221207130906.0181003e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061495282DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858103637042doi7 aPMC30467772pmcid7 a203513592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBailey, C.10aSystemic Spironucleosis in 2 Immunodeficient Rhesus Macaques (Macaca mulatta)  ap. 488-494.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSpironucleus spp are parasites of fish and terrestrial vertebrates, including mice and turkeys, that rarely cause extraintestinal disease. Two rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were experimentally inoculated with simian immunodeficiency virus mac251. Both progressed to simian acquired immune deficiency syndrome within 1 year of inoculation and developed systemic protozoal infections in addition to common opportunistic infections, including rhesus cytomegalovirus, rhesus lymphocryptovirus, and rhesus adenovirus. In the first case, the protozoa were associated with colitis, multifocal abdominal abscessation, and lymphadenitis. In the second case, they were one of a number of organisms associated with extensive pyogranulomatous pneumonia and colitis. Ultrastructural, molecular, and phylogenetic analysis revealed the causative organism to be a species of Spironucleus closely related to Spironucleus meleagridis of turkeys. This report is the first of extraintestinal infection with Spironucleus sp in higher mammals and expands the list of opportunistic infections found in immunocompromised rhesus macaques.  aThis research was funded, in part, by National Institutes of Health grant Nos.

The presence and operation of dams modifies natural flow regimes thereby disrupting cues that signal migration and negatively influencing habitats critical to riverine fishes. Blue Suckers (Cycleptus elongatus) make large annual movements, require large and unfragmented reaches of river, and may be sensitive to modifications of cues that initiate migration. We assessed the influence of individual and abiotic factors on home ranges and movements of 62 transmittered Blue Suckers from 2006–2014 in the Missouri River upstream of Fort Peck Reservoir in Montana. Populations in this area are disjunct from those downstream and are influenced by upstream dam regulation. Blue Suckers used large expanses of river with overall home ranges ∼88 river kilometers, but these home ranges were about two times smaller than reported elsewhere. Increasing discharge and water temperature were associated with movement rate and movement probability and cued spawning movements of Blue Suckers. Movement rates increased with discharge to peak and decreased thereafter. Surprisingly, movement rate and probability were highest at the lowest water temperatures we observed (∼1–5°C) unlike previous studies in other systems when peak movement occurred at ≥10°C. Blue Suckers aggregated and showed interannual fidelity to several locations during spawning. Aggregation and fidelity suggest that optimal spawning areas, which exist in tributaries, may be limited within our study area. Our results support evidence that riverine fishes require natural trends in discharge and water temperature, including occasional flood pulses and connectivity among seasonal habitats. The Upper Missouri River retains pseudo-natural discharge and temperature regimes that elicit responses of Blue Sucker to environmental cues, but other rivers may not. Preserving or restoring these features, and entire riverscapes, would maintain natural environmental cues and habitats required by riverine fishes to complete their life histories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCycleptus elongatus 3adams (hydrology) 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afish 3ahabitats 3ahome range 3alife history 3aprobability 3ariparian areas 3ariver flow 3arivers 3aspawning 3awater temperature 3aGreat Plains region 3aMissouri River 3aMontana1 aSmith, Troy W.1 aTews, Anne E.1 aBeattie, Robert P.1 aGardner, William M.1 aEby, Lisa A.0 tCopeia.g2020 Mar. 18, v. 108, no. 1 p.151-162dAmerican Society of Ichthyologists and HerpetologistswJournal:19631x0045-85117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1643/CI-19-2563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245008900213300001600302520125700318592002801575650004601603650001301649650001801662650001801680650002401698650001301722651001301735653001601748653001501764700006801779700006301847700006001910700006801970773017902038856004902217852000902266655001202275IND60776149520221119212959.0220502e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077614952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2021.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibson, Starr'Retiece1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0766-399610aNutrition Environment at Food Pantries Improves After Fresh Produce Donation Program  ap. 432-441.  aTo evaluate the influence of the Growing Together Illinois fresh produce donation program and understand factors that affect produce distribution at participating food pantries. In this intervention at 17 Illinois food pantries, Master Gardeners supported food donation gardens, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education provided educational and environmental interventions to increase selection and use of fresh produce. This mixed-methods pre-post study assessed pantry characteristics and program impact via Nutrition Environment Food Pantry Assessment Tool evaluations, interview feedback from pantry staff, and structured pantry observations. Pantries experienced significant increases from preintervention to postintervention in providing various types of produce, marketing and nudging healthful products, providing additional resources, and total Nutrition Environment Food Pantry Assessment Tool scores.

Here we present a high-resolution lacustrine log from a western Mediterranean intramountain basin; it is based on calcite oxygen isotope composition (δ¹⁸Oc) and records detailed paleoclimatic information from the Late Miocene to the Early Pleistocene (9.8–1.8 Ma). Evidence is found for orbital forcing in the regional paleoclimate, with minimum and maximum eccentricity related to drier and wetter conditions respectively. Superimposed onto this variability, the long-term trend reflects the influence of global paleogeographic and climate change. Variations inferred in precipitation-evaporation (P–E) are related to SST in the North Atlantic, which evidences a connection between marine dynamics and continental climate in areas far from the coast in southwestern Europe and a relation between dry periods and high SST inland. It is proposed that the regional climate was impacted by the effect of the closure of the Central Atlantic Seaway and changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Warmer/drier conditions were related to a more permanent, stable, high-pressure centre over the mid-Atlantic in a situation of strengthened AMOC, which would have blocked westerly winds, increasing aridity in southwestern Europe. The inferred warm/dry connection differs from other western Mediterranean records, supporting previous interpretations of a regional climate gradient in western Europe. As occurs at present, isolation from the influence of the humidity of the Mediterranean Sea during warm periods as a result of' to the local orography could well have been the cause of regional differences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiocene epoch 3aPleistocene epoch 3abasins 3acalcite 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3acontinental climates 3adry environmental conditions 3ahumidity 3aoxygen isotopes 3apaleoclimatology 3aEurope 3aMediterranean Sea 3aWestern European region 0aPaleoclimate 0aLacustrine record 0aAMOC 0aStable isotopes 0aLate Neogene 0aSW Europe 0aAMOC 0aCAS 0aELMA 0aETWZ 0aGPTS 0aLMC 0aMAP 0aMAT 0aMCO 0amPWP 0aNADW 0aNAO 0aODP 0aP–E 0aSHPZ 0aSST1 aMuñoz, Arsenio,1 aLiesa, Carlos L.1 aSimón, José L.1 aLuzón, Aránzazu0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2022 Apr., v. 211 p.103788-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12406x0921-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2022.1037883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002200176245006300198300001500261520125400276592002801530650001401558650001201572650001301584650001201597650002401609650002001633700002101653700002101674700002201695773015101717856006901868856009501937990002302032852000902055655001202064IND60643418620221118085011.0190510e20130326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064341862DNAL7 a10.3791/503042doi7 aPMC36408392pmcid7 a235671872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrampton, John P.10aCell co-culture patterning using aqueous two-phase systems  ap. e50304.  aCell patterning technologies that are fast, easy to use and affordable will be required for the future development of high throughput cell assays, platforms for studying cell-cell interactions and tissue engineered systems. This detailed protocol describes a method for generating co-cultures of cells using biocompatible solutions of dextran (DEX) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) that phase-separate when combined above threshold concentrations. Cells can be patterned in a variety of configurations using this method. Cell exclusion patterning can be performed by printing droplets of DEX on a substrate and covering them with a solution of PEG containing cells. The interfacial tension formed between the two polymer solutions causes cells to fall around the outside of the DEX droplet and form a circular clearing that can be used for migration assays. Cell islands can be patterned by dispensing a cell-rich DEX phase into a PEG solution or by covering the DEX droplet with a solution of PEG. Co-cultures can be formed directly by combining cell exclusion with DEX island patterning. These methods are compatible with a variety of liquid handling approaches, including manual micropipetting, and can be used with virtually any adherent cell type.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoculture 3adextran 3adroplets 3aliquids 3apolyethylene glycol 3asurface tension1 aWhite, Joshua B.1 aAbraham, Abin T.1 aTakayama, Shuichi0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2013 Mar. 26, , no. 73 p.e50304-e50304dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/503043Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/50304/cell-co-culture-patterning-using-aqueous-two-phase-systems  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245011200207300002000319506007600339520108000415592002801495506003701523650001501560650002501575650002101600650001301621650001601634650001801650650001501668650001701683650001401700653002601714653001401740653001601754653001501770653002101785700002401806700002001830700001601850700001801866700001701884700001701901700001801918700002201936700001701958700001701975700001701992700002202009773019402031856007902225852000902304655001202313IND60230286620221207060014.0150614e20141230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023028662DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14217791122doi7 aPMC42845672pmcid7 a255125162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Vikas K.10aIn silico selection of therapeutic antibodies for development: Viscosity, clearance, and chemical stability  ap. 18601-18606.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFor mAbs to be viable therapeutics, they must be formulated to have low viscosity, be chemically stable, and have normal in vivo clearance rates. We explored these properties by observing correlations of up to 60 different antibodies of the IgG1 isotype. Unexpectedly, we observe significant correlations with simple physical properties obtainable from antibody sequences and by molecular dynamics simulations of individual antibody molecules. mAbs viscosities increase strongly with hydrophobicity and charge dipole distribution and decrease with net charge. Fast clearance correlates with high hydrophobicities of certain complementarity determining regions and with high positive or high negative net charge. Chemical degradation from tryptophan oxidation correlates with the average solvent exposure time of tryptophan residues. Aspartic acid isomerization rates can be predicted from solvent exposure and flexibility as determined by molecular dynamics simulations. These studies should aid in more rapid screening and selection of mAb candidates during early discovery.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibodies 3achemical degradation 3achronic diseases 3apatients 3aprobability 3arapid methods 3ashelf life 3atherapeutics 3aviscosity 0amonoclonal antibodies 0aviscosity 0adegradation 0aprediction 0apharmacokinetics1 aPatapoff, Thomas W.1 aKabakoff, Bruce1 aPai, Satyan1 aHilario, Eric1 aZhang, Boyan1 aLi, Charlene1 aBorisov, Oleg1 aKelley, Robert F.1 aChorny, Ilya1 aZhou, Joe Z.1 aDill, Ken A.1 aSwartz, Trevor E.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Dec. 30, v. 111, no. 52 p.18601-18606dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14217791123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245017300174300001400347520097400361592002801335650002101363650001201384650002101396650002901417650001401446650000901460650002401469650002401493650003301517650001501550650002501565651001301590653002801603653002101631653002101652653001701673653002501690700002601715700002501741700002501766700001901791700002501810773010701835856008201942852000902024655001202033IND60544485420221120141251.0210124e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054448542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wri.2015.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCristóvão, Raquel O.10aFish canning wastewater treatment by activated sludge: Application of factorial design optimization: Biological treatment by activated sludge of fish canning wastewater  ap. 29-38.  aThe optimization of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and initial organic matter concentration for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) abatement of wastewater from a fish canning industry of northern Portugal by activated sludge was investigated using response surface methodology (RSM).

The experimental data on DOC removal were fitted into a quadratic polynomial model using factorial design and RSM. The optimum process conditions were determined by analyzing the response surface of a three-dimensional plot and by solving the regression model equation. The obtained results showed a HRT of 6.4h and an initial DOC of 406.2mg/L as the best treatment conditions.

However, research on improving the rheological properties of PM dough is limited. In the present study, rheological and color characteristics of PM dough (37% moisture) were compared with the behavior of wheat dough. Three hydrocolloids [guar gum (GG), xanthan gum (XG) and sodium alginate (SA)] at concentrations of 0%, 1% and 2% were added to improve the physical properties of PM dough. The textural properties of PM dough developed pasta with hydrocolloids were also studied. Wheat dough presented a much higher apparent viscosity and elastic modulus than PM dough. Both the apparent viscosity and elasticity were increased by all three hydrocolloids, with 2% XG presenting the most pronounced improvement in elasticity. Generally, the capacity of hydrocolloids to improve the PM dough follow the order XG > GG > SA. The addition of hydrocolloids showed no significant impact on the color of PM dough. GG and XG showed an improvement in the network strength of PM pasta, while SA did not contribute to textural enhancement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum miliaceum subsp. miliaceum 3acolor 3adough 3agluten-free foods 3aguar gum 3ahydrocolloids 3amillet flour 3amodulus of elasticity 3apasta 3aproduct development 3asodium alginate 3atexture 3aviscosity 3awheat 3axanthan gum 0aProso millet 0aHydrocolloids 0aRheological properties 0aGluten-free1 aSantra, Dipak1 aRose, Devin1 aZhang, Yue0 tJournal of cereal science.g2017 Mar., v. 74 p.238-243dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2017.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245013100168520176100299592002802060650001702088650002002105650001502125650001102140650001602151650002402167650001102191650001702202650001402219650001302233650003002246650001602276651001502292651001702307653001902324653001602343653002002359653001902379653002102398700001602419700001902435700001402454700002002468773010902488856008802597852000902685655001202694IND60770830920221119115709.0220523e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077083092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2022.1037892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Jimin10aEnhanced aridification across the Eocene/Oligocene transition evidenced by geochemical record in the Tajik Basin, Central Asia  aThe Tajik Basin is an intermontane depression between the mountain ranges of Tian Shan, Pamir, and Hindukush, which is located in the northwestern part of the India-Asia collision zone. Due to the westward retreat of the Neotethys Sea, the paleoenvironment of the Tajik Basin has underwent change from a shallow-sea to a continental semiarid land during the Cenozoic era. This implies that the long-term climatic record in the Tajik Basin can potentially reflect the environmental effects of the changed land-sea distributions controlled by plate collision and global eustatic sea-level changes. In this paper, we present new results of stable oxygen and carbon isotopes of carbonates and chemical weathering indices of bulk samples from the Eocene-Oligocene terrestrial strata (ca. 39–30 Ma) in the center of the Tajik Basin. The temporal variations of oxygen and carbon isotopes of carbonates indicate an isotopic shift across the Eocene-Oligocene transition (~34 Ma), characterized by a relatively positive shift due to the isotopic enrichment in authigenic carbonates in an enhanced aridification episode in the Tajik Basin. This shift was also mirrored by the weakened chemical weathering indicated by the ratios of major oxides across the Eocene-Oligocene transition. Such a regional climatic shift was generally coincident with a remarkable global scale sea-level drop. We suggest that the isolated Paratethys Sea, which was mainly driven by global cooling due to the initial formation of the Antarctica Ice-sheet, together with the decreased seawater evaporation due to lower sea surface temperature, reduced water vapor transport by westerlies to the downwind region, and thus intensified the aridification in the Tajik Basin began at ~34 Ma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEocene epoch 3aOligocene epoch 3aarid lands 3abasins 3aevaporation 3aisotopic enrichment 3aoxygen 3apaleoecology 3asea level 3aseawater 3asurface water temperature 3awater vapor 3aAntarctica 3aCentral Asia 0aLate Paleogene 0aTajik Basin 0aLand-sea change 0aStable isotope 0aPaleoenvironment1 aLiu, Weiguo1 aGuo, Zhengtang1 aQi, Liang1 aZhang, Zhiliang0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2022 Apr., v. 211 p.103789-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12406x0921-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2022.1037893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03642naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008900175520198800264592002802252650003402280650001302314650001302327650001602340650002402356650001702380650001602397650001402413650002602427650001402453650001902467650001402486650001302500650001302513650001302526650001302539653001302552653002002565653003602585653002402621653001702645700003102662700006102693700006202754700002002816700006202836700002602898773009302924856008603017852000903103655001203112IND60729680620221119050641.0220315e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072968062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e062752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Clayton R.10aReduction of Sb(V) by coupled biotic-abiotic processes under sulfidogenic conditions  aIncreasing use and mining of antimony (Sb) has resulted in greater concern involving its fate and transport in the environment. Antimony(V) and (III) are the two most environmentally relevant oxidation states, but little is known about the redox transitions between the two in natural systems. To better understand the behavior of antimony in anoxic environments, the redox transformations of Sb(V) were studied in biotic and abiotic reactors. The biotic reactors contained Sb(V) (2 mM as KSb(OH)₆), ferrihydrite (50 mM Fe(III)), sulfate (10 mM), and lactate (10 mM), that were inoculated with sediment from a wetland. In the abiotic reactors, The interaction of Sb(V) with green rust, magnetite, siderite, vivianite or mackinawite was examined under abiotic conditions. Changes in the concentrations of Sb, Fe(II), sulfate, and lactate, as well as the microbial community composition were monitored over time. Lactate was rapidly fermented to acetate and propionate in the bioreactors, with the latter serving as the primary electron donor for dissimilatory sulfate reduction (DSR). The reduction of ferrihydrite was primarily abiotic, being driven by biogenic sulfide. Sb and Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analysis showed reduction of Sb(V) to Sb(III) within 4 weeks, concurrent with DSR and the formation of FeS. Sb K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy analysis indicated that the reduced phase was a mixture of S- and O-coordinated Sb(III). Reduction of Sb(V) was not observed in the presence of magnetite, siderite, or green rust, and limited reduction occurred with vivianite. However, reduction of Sb(V) to amorphous Sb(III) sulfide occurred with mackinawite. These results are consistent with abiotic reduction of Sb(V) by biogenic sulfide and reveal a substantial influence of Fe oxides on the speciation of Sb(III), which illustrates the tight coupling of Sb speciation with the biogeochemical cycling of S and Fe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aacetates 3aantimony 3abioreactors 3acommunity structure 3aferrihydrite 3alactic acid 3amagnetite 3amicrobial communities 3aoxidation 3apropionic acid 3asediments 3asiderite 3asulfates 3asulfides 3awetlands 0aAntimony 0aBiogeochemistry 0aDissimilatory sulfate reduction 0aMicrobial reduction 0aIron sulfide1 aAntonopoulos, Dionysios A.1 aBoyanov, Maxim I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8758-52481 aFlynn, Theodore M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1838-89421 aKoval, Jason C.1 aKemner, Kenneth M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1409-85421 aO'Loughlin, Edward J.0 tHeliyon.g2021 Feb., v. 7, no. 2 p.e06275-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e062753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245014300168300001800311520124200329592002801571650001201599650002401611650001401635650002801649650001301677650001201690650002201702650001301724650001701737650001401754700005601768700005901824773013301883856008002016852000902096655001202105IND60770544120220318000000.0220318e20220211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077054412DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.1c027752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJankovič, Dominik10aCopper-Catalyzed Azide–Alkyne Cycloaddition of Hydrazoic Acid Formed In Situ from Sodium Azide Affords 4-Monosubstituted-1,2,3-Triazoles  ap. 4018-4028.  aWe report a copper-catalyzed cycloaddition of hydrogen azide (hydrazoic acid, HN₃) with terminal alkynes to form 4-substituted-1H-1,2,3-triazoles in a sustainable manner. Hydrazoic acid was formed in situ from sodium azide under acidic conditions to react with terminal alkynes in a copper-catalyzed reaction. Using polydentate N-donor chelating ligands and mild organic acids, the reactions were realized to proceed at room temperature under aerobic conditions in a methanol–water mixture and with 5 mol % catalyst loadings to afford 4-substituted-1,2,3-triazoles in high yields. This method is amenable on a wide range of alkyne substrates, including unprotected peptides, showing diverse functional group tolerance. It is applicable for late-stage functionalization synthetic strategies, as demonstrated in the synthesis of the triazole analogue of losartan. The preparation of orthogonally protected azahistidine from Fmoc-l-propargylglycine was realized on a gram scale. The hazardous nature of hydrazoic acid has been diminished as it forms in situ in <6% concentrations at which it is safe to handle. Reactions of distilled solutions of hydrazoic acid indicated its role as a reactive species in the copper-catalyzed reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3aambient temperature 3acatalysts 3acycloaddition reactions 3ahydrogen 3aligands 3aorganic chemistry 3apeptides 3asodium azide 3atriazoles1 aVirant, Miha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5919-36311 aGazvoda, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3421-06820 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2022 Feb. 11, v. 87, no. 6 p.4018-4028dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.1c027753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01933naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010100160300002000261520097900281592002801260650002301288650003401311650001301345650001601358650001701374700002501391773014401416856007401560852000901634655001201643IND60642519120221120025200.0190507e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064251912DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta01258f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrishna, Anurag10aHole transporting materials for mesoscopic perovskite solar cells – towards a rational design?  ap. 16446-16466.  aOrganic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become one of the most exciting fields in the search for renewable energy sources with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs having increased in only a few years from less than 5% to certified values of over 22%. To obtain high efficiencies in PSCs hole transporting materials (HTMs) are needed, and the HTM used in the best devices is so expensive as to make them potentially uncompetitive. In this review we give an overview of the types of HTMs that have been developed and discuss some of the strategies that have been used in designing HTMs for efficient PSCs, including the apparent effects of functional groups in and structures of organic HTMs on device parameters such as the PCE, fill factor (FF), open circuit voltage (Vₒc), and the stability of the resulting PSCs. We suggest some tentative design principles that might enable the rational design of a cost-effective HTM for efficient PSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3aelectric potential difference 3amoieties 3asolar cells 3asolar energy1 aGrimsdale, Andrew C.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 5, no. 32 p.16446-16466dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta01258f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03510naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245019600169300001200365520179500377592002802172650001502200650002002215650002002235650001702255650001202272650001202284650001102296650001502307650001202322650003102334650002402365650001702389650002102406650000902427650003102436650002102467650001702488650001502505650001402520650001402534650001002548650002002558650001902578650001302597650001502610700001802625700002402643700002302667700002302690773014002713856008202853852000902935655001202944IND60593646720221116154527.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059364672DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-018-3816-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLebrun, Manhattan10aAssisted Phytoremediation of a Multi-contaminated Industrial Soil Using Biochar and Garden Soil Amendments Associated with Salix alba or Salix viminalis: Abilities to Stabilize As, Pb, and Cu  ap. 163.  aWith the development of the industrial era, environmental pollution by organic and inorganic pollutants increased and became a worldwide issue. Particularly, former industrial sites often present high concentrations of metal(loid)s. These pollutions have adverse effects not only on the environment but also to human health, as pollutants can enter the food chain. Therefore, contaminated sites need rehabilitation. Phytoremediation is a clean and low-cost solution to remediate such sites. However, vegetation establishment can be difficult on such extreme soils from both a physical and a chemical point of view. Consequently, amendments, like biochar and garden soil, must be applied. Biochar, product of biomass pyrolysis under low-oxygen conditions, showed beneficial effects on soil fertility and plant growth, as well as metal(loid) sorption properties. The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of two organic amendments, biochar and garden soil, alone or combined, on the physico-chemical properties of a post-industrial soil and the growth of two Salix species (Salix alba and Salix viminalis) and evaluate the phytostabilizing capacities of the two Salix species. In this goal, a greenhouse experiment was performed, using garden soil at 50% (v/v) and/or biochar at 2 or 5% (w/w). The results showed that biochar did not improve soil physico-chemical properties, neither did it affect plant parameters (dry weight, organ metal(loid)s concentrations). Moreover, higher metal(loid) concentrations were found in the roots compared to the upper parts. Finally, S. alba presented lower metal(loid) concentrations in the aboveground parts compared to S. viminalis, associated with a good growth, which make it a better candidate for phytostabilization of the studied soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalix alba 3aSalix viminalis 3aadverse effects 3aaerial parts 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acopper 3afood chain 3agardens 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ahorticultural soils 3ahuman health 3aindustrial sites 3alead 3aphysicochemical properties 3aphytoremediation 3aplant growth 3apollutants 3apollution 3apyrolysis 3aroots 3asoil amendments 3asoil fertility 3asorption 3avegetation1 aMiard, Florie1 aHattab-Hambli, Nour1 aBourgerie, Sylvain1 aMorabito, Domenico0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2018 May, v. 229, no. 5 p.163-163dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-018-3816-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03444naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013200165520173300297592002802030650003602058650001602094650002402110650001702134650001202151650000902163650002102172650001802193650001802211650001202229650001202241650001502253650001702268650003002285650002302315650003802338650002502376650002102401650001302422653002302435653001902458653001702477653000902494653002002503653001702523700002002540700003002560700001702590700002802607700003002635773012102665856008302786852000902869655001202878IND60776149920221119213137.0220517e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077614992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpc.2022.1093572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xujia10aInvestigating mitochondria-immune responses in zebrafish, Danio rerio (Hamilton, 1822): A case study with the herbicide dinoseb  aThe dinitrophenol herbicide dinoseb is an uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Studies in fish demonstrate impaired OXPHOS is associated with altered immune system responses and locomotor activity in fish. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dinoseb on zebrafish (Danio rerio) during early stages of development. We measured oxygen consumption rates of embryos, transcripts related to OXPHOS, growth, and the immune system (cytokines and immune-signaling transcripts), and locomotor activity. We hypothesized that OXPHOS of fish would be impaired in vivo, leading to altered basal immune system expression and locomotor activity. Oxidative respiration assessments in embryos revealed that dinoseb decreased both mean basal respiration and oligomycin-induced ATP-linked respiration. Expression levels of cytochrome c oxidase complex IV, 3-hydroxyacyl-COA dehydrogenase and superoxide dismutase 1 were decreased in larvae following exposure to dinoseb while succinate dehydrogenase complex flavoprotein subunit A, insulin growth factor 1 (igf1) and igf2a mRNA were increased in abundance. Immune-related transcripts chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) were decreased in expression levels while toll-like receptor 5a and 5b were increased in expression. In addition, a visual motor response test was conducted on both 6 and 7 dpf larvae to determine if dinoseb impaired locomotor activity. Dinoseb decreased locomotor activity in 7 dpf larvae but not 6 dpf. This study improves knowledge of toxicity mechanisms for dinoseb in early stages of fish development and demonstrates that mitochondrial toxicants may disrupt immune signaling in zebrafish.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase 3aDanio rerio 3aToll-like receptors 3acase studies 3adinoseb 3afish 3afish development 3aflavoproteins 3aimmune system 3ainsulin 3aligands 3alocomotion 3amitochondria 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aoxygen consumption 3asuccinate dehydrogenase (quinone) 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 0aPesticide toxicity 0aImmunotoxicity 0aMitochondria 0aFish 0aAdverse outcome 0aAgrochemical1 aIvantsova, Emma1 aPerez-Rodriguez, Veronica1 aCao, Fangjie1 aSouders, Christopher L.1 aMartyniuk, Christopher J.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2022 July, v. 257 p.109357-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12414x1532-04567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpc.2022.1093573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03983naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245007400205300002000279506007600299520175300375592002802128506003702156650001402193650001502207650001502222650001602237650001002253650001502263650001302278650002102291650001902312650001302331650001402344650001402358650001702372653001202389653002702401653001202428700002102440700002702461700002002488700002502508700002002533700002302553700001702576700002302593700001902616700001802635700005102653700002202704700002402726700002102750700002502771700002202796700001802818700002602836700002202862700002002884700002002904700001802924700002502942773019402967856007903161852000903240655001203249IND60230287120221207053240.0150614e20141230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023028712DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14220501122doi7 aPMC42845552pmcid7 a255125072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarzon, Ramiro10aExpression and prognostic impact of lncRNAs in acute myeloid leukemia  ap. 18679-18684.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides, located within the intergenic stretches or overlapping antisense transcripts of protein coding genes. LncRNAs are involved in numerous biological roles including imprinting, epigenetic regulation, apoptosis, and cell cycle. To determine whether lncRNAs are associated with clinical features and recurrent mutations in older patients (aged ≥60 y) with cytogenetically normal (CN) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we evaluated lncRNA expression in 148 untreated older CN-AML cases using a custom microarray platform. An independent set of 71 untreated older patients with CN-AML was used to validate the outcome scores using RNA sequencing. Distinctive lncRNA profiles were found associated with selected mutations, such as internal tandem duplications in the FLT3 gene ( FLT3 -ITD) and mutations in the NPM1 , CEBPA , IDH2 , ASXL1 , and RUNX1 genes. Using the lncRNAs most associated with event-free survival in a training cohort of 148 older patients with CN-AML, we derived a lncRNA score composed of 48 lncRNAs. Patients with an unfavorable compared with favorable lncRNA score had a lower complete response (CR) rate [ P < 0.001, odds ratio = 0.14, 54% vs. 89%], shorter disease-free survival (DFS) [ P < 0.001, hazard ratio (HR) = 2.88] and overall survival (OS) ( P < 0.001, HR = 2.95). The validation set analyses confirmed these results (CR, P = 0.03; DFS, P = 0.009; OS, P = 0.009). Multivariable analyses for CR, DFS, and OS identified the lncRNA score as an independent marker for outcome. In conclusion, lncRNA expression in AML is closely associated with recurrent mutations. A small subset of lncRNAs is correlated strongly with treatment response and survival.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3abiomarkers 3acell cycle 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3ametastasis 3amutation 3amyeloid leukemia 3anon-coding RNA 3apatients 3aprognosis 3aremission 3atherapeutics 0alncRNAs 0aacute myeloid leukemia 0aoutcome1 aVolinia, Stefano1 aPapaioannou, Dimitrios1 aNicolet, Deedra1 aKohlschmidt, Jessica1 aYan, Pearlly S.1 aMrózek, Krzysztof1 aBucci, Donna1 aCarroll, Andrew J.1 aBaer, Maria R.1 aWetzler, Meir1 aCarter, Thomas H.q(Thomas Henry),d1931-1963,1 aPowell, Bayard L.1 aKolitz, Jonathan E.1 aMoore, Joseph O.1 aEisfeld, Ann-Kathrin1 aBlachly, James S.1 aBlum, William1 aCaligiuri, Michael A.1 aStone, Richard M.1 aMarcucci, Guido1 aCroce, Carlo M.1 aByrd, John C.1 aBloomfield, Clara D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Dec. 30, v. 111, no. 52 p.18679-18684dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14220501123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03592naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012200165520166300287592002801950650002801978650001602006650001502022650001702037650000902054650001702063650001402080650002002094650001702114650002102131650002102152653000802173653001102181653000802192653000702200653000702207653000702214653000802221653000902229653000802238653000702246653000902253653000902262653001102271653001002282653001002292653001202302653001102314653000802325653000802333653000902341653000902350653000902359653000902368653000802377653001502385653001702400653001302417653001602430653002002446700001602466700001302482700001302495700002002508700001702528700002302545700001302568700001602581773012102597856008302718852000902801655001202810IND60776150020221119211451.0220517e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077615002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpc.2022.1093582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Xu-Qian10aExposure to enrofloxacin and depuration: Endocrine disrupting effect in juvenile grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella)  aThis study aimed to determine the effects of Enrofloxacin (ENR) exposure and depuration on the disruption of thyroid function and growth of juvenile grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) as well as to assess the risk of ENR exposure to human health. Juvenile grass carp were treated with ENR solutions at different concentration gradients for 21 days and then depurated for 14 days. The results indicated ENR accumulation in the juvenile grass carp muscles, which persisted after depuration. In addition, exposure to ENR could alter growth by regulating the expression of genes associated with growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor (GH)/IGF) axis and the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid (HPT) axis. During ENR exposure, no significant changes in growth hormone levels were observed; however, a significant increase in the growth hormone level was noted. GH/IGF axis-related genes were upregulated after ENR exposure, and their expression levels remained high after depuration. Notably, a significant increase in the serum triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels coincided with the upregulation of HPT axis-related genes in both exposure and depuration treatments, and their expression levels remained high after depuration. Therefore, juvenile grass carp exposure to ENR induces physiological stress through HPT and GH/IGF axes that cannot be recovered after depuration. ENR accumulates in the muscles of juvenile grass carp and may pose a threat to human health. Therefore, exposure of juvenile grass carp to ENR results in impaired thyroid function and impaired growth. In addition, consumption of ENR-exposed fish poses human health risks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3ablood serum 3adepuration 3aenrofloxacin 3afish 3ahuman health 3ajuveniles 3arisk assessment 3asomatotropin 3athyroid function 3atriiodothyronine 0aENR 0aGH/IGF 0aHPT 0aT3 0aT4 0aGH 0aGHR 0aIGFs 0aTHs 0aCF 0aghrb 0aigf1 0aigf1rb 0aigf2a 0aigf2b 0aigfbp1a 0aigfbp3 0acrh 0attr 0adio1 0adio2 0atrα 0atrβ 0aTHQ 0aGrass carp 0aEnrofloxacin 0aHPT axis 0aGH/IGF axis 0aRisk assessment1 aHe, Shu-Wen1 aLiu, Bin1 aWang, Xu1 aXing, Shao-Ying1 aCao, Zhi-Han1 aChen, Cheng-Zhuang1 aLi, Ping1 aLi, Zhi-Hua0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2022 July, v. 257 p.109358-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12414x1532-04567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpc.2022.1093583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245013100174300001600305520178600321592002802107650003002135650001102165650001402176650002102190650000902211650001502220650001202235650002902247650004402276651001102320651001502331651000902346651001402355651001102369651001802380651001802398653000902416653000902425653001002434653002102444653002602465700002102491700002302512700002402535773007702559856008902636852000902725655001202734IND60524642220221120082153.0160726e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052464222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.06.1092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRankin, Keegan12aA North American and global survey of perfluoroalkyl substances in surface soils: Distribution patterns and mode of occurrence  ap. 333-341.  aThe distribution of 32 per/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in surface soils was determined at 62 locations representing all continents (North America n = 33, Europe n = 10, Asia n = 6, Africa n = 5, Australia n = 4, South America n = 3 and Antarctica n = 1) using ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) systems. Quantifiable levels of perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs: PFHxA-PFTeDA) were observed in all samples with total concentrations ranging from 29 to 14,300 pg/g (dry weight), while perfluoroalkane sulfonates (PFSAs: PFHxS, PFOS and PFDS) were detected in all samples but one, ranging from <LOQ-3270 pg/g, confirming the global distribution of PFASs in terrestrial settings. The geometric mean PFCA and PFSA concentrations were observed to be higher in the northern hemisphere (930 and 170 pg/g) compared to the southern hemisphere (190 and 33 pg/g). Perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) were the most commonly detected analytes at concentrations up to 2670 and 3100 pg/g, respectively. The sum of PFCA homologues of PFOA commonly were roughly twice the concentration of PFOA. The PFCA and PFSA congener profiles were similar amongst most locations, with a few principal-component statistical anomalies suggesting impact from nearby urban and point sources. The ratio of even to odd PFCAs was consistent with the atmospheric oxidation of fluorotelomer-based precursors previously observed in laboratory and environmental studies. Given the soils were collected from locations absent of direct human activity, these results suggest that the atmospheric long-range transport (LRT) of neutral PFASs followed by oxidation and deposition are a significant source of PFCAs and PFSAs to soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageographical distribution 3ahumans 3aoxidation 3aperfluorocarbons 3asoil 3asulfonates 3asurveys 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aAfrica 3aAntarctica 3aAsia 3aAustralia 3aEurope 3aNorth America 3aSouth America 0aPFOA 0aPFOS 0aPFASs 0aBackground soils 0aReconnaissance survey1 aMabury, Scott A.1 aJenkins, Thomas M.1 aWashington, John W.0 tChemosphere.g2016 Oct., v. 161 p.333-341dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.06.1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02082naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245011800174300001600292520103800308592002801346650003001374650001301404650003201417650001401449653001501463653002401478653001601502653001401518653001701532700002201549773008301571856008101654852000901735655001201744IND60687636920221120030542.0200402e20200320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068763692DNAL7 a10.1163/1568539X-000035872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHumphreys, Rosalind K.10aDo orientation and substrate influence apparent turning biases by the 7-spot ladybird, Coccinella septempunctata?  ap. 205-230.  aHow foraging predators explore their environment is a fundamental aspect of predator-prey interactions. Girling et al. (2007) tested Coccinella septempunctata in a Y-maze, finding that approximately 45% of individuals displayed significant turning biases. We extend the work of Girling et al. in three ways: (1) turning bias was tested on vertical as well as horizontal structures, (2) turning bias was tested on natural Y-shaped twigs as well as artificial twigs and (3) turning bias was recorded both as the pre-designated ‘left’ or ‘right’ physical branch selected and from the perspective of ladybirds. No significant patterns of ‘handedness’ were apparent with vertical orientation, on either substrate. With horizontal orientation, significant turning biases were exhibited on artificial but not natural twigs. Overall, although turning biases are theoretically efficient when searching branched structures, we propose that in natural environments ladybirds will base their foraging movements on environmental cues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoccinella septempunctata 3aforaging 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredators 0ahandedness 0aforaging efficiency 0aorientation 0asubstrate 0aturning bias1 aRuxton, Graeme D.0 tBehaviour.g, v. 157, no. 3-4 p.205-230dBrillwJournal:11664x0005-79597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568539X-000035873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01840naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011000158300001600268520057300284592002800857650001800885650001100903650002000914650001600934650002800950650001400978650002300992651001201015653001801027653001201045653002001057653001601077700002001093700002901113700001901142700001901161700002001180700001901200773010301219856007501322852000901397655001201406IND60560181020221119064322.0170103e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056018102DNAL7 a10.5252/a2016n2a12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuy , Nong Van12aA new combination and a new species in Phlegmariurus (Herter) Holub (Lycopodiaceae) from Southern Vietnam  ap. 151-157.  aA new combination is proposed for Phlegmariurus (Herter) Holub (Lycopodiaceae): P. obovalifolius (Bonap.)

Here we present a novel result that the Wh6 strain with type Chinese 1, which is predominantly prevalent in China, induces Arg1 expression in a STAT6-dependent manner in primary rat peritoneal macrophages as compared to the PRU stain with type II, which elicited a high expression of Arg1 in a C/EBPβ-dependent manner. In addition, dexamethasone inhibited Arg1 expression in rat macrophages in both treatments. Our data suggest that Arg1 expression, which is abundant in polarized M2 cells, is associated with strain/genotype differences from different pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aarginase 3adexamethasone 3agenotype 3amacrophages 3amice 3arats 3aChina1 aHe, Liuyuan1 aKong, Lanting1 aZhang, Yihua1 aChen, He1 aAn, Ran1 aWang, Lu1 aWang, Weiwei1 aXu, Xiucai1 aZhang, Aimei1 aCai, Yihong1 aLi, Min1 aWen, Huiqin1 aLuo, Qingli1 aShen, Jilong0 tJournal of parasitology.g2015 Aug., v. 101, no. 4 p.418-423dAmerican Society of Parasitologistsx0022-33957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1645%2F14-696.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011800157300001800275500002000293520133800313592002801651650002101679650001701700650001601717650002601733650002101759650001301780650001201793700001901805700001301824700001701837700001601854700001801870773011301888856007402001852000902075655001202084IND60571934920221122163225.0170712e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057193492DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.285682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yawen10aPhotoactive Polymers with Benzocyclobutene/Silacyclobutane Dual Crosslinked Structure and Low Dielectric Constant  ap. 1920-1928.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLow dielectric photopatternable materials have aroused much interest owing to their potential application as alternatives of conventional photoresists. Although a number of photosensitive groups have been established to construct photopatternable materials for many years, it is still a challenge to introduce them into polymer chains via a facile and control polymerization technique, such as living free radical polymerization. In this work, on the basis of the photoactive silaycyclobutene moiety, a new monomer, 1‐methyl‐1‐(4‐vinylphenyl) silacyclobutane (1‐MVPSCB), was synthesized and demonstrated successful to conduct atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Subsequently, the copolymerization of 1‐MVPSCB with 4‐vinylbenzocyclobutene (4‐VBCB) and styrene produced a kind of benzocyclobutene/silacyclobutane double‐crosslinked polymer (BS‐DCP) with controlled benzocyclobutene/silacyclobutane ratios and low polydispersity index. Owing to the UV/thermally dual crosslinked structure, BS‐DCP possesses photapatternability, high dimensional stability and low dielectric constant (2.37 at 10 MHz). These properties make BS‐DCP a potential photoresist that could be directly used as interconnected dielectrics. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym.

Phenol-producing activity was found in 36 strains and p-cresol-producing activity in 55 strains. Fourteen strains had both types of activity. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains that produced 100 µM or more of phenols revealed that 16 phenol producers belonged to the Coriobacteriaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Fusobacteriaceae and Clostridium clusters I and XIVa; four p-cresol-producing bacteria belonged to the Coriobacteriaceae and Clostridium clusters XI and XIVa; and one strain producing both belonged to the Coriobacteriaceae. A genomic search for protein homologs of enzymes involved in the metabolism of tyrosine to phenols in 10 phenol producers and four p-cresol producers, the draft genomes of which were available in public databases, predicted that phenol producers harbored tyrosine phenol-lyase or hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylase, or both, and p-cresol producers harbored p-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylase or tyrosine lyase, or both. These results provide important information about the bacterial strains that contribute to production of phenols in the intestine.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a4-hydroxybenzoic acid 3aClostridium 3aCoriobacteriaceae 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3aFusobacteriaceae 3abacteria 3aculture media 3adatabases 3aenzymes 3agenome 3agenomics 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3anucleotide sequences 3ap-cresol 3aphenol 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3atyrosine 0aintestinal bacteria 0ametabolite 0aphylogenetic analysis1 aSato, Tadashi1 aNomoto, Koji1 aTsuji, Hirokazu0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2018 June 22, v. 94, no. 9dOxford University PresswJournal:1989x1574-69417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiy1253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245011500168300001400283500002000297520146700317592002801784650001401812650001001826650002201836650001901858650001001877650001101887650002201898650001601920650001601936650001301952650001101965650001001976650001301986650001601999650002602015650002702041650002302068650002302091650001402114650001102128650002202139650001302161650001002174700002302184700002202207700003002229700001802259700001902277700002202296700002802318700002202346773010402368856008402472852000902556655001202565IND60562233220221118163524.0220805e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056223322DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM-04-16-0108-FI2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarengo, Mauro10aMacromolecular and Micronutrient Profiles of Sprouted Chickpeas to Be Used for Integrating Cereal‐Based Food  ap. 82-88.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPulse flour may be used to improve nutritional traits of gluten and gluten‐free formulations in traditional food such as bread or pasta. However, owing to some intrinsic nutritional, textural, and sensory properties, the use of pulses as ingredients for production of enriched food remains limited. In this study, we investigated the modification in macromolecules and micronutrients in industrial‐scale flour from partially sprouted chickpeas to define its possible use as an ingredient in cereal‐based foods. Controlled sprouting resulted in significant decrease of antinutritional compounds (e.g., phytic acid and serine protease inhibitors) and in an increase of free minerals and vitamins. Sprouting also affected the overall structural organization of proteins (such as aggregate formation) and their thiol/disulfide balance, and it promoted release of peptides. All of these had a positive effect on dough mixing properties, in particular for dough development. Formulations with enrichment in sprouted chickpea flour (wheat/chickpea ratio = 100:20) were tested also as for their dough leavening properties, which improved with respect to flour from nonsprouted chickpeas. Taking into account the modifications induced by partial sprouting on an industrial scale, we can conclude that sprouted chickpea flour represents an interesting ingredient for production of enriched cereal‐based food with better nutritional and rheological characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3achickpeas 3adough 3adough development 3aenriched foods 3aflour 3agluten 3agluten-free foods 3agrain foods 3aingredients 3aminerals 3amixing 3apasta 3apeptides 3aphytic acid 3aproteinase inhibitors 3arheological properties 3asensory properties 3aserine proteinases 3asprouting 3athiols 3atraditional foods 3avitamins 3awheat1 aCarpen, Aristodemo1 aBonomi, Francesco1 aCasiraghi, Maria Cristina1 aMeroni, Erika1 aQuaglia, Lucio1 aIametti, Stefania1 aPagani, Maria Ambrogina1 aMarti, Alessandra0 tCereal chemistry.g2017 Jan., v. 94, no. 1 p.82-88dCereal ChemistrywJournal:1935x0009-03527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM-04-16-0108-FI3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245010300210300001400313506007600327520110200403592002801505506003701533650001601570650001001586650000901596650001101605650001101616650001301627650001501640650000901655700002801664700002801692700002501720700002601745700002401771700002001795700002101815700002401836700001901860700002301879700001701902700002001919700002501939700001901964700002101983700006402004773007302068856008202141852000902223655001202232IND60092701520221207121721.0161019e20130926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009270152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2013.08.0302doi7 aPMC38445542pmcid7 a240748612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlair, David R.12aA Nondegenerate Code of Deleterious Variants in Mendelian Loci Contributes to Complex Disease Risk  ap. 70-80.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough countless highly penetrant variants have been associated with Mendelian disorders, the genetic etiologies underlying complex diseases remain largely unresolved. By mining the medical records of over 110 million patients, we examine the extent to which Mendelian variation contributes to complex disease risk. We detect thousands of associations between Mendelian and complex diseases, revealing a nondegenerate, phenotypic code that links each complex disorder to a unique collection of Mendelian loci. Using genome-wide association results, we demonstrate that common variants associated with complex diseases are enriched in the genes indicated by this “Mendelian code.” Finally, we detect hundreds of comorbidity associations among Mendelian disorders, and we use probabilistic genetic modeling to demonstrate that Mendelian variants likely contribute nonadditively to the risk for a subset of complex diseases. Overall, this study illustrates a complementary approach for mapping complex disease loci and provides unique predictions concerning the etiologies of specific diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomorbidity 3agenes 3aloci 3amining 3amodels 3apatients 3aprediction 3arisk1 aLyttle, Christopher S.1 aMortensen, Jonathan M.1 aBearden, Charles F.1 aJensen, Anders Boeck1 aKhiabanian, Hossein1 aMelamed, Rachel1 aRabadán, Raúl,1 aBernstam, Elmer V.1 aBrunak, Søren1 aJensen, Lars Juhl1 aNicolae, Dan1 aShah, Nigam H.1 aGrossman, Robert L.1 aCox, Nancy J.,1 aWhite, Kevin P.1 aRzhet︠s︡kiĭ, A.

Here we use a novel approach to explore the effects of stochastic variation on life-history evolution and estimate the selection pressures operating on the monocarpic perennial Carlina vulgaris, in which flowering may be delayed by up to eight years. The approach is novel in that we use modern theoretical techniques to estimate selection pressures and the fitness landscape from a fully parameterised individual-based model. These approaches take into account temporal variation in demographic rates and density dependence. Analysis of 16 years' data revealed significant temporal variation in growth, mortality, and recruitment in our study population. Flowering was strongly size dependent and, unusually for such a species, also age dependent. Individual-based models of the flowering strategy, parameterized using field data, consistently underestimated the size at flowering, when temporal variation in demographic rates was ignored. In contrast, models that incorporated temporal variation in growth, mortality, and recruitment predicted sizes at flowering not significantly different from those observed in the field. Temporal variation in mortality, which had the largest effect on the flowering strategy, selected for increased size at flowering. An analytical approximation is presented to explain this result, extending the ““1-year look-ahead criterion”” presented in Rees et al. (2000). A fitness landscape generated by following the fate of rare mutant invaders with a broad range of alternative flowering strategies demonstrated that the observed parameters were adaptive. However, the fitness landscape reveals that approximately equal fitness is achieved by a broad range of strategies, providing a mechanism for the maintenance of genetic variation. To understand how the different parameters that defined our models determine the fitness of rare mutants, we numerically estimated the elasticities and sensitivities of mutant fitness. This demonstrated strong selection on a number of the parameters. Elasticities and sensitivities estimated in constant and random environments were significantly positively correlated, and both were negatively related to the standard error of the parameter. This last result is surprising and, we argue, reflects the genetic and phenotypic responses to selection.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDelayed reproduction 0aelasticity 0afitness landscape 0agenetic variation 0astochastic variation1 aRees, Mark1 aGrubb, P.

Medium‐chain‐triglycerides (MCT) have specific metabolic properties and they are described as ketogenic even without restriction of carbohydrate. Octanoic acid (C8) is the main MCT showing this effect. Rotenone is a neurotoxin that is used to induce experimental PD model. Rotenone inhibits mitochondrial respiratory complex 1 (MRC1) and causes reactive oxygen species formation. Mass spectrometry (MS)‐based phosphoproteomic methods enable discovering specific signaling events in special molecular pathways through identification and quantification of phosphoproteins. Signaling networks involved in rotenone‐mediated biological processes and beneficial effects of MCTs on neurodegenerative diseases are not well understood. We aimed to gain comprehensive molecular perspective on the global phosphoproteome differences in rotenone‐exposed zebrafish treated with octanoic acid. Raw files obtained from MS analysis were processed and searched against the Danio rerio protein database using SEQUEST‐HT algorithm to identify and quantify phosphopeptides with 2,569 unique phosphoproteins and 4,161 unique phosphopeptides corresponding to 2005 proteins. Microtubule‐associated protein (MAP) family members were significantly lower in rotenone group. Phosphoproteins involved in ion binding (calcium, magnesium, zinc ion), oxygen binding, microtubule binding, ATP‐ and GTP‐binding were among differentially expressed 347 proteins in rotenone group and they were reversed after octanoic acid treatments. Phosphoproteins and phosphorylation sites were identified for future exploration of signaling pathways involved in rotenone toxicity. We believe our findings might help in the formulation of effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of PD using ketogenic formulations involving MCTs. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Ketosis is a potentially beneficial metabolic state for health especially in neurological conditions including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Medium‐chain‐triglycerides (MCT) (C6–C12) have specific metabolic properties making them described as ketogenic even without restriction of carbohydrate. Octanoic acid (caprylic acid, C8) is the main MCT showing this effect. Our findings might help in the formulation of effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease using ketogenic formulations involving Medium‐chain‐triglycerides.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019/013cScientific Research Projects Coordination Unit of University of Health Sciences 3aDanio rerio 3aalgorithms 3acalcium 3acarbohydrates 3adatabases 3aketosis 3amagnesium 3amass spectrometry 3amicrotubules 3amitochondria 3amodels 3aneurotoxins 3aoctanoic acid 3aoxygen 3aphosphopeptides 3aphosphoproteins 3aphosphoproteome 3aphosphorylation 3aproteomics 3areactive oxygen species 3arotenone 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 3azinc1 aSürmen, Saime1 aCansız, Derya1 aÜnal, İsmail,1 aÜstündağ, Ünsal Veli1 aAlturfan, Ahmet Ata1 aEmekli‐Alturfan, Ebru1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2419-85870 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2021 Oct., v. 45, no. 10 p.e13923-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.139233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245010500164300001600269520123800285592002801523650001701551650001101568650002201579650001201601650002001613650001601633650001101649650002401660650002101684650001701705650002001722651001301742651001701755653001301772653000901785653001701794653002201811700001501833700001501848700001401863700001901877700001601896700001401912773009101926856008502017852000902102655001202111IND60651022220221122022533.0190815e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065102222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.06.1662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Bin12aA novel strategy for a building-integrated diurnal photovoltaic and all-day radiative cooling system  ap. 892-900.  aFor rooftop building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) technology, photovoltaic (PV) modules are typically mounted on the sunny side of a rooftop to receive a high amount of solar irradiance, whereas the opposite side of the rooftop will have free space. This study proposed a novel strategy for building-integrated PV and radiative cooling (RC) system, namely BIPV−RC system, by covering the sunny side of a rooftop with PV modules and its free side with all-day RC modules to integrate solar energy collection and RC utilization into a single building unit. A mathematical model was developed for the proposed BIPV−RC system and a case study was conducted in two tropical cities (Karachi, Pakistan and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia). Results show the total electricity and cooling output of the BIPV−RC system in Riyadh is 462.1 kWh·m−2 and 1315.3 MJ m−2, respectively, approximately 20.7% and 94.0% higher than those in Karachi. Moreover, a comparative study between the BIPV−RC system and the common BIPV and building-integrated RC (BIRC) system was performed and results indicate that the annual total energy output of the BIPV−RC system is nearly 79.1% and 16.8% higher than that of BIPV and BIRC system, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acities 3acomparative study 3acooling 3acooling systems 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3amathematical models 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3aPakistan 3aSaudi Arabia 0aBuilding 0aBIPV 0aPhotovoltaic 0aRadiative cooling1 aHu, Mingke1 aAo, Xianze1 aChen, Nuo1 aXuan, Qingdong1 aSu, Yuehong1 aPei, Gang0 tEnergy.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 183 p.892-900dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.06.1663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245010900212300001400321506007600335520120100411592002801612506003701640650002501677650002001702650001401722650002001736650001601756650001501772650002001787650001001807650001301817650001701830650001001847650001501857650002401872650000901896650001301905650001401918650001301932700001701945700002301962700001401985700002901999700001702028700002002045700002202065700002002087700002102107700002202128773008002150856008202230852000902312655001202321IND60092701620221207135221.0141103e20130926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009270162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2013.09.0022doi7 aPMC38448712pmcid7 a240748622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadmanabhan, Nisha10aMutation in Folate Metabolism Causes Epigenetic Instability and Transgenerational Effects on Development  ap. 81-93.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe importance of maternal folate consumption for normal development is well established, yet the molecular mechanism linking folate metabolism to development remains poorly understood. The enzyme methionine synthase reductase (Mtrr) is necessary for utilization of methyl groups from the folate cycle. We found that a hypomorphic mutation of the mouse Mtrr gene results in intrauterine growth restriction, developmental delay, and congenital malformations, including neural tube, heart, and placental defects. Importantly, these defects were dependent upon the Mtrr genotypes of the maternal grandparents. Furthermore, we observed widespread epigenetic instability associated with altered gene expression in the placentas of wild-type grandprogeny of Mtrr-deficient maternal grandparents. Embryo transfer experiments revealed that Mtrr deficiency in mice lead to two distinct, separable phenotypes: adverse effects on their wild-type daughters’ uterine environment, leading to growth defects in wild-type grandprogeny, and the appearance of congenital malformations independent of maternal environment that persist for five generations, likely through transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabnormal development 3aadverse effects 3adaughters 3aembryo transfer 3aepigenetics 3afolic acid 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenotype 3agrandparents 3aheart 3ametabolism 3amethionine synthase 3amice 3amutation 3aphenotype 3aplacenta1 aJia, Dongxin1 aGeary-Joo, Colleen1 aWu, Xuchu1 aFerguson-Smith, Anne C.,1 aFung, Ernest1 aBieda, Mark C.1 aSnyder, Floyd F.1 aGravel, Roy A.1 aCross, James C.1 aWatson, Erica D.0 tCell.g2013 Sept. 26, v. 155, no. 1 p.81-93dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100001600153245014700169300001400316500001500330520118000345592002801525650001601553650001001569650001701579650001501596650001201611650002701623650001501650650001301665650001601678650002301694651000901717653001001726700001601736700002301752700002901775700002201804773008801826856008901914852000902003655001202012IND4449713820221122235437.0141110e20110225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444971382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2010.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgata, Yuka12aA Laotian strain of the rotifer Brachionus angularis holds promise as a food source for small-mouthed larvae of freshwater fish in aquaculture  ap. 72-76.  a2019-12-06  aA very small strain of the freshwater rotifer Brachionus angularis (Laos strain) was isolated in Vientiane, Laos. We investigated the morphology as well as grazing and growth characteristics of this strain. The lorica of the Laos strain was round, 86.0±4.9μm (mean±SD) in length, with a few small spines. These morphological characteristics make the strain an appropriate live food for small-mouthed larvae of freshwater fish. The rotifer's grazing rate on Chlorella vulgaris increased in a density-dependent manner up to approximately 10×10⁶algalcellsml⁻¹. The rotifer filtering rate was stable (ca. 100μl per individual per hour [ind.⁻¹h⁻¹]) at 0.5–10×10⁶algalcellsml⁻¹ and declined to 30–50μlind.⁻¹h⁻¹ at a higher C. vulgaris density (20×10⁶cellsml⁻¹). In batch cultures, the rotifer strain grew well at 24°C and 27°C when fed with algal densities of 7×10⁶ and 10×10⁶cellsml⁻¹; under these conditions, the rotifer density reached >2000ind.ml⁻¹ within 10days. Life history parameters were obtained using the individual culture method. The generation time became shorter at higher temperatures and higher algal densities.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3afoods 3alife history 3alive feeds 3agrazing 3afreshwater aquaculture 3afish feeds 3aRotifera 3afish larvae 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aLaos 0aspine1 aTokue, Yuri1 aYoshikawa, Takashi1 aHagiwara, A.q(Atsushi),1 aKurokura, Hisashi0 tAquaculture.g2011 Feb. 25, v. 312, no. 1-4 p.72-76dElsevier B.V.x0044-84867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2010.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01968naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245007600163300001600239520103900255592002801294650002301322650002201345650001901367650001801386650001601404650001001420650001301430700001301443773014301456856004601599852000901645655001201654IND50088882420221122063341.0140418e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008888242DNAL7 a10.1111/1541-4337.120622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Jinkai10aSurface‐Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy for the Chemical Analysis of Food  ap. 317-328.  aSurface‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is an emerging and promising technique for the chemical analysis of food. The use of metallic nanosubstrates improves the sensitivity and capacity of conventional Raman spectroscopy greatly. This paper comprehensively reviews the development and applications of SERS in the chemical analysis of food, mainly focusing on food additives and chemical contaminants. The progress of SERS development and their applications in chemical analysis of food, from detection and characterization of target analytes in simple solvents to complex food matrices, is summarized. The advantages and limitations of different SERS substrates and methodologies are discussed. As most of the current SERS research on chemical analysis of food is still in an early stage, there are still several hurdles for further advancing SERS techniques into real‐world applications for complex food products. This review includes our perspectives on the future trends of the SERS technique in the field of food analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3achemical analysis 3afood additives 3afood analysis 3afood matrix 3afoods 3asolvents1 aHe, Lili0 tComprehensive reviews in food science and food safety.g2014 May, v. 13, no. 3 p.317-328dInstitute of Food Technologistsx1541-43377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.12062  aDNAL 7aarticle03377naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245025200197300001400449500002000463520171700483592002802200596006902228596004902297650001202346650001802358650001002376650001402386650001102400650000902411650003302420650002702453650002102480650004302501650001602544650001402560650001702574650002302591700001802614700002102632700005402653773013002707856007302837852000902910655001202919IND60627778120221120144118.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062777812DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.133272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Haitao T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2332-639110aAmino acids profile within peripheral blood and follicular fluid based on high‐performance liquid chromatography methods may explain differences in folliculogenesis between short‐term under/over‐fed treatments during luteal phase of Hu sheep  ap. 72-82.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe nutritional alteration of amino acids (AAs) profile in physiological fluid was poorly characterized in livestock. After oestrus synchronization, 24 ewes were randomly assigned to two groups based on the nutrient requirement recommended for maintenance (M): the feed‐supplemented group (S, 1.5 × M, N = 12) and feed‐restricted group (R, 0.5 × M, N = 12) on days 6–12 of their oestrous cycle, which occurred shortly before ovulation. The concentration of 30 AAs in peripheral blood (PB) and follicular fluid (FF) was quantified to calculate the PB‐to‐FF concentration gap for each AA and determine its correlation with metabolites and hormones in PB and FF. Results showed that the feed restriction enlarged the oestrous cycle length, decreased the number of follicles 2.5–3.5 mm, increased the number of follicles >3.5 mm and augmented the volume of follicles >2.5 mm. Nineteen AAs from PB were significantly different between the groups. The phosphoethanolamine (PEtN) and ration of essential AAs to nonessential AAs (EAA/NEAA) in FF significantly (p < 0.05) increased and decreased in the R group, respectively. Most AAs, except aspartate (Asp) and carnosine (Car) in the R group and alanine (aAla) in both groups, were significantly lower within FF than those within PB. The correlation of AAs with FSH and progesterone (P₄) was more significant than that of AAs with other endocrine milieu characteristics. In conclusion, our results revealed that the influence of short‐term nutritional manipulation during luteal phase on folliculogenesis might not be due to the variation of intrafollicular AAs profile but rather attribute to the peripheral blood AAs profile alteration.  aPublisher supplied data  aBE2015362cKey Research and Development Plan of Jiangsu Province  aCARS‐38cChina Agriculture Research System 3aalanine 3aaspartic acid 3ablood 3acarnosine 3aestrus 3aewes 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3afollicular development 3afollicular fluid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3aovulation 3aprogesterone 3arestricted feeding1 aWang, Zi‐yu1 aZhang, Guomin M.1 aWang, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4729-518X0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2019 Jan., v. 54, no. 1 p.72-82dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.133273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011100156300001800267520140500285592002801690650001901718650002201737650001001759650001601769650001601785650002101801700001701822773011001839856007501949852000902024655001202033IND60529164420221118152448.0160717e20120306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052916442DNAL7 a10.1021/ac20294252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopes, Paula10aChiral Interactions of the Drug Propranolol and α1-Acid-Glycoprotein at a Micro Liquid–Liquid Interface  ap. 2299-2304.  aThe investigation of chiral interactions of drugs with plasma proteins is of fundamental importance for drug efficacy and toxicity studies. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple liquid–liquid interface procedure for investigating chiral interactions. Chiral discrimination of the enantiomers of a basic drug, propranolol, was achieved at a micro liquid–liquid interface, using α₁-acid-glycoprotein (AGP) as a chiral acute phase plasma protein. When the protein is added to an aqueous phase containing the enantiomers of propranalol hydrochloride, the binding of (S)- and (R)-propranolol hydrochloride to the protein results in a decrease in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) current responses corresponding to the decrease in transfer of propranolol at an aqueous–1,2-dichloroethane interface. This decrease is a consequence of the complexation of the drug and the protein. The complex drug–protein does not transfer across the interface nor changes the transfer potential of the uncomplexed form of propranolol enantiomers. The bound concentration of propranolol enantiomers in the presence of AGP was found to be greater for (S)-propranolol than (R)-propranolol for solutions containing constant concentrations of AGP (50 μM). Scatchard analysis yielded association constants of 2.7 and 1.3 × 10⁵ M–¹ for (S)- and (R)-propranolol, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood proteins 3adrug interactions 3adrugs 3aenantiomers 3apropranolol 3atoxicity testing1 aKataky, Ritu0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 Mar. 06, v. 84, no. 5 p.2299-2304dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac20294253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002700145245014000172300001600312520174200328592002802070650001602098650001402114650002602128650001902154650001602173650001802189650001202207650002702219650001302246650001102259700002102270700002202291700001702313700002202330700002302352773014302375856004602518852000902564655001202573IND50088882520221122063404.0140418e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008888252DNAL7 a10.1111/1541-4337.120592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoelants, Katlijn R.N.12aA Review on the Relationships between Processing, Food Structure, and Rheological Properties of Plant‐Tissue‐Based Food Suspensions  ap. 241-260.  aNowadays, there is much interest in controlling the functional properties of processed fruit‐ and vegetable‐derived products, which has stimulated renewed research interest in process–structure–function relations. In this review, we focus on rheology as a functional property because of its importance during the entire production chain up to the moment of consumption and digestion. This review covers the literature of the past decade with respect to process–structure–rheology relations in plant‐tissue‐based food suspensions. It became clear that the structure of plant‐tissue‐based food suspensions, consisting of plant‐tissue‐based particles in an aqueous serum phase, is affected by many unit operations (for example, heat treatment) and that also the sequence of unit operations can have an effect on the final structural properties. Furthermore, particle concentration, particle size, and particle morphology were found to be key structural elements determining the rheological properties of these suspensions comprising low amounts of starch and serum pectin. Since the structure of plant‐tissue‐based products was shown to be changed during processing, rheological parameters of these products were simultaneously altered. Therefore, this review also comprises a discussion of the effect on rheological properties of the most relevant processing steps in the production of plant‐tissue‐based products. Linking changes in rheology due to processing with process‐induced alterations in structural characteristics turned out to be quite intricate. The current knowledge on process–structure–function relations can form the basis for future improved and novel food process and product design.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3adigestion 3afunctional properties 3aheat treatment 3anovel foods 3aparticle size 3apectins 3arheological properties 3arheology 3astarch1 aCardinaels, Ruth1 aBuggenhout, Sandy1 aLoey, Ann M.1 aMoldenaers, Paula1 aHendrickx, Marc E.0 tComprehensive reviews in food science and food safety.g2014 May, v. 13, no. 3 p.241-260dInstitute of Food Technologistsx1541-43377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.12059  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245013400169300001400303520211300317592002802430650002402458650002202482650001002504650001202514650000802526650001602534650001202550650001102562653001502573653003302588653001202621653001602633653001602649700002402665700002902689773012102718856008302839852000902922655001202931IND60527168220221117101920.0190412e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052716822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jveb.2015.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranchi, Valeria10aFur chewing and other abnormal repetitive behaviors in chinchillas (Chinchilla lanigera), under commercial fur-farming conditions  ap. 60-64.  aFur chewing is a behavioral disorder frequently reported in chinchillas kept for fur-farming purposes. Rodents kept in barren cages usually develop some form of abnormal repetitive behavior, which can indicate a past or present welfare problem. Fur chewing may not be the only form of abnormal repetitive behavior present but is the one reported because of its direct repercussion on fur production. The aim of this study was to describe the frequency of occurrence of fur chewing and the distribution of time dedicated to it in chinchillas diagnosed as presenting this behavior. A secondary aim was to determine the presentation of other abnormal repetitive behaviors. Ten chinchillas, 5 fur chewers and 5 controls, were video recorded for 24 hours with an infrared camera. Behavioral analysis was done with The Observer XT from Noldus (The Netherlands). Focal sampling and continual recording were used, the 24-hour time budget was calculated, and abnormal repetitive behaviors were analyzed in terms of time dedication and frequency of presentation. A paired t test was used to compare differences in the amount of nocturnal versus daytime abnormal behavior. When normality was not met, a 2-sample t test and randomization test were used to compare data between treatments. No differences were observed between the time budgets of fur-chewing and control chinchillas, and all individuals exhibited more than one abnormal repetitive behavior. The amount of time devoted to abnormal repetitive behaviors was significantly higher during night in both groups and reached its lowest level between 13:00 and 17:00 hours. Fur chewing is not the only abnormal repetitive behavior developed by chinchillas in fur-farming systems, although it is the only one reported by the producer. The presence of bar chewing, cage scratching, and backflipping should also be welfare concerns. The higher presentation of abnormal repetitive behaviors at night may be associated with the lack of recognition by the producer, especially because these abnormal behaviors do not result in direct product loss as does fur chewing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinchilla lanigera 3aabnormal behavior 3acages 3acameras 3afur 3amastication 3arodents 3at-test 0achinchilla 0aabnormal repetitive behavior 0awelfare 0afur-farming 0afur-chewing1 aAleuy, O.

On the basis of clinical manifestations and progression of the lesion, combined with previous treatments and different diagnostic investigations, hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans (HrCLM) disease was hypothesized. Albendazole was employed as treatment and the resolution of the symptoms confirmed the diagnosis. The relevance of the reported case relies on 3 main aspects: the acquisition of the disease in Italy, the initial treatment with topical corticosteroids that sped up the progression of the cutaneous trail, and the uncommon location of the lesions. Furthermore, the anamnestic data and the laboratory/clinical investigations strongly suggested an occupational exposure to the etiological agent. As illustrated here, HrCLM might represent a challenge for Western physicians in terms of diagnosis, treatment, and ways of acquisition. Describing the clinical presentation and the treatment of cases of cutaneous larva migrans might contribute to early and correct diagnosis, to an increase of our knowledge on this disease, and to an update on its epidemiology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadrenal cortex hormones 3aalbendazole 3aarms (limbs) 3acase studies 3aepidemiology 3aetiological agents 3alarva migrans 3aoccupational exposure 3apatients 3aphysicians 3aItaly1 aAhmed, S.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of these subsoil-specific gas conditions, which were measured in the field, on the decomposition of native soil organic C (SOC) and plant residues. Soil samples were taken on two neighbouring arable sites; one with high and the other with low SOC contents below 30cm depth. An incubation experiment was carried out for 176days, using gas conditions with reduced O2 and increased CO2, matching gas conditions measured in subsoil. Three different gas concentrations were used in the experiment: Ambient, medium (17% O2; 4% CO2) and extreme (13% O2; 8% CO2). These gas treatments were applied to samples with and without the addition of C4 plant residues to the sampled soil. We determined the effects of these treatments on contents of SOC, microbial biomass C (MBC) and fungal ergosterol. Plant residue addition caused negative priming effects on SOC mineralisation in the subsoils. The contribution of plant-derived to total MBC was reduced under medium and extreme gas conditions (topsoil: 31%; subsoil: 54%). However, neither medium nor extreme gas conditions had general effects on MBC and microbial activity indices. There was no evidence that changes in the soil atmosphere are a major factor controlling C sequestration in subsoil. However, some results indicate that changes in soil atmospheric conditions do have an impact on microbial substrate use, which should be considered in C sequestration research in subsoil.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3amineralization 3aC4 plants 3asoil organic carbon 3aplant residues 3amicrobial biomass 3asoil air 3acarbon sequestration 3afungi 3atopsoil 3asoil sampling 3amicrobial activity 3aoxygen 3aergosterol 0aGas conditions 0aorganic matter 0aDecomposition 0aC-turnover 0aSubsoil 0aMicrobial biomass1 aDyckmans, Jens1 aJoergensen, Rainer Georg0 tGeoderma.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 292 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245010200159300001600261520127500277592002801552650001901580650002201599650001201621650001101633650000901644650001001653650001401663651002401677651001501701700002201716773011901738856007401857852000901931655001201940IND60466570320221118001936.0151126e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046657032DNAL7 a10.1645/15-731.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarton, Diane P.10aAcanthocephalan Cystacanths from Flatfish (Order Pleuronectiformes) in Tropical Australian Waters  ap. 429-435.  aCystacanths of 4 species of Acanthocephala are reported for the first time from various species of fish belonging to the Order Pleuronectiformes from waters of the western Gulf of Carpentaria and the central coast of Queensland, Australia: Corynosoma cetaceum Johnston and Best, 1942 (Family Polymorphidae), Serrasentis cf. sagittifer (Linton, 1889) and Rhadinorhynchus sp. (Family Rhadinorhynchidae), and Gorgorhynchoides sp. (Family Isthmosacanthidae). Approximately 32% of the 515 individual fish belonging to 24 species were infected with at least 1 cystacanth. Serrasentis cf. sagittifer was the most-commonly encountered, infecting a total of 18 species of fish across both regions. Gorgorhynchoides sp. infected 7 fish species in the Gulf of Carpentaria only while Rhadinorhynchus sp. (1 fish species) and C. cetaceum (7 fish species) were only found on the central coast of Queensland. Most fish were infected with a single cystacanth of any species. There was no relationship between total length of fish and intensity of infection for any species. This paper provides information on parasite infections in fish hosts commonly caught as by-catch and outlines the need for further studies on these fish to be able to determine sustainability of such fish stocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthocephala 3aPleuronectiformes 3abycatch 3acoasts 3afish 3ahosts 3aparasites 3aGulf of Carpentaria 3aQueensland1 aSmales, Lesley R.0 tJournal of parasitology.g2015 Aug., v. 101, no. 4 p.429-435dAmerican Society of Parasitologistsx0022-33957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1645%2F15-731.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245008500163300001600248520129400264592002801558650003101586650001601617650000901633650001601642650002201658650001001680650001601690653002301706653001701729653002701746653002701773700001901800773009101819856008501910852000901995655001202004IND60651022620221122022501.0190815e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065102262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.06.1822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lifu10aInvestigation on steam direct injection in a natural gas engine for fuel savings  ap. 958-970.  aIn order to improve the natural gas engine (NGE) fuel economy, a steam direct injection method has been presented in the present study. In this method, exhaust was employed to heat water to produce superheated steam firstly. After that, at the power stroke, steam was injected into the cylinder directly. The potentials for fuel savings by this method are evaluated. First, ideal thermodynamic cycle of steam injected NGE is analyzed. Then, a baseline NGE is modeled and validated through experiments. After that, based on the simulation model, the effects of different steam injection parameters on the NGE performance are discussed, including steam mass, temperature and injected timing. The results show that the NGE fuel economy is significantly improved with steam direct injection. With optimal steam mass, 3.9–5.2% reductions of the NGE brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) are obtained over different speeds, when steam temperature and injected timing are 550 K and 50 deg, respectively. Steam mass and injected timing have great influences on the NGE BSFC. However, steam mass is limited by pinch point temperature difference of the evaporator and exhaust temperature at the evaporator exit. In addition, steam injected timing is restricted by pressure inside the cylinder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy use and consumption 3agas engines 3aheat 3anatural gas 3asimulation models 3asteam 3atemperature 0aNatural gas engine 0aFuel savings 0aSteam direct injection 0aWaste heat utilization1 aZhang, Zhongbo0 tEnergy.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 183 p.958-970dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.06.1823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007900148245015600227300001400383520162700397592002802024650002002052650001802072650001202090650001902102650001602121650002102137650001902158650002002177650001602197650002702213650001602240650001202256650002202268650002502290650001602315653002102331653002402352653001302376653001602389700002502405700002402430700002002454773012102474856008302595852000902678655001202687IND60527168620221117102409.0190412e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052716862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jveb.2015.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgbuniwe, Ifeanyichukwu Chukwuemeka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7658-982210aEffects of betaine and ascorbic acid on tonic immobility, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in broiler chickens during the hot-dry season  ap. 60-65.  aThe aim of the study was to evaluate effects of betaine and ascorbic acid (AA) on tonic immobility (TI), and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in broiler chickens, reared during the hot-dry season. Eighty White Ross breed day-old broilers were divided into 4 groups. Group I (control) was given sterile water; group II, betaine (250 mg/kg); group III, AA (50 mg/kg), and group IV, betaine + AA, at 250 + 50 mg/kg, respectively. The administration was done orally in drinking water and daily for 42 days. The duration of TI of each bird was measured. Serum obtained from blood samples collected from the birds were assayed for activities of the enzymes. The dry-bulb temperature (28.33°C-35.67°C), relative humidity (69.0-93.0%), and temperature-humidity index (27.85-36.1), recorded during the study period showed that the birds were subjected to heat stress. Betaine and its coadministration with AA decreased (P < 0.05) TI duration compared to the control group. Betaine + AA significantly increased (P < 0.01) SOD activity compared with the controls. There were significant increases in GPx activity in broiler chickens in betaine (P < 0.01), AA (P < 0.05), and betaine + AA (P < 0.001) groups, when compared with that of controls. The result demonstrates that betaine and/or AA decreased TI and enhanced activities of the antioxidant enzymes in heat-stressed birds. It is concluded that the administration of betaine and/or AA to broiler chickens alleviates the adverse effects of heat stress by decreasing fearfulness and increasing activities of SOD and GPx enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aascorbic acid 3abetaine 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3abroiler chickens 3adrinking water 3aenzyme activity 3afearfulness 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aheat stress 3arearing 3arelative humidity 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atemperature 0atonic immobility 0aantioxidant enzymes 0abroilers 0aheat stress1 aAyo, Joseph Olusegun1 aKawu, Mohammed Umar1 aMohammed, Aliyu0 tJournal of veterinary behavior.g2016 Mar.,  Apr., v. 12 p.60-65dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000000117x1558-78787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2015.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001200144245012300156300002000279520124300299592002801542650002101570650001001591650002201601650001101623650001701634650001601651650001801667650001101685650000901696650001901705650001701724650000701741653002301748653001801771653001301789653001001802653001601812700001901828700001701847700001601864700001401880700001301894700001701907700001301924700001301937700001901950773012601969856008002095852000902175655001202184IND60558119520221117032210.0161109e20161109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055811952DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b106972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jie10aCaCO3/Tetraethylenepentamine–Graphene Hollow Microspheres as Biocompatible Bone Drug Carriers for Controlled Release  ap. 30027-30036.  aCaCO₃ is one kind of important biological mineral, which widely exists in coral, shell, and other organisms. Since it is similar to bone tissue elements and has good biocompatibility, it was very suitable as a candidates for bone drug carriers. In this work, we used tetraethylenepentamine–graphene (rGO-TEPA) sheet matrices induction of CaCO₃ mineralization and successfully constructed CaCO₃/rGO-TEPA drug carriers with a hollow structure and rough surface. As potential drug carriers, doxorubicin (DOX) loading and release measurements were carried out. It showed that load efficiency was 94.7% and the release efficiencies were 13.8% and 91.7% at values of pH 7.4 and 5.0. The as-prepared drug carriers showed some appealing advantages, such as the pH-sensitive release characteristics and mild storage–release behaviors. The excellent biocompatibility and nontoxicity of CaCO₃/rGO-TEPA hybrid microspheres were tested by the cell viability of mouse preosteoblast cells (MC3T3-E1). And cytotoxicity with human osteosarcoma cells (MG-63) was carried out to demonstrate the drug release effect in the cells system. Therefore, the CaCO₃/rGO-TEPA hybrid microspheres would be a competitive alternative in bone drug carriers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3abones 3acalcium carbonate 3acorals 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3adrug carriers 3ahumans 3amice 3amineralization 3aosteosarcoma 3apH 0abone drug carriers 0adrug delivery 0arGO-TEPA 0aCaCO3 0adoxorubicin1 aJiang, Hongkun1 aOuyang, Xiao1 aHan, Shihui1 aWang, Jun1 aXie, Rui1 aZhu, Wenting1 aMa, Ning1 aWei, Hao1 aJiang, Zhongyi0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Nov. 09, v. 8, no. 44 p.30027-30036dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b106973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03780naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100003300151245011500184300001800299520205700317592002802374650002002402650002202422650001902444650002502463650001202488650002102500650001602521650002102537650002202558650001002580650002102590650001402611650001502625650001902640650001802659650001002677650002502687650002302712650001402735650001802749650001102767650002502778650001802803650001302821700002602834700003102860700002102891700003402912700002402946700002602970773011002996856008703106852000903193655001203202IND4456578420221116172212.0141112e20110501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445657842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.02.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalmer-Felgate, Elizabeth J.10aInternal loading of phosphorus in a sedimentation pond of a treatment wetland: Effect of a phytoplankton crash  ap. 2222-2232.  aSedimentation ponds are widely believed to act as a primary removal process for phosphorus (P) in nutrient treatment wetlands. High frequency in-situ P, ammonium (NH₄ ⁺) and dissolved oxygen measurements, alongside occasional water quality measurements, assessed changes in nutrient concentrations and productivity in the sedimentation pond of a treatment wetland between March and June. Diffusive equilibrium in thin films (DET) probes were used to measure in-situ nutrient and chemistry pore-water profiles. Diffusive fluxes across the sediment–water interface were calculated from the pore-water profiles, and dissolved oxygen was used to calculate rates of primary productivity and respiration. The sedimentation pond was a net sink for total P (TP), soluble reactive P (SRP) and NH₄ ⁺ in March, but became subject to a net internal loading of TP, SRP and NH₄ ⁺ in May, with SRP concentrations increasing by up to 41μM (1300μl⁻¹). Reductions in chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen concentrations also occurred at this time. The sediment changed from a small net sink of SRP in March (average diffusive flux: −8.2μmolm⁻²day⁻¹) to a net source of SRP in June (average diffusive flux: +1324μmolm⁻²day⁻¹). A diurnal pattern in water column P concentrations, with maxima in the early hours of the morning, and minima in the afternoon, occurred during May. The diurnal pattern and release of SRP from the sediment were attributed to microbial degradation of diatom biomass, causing reduction of the dissolved oxygen concentration and leading to redox-dependent release of P from the sediment. In June, 2.7mol-Pday⁻¹ were removed by photosynthesis and 23mol-Pday⁻¹ were supplied by respiration in the lake volume. SRP was also released through microbial respiration within the water column, including the decomposition of algal matter. It is imperative that consideration to internal recycling is given when maintaining sedimentation ponds, and before the installation of new ponds designed to treat nutrient waste.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyta 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiodegradation 3abiological treatment 3abiomass 3acell respiration 3achlorophyll 3adissolved oxygen 3adiurnal variation 3alakes 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytoplankton 3aponds 3aprimary productivity 3aseasonal variation 3asediments 3awaste lagoons 3awastes 3awastewater treatment 3awater quality 3awetlands1 aMortimer, Robert J.G.1 aKrom, M.

Previous studies have shown that bacterioplankton readily degrade dDNA, and culture-based approaches have identified several potential dDNA-utilising taxa. This study characterised the seasonal variation in D-DNA concentrations at Station L4, a coastal marine observatory in the Western English Channel, and linked changes in concentration to cognate physicochemical and biological factors. The impact of dDNA addition on active bacterioplankton communities at Station L4 was then determined using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing and RNA Stable Isotope Probing (RNA SIP) with ¹³C-labelled diatom-derived dDNA. Compared to other major bacterioplankton orders, the Rhodobacterales actively responded to dDNA additions in amended microcosms and RNA SIP identified two Rhodobacterales populations most closely associated with the genera Halocynthiibacter and Sulfitobacter that assimilated the ¹³C-labelled dDNA. Here we demonstrate that dDNA is a source of dissolved organic carbon for some members of the major bacterioplankton group the Marine Roseobacter Clade. This study enhances our understanding of roles of specific bacterioplankton taxa in dissolved organic matter cycling in coastal waters with potential implications for nitrogen and phosphorus regeneration processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRoseobacter 3aSulfitobacter 3abacterioplankton 3acoastal water 3adissolved organic carbon 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aisotope labeling 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aribosomal RNA 3aseasonal variation 3aseawater 3astable isotopes 3aviruses 3aEnglish Channel 0astable-isotope probing 0aDON 0aDOC 0aDOP1 aBird, Kimberley E1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7244-59601 aWiddicome, Claire E1 aCunliffe, Michael0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2018 July 13, v. 94, no. 10dOxford University PresswJournal:1989x1574-69417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiy1323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245015000173300001600323520170700339592002802046596007302074596007602147650002302223650001502246650001002261650001002271650001702281650001102298650002302309650002002332650001002352650001502362650002902377650001302406650001902419650002302438650001402461650001302475650001002488650001302498650001102511651001102522653002402533653002202557653001202579653003002591653002302621700002102644700001802665700001402683773010902697856008602806852000902892655001202901IND60560182120221119064148.0200430e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056018212DNAL7 a10.1080/15627020.2016.12499542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBariyanga, Jean D10aEffectiveness of electro-fencing for restricting the ranging behaviour of wildlife: a case study in the degazetted parts of Akagera National Park  ap. 183-191.  aSeveral national parks on the African continent have been fenced to mitigate human–wildlife conflict, but the effectiveness of different fencing strategies seems to vary between regions. Here, we assessed the effectiveness of electro-fencing for restricting movement patterns of several wild ungulates in Akagera National Park (NP), Rwanda. Following the turmoil of the Rwandan genocide and civil war (1991–1995), large numbers of returning war refugees brought about an increasing pressure on land use, after which considerable parts of the western Akagera NP and adjacent Mutara Game Reserve were degazetted, followed by the construction of an electric fence in 2013 and a helicopter-based game-drive of ungulates into the modern park. We conducted distance sampling of wildlife and domestic livestock in the Uruhita plain – now no longer part of Akagera NP but bordering the modern Akagera NP to the west – for extended periods of time (2010–2015) before and after fencing. For abundant species population densities could be calculated, whereas for other species encounter frequencies are reported. We report on continuously high cattle densities, and increasing encounter frequencies of sheep/goats in the Uruhita plain. We found decreasing densities of zebra (Equus quagga) and decreasing encounter frequencies of waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), stagnant encounter frequencies in the case of topi (Damaliscus lunatus jimela) and stagnant densities of impala (Aepyceros melampus). The latter species can jump fences, and we argue that competitive release and reduced predation may be the prime factors leading impala to (temporarily) exploit grasslands outside the modern national park.  aPublisher supplied data  aPost-Doctoral Research Grant (UR - CRA/08/7/20cUniversity of Rwanda  aDFG-TWAS KL 2378/3-1; PL 470/4-1cDeutsche Forschungs Gemeinschaft-TWAS 3aAepyceros melampus 3aDamaliscus 3aEquus 3aKobus 3acase studies 3acattle 3aconservation areas 3aelectric fences 3agoats 3agrasslands 3ahuman-wildlife relations 3aland use 3anational parks 3apopulation density 3apredation 3arefugees 3asheep 3awildlife 3azebras 3aRwanda 0acompetitive release 0adistance sampling 0afencing 0ahuman–wildlife conflict 0aungulate densities1 aWronski, Torsten1 aPlath, Martin1 aApio, Ann0 tAfrican zoology.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 51, no. 4 p.183-191dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12091x2224-073X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15627020.2016.12499543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02231naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010100169300001400270520090700284592002801191650002501219650002101244650001501265650001901280650001101299650001701310650001001327650001401337650001101351650001501362653001101377653003401388653001001422653001101432653001101443653001401454700002201468700002301490700002401513700002301537773012101560856008301681852000901764655001201773IND60527168820221117103218.0190412e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052716882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jveb.2015.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFazio, Francesco10aErythrocyte osmotic fragility in response to a short road transport in cattle, horses, and goats  ap. 82-84.  aThe effect of transport on erythrocyte osmotic fragility (EOF) was evaluated in cattle, horses, and goats, transported by road over a distance of 230 km for 3 hours. Blood samples were obtained from 8 animals for each species, before (T0) and immediately (T1) and after a recovery period of 24 hours (T2) after transport. One-way repeated-measures analysis of variance showed significant increase of EOF after the transport and a decrease after 24 hours from the end of the transport in all studied species. These changes could be associated to an alteration of homeostatic balance and metabolism, resulting in numerous cellular changes that occur during transport. Therefore, the erythrocyte response and the changes of hemolysis represent the complexity of variations because of transport and contribute to demonstrate that EOF could be used as effective biomarker of stress during the transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3aanimal transport 3abiomarkers 3ablood sampling 3acattle 3aerythrocytes 3agoats 3ahemolysis 3ahorses 3ametabolism 0acattle 0aerythrocyte osmotic fragility 0agoats 0ahorses 0astress 0atransport1 aCasella, Stefania1 aGiannetto, Claudia1 aGiudice, Elisabetta1 aPiccione, Giuseppe0 tJournal of veterinary behavior.g2016 Mar.,  Apr., v. 12 p.82-84dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000000117x1558-78787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2015.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100006000143245012300203520145300326592002801779650001501807650001301822650002201835650001301857650001201870650001001882650001001892650003001902650002201932650001601954650001701970650001701987650001502004650001302019650001802032650002202050650002102072650001702093653001502110653003702125653003302162653003102195700001702226700001302243700001502256700001902271700002702290700001802317700002102335700001302356700001802369700001902387700006102406773011502467856007702582852000902659655001202668IND60673360420221120113317.0191018e20180713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067336042DNAL7 a10.1093/femsec/fiy1332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNusbaum, David J1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6605-618710aGut microbial and metabolomic profiles after fecal microbiota transplantation in pediatric ulcerative colitis patients  aUlcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon that carries a significant disease burden in children. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are being explored to help children living with this disease. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been successful in some children with ulcerative colitis. However, the mechanism of its therapeutic effect in this patient population is not well understood. To characterize changes in gut microbial and metabolomic profiles after FMT, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenomic sequencing, virome analysis and untargeted metabolomics by gas chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry on stool samples collected before and after FMT from four children with ulcerative colitis who responded to this treatment. Alpha diversity of the gut microbiota increased after intervention, with species richness rising from 251 (S.D. 125) to 358 (S.D. 27). In responders, the mean relative abundance of bacteria in the class Clostridia shifted toward donor levels, increasing from 33% (S.D. 11%) to 54% (S.D. 16%). Patient metabolomic and viromic profiles exhibited a similar but less pronounced shift toward donor profiles after FMT. The fecal concentrations of several metabolites were altered after FMT, correlating with clinical improvement. Larger studies using a similar multi-omics approach may suggest novel strategies for the treatment of pediatric ulcerative colitis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridia 3abacteria 3aburden of disease 3achildren 3acolitis 3acolon 3afeces 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3ametagenomics 3amultiomics 3apatients 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3aspecies richness 3atherapeutics 0amicrobiome 0afecal microbiota transplantation 0apediatric ulcerative colitis 0ainflammatory bowel disease1 aSun, Fengzhu1 aRen, Jie1 aZhu, Zifan1 aRamsy, Natalie1 aPervolarakis, Nicholas1 aKunde, Sachin1 aEngland, Whitney1 aGao, Bei1 aFiehn, Oliver1 aMichail, Sonia1 aWhiteson, Katrine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5423-60140 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2018 July 13, v. 94, no. 9dOxford University PresswJournal:1989x1574-69417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiy1333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006600170300001600236520122000252592002801472650002101500650002301521650001501544650001001559650001501569650001201584650001201596650002101608653001401629653001401643653002001657653002401677700002101701700001901722773010901741856008601850852000901936655001201945IND60560182220221119064150.0200430e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056018222DNAL7 a10.1080/15627020.2016.12583272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Bruin, Ruan10aFrom killer to carer: steroid hormones and paternal behaviour  ap. 173-182.  aMammalian parental investment (i.e. care of descendant offspring) is largely biased towards maternal contributions due to the specific feeding needs of mammalian offspring; however, varying degrees of paternal investment have been reported in about 10% of all mammalian species. Within the order Carnivora, paternal contribution to rearing offspring is particularly high: an estimated 32% of all studied carnivore species exhibit direct paternal care. Despite the prominence of paternal investment in carnivores, the endocrine basis of this behaviour is not well understood. This review examines the current – highly constrained – state of knowledge about the endocrine basis of carnivore paternal investment. We attempt to link changes in androgen and glucocorticoid levels with variation in direct and indirect paternal care behaviour making specific predictions regarding the way forward. Well-studied species, such as bat-eared foxes (Otocyon megalotis), dwarf mongoose (Helogale parvula) and meerkats (Suricata suricatta), where social dynamics are relatively well understood, can act as ideal model systems through which we may further investigate the endocrine basis of paternal investment in carnivores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelogale parvula 3aSuricata suricatta 3acarnivores 3afoxes 3aprediction 3aprogeny 3arearing 3asteroid hormones 0aandrogens 0acarnivore 0aglucocorticoids 0apaternal investment1 aGanswindt, Andre1 ale Roux, Aliza0 tAfrican zoology.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 51, no. 4 p.173-182dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12091x2224-073X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15627020.2016.12583273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03771naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008300169300001400252520249200266592002802758650001102786650002002797650000902817650001202826650002202838650002702860650002102887650001202908650001002920650001602930653000802946653002402954653001602978653000902994653001803003700001903021700006003040700002403100773012103124856008303245852000903328655001203337IND60527168920221117102231.0190412e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052716892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jveb.2015.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevine, Emily D.10aOwner's perception of changes in behaviors associated with dieting in fat cats  ap. 37-41.  aFifty-eight obese cats were fed 1 of 3 equicaloric diets for 8 weeks: a high-fiber (HiFi) diet, a control diet formulated to maintain weight in adult cats, or a low-carbohydrate and high-protein diet. The cats' changes in weight at 4 and 8 weeks were compared with baseline weights. Behaviors at 4 weeks were compared between diet groups. Whether the cats differed in behaviors compared with baseline was compared at 4 and 8 weeks without regard to diet. The behaviors were recorded by the owners and analyzed for direction of the change (if change occurred). The behaviors were prefeeding begging, following, meowing, and pacing. Those recorded postfeeding and similarly analyzed were jump in lap, purr, rest, sleep, and use litter box. The owners were also asked whether the cat's affection toward them had changed since the diet was fed. Most of the cats (38 of 47; 81% of those with data for that time) lost weight during the first 4 weeks, irrespective of the diet; there was no difference in percentage of original body weight lost at 4 weeks between the diets (P = 0.36). However, the HiFi group lost relatively more weight across the entire 8 weeks than did the low-carbohydrate and high-protein diet group (P = 0.0075). Overall, 38 of 50 (76% of cats with data for that time) of all cats had weight losses at 8 weeks.Irrespective of the diet, many cats reacted to caloric restriction by intensifying their appetitive behaviors. Of the cats that had changed the frequency of the particular behavior at 4 weeks, most increased the frequency: begging (32 of 41 increased), following (35 of 37), meowing (34 of 38), and pacing (30 of 31) before the meal (all P ≤ 0.0001); however, the cats did not begin to beg earlier during food restriction (P = 0.47). The cats also increased the 4-week postmeal (satiated) behavior for jump in the owners lap (14 of 15 increased) and use the litter box (12 of 13) (both P ≤ 0.005). Affectionate behavior increased in most cats (30 of 32 with change at 4 weeks; P ≤ 0.001). The changes in behaviors at 8 weeks generally followed the same patterns except that purr became significant, and both beg and use of litter lost significance.A HiFi diet led to more weight loss at 8 weeks than an equicaloric and high-protein diet, but the type of diet did not affect appetitive and satiated behaviors. Of the cats that changed behaviors, the appetitive behaviors typically increased, and the owners felt that their cats displayed more affection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanimal behavior 3acats 3adieting 3ahigh protein diet 3ahuman-animal relations 3alow calorie diet 3aobesity 3asleep 3aweight loss 0acat 0aappetitive behavior 0aweight loss 0adiet 0adietary fiber1 aErb, Hollis N.1 aSchoenherr, Bill1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7033-05131 aHoupt, Katherine A.0 tJournal of veterinary behavior.g2016 Jan.,  Feb., v. 11 p.37-41dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000000117x1558-78787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2015.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245016300167300001400330500001500344520156300359592002801922650001901950650001901969650001801988650002402006650002402030650001302054650002302067650002202090650001202112650002102124650001902145650002602164650002602190650001702216650001802233653003202251653001102283653003402294653002602328653001902354653002402373653001802397700001602415700001402431700001702445700001902462773007602481856008602557852000902643655001202652IND60560981120221122072100.0170720e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056098112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.01.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ying10aImpact of root diversity upon coupling between soil C and N accumulation and bacterial community dynamics and activity: Result of a 30year rotation experiment  ap. 87-95.  a2019-12-06  aMany ecosystem functions and processes depend on biodiversity, however, the effect of root diversity in agroecosystems on soil bacterial communities and processes remained largely unknown. Our objectives were to examine the importance of increased root diversity through crop rotation on soil bacterial community composition and its relationship with soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) accumulation, which play an important role in soil fertility. In a field experiment with 30-year crop rotation, where there was no difference in root biomass input in top soil, soil C and N accumulation rates, soil microbial activities and bacterial community composition were investigated. Soil C and N accumulation rates and microbial biomass content were generally increased after rotation, with a greater increase in legume-cereal rotation than in cereal-cereal rotation. Crop rotation also increased soil microbial activity (soil respiration, potential N mineralization), but did not affect soil bacterial diversity. The increased bacterial abundance and changes in bacterial community structure and abundances of dominant bacterial phyla in rotation soils were related to increases in soil C and N accumulation and microbial activity. Our results suggest that increased root diversity through rotation can influence soil bacterial community structure and increase soil fertility by enhancing C and N accumulation rates, and cause positive effects on soil organic C and fertility. The influence of legume-cereal rotation was greater than that of cereal-cereal rotation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecosystems 3amineralization 3asoil bacteria 3asoil organic carbon 3acommunity structure 3anitrogen 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3atopsoil 3asoil respiration 3asoil fertility 3abacterial communities 3afield experimentation 3abiodiversity 3acrop rotation 0aCarbon-use efficiency (CUE) 0acarbon 0aNitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) 0aCopiotrophic bacteria 0aRoot diversity 0aBacterial community 0aCrop rotation1 aJi, Hongfei1 aWang, Rui1 aGuo, Shengli1 aGao, Changqing0 tGeoderma.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 292 p.87-95dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.01.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012700158300001800285500002000303520144700323592002801770650001401798650002301812650002101835650001701856650001301873650000901886650001101895650001701906650001201923700001501935700001201950700001801962700001701980700001801997773011302015856007402128852000902202655001202211IND60571935820221120132433.0170712e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057193582DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.285612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Shaofei10aNonconjugated diene homopolymerization and copolymerization with ethylene catalyzed by α‐diimine Ni(II) complex/Et2AlCl  ap. 1900-1909.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFour nonconjugated diene comonomers 1,9‐decadiene (19DD), 6‐ethylundeca‐1,10‐diene (EUD), 1,5‐cyclooctadiene (COD) and cinene (1‐methyl‐4‐(prop‐1‐en‐2‐yl) cyclohex‐1‐ene) (CE) were used in copolymerization with ethylene catalyzed by α‐diimine Ni(II) complex ([2,6‐(iPr)₂C₆H₃N = C(CH₃)−(CH₃)C = N2,6‐(iPr)₂C₆H₃)]NiBr₂ (1)) activated by Et₂AlCl. These dienes showed quite distinct copolymerization behaviors. Ethylene‐19DD copolymerization formed highly branched polyethylene with cyclic units and pendent vinyls, and a large part of crosslinked polymer when the 19DD concentration was relatively high. Using EUD as comonomer lead to evidently reduced gel formation and increased content of pendent vinyl. COD can be incorporated in the copolymer with evidently lower catalyst efficiency than the ethylene homopolymerization, and CE behaves like an inert compound as it was not incorporated in the copolymer. Homopolymerization of 19DD with the same catalyst produced polymer containing both cyclic units and pendent vinyls. The cyclic units were formed by cyclopolymerization of the inserted 19DD after several steps of chain walking. Crosslinking through the pendent vinyl took place when the initial 19DD concentration was relatively high, forming large amount of gel in the product. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym.

To this end, data on maximum temperature (Tx), minimum temperature (Tn), mean temperature (Tm), and precipitation (Pt) as well as local pressure (Ps), mean wind (WN), relative humidity (RH), and specific humidity (SH) have been investigated statistically and graphically. The specific humidity data calculated using Tm, Ps, and RH data and statistical comparisons have shown that there are no drawbacks to using SH in climatologic studies. According to principal component analysis, it was concluded that RH and SH should be used together with Tx, Tm, Tn, and Pt for the determination of the climate regions. Two cluster analysis methods, Ward's method and Kohonen neural network technique, were used to show the effect of RH and SH. A comparison of the cluster's stability between the limited and high number of stations shows that Ward's method and Kohonen neural network are very stable in both cases. It was also determined that RH does not change the outline of climate regions but that it affects the zones of climate transition. It was observed that clusters determined by using Tm, Pt, and RH provide relatively more distinctive clusters in the data space than clusters determined by using Tm, Pt, and SH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acluster analysis 3aneural networks 3aprincipal component analysis 3arelative humidity 3atemperature 3awind 3aTurkey (country)1 aCigizoglu, H.

Trifluoroacetic acid (TFAA) has been recently proposed as a promising harmless substitute for hydrofluoric acid (HF) in preparing fluorine-modified anatase with good scavenger properties. However the photocatalytic performance of the TiO₂ nanoparticles also depends on their specific morphology, by which the number and type of crystal facets, which remain exposed, are determined. A comprehensive study is presented in this contribution which for the first time describes the role of TFAA in stabilizing the highly photoactive {001} TiO₂ facets. Furthermore, by reducing the amount of water incorporated into the reaction medium, a simple one-step synthesis method is also proposed that allows the preparation of TFAA-modified anatase nanoparticles with specific morphology and selected stabilized facets, eventually yielding a semiconductor material with excellent photocatalytic properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrons 3afluorine 3ahydrofluoric acid 3ananoparticles 3aphotocatalysis 3asemiconductors 3atitanium dioxide1 aJardiel, Teresa1 aPeiteado, Marco1 aRodríguez, Cristina Fernández1 aEspino Estévez, M.

The mechanisms by which insulator activity can be regulated to orchestrate changes in the function and three-dimensional arrangement of the genome remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila insulator proteins are poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated and that mutation of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Parp) gene impairs their function. This modification is not essential for DNA occupancy of insulator DNA-binding proteins dCTCF and Su(Hw). However, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of K566 in CP190 promotes protein-protein interactions with other insulator proteins, association with the nuclear lamina, and insulator activity in vivo. Consistent with these findings, the nuclear clustering of CP190 complexes is disrupted in Parp mutant cells. Importantly, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation facilitates intrachromosomal interactions between insulator sites measured by 4C. These data suggest that the role of insulators in organizing the three-dimensional architecture of the genome may be modulated by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aDrosophila 3aNAD ADP-ribosyltransferase 3achromosomes 3agenes 3amutants 3amutation 3aprotein-protein interactions1 aVan Bortle, Kevin1 aRamos, Edward1 aCorces, Victor G.0 tCell.g2013 Sept. 26, v. 155 p.148-159dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.08.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03536naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001800158245014800176300001600324520188100340592002802221650002102249650003402270650003802304650001402342650002302356650003302379650004302412650002002455650001402475650001802489650001202507650002202519650001402541650001002555650002402565653001102589653002502600653002202625653003502647653002102682700001802703700001902721700001402740700001802754700001902772700001202791773010102803856009302904852000902997655001203006IND60570188220221123021620.0190318e20171001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057018822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2017.06.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuandi, Gong10aFSH receptor binding inhibitor influences estrogen production, receptor expression and signal pathway during in vitro maturation of sheep COCs  ap. 144-150.  aFollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) promotes secretion of follicle fluid and follicle development. FSH acts via cognate FSH receptor (FSHR). It remains unknown whether the supplement of FSH-receptor binding inhibitor (FRBI) into the in vitro maturation (IVM)medium influence the estrogen receptor expression and signal pathway of oocytes in sheep. The present study aimed to investigate FRBI effects on inositol trisphosphate (IP3) of oocytes and protein kinase A (PKA) of sheep granulosa cells, further to elucidate the signal pathway of FRBI effects. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were recovered from antral follicles. COCs were cultured for 24 h in the IVM medium supplemented with varying concentrations of FRBI (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 μg/mL) and FSH (10IU/mL). ELISA was used to measure the concentrations of estradiol (E2) and IP3 in the IVM medium. Western blotting was utilized to detect protein expression of ERβ of COCs and protein kinase A (PKA) of granulosa cells. The results showed IP3 concentrations of FRBI-3 and FRBI-4 groups were less than that of CG and FSH groups at 22 h and 24 h (P < 0.05). PKA levels of FRBI-3 and FRBI-4 groups were significantly less than that of CG and FSH group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Expression levels of ERβ mRNA and protein of FRBI-treated groups were gradually decreased in comparison to CG and FSH group. The minimum value was detected in the FRBI-4 group. ERβ protein level of the FRBI-4 group was significantly less than that of FSH group (P < 0.05). E2 concentrations of FRBI-treated groups were elevated as compared to CG, with the highest increment of FRBI-2 group (P < 0.05). Our results revealed a higher dose of FRBI reduced IP3 production. FRBI could suppress slightly expression levels of ERβ mRNA and protein of COCs and PKA of granulosa cells, additionally increased E2 production of sheep COCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aestradiol 3aestrogen receptors 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3afollicle-stimulating hormone receptors 3agranulosa cells 3ainositols 3amessenger RNA 3aoocytes 3aprotein synthesis 3asecretion 3asheep 3asignal transduction 0aOocyte 0aIn vitro maturation 0aEstrogen receptor 0aFSH receptor binding inhibitor 0aProtein kinase A1 aHaoqin, Liang1 aYingying, Deng1 aLuju, Lai1 aSuocheng, Wei1 aYingpai, Zhaxi1 aYou, Li0 tTheriogenology.g2017 Oct. 01, v. 101 p.144-150dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2017.06.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245014800155300001800303520143300321592002801754650002401782650001101806650002101817650002201838650002801860650000901888650001501897650002201912650001901934650003301953650001701986650003702003700001402040700002902054700002502083700001702108700002302125700002302148700002202171773012802193856007302321852000902394655001202403IND60529165120221118093854.0160717e20120306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052916512DNAL7 a10.1021/ac203061m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xiaoyun10aPorous Graphitized Carbon Monolith as an Electrode Material for Probing Direct Bioelectrochemistry and Selective Detection of Hydrogen Peroxide  ap. 2351-2357.  aFor the first time, graphitized carbon particles with a high surface area have been prepared and evaluated as a new material for probing direct electrochemistry of hemoglobin (Hb). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging revealed that the carbon monolithic skeleton was constructed by a series of mesopores with irregular shapes and an average pore diameter of ∼5.6 nm. With a surface area of 239.6 m²/g, carbon particles exhibited three major Raman peaks as commonly observed for carbon nanotubes and other carbon materials, i.e., the sp³ and sp² carbon phases coexisted in the sample. A glassy carbon electrode modified with carbon monoliths and didodecyldimethylammonium bromide exhibited direct electron transfer between Hb molecules and the underlying electrode with a transfer rate constant of 6.87 s–¹. The enzyme electrode displayed a pair of quasi-reversible reduction–oxidation peaks at −0.128 and −0.180 V, reflecting the well-known feature of the heme [Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺] redox couple: a surface-controlled electrochemical process with one electron transfer. This reagentless biosensing approach was capable of detecting H₂O₂, a simple molecule but plays an important role in analytical and biological chemistry, as low as 0.1 μM with linearity of 0.1–60 μM and a response time of <0.8 s, comparing favorably with other carbon based electrodes (5 s).  aPublisher supplied data 3abioelectrochemistry 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectron transfer 3aglassy carbon electrode 3aheme 3ahemoglobin 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimage analysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZhou, Lin1 aNesterenko, Ekaterina P.1 aNesterenko, Pavel N.1 aPaull, Brett1 aOmamogho, Jesse O.1 aGlennon, Jeremy D.1 aLuong, John H.

The high performance NiS/MWCNT/Ti hybrid film was firstly used as a Pt-free counter electrode (CE) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The surface of MWCNTs was wrapped with a nano-corallines NiS thin film of ∼45 nm in thickness. Under full sunlight illumination (100 mW cm⁻², AM 1.5 G), DSSCs with a NiS/MWCNT/Ti CE achieved an enhanced photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 7.90%, while DSSCs with a Pt/Ti CE obtained the efficiency of 6.36%. The characterization of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) indicated that nano-corallines NiS had high electrocatalytic activity for I₃⁻ reduction, MWCNTs had high specific surface area and low resistance, and the synergistic effect of NiS and MWCNTs endowed the superior features of the hybrid film. Therefore, the NiS/MWCNT/Ti CE can be used as a promising alternative CE in low-cost and large-scale DSSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalytic activity 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrophoresis 3afilms (materials) 3afoil 3alighting 3anickel 3asolar cells 3asolar radiation 3asurface area 3asynergism 3atitanium1 aWu, Jihuai1 aLin, Jengyu1 aYue, Gentian1 aLin, Jianming1 aHuang, Miaoliang1 aHuang, Yunfang1 aLan, Zhang1 aFan, Leqing0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2013 Oct. 22, v. 1, no. 44 p.13885-13889dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta12972a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002800137245010500165300001600270520127300286592002801559650001401587650001401601650001201615650004101627650002301668650001101691650001601702650001501718653001701733653002801750653001401778653002501792700002101817700001801838700001901856700002101875773009501896856007101991852000902062655001202071IND60353355520221117002749.0150813s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6035335552DNAL7 a10.1071/FP142792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarré-Armengol, Gerard10aOptimum temperature for floral terpene emissions tracks the mean temperature of the flowering season  ap. 851-857.  aEmissions of volatiles from leaves exhibit temperature dependence on maximums, but the optimum temperatures for the release of floral volatiles and the mechanism(s) of optimising these emissions have not been determined. We hypothesised that flowers have an optimum temperature for the emission of volatiles and, because the period of flowering varies highly among species, that this optimum is adapted to the temperatures prevailing during flowering. To test these hypotheses, we characterised the temperature responses of floral terpene emissions of diverse widespread Mediterranean plant species flowering in different seasons by using dynamic headspace sampling and analysis with GC-MS. The floral emissions of terpenes across species exhibited maximums at the temperatures corresponding to the season of flowering, with the lowest optimal temperatures observed in winter-flowering and the highest in summer-flowering species. These trends were valid for emissions of both total terpenes and the various terpene compounds. The results show that the optimum temperature of floral volatile emissions scales with temperature at flowering, and suggest that this scaling is the outcome of physiological adaptations of the biosynthetic or emission mechanisms of flowers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemissions 3aflowering 3aflowers 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3aleaves 3atemperature 3aterpenoids 0aflower scent 0ainterspecific variation 0aphenology 0aseasonal variability1 aFilella, Iolanda1 aLlusià, Joan1 aNiinemets, Ulo1 aPeñuelas, Josep0 tFunctional plant biology.g2015, v. 42, no. 9 p.851-857dCSIRO Publishingx1445-44087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP142793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245018900171300001600360520147500376592002801851650001501879650001101894650001301905650001101918650001401929650001301943650002301956650002301979650001002002650001102012651001702023653001302040653001402053653001402067653002302081653001702104653001002121700002502131700001802156773010902174856008602283852000902369655001202378IND60560182620221119064125.0200430e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056018262DNAL7 a10.1080/15627020.2016.12689302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiemer, Natalie10aDisentangling the identities and distribution patterns of the introduced beachfleas Orchestia gammarellus and Platorchestia platensis (Crustacea: Amphipoda: Talitridae) in South Africa  ap. 203-210.  aTwo introduced beachfleas, Orchestia gammarellus and Platorchestia platensis, have been recorded from South Africa, but have been misidentified by some earlier researchers and, prior to this study, each was also known from just a few, scattered observations, such that their true distributions remained obscure. We illustrate both species to clarify the features that identify and distinguish them and determine their true distributions by re-examining historical samples and by collecting new material from estuaries and lagoons along the west and south coasts of South Africa. Adult males of O. gammarellus have slender antennae and characteristic expanded, flattened, oar-like distal segments on pereopod 7. Adult males of P. platensis have the peduncle of antenna 2 strongly swollen and have bulbous, but not flattened, distal segments on pereopod 7. Both species occur under wrack and other debris along the banks of estuaries and sheltered lagoons. Orchestia gammarellus is found only along the south-west coast, in the Berg River Estuary, Langebaan Lagoon and the Diep River Estuary. Previous records from Knysna were misidentifications of P. platensis. Platorchestia platensis is found at one west coast site, Langebaan Lagoon, but is widely distributed from Cape Point eastwards to at least Algoa Bay. Both species share the same habitats as several other native beachfleas and competitive interactions between native and introduced species merit investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTalitridae 3aadults 3aantennae 3acoasts 3aestuaries 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3amales 3arivers 3aSouth Africa 0aamphipod 0abeachflea 0aestuaries 0aintroduced species 0aSouth Africa 0awrack1 aGriffiths, Charles L1 aHodgson, Alan0 tAfrican zoology.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 51, no. 4 p.203-210dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12091x2224-073X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15627020.2016.12689303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245012300153300001800276520170700294592002802001650002202029650001502051650001902066650002202085650002102107650002002128650001002148650001702158650001902175650003002194650002602224650001702250650001702267650002102284650001102305650001202316700001802328700002002346700001502366700001202381700001302393700002002406700001802426773011002444856007502554852000902629655001202638IND60529165220221118093856.0160717e20120306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052916522DNAL7 a10.1021/ac203102u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Wei10aRobust and Highly Sensitive Fluorescence Approach for Point-of-Care Virus Detection Based on Immunomagnetic Separation  ap. 2358-2365.  aIn this work, robust approach for a highly sensitive point-of-care virus detection was established based on immunomagnetic nanobeads and fluorescent quantum dots (QDs). Taking advantage of immunomagnetic nanobeads functionalized with the monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the surface protein hemagglutinin (HA) of avian influenza virus (AIV) H9N2 subtype, H9N2 viruses were efficiently captured through antibody affinity binding, without pretreatment of samples. The capture kinetics could be fitted well with a first-order bimolecular reaction with a high capturing rate constant kf of 4.25 × 10⁹ (mol/L)⁻¹ s–¹, which suggested that the viruses could be quickly captured by the well-dispersed and comparable-size immunomagnetic nanobeads. In order to improve the sensitivity, high-luminance QDs conjugated with streptavidin (QDs-SA) were introduced to this assay through the high affinity biotin-streptavidin system by using the biotinylated mAb in an immuno sandwich mode. We ensured the selective binding of QDs-SA to the available biotin-sites on biotinylated mAb and optimized the conditions to reduce the nonspecific adsorption of QDs-SA to get a limit of detection low up to 60 copies of viruses in 200 μL. This approach is robust for application at the point-of-care due to its very good specificity, precision, and reproducibility with an intra-assay variability of 1.35% and an interassay variability of 3.0%, as well as its high selectivity also demonstrated by analysis of synthetic biological samples with mashed tissues and feces. Moreover, this method has been validated through a double-blind trial with 30 throat swab samples with a coincidence of 96.7% with the expected results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aadsorption 3aanimal tissues 3aantibody affinity 3abinding capacity 3adetection limit 3afeces 3afluorescence 3ahemagglutinins 3aimmunomagnetic separation 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aquantum dots 3astreptavidin 3asurface proteins 3athroat 3aviruses1 aZhang, Wan-Po1 aZhang, Zhi-Ling1 aHe, Rui-Li1 aLin, Yi1 aXie, Min1 aWang, Han-Zhong1 aPang, Dai-Wen0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 Mar. 06, v. 84, no. 5 p.2358-2365dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac203102u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03461naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245012900210300001600339506007600355520165000431592002802081506003702109650001702146650003102163650001502194650001802209650002202227650002002249650001002269650001102279650001402290650001002304650001802314650000902332650003702341650001302378650001102391650002002402650002102422650001402443650002402457653001902481653003802500653004202538653001402580653003102594700002602625700002002651773012102671856008202792852000902874655001202883IND60567581420221207092350.0170628e20170603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056758142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.04.1122doi7 aPMC54977332pmcid7 a284386022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenon, Renuka T.10aHyperoxia exposure disrupts adrenomedullin signaling in newborn mice: Implications for lung development in premature infants  ap. 666-671.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHyperoxia contributes to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of human infants that is characterized by disrupted lung angiogenesis. Adrenomedullin (AM) is a multifunctional peptide with angiogenic and vasoprotective properties. AM signals via its cognate receptors, calcitonin receptor-like receptor (Calcrl) and receptor activity-modifying protein 2 (RAMP2). Whether hyperoxia affects the pulmonary AM signaling pathway in neonatal mice and whether AM promotes lung angiogenesis in human infants are unknown. Therefore, we tested the following hypotheses: (1) hyperoxia exposure will disrupt AM signaling during the lung development period in neonatal mice; and (2) AM will promote angiogenesis in fetal human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) via extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 activation. We initially determined AM, Calcrl, and RAMP2 mRNA levels in mouse lungs on postnatal days (PND) 3, 7, 14, and 28. Next we determined the mRNA expression of these genes in neonatal mice exposed to hyperoxia (70% O2) for up to 14 d. Finally, using HPAECs, we evaluated if AM activates ERK1/2 and promotes tubule formation and cell migration. Lung AM, Calcrl, and RAMP2 mRNA expression increased from PND 3 and peaked at PND 14, a time period during which lung development occurs in mice. Interestingly, hyperoxia exposure blunted this peak expression in neonatal mice. In HPAECs, AM activated ERK1/2 and promoted tubule formation and cell migration. These findings support our hypotheses, emphasizing that AM signaling axis is a potential therapeutic target for human infants with BPD.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aangiogenesis 3abronchopulmonary dysplasia 3acalcitonin 3acell movement 3aendothelial cells 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahumans 3ahyperoxia 3alungs 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aneonates 3aoxygen 3apremature birth 3apulmonary artery 3areceptors 3asignal transduction 0aAdrenomedullin 0aCalcitonin receptor-like receptor 0aReceptor activity-modifying protein 2 0aHyperoxia 0aBronchopulmonary dysplasia1 aShrestha, Amrit Kumar1 aShivanna, Binoy0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017 June 03, v. 487 p.666-671dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.04.1123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01946naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100003100169245009400200300001800294520097500312592002801287653002801315653002701343653002401370653002001394653002301414773010501437856011701542852000901659655001201668IND60127094720221121022511.0151110e200208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012709472DNAL7 a10.1554/0014-3820(2002)056[1592:EDOMPI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersson-Ceplitis, Helene10aEvolutionary dynamics of mitochondrial plasmids in natural populations of silene vulgaris  ap. 1592-1598.  aAlthough plasmid-like mitochondrial DNA molecules have been investigated in a number of cultivated plant species, knowledge about their occurrence and behavior in natural plant populations is scarce. In the bladder campion, Silene vulgaris, a common weed of northern Europe, mt-plasmids of three different sizes were detected in a survey of S. vulgaris populations in southern Sweden. Two of the three plasmids usually occurred together within individual plants and showed large variation in frequency between populations. From FST-estimates of plasmids, mitochondrial markers, and nuclear markers it was concluded that the plasmids are predominantly maternally inherited in their natural habitat, as observed in greenhouse experiments. The association between mt-plasmids and mitochondrial haplotype was strong, but not complete, in the natural material. These results indicate that the mt-plasmids of S. vulgaris have evolved toward almost strict maternal inheritance.  aPublisher supplied data 0aGeographic distribution 0amitochondrial plasmids 0apopulation dynamics 0aSilene vulgaris 0atransmission rules0 tEvolution.g2002 Aug., v. 56, no. 8 p.1592-1598dSociety for the Study of Evolutionx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1554%2F0014-3820%282002%29056%5B1592%3AEDOMPI%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245011100169300001600280500001500296520133700311592002801648650001401676650001501690650001301705650002201718650001101740650001501751650002001766650001001786650002601796650001801822650001301840650001401853650001701867650001401884650001801898651001901916651001101935651001801946651001201964653003301976653001402009653002202023653002902045653002302074700002602097700001902123700001902142700002402161700002202185773009402207856007802301852000902379655001202388IND60562234620221118162931.0170203e20170127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056223462DNAL7 a10.1515/forj-2016-00252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWegensteiner, Rudolf10aExtremely low infection levels of pathogens and nematodes in Trypodendron spp. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)  ap. 202-206.  a2019-12-06  aThe striped ambrosia beetles Trypodendron lineatum and T. domesticum are timber forest pests in the Palearctic region and North America. Because only a few pathogens are known for Trypodendron species, the aim of this work was to determine the spectrum of pathogen species of T. lineatum, T. laeve, and T. domesticum. Trypodendron species were collected in pheromone traps at nine localities in the Czech Republic, five localities in Poland, and one locality in Austria. In total, 2,439 T. lineatum, 171 T. domesticum, and 17 T. laeve beetles were dissected and examined. Infection was found in only two of the 17 specimens of T. laeve and in only two of the 171 specimens of T. domesticum; in all four cases, the parasites were nematodes. Parasitisation of T. lineatum by nematodes was found in T. lineatum at eight localities with a mean (± SE) parasitisation level of 8.1 ± 4.7%. A Chytridiopsis sp. was detected in cells of the midgut epithelium of one T. lineatum specimen, and Gregarina sp. was detected in the midgut lumen of two T. lineatum specimens; no other pathogens were found in T. lineatum. The low infection rates and the tendency for infection by nematodes can be explained by the monogamy of Trypodendron spp. and their feeding on fungi in short galleries that are not connected to the galleries of conspecifics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3amonogamy 3aPalearctic region 3amidgut 3aepithelium 3apheromone traps 3afungi 3aTrypodendron lineatum 3aChytridiopsis 3aNematoda 3aGregarina 3aforest pests 3apathogens 3aCurculionidae 3aCzech Republic 3aPoland 3aNorth America 3aAustria 0aChytridiopsis cf. typographi 0anematodes 0aTrypodendron spp. 0aGregarina cf. typographi 0aPalaearctic region1 aLukášová, Karolina1 aVanická, Hana1 aZimová, Soňa1 aKacprzyk, Magdalena1 aHoluša, Jaroslav0 tLesnicky casopis.g2017 Jan. 27, v. 62, no. 4 p.202-206dDe Gruyter Openx0323-10467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/forj-2016-00253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011800166300001600284520134000300592002801640650002801668650001501696650002201711650001101733650001601744650001901760653001901779653003401798653002301832653002301855700001701878700001601895700001901911700013001930773009002060856008502150852000902235655001202244IND60651023420221122041248.0191114e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065102342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Sheng10aImproved constitutive model of the jellyroll for cylindrical lithium ion batteries considering microscopic damage  ap. 202-212.  aThe stiffness of Li-ion batteries is defined as the derivative of force with respect to displacement. The existing constitutive models of the jellyroll of Li-ion batteries reveal that such stiffness keeps increasing as displacement increases. In this study, quasi-static mechanical abusive tests are performed on 18650 cylindrical Li-ion batteries at different state of charge. The experimental results indicate that three distinct stages are identified in the stiffness curve corresponding to densification stage, microscopic damage stage and macroscopic failure stage, and the stiffness only increases in the first stage and decreases in the latter two stages. Therefore, this paper proposes the improved constitutive model of the jellyroll of Li-ion batteries to describe their kinematics considering microscopic damage. An explicit finite element model of a Li-ion battery is established to validate the improved constitutive model. The voltages and temperatures of Li-ion batteries are also recorded to reveal their responses at different stages. It is found that Li-ion batteries at the fully charged state initiate internal short circuit before the end of the stage 2 (microscopic damage stage) whereas Li-ion batteries at low state of charge will only initiate internal short circuit at the stage 3 (macroscopic failure stage).  aPublisher supplied data 3afinite element analysis 3akinematics 3alithium batteries 3amodels 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 0aLi-ion battery 0aMechanical abusive conditions 0aMicroscopic damage 0aConstitutive model1 aWang, Wenwei1 aLin, Zheng,1 aShen, Weixiang1 aLi, Yiding1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8991-5976 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8991-5976 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8991-59760 tEnergy.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 185 p.202-212dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.07.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04007naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002200158245016800180300001600348500001900364520244800383592002802831650001702859650001802876650001802894650001602912650002302928650002702951650002002978650001302998650004203011650001703053650001603070650001203086650001203098650001903110650001603129653001903145653001803164653000803182653002103190700002103211700002403232700002103256700002403277773009803301856009303399852000903492655001203501IND60713252920221118222826.0201104e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071325292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.09.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLafontaine, Simon10aSpecific imprinted genes demethylation in association with oocyte donor’s age and culture conditions in bovine embryos assessed at day 7 and 12 post insemination  ap. 321-330.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe production of bovine embryos through in vitro maturation and fertilization is an important tool of the genomic revolution in dairy cattle. Gene expression analysis of these embryos revealed differences according to the culture conditions or oocyte donor’s pubertal status compared to in vivo derived embryos. We hypothesized that some of the methylation patterns in oocytes are acquired in the last step of folliculogenesis and could be influenced by the environment created in the follicles containing these oocytes. These altered patterns may not be erased during the first week of embryonic development in culture or may be sensitive to the conditions during that time. To quantify the changes related to culture conditions, an in vivo control group consisting of embryos (Day 12 post fertilization for all groups) obtained from superovulated and artificially inseminated cows was compared to in vitro produced (IVP) embryos cultured with or without Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). To measure the effect of the oocytes donor’s age, we also compared a fourth group consisting of IVP embryos produced with oocytes collected following ovarian stimulation of pre-pubertal animals. Embryonic disk and trophoblast cells were processed separately and the methylation status of ten imprinted genes (H19, MEST, KCNQ1, SNRPN, PEG3, NNAT, GNASXL, IGF2R, PEG10, and PLAGL1) was assessed by pyrosequencing. Next, ten Day 7 blastocysts were produced following the same methodology as for the D12 embryos (four groups) to observe the most interesting genes (KCNQ1, SNRPN, IGF2R and PLAGL1) at an earlier developmental stage. For all samples, we observed overall lower methylation levels and greater variability in the three in vitro groups compared to the in vivo group. The individual embryo analysis indicated that some embryos were deviant from the others and some were not affected. We concluded that IGF2R, SNRPN, and PEG10 were particularly sensitive to culture conditions and the presence of FBS, while KCNQ1 and PLAGL1 were more affected in embryos derived from pre-pubertal donors. This work provides markers at the single imprinted control region (ICR) resolution to assess the culture environment required to minimize epigenetic perturbations in bovine embryos generated by assisted reproduction techniques, thus laying the groundwork for a better comprehension of the complex interplay between in vitro conditions and imprinted genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3adairy cattle 3ademethylation 3aembryogenesis 3aepigenetics 3afetal bovine serum 3afollicular development 3agene expression 3agenomics 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ainsemination 3amethylation 3aoocytes 3apuberty 3asuperovulation 3atrophoblast 0aImprinted gene 0aBovine embryo 0aART 0aIn vitro embryo1 aLabrecque, Rémi1 aPalomino, J.

However, due to UV absorption and mechanical properties, lignin can contribute to the fabrication of biodegradable blown films with superior performances. In this study, it was established the suitability of lignin for manufacturing biocomposite PBAT blown films with higher stiffness and photo-oxidation resistance. The effect of the filler concentration on the melt rheological behavior in non-isothermal elongational flow was investigated. The results allowed us to choose the correct filler concentration for producing films through a film blowing operation. The PBAT/lignin blown film composites displayed an increase of the elastic modulus if compared to neat PBAT films without affecting their elongation at break. Furthermore, the filler delayed the photo-oxidative degradation of PBAT hence potentially allowing open-air applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abiocomposites 3abiodegradability 3abyproducts 3alignin 3amodulus of elasticity 3aphotooxidation 3aphotostability 0aBiocomposite blown film 0aLignin 0aPBAT 0aPhoto-oxidative resistance1 aTitone, Vincenzo1 aTeresi, Rosalia1 aScarlata, Maria Costanza1 aLo Re, Giada1 aLa Mantia, Francesco Paolo1 aLopresti, Francesco0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Sept. 30, v. 217 p.161-170dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.07.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02472naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245014500197500002000342520119100362592002801553650002001581650001501601650001501616650001301631650001401644651001001658651002501668651001101693651001901704700005401723700005501777700005601832773013601888856007702024852000902101655001202110IND60790244220221120210844.0220824e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079024422DNAL7 a10.1029/2020JB0205192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScarfì, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5995-388010aTectonic Regimes Inferred From Clustering of Focal Mechanisms and Their Distribution in Space: Application to the Central Mediterranean Area  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe study of the kinematics and stress field related to seismicity makes an important contribution to the understanding of tectonic processes. In this kind of analysis, a crucial issue is identifying seismically homogeneous areas, which implies data classification and cluster creation. We present an approach that combines unsupervised learning techniques in order to reveal patterns in the focal mechanisms data set. In particular, a combination of two popular clustering algorithms, that is, self‐organizing maps and Fuzzy C‐means, was applied to focal mechanisms of events located in the Central Mediterranean region, characterized by a complex geodynamic framework. The analysis allowed identifying eight groups of focal mechanisms and their spatial distribution in the crust, and revealing the tectonic style of key sectors of southern Italy and of the neighboring offshore areas. A compressive regime was found between the lower Tyrrhenian Sea and southeastern Sicily, whereas extension prevails along the Calabrian Arc and the southern Apennines. A NW‐SE transcurrent faulting between the Aeolian Islands and the Ionian Sea forms a transfer zone between these two domains.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3ageophysics 3akinematics 3aresearch 3atectonics 3aItaly 3aMediterranean region 3aSicily 3aTyrrhenian Sea1 aLanger, H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2508-80671 aMessina, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3358-72101 aMusumeci, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0143-45940 tJournal of geophysical research.g2021 Jan., v. 126, no. 1 p.e2020JB020519-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JB0205193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005700144245015800201300002000359520109000379592002801469650002301497650001801520650002101538650001901559650001301578650002201591653002801613653004001641653001201681653001201693653006001705700001901765700001401784700001901798700005901817700005701876773014201933856007802075852000902153655001202162IND60749907620221119175701.0210908e20210826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074990762DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c109192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhn, Jong-Guk1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5772-566810aSustainable Surface-Enhanced Raman Substrate with Hexagonal Boron Nitride Dielectric Spacer for Preventing Electric Field Cancellation at Au–Au Nanogap  ap. 42176-42182.  aNanogaps between Au nanoparticles and Au substrates are the simplest systems that generate extremely high electric fields at hotspots for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). However, the electric field cancellation at the hotspots in the systems can cause the reduction of Raman signal when two metallic materials are physically contacted due to the low concentration of analytes. Here, we propose an atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) shielding layer for Au substrates, which can be used as an insulating spacer to prevent electrical shorts at nanogaps. Experimental investigation of the SERS effect combined with theoretical studies by finite-difference time-domain simulations demonstrate that the Au NP/h-BN/Au substrate structure has excellent performance in electrical short prevention, thus facilitating ultrasensitive Raman detection. The outstanding chemical and thermal stability of h-BN allow the efficient recycling of the SERS substrate by protecting the Au surface during the removal of Au NPs and molecular analytes by chemical and thermal processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aboron nitride 3achemical species 3aelectric field 3ananogold 3athermal stability 0ahexagonal boron nitride 0asurface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy 0ananogap 0ahotspot 0ashell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy1 aYeo, Gyeonghun1 aHan, Yeji1 aPark, Younghee1 aHong, Jong Wook1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2617-26121 aLim, Hyunseob1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4956-42080 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Aug. 26, v. 13, no. 35 p.42176-42182dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c109193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011900170300001600289520131300305592002801618650001901646650001501665650002501680650000901705650001101714650001201725650002101737650001101758650002201769650001401791650002101805650002001826650001101846650001901857650001301876650001501889651001501904773010101919856008402020852000902104655001202113IND60085924120221119115806.0141101e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008592412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2010.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRick, Torben C.10aWeathering the storm: Coastal subsistence and ecological resilience on Late Holocene Santa Rosa Island, California  ap. 135-146.  aArchaeological research on California’s Channel Islands has significantly enhanced understanding of the diversity and variability of coastal hunter-gatherers and the shell middens these people left behind. On the Channel Islands, the Late Holocene was a time of substantial population growth, territoriality, and the emergence of social hierarchies. The role of marine and terrestrial climate change, population growth, human environmental impacts, and other variables in driving Late Holocene cultural and ecological developments is a subject of considerable debate. Analysis of faunal remains (especially finfish and shellfish), complemented by human skeletal and stable isotope analyses, from a massive shell midden and village complex (CA-SRI-2) on Santa Rosa Island provides insight into Late Holocene human responses to coastal resource stress and environmental change. Despite significant population growth, the emergence of social stratification, and increased pressure on local resources and ecosystems, these data demonstrate that there is significant continuity in the coastal resources Channel Island peoples exploited through time. These results document the long-term resilience and adaptability of coastal hunter-gatherers, the marine resources they harvested, and Channel Island ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3afish 3ahumans 3aislands 3amarine resources 3apeople 3apopulation growth 3ashellfish 3asocial structure 3astable isotopes 3astorms 3aterritoriality 3avillages 3aweathering 3aCalifornia0 tQuaternary international.g2011 July 1, v. 239, no. 1-2 p.135-146dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2010.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001800142245009300160300001600253500000900269520198100278592002802259650001502287650001502302650001602317650001902333650001602352650001502368650001502383650002302398700001702421700002302438700001902461700001502480700002102495773013602516852000902652856007902661655001202740IND4481134220221120061336.0191228e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448113422DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2003.76502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGamst, Jesper10aComparison of Naphthalene Diffusion and Nonequilibrium Adsorption-Desorption Experiments  ap. 765-777.  aepub  aDiffusion of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOC) is a key process controlling transport of contaminants in soils. However, the separate effects of sorption and diffusion on net (effective) HOC diffusion are not fully understood. In this study, effective diffusion of naphthalene in five unsaturated soils was evaluated by: (i) naphthalene adsorption-desorption experiments (batch method), (ii) naphthalene effective diffusion experiments (half-cell method), and (iii) trace-gas diffusivity experiments (chamber method). There was no soil type effect on gas diffusivity in repacked unsaturated soil, but a pronounced soil type effect on naphthalene sorption behavior. Varying degree of adsorption nonlinearity (Freundlich n ′ ₐ) and apparent adsorption-desorption nonsingularity (ω) and ω increased with decreasing n ′ ₐ were observed. In the half-cell experiments, gas diffusion was the governing naphthalene transport mechanism. Three effective diffusion coefficients were calculated from the half-cell experiments, based on concentration profile from either the whole (D ₑff) cell, the source (desorption) half-cell (D ₑff,D), or the recipient (adsorption) half-cell (D ₑff,A). Generally, the observed D ₑff decreased with naphthalene-soil contact time, because of aging effects. The D ₑff, D ₑff,A, and D ₑff,D values (half-cell method) could only to some extend be estimated from Freundlich isotherm parameters (batch method). A suggested index of effective diffusion nonsingularity, H = D ₑff,D/D ₑff,A, showed that H was correlated with ω and inversely correlated with n ′ ₐ Thus, the sorption nonlinearity (n ′ ₐ) was found to provide good indications of degree of nonsingularity in both HOC adsorption-desorption and effective diffusion. The combination of batch and half-cell experiments generally gave useful insight towards understanding and predicting the influence of sorption nonlinearity and nonequilibrium on HOC diffusion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adesorption 3adiffusivity 3ahydrophobicity 3anaphthalene 3aprediction 3asoil types 3asorption isotherms1 aMoldrup, Per1 aRolston, Dennis E.1 aOlesen, Torben1 aScow, Kate1 aKomatsu, Toshiko0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2003 May, v. 67, no. 3 p.765-777dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2003.76503Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02580naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245015900171520143100330592002801761650001701789650001901806650002901825650001701854650002101871650001701892651001101909653001901920653002201939653001401961653003101975700001802006773011002024856008702134852000902221655001202230IND60741169020221120124937.0210820e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074116902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2021.1043042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoer, Joop de,10aExploring food consumers’ motivations to fight both climate change and biodiversity loss: Combining insights from behavior theory and Eurobarometer data  aUsing data from Eurobarometer 83.4, this study combines the two branches of research that address climate-related and biodiversity-related opinions and actions of individuals in the EU. The literature shows that the differences between climate-related and biodiversity-related policies correspond, at an individual level, to a person's basic attitudes towards environmental protection and towards nature protection, respectively. The contribution of this study is to demonstrate how these attitudes can influence behavior that has environmental repercussions for both issues, such as food consumption practices. The analysis focused on two Eurobarometer questions about buying local and seasonal food (to fight climate change) and about buying organic and local food (to protect biodiversity and nature). The results of two multinomial regression analyses, separately in Northwestern European countries and Eastern and Southern European countries, demonstrated that climate-related and biodiversity-related attitudes were, independent of each other, related to the adoption of these purchase behaviors. The results may support Europe’s new Farm to Fork (F2F) strategy and indicate that improving food consumption practices can enable individuals to better play their part in fighting climate change and biodiversity loss simultaneously, which opens up interesting new perspectives for policymakers, businesses and consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental protection 3afarm to fork 3afood consumption 3afood quality 3aEurope 0aClimate change 0aBiodiversity loss 0aAttitudes 0aFood consumption practices1 aAiking, Harry0 tFood quality and preference.g2021 Dec., v. 94 p.104304-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2021.1043043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03253naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245015300159300001600312520168400328592002802012650002002040650001002060650001302070650001402083650001102097650002102108650001702129650001702146650001202163650002602175650001202201650002302213650003702236650001402273650001202287650001402299650000902313650001702322650003502339651001402374651001802388700001802406700002102424700001802445700001802463700001702481700002502498773009802523856008102621852000902702655001202711IND60119259520221118205836.0141210e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011925952DNAL7 a10.1007/s12042-014-9144-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLukman,10aGenetic Identity, Ancestry and Parentage in Farmer Selections of Cacao from Aceh, Indonesia Revealed by Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Markers  ap. 133-143.  aCacao (Theobroma cacao L.), the source of cocoa powder and cocoa butter used for chocolate, originated in the rainforests of South America. Indonesia is the 3rd largest cocoa producer in the world with an annual cocoa output of 0.84 million tons. The main objective of this study was to examine the genetic background of superior farmer-selected clones from farmers’ fields, in order to provide a scientific basis to support cacao rehabilitation in Aceh, Indonesia. The pilot experiment assessed 136 genotypes, including 80 Aceh farmer selections and 56 reference international clones, using 53 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Principle coordinates analysis revealed that the Aceh farmer selections were largely hybrids between Upper Amazon Forastero and Trinitario. Bayesian clustering analysis further specified the germplasm groups of the ancestral contributors. Of the 80 farmer selections, parentage analysis identified 30 parent-offspring relationships contributed by 16 progenitors. Spatial genetic analysis showed no significant global spatial correlation, but local spatial correlation was detected. These results suggest that only a fraction of cacao germplasm from Upper Amazon has been incorporated into farmers’ fields, despite the use of diversie progenitors in breeding programs and seed gardens. This relatively narrow genetic background was likely due either to limited access to diverse hybrids by local farmers or to the over-emphasis on selecting for yield and morphological appearance, such as pods and bean size. Based on the results, a subset of farmer selections with diverse genetic background are chosen and evaluated in field trials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTheobroma cacao 3abeans 3abreeding 3achocolate 3aclones 3acluster analysis 3acocoa butter 3acocoa powder 3afarmers 3afield experimentation 3agardens 3agenetic background 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agermplasm 3ahybrids 3aparentage 3apods 3arain forests 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aIndonesia 3aSouth America1 aZhang, Dapeng1 aSusilo, Agung W.1 aDinarti, Diny1 aBailey, Bryan1 aMischke, Sue1 aMeinhardt, Lyndel W.0 tTropical plant biology.g2014 Dec., v. 7, no. 3-4 p.133-143dSpringer-Verlagx1935-97567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12042-014-9144-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001400188245014600202300001200348506007600360520119700436592002801633506003701661650001601698650002601714650002501740650000901765650003001774650001201804650001501816650001001831650001001841650002301851650001301874650002001887650001401907650001001921650001401931650000901945650002601954700001701980700001901997700001502016700002402031700001702055700001702072700002102089700001702110700002102127700002102148773010502169856008202274852000902356655001202365IND60555775520221207141906.0191003e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055577552DNAL7 a252979882pmid7 aPMC41987062pmcid7 a10.1186/s12870-014-0268-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Chao14aThe beneficial fungus Piriformospora indica protects Arabidopsis from Verticillium dahliaeinfection by downregulation plant defense responses  ap. 268.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Verticillium dahliae (Vd) is a soil-borne vascular pathogen which causes severe wilt symptoms in a wide range of plants. The microsclerotia produced by the pathogen survive in soil for more than 15 years. RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that an exudate preparation induces cytoplasmic calcium elevation in Arabidopsis roots, and the disease development requires the ethylene-activated transcription factor EIN3. Furthermore, the beneficial endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica (Pi) significantly reduced Vd-mediated disease development in Arabidopsis. Pi inhibited the growth of Vd in a dual culture on PDA agar plates and pretreatment of Arabidopsis roots with Pi protected plants from Vd infection. The Pi-pretreated plants grew better after Vd infection and the production of Vd microsclerotia was dramatically reduced, all without activating stress hormones and defense genes in the host. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Pi is an efficient biocontrol agent that protects Arabidopsis from Vd infection. Our data demonstrate that Vd growth is restricted in the presence of Pi and the additional signals from Pi must participate in the regulation of the immune response against Vd.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aPiriformospora indica 3aVerticillium dahliae 3aagar 3abiological control agents 3acalcium 3aendophytes 3afungi 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3ahormones 3aimmune response 3apathogens 3aroots 3asclerotia 3asoil 3atranscription factors1 aShao, Yongqi1 aVahabi, Khabat1 aLü, Jing,1 aBhattacharya, Samik1 aDong, Sheqin1 aYeh, Kai-Wun1 aSherameti, Irena1 aLou, Binggan1 aBaldwin, Ian T.,1 aOelmüller, Ralf0 tBMC plant biology.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.268-268dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-014-0268-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100004000158245017700198300001600375500001900391520190800410592002802318650001802346650001202364650001602376650000902392650001502401650001402416650002402430650001002454650001902464650001802483650002502501650001102526653001602537653001002553653001002563653001602573700002902589700003202618773009802650856009302748852000902841655001202850IND60713253120221118222726.0201104e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071325312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.09.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgbuniwe, Ifeanyichukwu Chukwuemeka10aEffects of betaine and ascorbic acid supplementation on serum gonadotropin, testicular histological analysis and sperm quality in male Japanese quails during the dry season  ap. 391-405.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe study investigated the effects of betaine and ascorbic acid supplementation on serum gonadotropin, testicular histological features and sperm quality in male Japanese quails reared during the dry season. Two hundred and forty 14 day–old male Japanese quails, obtained commercially and housed in cages, were assigned randomly to four dietary treatments for 56 days. Each treatment comprised of 3 replicates (20 birds per replicate). Birds in Control group were fed only basal diet, while those in AA group consumed supplemental ascorbic acid at (200 mg/kg); BET group, betaine (2 g/kg) and AA + BET, a combination of AA (200 mg/kg) and betaine (2 g/kg) in diets. Feeds and water were offered to all birds ad libitum. The prevailing environmental conditions during the study predominantly exceeded the zone of thermal comfort for Japanese quails with DBT ranging from 25.0 to 37.0 °C; RH, 48.0–92.0% and THI, 69.8–91.0. At 28, 49 and 70 day–old, serum concentrations of malondialdhyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), gonadotropins [luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormones (FSH)] and testicular histological analyses were evaluated. Sperm quality was assessed in 70 day – old quails as sperm motility (SM), vitality (SV), total abnormalities (STA) and reserve (SR). Supplemental AA + BET decreased (P < 0.05) MDA, but improved (P < 0.05) SOD in 28, 49 and 70 day–old quails. Serum LH and FSH activities were enhanced (P < 0.05) in birds fed AA ± BET diets, but those which consumed BET or AA + BET showed enhanced (P < 0.05) testicular histological architecture and spermatogenic activities. Birds fed AA ± BET showed improved SM, SV and SR (P < 0.05), but lower STA in 70 days old male quails. It is concluded that supplementation of betaine and ascorbic acid enhances male reproductive potentials in Japanese quails during the dry season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3abetaine 3ablood serum 3adiet 3adry season 3ahistology 3aluteinizing hormone 3amales 3asperm motility 3asperm quality 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atestes 0aHeat stress 0aSperm 0aQuail 0aAntioxidant1 aUchendu, Chukwuka Nwocha1 aObidike, Ikechukwu Reginald0 tTheriogenology.g2020 Dec., v. 158 p.391-405dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.09.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01963naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013200167300001800299520070500317592002801022650001901050650001201069650001101081650002501092650001201117650001301129650002101142650000701163650002201170650000901192650001201201650001601213650000901229700002301238700002001261700002501281700001801306773012701324856008101451852000901532655001201541IND60081265620221118025743.0150217e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008126562DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-014-2507-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSukrutha, S.

Although artificially formed allopolyploids show a high rate of genome rearrangement, the genomes of cultivars and germplasm used for crop breeding were assumed stable and genome structural variation under the artificial selection process of commercial breeding has remained little studied. Here, we show, using a repurposed visualization method based on transcriptome sequence data, that genome structural rearrangement occurs frequently in varieties of three polyploid crops (oilseed rape, mustard rape and bread wheat), meaning that the extent of genome structural variation present in commercial crops is much higher than expected. Exchanges were found to occur most frequently where homoeologous chromosome segments are collinear to telomeres and in material produced as doubled haploids. The new insights into genome structural evolution enable us to reinterpret the results of recent studies and implicate homoeologous exchanges, not deletions, as being responsible for variation controlling important seed quality traits in rapeseed. Having begun to identify the extent of genome structural variation in polyploid crops, we can envisage new strategies for the global challenge of broadening crop genetic diversity and accelerating adaptation, such as the molecular identification and selection of genome deletions or duplications encompassing genes with trait‐controlling dosage effects.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrassica napus 3aallopolyploidy 3aartificial selection 3acrops 3acultivars 3adose response 3adoubled haploids 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3aplant breeding 3arapeseed 3aseed quality 3atelomeres 3awheat1 aWang, Lihong1 aHarper, Andrea L.1 aHavlickova, Lenka1 aPradhan, Akshay K.1 aParkin, Isobel A.

Besides the already known underlying counter-back mechanisms, the astronomical numbers of tumor cells in established tumors could overwhelm the limited amount of specific T cells induced by vaccination, which may account for the modest efficiency of immunotherapy against cancer. We speculate that the long window period for cancer development will allow immune-intervening strategies (e.g., the proper prophylactic vaccination) to promote adaptive mechanisms toward an enhanced immunosurveillance, which could effectively eradicate or at least control the few precancerous cells undergoing neoplastic transformation during early premalignant stages in cancer development, and protect the host from lethal tumor formation. It should be emphasized that the pre-cancer-associated antigens but not the tumor-associated antigens seem to be the suitable antigens for designing prophylactic cancer vaccines. In addition, an ideal prophylactic cancer vaccine may contain multiple pre-cancer-associated antigens, which will provide broad and effective immune protection in a heterogeneous human population. Finally, we demonstrated that placenta-derived gp96, which can be readily obtained in high amount for vaccination, has the ability to initiate antitumor T-cell immunity via association with multiple embryo-cancer antigens. Further understanding placental gp96 associated with carcinoembryonic antigen repertoires that orchestrate immune defense networks against cancer formation will allow to provide an effective prophylactic approach in cancer prevention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantigens 3ahuman population 3aimmunity 3ainfectious diseases 3aneoplasms 3avaccination 3avaccines1 aLi, Xin1 aWang, Beinan1 aGao, Bin1 aMeng, Songdong0 tChinese science bulletin.g2014 Apr., v. 59, no. 10 p.944-949dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-014-0176-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011500167300001600282520145200298592002801750650002501778650002801803650002101831650001901852650001601871650001901887650001901906650001501925650002001940650000901960653002001969653001901989653002102008700001602029700001702045700002202062700001502084700001602099700001302115700001302128700001402141773013602155856008702291852000902378655001202387IND60782748220221119172807.0220830e20220930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078274822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.07.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Yarong10aElectrospun hydroxyapatite loaded L-polylactic acid aligned nanofibrous membrane patch for rotator cuff repair  ap. 180-187.  aRotator cuff repair remains a challenge clinically due to the high retear rate after surgical intervention. There is a significant need to develop functional biomaterials facilitating tendon-to-bone integration. In this study, hydroxyapatite (HA) incorporated polylactic acid (PLLA) aligned nanofibrous membranes were fabricated by electrospinning as a low-cost sustainable rotator cuff patch. The morphology, physical, mechanical and in vitro cell assays of the nanofibrous membranes were characterized. The results showed that the nanofibrous membrane maintained a rough surface and weakened hydrophobicity. It has excellent cytocompatibility, and the cells were oriented along the direction of fiber arrangement. What's more, the PLLA-HA nanofibrous membrane could increase the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression in rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), indicating that the electrospinning PLLA-HA nanofibrous membrane can better induce the bone formation of rat BMSCs cells. When the mass ratio of PLLA to HA exceeds 3: 1, with the increase of the HA content, the patch showed rising induction ability. The results suggested that electrospinning PLLA-HA nanofibrous membranes are an ideal patch for promoting tendon-bone healing and reducing the secondary tear rate. Furthermore, the use of biodegradable polymers and low-cost preparation methods presented the possibility for commercial production of these nanofibrous membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abiocompatible materials 3abiodegradability 3abone formation 3abone marrow 3ahydrophobicity 3ahydroxyapatite 3ananofibers 3apolylactic acid 3arats 0aElectrospinning 0aAligned fibers 0aBiocompatibility1 aSang, Xinyu1 aTian, Zhuang1 aJiang, Shuangpeng1 aLi, Chenxi1 aGuo, Quanyi1 aWang, Ce1 aHu, Ping1 aLiu, Yong0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Sept. 30, v. 217 p.180-187dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.07.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002000142245008900162300001600251500000900267520162800276592002801904650002501932650001901957650001801976650001101994650001802005650001202023650001302035650001802048650001302066700001702079773013602096852000902232856007902241655001202320IND4481134420221121010836.0191228e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448113442DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2003.78702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD'Angelo, Elisa10aEffect of Aerobic and Anaerobic Conditions on Chlorophenol Sorption in Wetland Soils  ap. 787-794.  aepub  aSorption of four chlorophenols (CPs) was studied in ten wetland soils with organic C contents between 1 and 44%, which were incubated under aerobic or anaerobic conditions to simulate wetland conditions. The objectives of the study were to (i) determine the influence of aerobic and anaerobic processes on sorption, and (ii) develop sorption models to predict the distribution coefficient based on chemical characteristics of soils and compounds. Aerobic soils consistently had lower pH than anaerobic treatments, which was a function of the amount of oxidizable constituents present in the sample. Depending on the pKₐ of the compound relative to the pH shift, a greater fraction of the CP was in the neutral form in the aerobic treatments, which was sorbed to a much greater extent than the ionic form (by about 25 times). The organic C normalized distribution coefficient (K ₒc) was strongly related to the octanol-water distribution coefficient (K ₒw) and soil pH. Sorption models accurately predicted distribution coefficients within a factor of 2 from the K ₒw and pKₐ of the compounds and the pH and organic C content of the sorbent. The role of sorption on CP retention was partially negated by the formation of the nonseparable phase, which composed up to 8.6% of the total solid mass (depending on the soil redox status) and had similar distribution coefficients as the separable phase. This study demonstrated that microbial redox processes significantly influenced the soil properties and CP retention characteristics, and should be considered when designing a bioremediation plan for these compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3abioremediation 3achlorophenols 3amodels 3aorganic soils 3asoil pH 3asorption 3awetland soils 3awetlands1 aReddy, K.

(R)-1-[3,5-Bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]ethanol [(R)-3,5-BTPE], as an important artificial chiral intermediate for complicated pharmaceutical drugs and biologically active molecules, is often synthesized through a hydrogenation reaction of 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)acetophenone (3,5-BTAP), in which enantioselectivity and sufficient active hydrogen are the key to restricting the reaction. In this work, a biohybrid photocatalytic hydrogenation system based on an artificial cross-linked enzymes (CLEs)-TiO₂-Cp*Rh(bpy) photoenzyme is developed through a bottom-up engineering strategy. Here, TiO₂ nanotubes in the presence of Cp*Rh(bpy) are used to transform NADP⁺ to NADPH during the formation of chiral alcohol intermediates from the catalytic reduction of a ketone substrate by alcohol dehydrogenase CLEs. Hydrogen and electrons, provided by water and photocatalytic systems, respectively, are transferred to reduce NADP⁺ to NADPH via [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H₂O)]²⁺. With the resulting NADPH, [(R)-3,5-BTPE] is synthesized using our efficient CLEs obtained from the cell lysate by nonstandard amino acid modification. Through this biohybrid photocatalytic system, the photoenzyme-catalyzed combined reductive synthesis of [(R)-3,5-BTPE] has a yield of 41.2% after reaction for 24 h and a very high enantiomeric excess value (>99.99%). In the case of reuse, this biohybrid system retained nearly 95% of its initial catalytic activity for synthesizing the above chiral alcohol. The excellent reusability of the CLEs and TiO₂ nanotubes hybrid catalytic materials highlights the environmental friendliness of (R)-3,5-BTPE production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetophenones 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aamino acids 3acrosslinking 3adrugs 3aenantioselectivity 3aethanol 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3ananotubes 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotosynthesis 0across-linked enzymes 0aphotoenzyme catalysis 0aNADPH regeneration 0achiral alcohol1 aWang, Ru1 aZhang, Jing1 aLuo, Zhiyuan1 aXiao, Qinjie1 aXie, Tian1 aPei, Xiaolin1 aGao, Peng1 aWang, Anming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8480-57830 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Aug. 25, v. 13, no. 35 p.41454-41463dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c110503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245011800160300001400278520179300292592002802085650002202113650002402135650001202159650001002171650000902181650002102190650001202211650001002223650003102233650001102264650001102275650001002286650001302296650001602309650002202325650001002347700001702357700002102374700002202395700002402417773012402441856004002565852000902605655001202614IND50073941820221120112937.0140313e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007394182DNAL7 a10.1111/eea.121722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAng, Gurion C.K.10aContrary effects of leaf position and identity on oviposition and larval feeding patterns of the diamondback moth  ap. 86-96.  aThe influence of leaf position and leaf identity on oviposition and neonate feeding site establishment by the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), were investigated in laboratory experiments. Leaves were excised from cabbage [Brassica oleracea L. capitata, cv. Sugarloaf (Brassicaceae)] and the plants reconfigured on artificial stems made from oasis floral foam. Excised leaves were arranged in their normal (natural) order, in reverse order, or in random order. Relative leaf position, but not leaf identity, significantly influenced the choice of oviposition site; when exposed to female moths, leaves in the lowest three positions always received most eggs. To eliminate the effect of leaf position, oviposition experiments were conducted on excised leaves held at uniform height in individual blocks of oasis foam that had been randomly allocated to a position in a circle at the base of an oviposition cage. Moths laid significantly more eggs on younger leaves, but egg density per unit area did not vary among leaves, supporting the finding that leaf identity did not affect moth oviposition. In experiments that investigated the establishment of neonate feeding sites in reconfigured plants, feeding sites were always concentrated on the youngest two leaves of plants, regardless of their position in normal‐, reverse‐, and random‐order plant configurations. This indicates that leaf identity rather than leaf position determines the site of neonate feeding site establishment. The contrary effects of leaf identity and leaf position on oviposition and neonate feeding site establishment in the same species suggests that different life stages utilize different plant cues (perhaps both physical and chemical) in life stage‐specific ways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica oleracea 3aPlutella xylostella 3acabbage 3acages 3aeggs 3afeeding patterns 3afemales 3afoams 3alaboratory experimentation 3alarvae 3aleaves 3amoths 3aneonates 3aoviposition 3aoviposition sites 3astems1 aSilva, Rehan1 aMaxwell, Sean L.1 aZalucki, Myron P.1 aFurlong, Michael J.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2014 Apr., v. 151, no. 1 p.86-96dKluwer Academic Publishersx0013-87037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eea.12172  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003700113040001800150100001800168245017300186500001500359520116900374592002801543650002801571650002401599650001801623650000901641650002301650650001501673650003301688650000901721650003701730650002101767650001101788650002501799650001501824651001201839653001701851653001101868700002101879700002101900700001801921700001801939773011701957852000902074856011202083856008402195961001302279655001202292IND4389845320221119052852.0181130s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438984532DNAL7 a10113/119252hdl7 a10.1094/PHP-2006-0822-01-RS2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIrey, Michael10aPost-hurricane Analysis of Citrus Canker Spread and Progress towards the Development of a Predictive Model to Estimate Disease Spread Due to Catastrophic Weather Events  a2019-12-04  aMany factors have been involved in the spread of citrus canker (Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri); however, the 2004 hurricane season appears to have been one of the major factors leading to the widespread and numerous citrus canker infections discovered in late 2004 and 2005. Geospatially referenced citrus canker infection data from infections that were discovered after the 2004 hurricanes were examined in relation to wind and rain conditions experienced during the hurricanes and used to develop a predictive model to explain storm-related spread of citrus canker. The model incorporates a “threshold” concept for wind and rains that, in-effect, incorporates only biologically significant weather parameters in the calculations. When applied to three distinct areas of the state, the predictive model accounted for approximately 80% of the hurricane related and subsequent secondary spread of citrus canker over the next 14 months. Therefore, the use of the predictive model shows great promise a tool to predict disease spread as a result of extreme weather events and as a means of targeting resources for citrus canker survey and detection activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepidemiological studies 3amathematical models 3acitrus fruits 3awind 3adisease prevalence 3ahurricanes 3abacterial diseases of plants 3arain 3aXanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri 3acankers (plants) 3aCitrus 3adisease surveillance 3aprediction 3aFlorida 0aepidemiology 0amodels1 aGottwald, Tim R.1 aGraham, James H.1 aRiley, Tim D.1 aCarlton, Greg0 tPlant health progress.g2006, v. 7, no. 1dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:6160x1535-10257nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/119253Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHP-2006-0822-01-RS3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01498naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245003200162300001600194520064300210592002800853650001800881650001400899650002500913650002500938650001300963700002000976773013100996856007201127852000901199655001201208IND60663904220221116183446.0190910e20090624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066390422DNAL7 a10.1039/b813006j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobayashi, Jun'ichi14aThe Daphniphyllum alkaloids  ap. 936-962.  aAbout two hundred Daphniphyllum alkaloids have so far been isolated from thirteen species of the genus Daphniphyllum.

Postpartum beef cows (n = 1358) across thirteen locations were assigned to either the 7-d CO-Synch + CIDR protocol or the 7 & 7 Synch protocol prior to ET. Cows were preassigned to balanced treatments within location based on age and days postpartum, with body condition score recorded at ET. Cows assigned to the 7-d CO-Synch + CIDR protocol were administered gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH; 100 μg gonadorelin acetate) on Day 7, an intravaginal controlled internal drug release (CIDR; 1.38 g progesterone) from Day 7 to Day 14, and prostaglandin F₂α (PGF₂α; 25 mg dinoprost tromethamine) coincident with CIDR removal on Day 14. Cows assigned to the 7 & 7 Synch protocol were administered PGF₂α (25 mg dinoprost tromethamine) coincident with CIDR insertion on Day 0, GnRH (100 μg gonadorelin acetate) on Day 7, and PGF₂α (25 mg dinoprost tromethamine) coincident with CIDR removal on Day 14. Cows were observed for visible signs of estrus, with GnRH (100 μg gonadorelin acetate) administered to cows failing to express estrus during the detection period. Embryo transfer was performed approximately seven days after estrus or GnRH administration. Presence of corpora lutea (CL) was determined via transrectal palpation by a single veterinarian blinded to treatment, and embryos were transferred only to cows with palpable CL. Embryo transfer was performed using either fresh or frozen embryos, with embryo stage and grade recorded for each recipient. The proportion of cows expressing estrus was increased (P < 0.0001) among cows assigned to the 7 & 7 Synch protocol (86% [529/615] vs 76% [488/640]). The proportion of cows expressing estrus and presenting with palpable CL at ET was greater (P < 0.0001) among cows following treatment with the 7 & 7 Synch protocol compared to the 7-d CO-Synch + CIDR protocol (76% [466/615] vs 65% [418/640]). Consequently, the proportion pregnant to ET was greater (P < 0.03) following the 7 & 7 Synch protocol (40% [263/653]) compared to the 7-d CO-Synch + CIDR protocol (34% [228/664]). In summary, the 7 & 7 Synch protocol involving administration of PGF₂α and treatment with a CIDR for 7 days prior to GnRH improved the likelihood of estrus expression in recipients, increased the proportion of cows eligible to receive an embryo, which resulted in a greater pregnancy rate to ET.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3abeef 3abody condition 3adrugs 3aembryo transfer 3aestrus 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3apregnancy rate 3aprogesterone 3aprostaglandins 3aveterinarians 0a7 & 7 synch 0aEstrus synchronization 0aRecipient1 aGray, K.R.1 aBreiner, C.A.1 aAnderson, J.M.1 aPatterson, D.J.1 aSpinka, C.M.1 aThomas, J.M.0 tTheriogenology.g2020 Dec., v. 158 p.490-496dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.09.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03636naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002300158245009100181300001600272500001900288520222300307592002802530650002502558650002402583650001202607650001502619650001802634650001602652650001802668650000902686650001002695650001202705650001702717651001102734653002002745653001502765653001402780700001802794700002602812700002602838700002502864700003302889700003202922773009802954856009303052852000903145655001203154IND60713253620221118222448.0201104e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071325362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.09.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyala Guanga, Luis10aRelationship between testosterone and penile spicules in Guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus)  ap. 368-374.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUnderstanding the physiology of penile spicules in guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) may improve their management in large-scale production guinea systems. Here we examined whether penis spicule development depends on testosterone and whether exogenous testosterone can reverse penile spicule atrophy in castrated guinea pigs. The relationship between total testosterone (TT) and the development of penile spicules (DPS) in guinea pigs was explored in two experiments. The first experiment described the TT and DPS curves in non-castrated guinea pigs (E1-G1) and guinea pigs castrated on day 35 (E1-G2). In the second experiment, the dose-dependent effect of the administration of exogenous testosterone (ET) was evaluated during DPS in Group 1 (E2-G1; castrated guinea pigs + 125 μg ET on days 65 and 80 of age), Group 2 (E2-G2; castrated guinea pigs + 250 μg ET on days 65 and 80 of age), Group 3 (E2-G3; non-castrated guinea pigs), and Group 4 (E2-G4; castrated guinea pigs without ET). Analysis of variance using a General Linear Model (GLM) was performed. TT increased from day 20 to day 35 in both groups in the first experiment (P > 0.05). This increase in TT was maintained in E1-G1 on days 50, 65, and 80; however, TT fell to basal values in E1-G2 after castration. DPS guinea was directly related to TT level. In Experiment 2, guinea E2-G1 and E2-G2 animals that received ET showed an increase in TT, significantly differing from E2-G4 (P < 0.05). Nevertheless, ET administration in E2-G1 and E2-G2 was not sufficient to reach the TT levels in E2-G3. DPS was closely related to TT levels, such that when testicles were removed, the spicules began to atrophy without disappearing. Our results suggest that TT in guinea pigs increases steadily until puberty completes, after which it decreases and stabilizes and shows an association with DPS. Furthermore, 12–35% of TT produced by guinea pigs is testicle-independent. Finally, ET administration can stop and reverse the spicule atrophy process in castrated males. These results will help to manage guinea pigs in a more sustainable way in countries where this species is of utmost relevance to provide the population with the meat of high quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3aanimal reproduction 3aatrophy 3acastration 3adose response 3aguinea pigs 3alinear models 3ameat 3apenis 3apuberty 3atestosterone 3aGuinea 0aPenile spicules 0aGuinea pig 0aCastrated1 aAstiz, Susana1 aNieto Escandon, Pedro1 aDutan Saramago, Jorge1 aRodas Carpio, Ramiro1 aPesantez-Pacheco, José Luis1 aRosales Jaramillo, Cornelio0 tTheriogenology.g2020 Dec., v. 158 p.368-374dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.09.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245008600159300001400245520169500259592002801954650001501982650001501997650002502012650002702037650002302064650003002087650001102117650001402128650001002142650002402152650003202176650002002208650000902228650001402237650000902251700001802260773012402278856004002402852000902442655001202451IND50073942220221120153132.0140313e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007394222DNAL7 a10.1111/eea.121642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtsuki, Hatsune10aFunctionally different predators break down antipredator defenses of spider mites  ap. 27-33.  aPrey that lives with functionally different predators may experience enhanced mortality risk, because of conflicts between the specific defenses against their predators. Because natural communities usually contain combinations of prey and functionally different predators, examining risk enhancement with multiple predators may help to understand prey population dynamics. It is also important in an applied context: risk enhancement with multiple biological control agents could lead to successful suppression of pests. We examined whether risk enhancement occurs in the spider mite Tetranychus kanzawai Kishida (Acari: Tetranychidae) when exposed to two predator species: a generalist ant, Pristomyrmex punctatus Mayr (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), and a specialist predatory mite, Neoseiulus womersleyi Schicha (Acari: Phytoseiidae). We replicated microcosms that consisted of spider mites, ants, and predatory mites. Spider mites avoided generalist ants by staying inside their webs on leaf surfaces. In contrast, spider mites avoided specialist predatory mites that intruded into their webs by exiting the web, which obviously conflicts with the defense against ants. In the presence of both predators, enhanced mortality of spider mites was observed. A conflict occurred between the spider mites’ defenses: they seemed to move out of their webs and be preyed upon by ants. This is the first study to suggest that risk enhancement occurs in web‐spinning spider mites that are exposed to both generalist and specialist predator species, and to provide evidence that ants can have remarkable synergistic effects on the biological control of spider mites using specialist predatory mites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormicidae 3aNeoseiulus 3aTetranychus kanzawai 3aantipredatory behavior 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aleaves 3amortality 3apests 3apopulation dynamics 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredatory mites 3arisk 3asynergism 3awebs1 aYano, Shuichi0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2014 Apr., v. 151, no. 1 p.27-33dKluwer Academic Publishersx0013-87037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eea.12164  aDNAL 7aarticle03827naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001400169245016200183300001600345520178500361592002802146650002002174650001902194650002002213650002102233650001202254650001702266650001002283650002602293650002402319650002002343650001502363650001002378650001902388650002002407650005602427650002302483650001102506650001102517650002802528650000902556650002602565650003702591650001202628650002402640650001702664650002502681650004702706650004602753650001602799700001402815700001402829700001602843700001402859700001602873700001602889700001502905700001702920773012302937856008403060852000903144655001203153IND60083759320221119015018.0141101e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008375932DNAL7 a201639402pmid7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2009.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarra, S.10aParental history of premature myocardial infarction is a stronger predictor of increased carotid intima-media thickness than parental history of hypertension  ap. 391-397.  aAn increased carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) is detectable in young subjects with parental history of premature myocardial infarction (PHPMI) or hypertension (PHH). In this study we evaluated if PHPMI and PHH exert a different influence on carotid IMT and if their conjunction produces additive effects. High-resolution B-mode ultrasonographic evaluation of common carotid artery IMT was acquired from 48 subjects without PHPMI and PHH (22 males, 26 females; mean age 22.1±4.9 years; controls), 24 age- (±1 year) and sex-matched subjects with PHH without PHPMI (PHH-positive/PHPMI-negative subjects), 24 age- and sex-matched subjects with PHPMI without PHH (PHH-negative/PHPMI-positive subjects) and 24 age- and sex-matched subjects with both PHPMI and PHH (PHH/PHPMI-positive subjects). Lipid profile, resting blood pressure, smoking behaviour and body mass index (BMI) were also assessed. Carotid IMT was smaller in controls (0.41±0.07mm) compared to PHH-positive/PHPMI-negative subjects (0.47±0.10, p=0.023), to PHH-negative/PHPMI-positive subjects (0.54±0.11, p<0.001) and to PHH/PHPMI-positive subjects (0.52±0.10mm, p<0.001). Carotid IMT was greater in PHH-negative/PHPMI-positive (p=0.006) and in PHH/PHPMI-positive (p=0.031) than in PHH-positive/PHPMI-negative subjects. No difference in carotid IMT was evident between PHH-negative/PHPMI-positive and PHH/PHPMI-positive subjects (p=0.549). In the comparison among subjects using multiple regression analysis, only PHPMI, age and BMI were independently associated with carotid IMT. In healthy young subjects with PHPMI and/or PHH, carotid IMT is increased. PHPMI is a stronger predictor of increased carotid IMT than PHH. PHH in conjunction with PHPMI does not add any further detrimental effect on carotid IMT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditive effect 3ablood pressure 3abody mass index 3acarotid arteries 3afemales 3ahypertension 3amales 3amyocardial infarction 3aregression analysis 3aultrasonography 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBlood Pressure 2aBody Mass Index 2aCarotid Artery, Commonxpathologyxultrasonography. 2aCholesterolxblood 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypertensionxpathology 2aMale 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aMyocardial Infarctionxpathology 2aParents 2aRegression Analysis 2aRisk Factors 2aTriglyceridesxblood 2aTunica Intimaxpathologyxultrasonography. 2aTunica Mediaxpathologyxultrasonography. 2aYoung Adult1 aGaeta, G.1 aCuomo, V.1 aGuarini, P.1 aCuomo, S.1 aCapozzi, G.1 aTudisca, G.1 aMadrid, A.1 aTrevisan, M.0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2011 June, v. 21, no. 6 p.391-397dElsevier B.V.x0939-47537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2009.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005000144245011800194300002000312520128400332592002801616650001501644650002401659650001301683650002301696650002501719653002501744653002201769653002201791653002301813653002701836700001601863700001701879700005201896700005601948700001302004700001802017700005602035700005502091700006002146773014202206856007802348852000902426655001202435IND60749908420221119175501.0210908e20210825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074990842DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c112772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Di1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3266-061210aFabrication of 2D PdSe₂/3D CdTe Mixed-Dimensional van der Waals Heterojunction for Broadband Infrared Detection  ap. 41791-41801.  aRoom-temperature infrared photodetectors are in great demand because of their vitally important applications in the military and civilian fields, which has inspired intensive studies in recent decades. Here, we present the fabrication of a large-size PdSe₂/CdTe mixed-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) heterojunction for room-temperature infrared detection. Taking advantage of the wide light absorption of the multilayer PdSe₂, high-quality vdW interface, and unique mixed-dimensional device geometry, the present device is capable of detecting an ultrawide light up to long-wave infrared (LWIR) of 10.6 μm at room temperature. In addition, our photodetector exhibits a good capability to follow short pulse infrared signals with a quick response rate of 70 ns, a large responsivity of 324.7 mA/W, and a reasonable specific detectivity of 3.3 × 10¹² Jones. Significantly, the assembled photodetector is highly sensitive to a polarized infrared light signal with a decent polarization sensitivity of 4.4. More importantly, an outstanding LWIR imaging capability based on the PdSe₂/CdTe vdW heterojunction at nonrefrigeration condition is demonstrated. Our work paves a novel route for the design of highly polarization-sensitive, room-temperature infrared photodetectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aambient temperature 3ageometry 3ainfrared radiation 3avan der Waals forces 0apalladium diselenide 0acadmium telluride 0amixed dimensional 0avdW heterojunction 0ainfrared photodetector1 aMo, Zhiheng1 aHan, Yanbing1 aLin, Pei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3300-52411 aShi, Zhifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9416-39481 aChen, Xu1 aTian, Yongtao1 aLi, Xin Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5338-71121 aYuan, Huiyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5302-35191 aTsang, Yuen Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5632-52240 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Aug. 25, v. 13, no. 35 p.41791-41801dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c112773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002100158245013400179300001600313500001900329520164400348592002801992650000802020650002202028650001302050650002202063650001502085650001602100650001902116650001802135650001902153650002302172650001702195650001102212650001002223650001402233653002002247653001002267653000902277653001702286653002402303653001102327700002202338700002902360700002902389700001802418700002002436773009802456856009302554852000902647655001202656IND60713253720221118222626.0201104e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071325372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.09.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKüçük, Niyazi10aEffect of oviductal fluid on bull sperm functionality and fertility under non-capacitating and capacitating incubation conditions  ap. 406-415.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study investigated the effect of bovine oviductal fluid from late follicular (LF) and early luteal (EL) phases on bull sperm functionality under non-capacitating (NCAP) and capacitating (CAP) conditions. Frozen-thawed semen samples from five bulls were thawed and incubated (0, 1 or 2 h) in NCAP and CAP media supplemented with 1% bovine oviductal fluid (LF and EL groups) and in absence of fluid (C group). Motion parameters were assessed by CASA; sperm viability, acrosomal integrity and membrane lipid disorder parameters were evaluated by flow cytometry; and sperm DNA fragmentation was evaluated by the Comet assay. Finally, in vitro fertilization with sperm treated under CAP conditions was performed and further embryo culture results evaluated. In NCAP medium, addition of LF and EL fluid increased the total and progressive motility, and LF fluid improved the stability of sperm DNA. However, under CAP conditions addition of LF and EL fluid decreased some sperm motion parameters and some parameters of sperm DNA stability. Proportion of viable sperm cells with low lipid disorder was higher in NCAP than CAP medium and addition of LF fluid markedly increased the proportion of viable spermatozoa with high lipid disorder and acrosome alteration (spontaneous acrosome reaction). Under current conditions, incubation of bull sperm with oviductal fluid before insemination did not affect detrimentally the IVF results nor embryo development, being blastocyst rate similar between CAP-LF, CAP-EL and control groups. In conclusion, oviductal fluid positively influences sperm functionality and modulate in vitro capacitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3aacrosome 3aacrosome reaction 3ablastocyst 3acomet assay 3aembryo culture 3aembryogenesis 3aflow cytometry 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3ainsemination 3alipids 3asemen 3aviability 0aOviductal fluid 0aSperm 0aCASA 0aCapacitation 0aSperm functionality 0aEmbryo1 aLopes, Jordana S.1 aSoriano-Úbeda, Cristina1 aHidalgo, Carlos Olegario1 aRomar, Raquel1 aGadea, Joaquín0 tTheriogenology.g2020 Dec., v. 158 p.406-415dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.09.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03680naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002800166245014100194300001800335520174200353592002802095650002502123650002402148650002102172650001502193650001202208650001502220650000902235650001202244650001002256650001002266650001202276650001602288650002102304650001102325650002002336650004402356650001202400650002902412650002802441650003502469650004002504650002302544650002202567650004602589650002102635650004002656650004302696650001802739651001102757700003202768700003602800700002702836700002502863773010902888856004802997852000903045655001203054IND50070536420221119052141.0131109e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007053642DNAL7 a237371472pmid7 a10.1007/s10695-013-9812-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlivares-Rubio, Hugo F.10aPro-oxidant and antioxidant responses in the liver and kidney of wild Goodea gracilis and their relation with halomethanes bioactivation  ap. 1603-1617.  aIn mammals, it has been shown that halomethanes (HM) are bioactivated by enzymes such as CYP 2E1 and the theta isoform of GST to produce reactive metabolites. However, in fish, little information is available, although HM can form autochthonously in aquatic environments. This study assessed the effect of HM in dusky splitfin (Goodea gracilis) from three lakes of the Valley of Mexico by analysing specific HM biomarkers as well as a broad range of biomarkers. The concentration of HM was a function of its half-life (higher in deep waters), while its precursors and solar radiation are secondary factors that determine its concentration. The kidney showed higher basal metabolism than the liver, probably because of its function as a haematopoietic and filtration organ. Using integrated biological response version 2 (IBRv2), it was found that the hepatic and renal O₂· content is a pro-oxidant force capable of inducing oxidative stress (ROOH, TBARS and RC=O). Early damage was found to be dependent on low concentrations of HM in Major Lake, whereas late damage was observed in fish exposed to higher concentrations of HM in Zumpango Lake and Ancient Lake. The activities of enzymes involved in antioxidant defence seemed to be inefficient. The quantitative assessment of biomarkers (ANOVA) and the estimate of parameter A obtained from IBRv2 provided different information. However, the data support the greater predictive power of IBRv2, but it requires a series of interrelated biomarkers to infer these possibilities. G. gracilis presents marked patterns of adaptation, which are dependant on the HM concentrations in environmental mixtures, although the response is complex and many toxicants could induce similar responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3aaquatic environment 3abasal metabolism 3abiomarkers 3aenzymes 3afiltration 3afish 3akidneys 3alakes 3aliver 3amammals 3ametabolites 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3asolar radiation 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aBiomarkersxmetabolism. 2aCyprinodontiformesxmetabolism 2aGlutathione Transferasexmetabolism 2aKidneyxenzymology 2aLiverxenzymology 2aMethanexanalogs & derivativesxtoxicity. 2aOxidative Stress 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolism 2aWater Quality 3aMexico1 aMartínez-Torres, M.

Compared to body waves, scattered surface waves propagate along the Earth's surface with less energy loss and, thus, can be observed over a wider distance range. In this study, we utilize surface waves converted from teleseismic SH or Sdiff wave incidence to map strong lateral heterogeneities across the entire contiguous United States. We apply array‐based phase coherence analysis to broadband waveforms recorded by the USArray Transportable Array and other permanent/temporary networks to detect coherent signals that are associated with body‐to‐surface wave scattering. We then locate the source of the scattering by back‐propagating the beamformed energy using both straight‐ray and curved‐ray approximations. Our results show that the distribution of scatterers correlates well with known geological features across the contiguous United States. Topographic/bathymetric relief along the continental slope off the Pacific Border is the major source of scattering in the western United States. On the other hand, sedimentary basins, especially their margins, are the dominant scatterers in the central United States. Moho offsets, such as the one around the periphery of the Colorado Plateau, are also a strong contributor to scattering, but isolating their effect from that of other near‐surface structures without any additional constraints can be complicated. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of using scattered surface waves to constrain subsurface velocity structures, as complementary to conventional earthquake‐ or ambient noise‐based surface wave tomography.  aPublisher supplied data  a41974043cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  a1829496cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  aGML2019ZD0203cKey Special Project for Introduced Talents Team of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou) 3aenergy 3ageophysics 3aplateaus 3aresearch 3atomography 3atopography1 aCastellanos, Jorge C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0103-64301 aZhan, Zhongwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5586-26070 tJournal of geophysical research.g2021 Jan., v. 126, no. 1 p.e2020JB020798-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JB0207983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245011300187300001800300520159000318592002801908650001201936650001201948650002801960650002201988650000902010650001002019650001202029650002202041650002102063650002202084650001902106650003002125650001902155650002402174650001202198650002802210650001102238650004102249650002202290650002802312650003002340650003502370650002802405650002102433650004002454650002102494650004202515650002702557700002202584700001902606700002202625700002002647700003002667700002102697700002502718700002002743700002502763700001702788773010902805856008102914852000902995655001203004IND50070536520221119052238.0150210e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007053652DNAL7 a237401002pmid7 a10.1007/s10695-013-9814-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHosono, Masahiro10aDomain composition of rhamnose-binding lectin from shishamo smelt eggs and its carbohydrate-binding profiles  ap. 1619-1630.  aOsmerus (Spirinchus) lanceolatus egg lectin (OLL) is a member of the rhamnose-binding lectin (RBL) family which is mainly found in aqueous beings. cDNA of OLL was cloned, and its genomic architecture was revealed. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence indicated that OLL was composed of 213 aa including 95 aa of domain N and 97 aa of domain C. N and C showed 73 % sequence identity and contained both -ANYGR- and -DPC-KYL-peptide motifs which are conserved in most of the RBL carbohydrate recognition domains. The calculated molecular mass of mature OLL was 20,852, consistent with the result, and 20,677.716, from mass spectrometry. OLL was encoded by eight exons: exons 1 and 2 for a signal peptide; exons 3–5 and 6–8 for N- and C-domains, respectively. Surface plasmon resonance spectrometric analyses revealed that OLL showed comparable affinity for Galα- and β-linkages, whereas Silurus asotus lectin (SAL), a catfish RBL, bound preferentially to α-linkages of neoglycoproteins. The Kd values of OLL and SAL against globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) were 1.69 × 10⁻⁵M for and 2.81 × 10⁻⁶M, respectively. Thus, the carbohydrate recognition property of OLL is slightly different from that of SAL. On the other hand, frontal affinity chromatography revealed that both OLL and SAL interacted with only glycolipid-type oligosaccharides such as Gb3 trisaccharides, not with N-linked oligosaccharides. The domain composition of these RBLs and an analytical environment such as the “cluster effect” of a ligand might influence the binding between RBL and sugar chains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOsmerus 3aSilurus 3aaffinity chromatography 3acomplementary DNA 3aeggs 3aexons 3alectins 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3asequence analysis 3asignal peptide 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atrisaccharides 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aFemale 2aFish Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGenome Components 2aGlycolipidsxmetabolism 2aGlycoproteinsxmetabolism 2aLectinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aOsmeriformesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOvumxmetabolism 2aProtein Structure, Tertiaryxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aSugawara, Shigeki1 aTatsuta, Takeo1 aHikita, Toshiyuki1 aKominami, Junko1 aNakamura-Tsuruta, Sachiko1 aHirabayashi, Jun1 aKawsar, Sarkar M.

From the end of loess accumulation to the establishment of grass cover and forest succession in this area, a phase of active modeling of the land surface by slope processes occurred. Before the beginning of the Holocene, this activity stopped and mollisol and alfisol formation started. These soils are preserved beneath Holocene colluvia. Until the Neolithic age, the area of loess formations in Poland was uninhabited. The extensive Neolithic agriculture locally induced soil erosion, causing slopewash on farmedslopes. The scale of this process and establishing the age of the successive stages of the prehistoric soil erosion in loess deposits in Poland is a key problem in the investigations of the human–environment relationship in prehistory. Chronostratigraphy of the preserved Holocene colluvia is very helpful in the solution of these problems. Optical (OSL) dating was applied in chronostratigraphical analyses. Due to expected partial bleaching during sediment transport, a single-aliquot regenerative dose protocol (SAR) was applied. Insufficient bleaching during transport on the slope is expected to be a serious problem for luminescence dating of loess colluvia, and causes overestimation of the OSL age. Quartz from the study site was suitable for age determination by SAR. The youngest 50-year old colluvia were also studied using the ¹³⁷Cs method. The reliability of the obtained results is discussed in this paper, as well as the influence of environmental processes and type of the applied methods on chronological assignments. The precise age determination of loess colluvia is important for study of the human impact on the environment. The results of OSL dating show that soil erosion started in the Neolithic, with three phases of soil erosion: Neolithic, Middle Ages, and modern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage determination 3aanthropogenic activities 3ableaching 3acesium 3acolluvium 3aenvironmental impact 3aforest succession 3agrasses 3aloess 3aluminescence 3amodels 3aquartz 3asediment transport 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3aPoland1 aŚnieszko, Zbigniew,1 aMoska, Piotr0 tQuaternary international.g2011 Aug. 1, v. 240, no. 1-2 p.44-51dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2011.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005300142245017100195500002000366520157400386592002801960596004701988596004702035650001602082650001302098650001502111650002402126650001302150700005802163773013602221856007702357852000902434655001202443IND60790245620221120220205.0220824e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079024562DNAL7 a10.1029/2020JB0202312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Meng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7405-338910aSynchronization of Earthquake Cycles of Adjacent Segments on Oceanic Transform Faults Revealed by Numerical Simulation in the Framework of Rate‐and‐State Friction  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSynchronization behavior of large earthquakes (rupture of nearby faults close in time for many cycles) has been reported in many fault systems. The general idea is that the faults in the system have similar repeating intervals and are positively coupled through stress interaction. However, many details of such synchronization remain unknown. Here, we built a numerical model in the framework of rate‐and‐state friction to simulate earthquake cycles on the west Gofar fault, East Pacific Rise. Our model consists of two seismic patches separated by a barrier patch, which are constrained by seismic observations. We varied the parameters in the barrier to understand its role on earthquake synchronization. First, we found that when the barrier is relatively weak, synchronization can be achieved by afterslip or post‐seismic creep in the barrier patch. Second, static stress transfer can lead to synchronization, opposite to the suggestion by Scholz (2010, https://doi.org/10.1785/0120090309), which was based on results from a spring‐slider model using rate‐and‐state friction. Third, the width of the barrier is more important than its strength. When the barrier is narrow enough (no more than half the width of the seismic patch in our model), the system can achieve synchronization even with a very strong barrier. Fourth, for certain simulations, the interaction between the two seismic patches promotes partial rupture in the seismic patches and leads to complex behavior: the system switches from synchronized to unsynchronized over 10–20 cycles.  aPublisher supplied data  a1357433cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  a1654416cNational Science Foundation (NSF) 3aearthquakes 3afriction 3ageophysics 3amathematical models 3aresearch1 aShi, Pengcheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3558-458X0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2021 Jan., v. 126, no. 1 p.e2020JB020231-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JB0202313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007500166300001800241520125700259592002801516650001201544650001601556650001101572650001901583650001901602650001701621650000901638650001101647650001001658650001801668650001601686700002101702700002201723700001601745700002101761773009001782856008101872852000901953655001201962IND60119260620221118205319.0151227e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011926062DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-014-9437-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTilay, Ashwini10aGasification of Canola Meal and Factors Affecting Gasification Process  ap. 1131-1143.  aNon-catalytic gasification of canola meal for the production of syngas was studied in lab-scale fixed bed gasifier and pilot-scale fluidized bed gasifier. Various experiments were undertaken in order to study the effects of different gasification parameters on gas composition, H₂/CO ratio, gas yield, syngas yield, lower heating value (LHV), and carbon efficiency (CE). Fixed-bed experiments were performed to study the effects of operating temperature in the range of 650–850 °C and equivalence ratio in the range of 0.2–0.4. Steam, carbon dioxide (CO₂), and oxygen (O₂) were used as gasifying agents. The experimental results show that steam gasification delivers a gaseous product with a high H₂/CO ratio (2.7) and LHV (193.0 MJ/m³). Oxygen gasification attributed to maximum CE (65.5 %). CO₂ gasification contributes to high gas yield (82.8 mol/kg biomass). During fluidized bed gasification study, it was found that using steam as gasifying agent leads to more H₂ production as compared to that for O₂ and CO₂ gasifying agents. Thus, it leads to high H₂/CO ratio, syngas yield, and LHV of product gas. Regarding CE for O₂ gasification and gas yield for CO₂, observations were similar to those for fixed bed system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acanola meal 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3afluidized beds 3agasification 3aheat 3aoxygen 3asteam 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature1 aAzargohar, Ramin1 aGerspacher, Regan1 aDalai, Ajay1 aKozinski, Janusz0 tBioEnergy research.g2014 Dec., v. 7, no. 4 p.1131-1143dSpringer USx1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-014-9437-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012500160300001400285520147900299592002801778650002301806650001601829650001401845650002401859650000901883650001901892650000901911650001201920650001901932650001601951650001801967650001701985650001402002650001502016650001002031650001002041700002102051700001702072773012402089856004002213852000902253655001202262IND50073942520221120173747.0140313e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007394252DNAL7 a10.1111/eea.121632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrer, Aurélie10aStay cool, travel far: cold‐acclimated oriental fruit moth females have enhanced flight performance but lay fewer eggs  ap. 11-18.  aAcclimation to a particular environment may provide organisms with advantages in that environment. In species with multiple generations per year, acclimation may cause life‐history traits to vary with season and between generations. We investigated flight performance, lifetime egg production, and longevity in relation to the temperature experienced during development and adulthood in the invasive moth pest Grapholita molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). We found that females that developed at low temperature had good flight abilities when they were flown at low, intermediate, and high temperatures. At high temperature, females that developed at high temperature did not outperform females that developed at low temperature. Flight performance was generally poor at low ambient temperature. Our findings suggest a beneficial acclimation effect, occurring at low temperature. Nonetheless, there were potential costs of development at low temperature: development took longer, resulting in smaller females, which laid fewer eggs. Given temporal and spatial temperature variability in the field, dispersal potential should not be considered homogeneous within populations or across generations. Our results suggest that the most favourable time periods for female dispersal are at the beginning and towards the end of the host crop growing season, which has potential implications for monitoring the occurrence and range expansion of this invasive pest species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGrapholita molesta 3aacclimation 3aadulthood 3aambient temperature 3acold 3aegg production 3aeggs 3afemales 3agrowing season 3ahost plants 3ainsect flight 3alife history 3alongevity 3amonitoring 3amoths 3apests1 aMazzi, Dominique1 aDorn, Silvia0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2014 Apr., v. 151, no. 1 p.11-18dKluwer Academic Publishersx0013-87037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eea.12163  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015600169300001600325520113000341536004901471592002801520596001701548650002101565650001201586650001201598650002301610650001801633650002301651650000901674650001801683650001201701650001501713650001901728650000901747651000901756653002101765653001601786653001401802653002201816653001201838700002401850700002701874700002101901700002501922773014501947856008502092852000902177655001202186IND60637370720221122045316.0190417e20190326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063737072DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2019.15894842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNobahar, Amin10aResponse of Yield and Some Physiological Traits of Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) to Topping Height and Application Methods of Zn and Ca Nano-Chelates  ap. 749-762.  aGroundnut is an annual legume and important oilseed crop in the world. In order to evaluate the influence of the topping height and application methods of Zinc (Zn) and Calcium (Ca) nano-chelates on quantitative and qualitative characteristics of groundnut, these experiments were carried out during the 2016–2017 cropping seasons on groundnut in Iran. Both foliar and in soil applications of Zn and Ca nano-chelates improved groundnut yield. Foliar application of Zn nano-chelate in combination with topping the main stem 20 cm above the ground produced the highest 100-seed weight (82.19 g), seed yield per unit area (2722.5 kg.h⁻¹), harvest index (57.53%), biological yield (6540.00 kg.h⁻¹), oil yield (1486.76 kg.h⁻¹), protein yield (742.66 kg.h⁻¹), seed Zn content (12.08 ppm) and Ca content (35.86 ppm). The application of Zn nano-chelate had different positive influences on vegetative and reproductive growth of groundnut plants. Generally, optimizing of the nutritional status in groundnut plants with Ca and Zn supplements is recommended to enhance the quantitative and qualitative yield of groundnut.  aThis work was supported by the amin nobahar.  aPublisher supplied data  camin nobahar 3aArachis hypogaea 3aannuals 3acalcium 3afoliar application 3aharvest index 3anutritional status 3aoils 3aoilseed crops 3apeanuts 3aseed yield 3asoil treatment 3azinc 3aIran 0aAgronomic traits 0afatty acids 0agroundnut 0anutrient elements 0atopping1 aZakerin, Hamid Reza1 aMostafavi Rad, Marefat1 aSayfzadeh, Saeed1 aValadabady, Ali Reza0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2019 Mar. 26, v. 50, no. 6 p.749-762dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2019.15894843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245009500200300002000295520180400315592002802119650002002147650001502167650002402182650002302206653002202229653003702251653002202288653002002310653000802330653001002338653001802348653002302366700002402389700001902413700001902432700002002451700001702471700002002488700001502508700005802523773014202581856007802723852000902801655001202810IND60749908720221119175235.0210908e20210827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074990872DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c115282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanus, Riley1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6242-064710aThermoreflectance Imaging of (Ultra)wide Band-Gap Devices with MoS₂ Enhancement Coatings  ap. 42195-42204.  aMeasuring the maximum operating temperature within the channel of ultrawide band-gap transistors is critically important since the temperature dependence of the device reliability sets operational limits such as maximum operational power. Thermoreflectance imaging (TTI) is an optimal choice to measure the junction temperature due to its submicrometer spatial resolution and submicrosecond temporal resolution. Since TTI is an imaging technique, data acquisition is orders of magnitude faster than point measurement techniques such as Raman thermometry. Unfortunately, commercially available LED light sources used in thermoreflectance systems are limited to energies less than ∼3.9 eV, which is below the band gap of many ultrawide band-gap semiconductors (>4.0 eV). Therefore, the semiconductors are transparent to the probing light sources, prohibiting the application of TTI. To address this thermal imaging challenge, we utilize an MoS₂ coating as a thermoreflectance enhancement coating that allows for the measurement of the surface temperature of (ultra)wide band-gap materials. The coating consists of a network of MoS₂ nanoflakes with the c axis aligned normal to the surface and is easily removable via sonication. The method is validated using electrical and thermal characterization of GaN and AlGaN devices. We demonstrate that this coating does not measurably influence the electrical performance or the measured operating temperature. A maximum temperature rise of 49 K at 0.59 W was measured within the channel of the AlGaN device, which is over double the maximum temperature rise obtained by measuring the thermoreflectance of the gate metal. The importance of accurately measuring the peak operational temperature is discussed in the context of accelerated stress testing.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3asonication 3asurface temperature 3athermal properties 0apower electronics 0aradio frequency (RF) electronics 0athermoreflectance 0athermal imaging 0aGaN 0aAlGaN 0awide band gap 0aultrawide band gap1 aRangnekar, Sonal V.1 aMollah, Shahab1 aHussain, Kamal1 aHines, Nicholas1 aHeller, Eric1 aHersam, Mark C.1 aKhan, Asif1 aGraham, Samuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1299-16360 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Aug. 27, v. 13, no. 35 p.42195-42204dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c115283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001800142245009600160300001600256500000900272520161000281592002801891650002301919650001401942650002401956650002101980650002202001650002302023650002102046650001602067650001102083650001302094650001602107650001802123650001502141650002302156650001202179650002002191651001102211700001602222773013602238852000902374856007902383655001202462IND4481135320221122043821.0191228e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448113532DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2003.85202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAssouline, S.10aEffects of Water Applications and Soil Tillage on Water and Salt Distribution in a Vertisol  ap. 852-858.  aepub  aUnder limited water resources, modern irrigation methods tend to save water and improve water and salt regimes within the root zone. This study deals with the combined effects of water application methods and tillage practices on water and salt distributions, runoff production, and soil loss in a field irrigated with moving irrigation systems (MIS). An experiment was conducted in a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. cv. Sivon) field at Hazorea, Israel, where the main soil type is vertisol (Typic Chromoxerets). Sprinkling (SP) and flooding (FL) MIS, and conventional (CT) and microbasin (MB) tillage, were compared in terms of runoff and soil loss from runoff microplots (5 m²), soil water content and salinity distribution with depth, yield, and plant height. Under SP conditions, no runoff and soil loss were obtained for either tillage practice. In the FL/CT treatment, the mean runoff and soil loss were about 25% of the irrigation water and 0.59 kg m⁻² The FL/MB treatment reduced the runoff and soil loss to 5.8% and 0.02 kg m⁻², respectively. The soil water contents in the SP treatments were generally lower than in the FL treatments, especially in the 0.1- to 0.6-m soil layer. No significant differences in the soil salinity, plant height, and seed-cotton yield were observed between the treatments. Microbasins tillage reduces water losses under flooding MIS to a point where they become practically similar to those obtained under sprinkler MIS. It can potentially lead to lower water losses if the microbasins storage capacity is matched to the water application rate, to avoid runoff.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aVertisols 3aapplication methods 3aapplication rate 3airrigated farming 3airrigation systems 3airrigation water 3arhizosphere 3arunoff 3asalinity 3aseed cotton 3asoil salinity 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3atillage 3awater resources 3aIsrael1 aBen-Hur, M.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2003 May, v. 67, no. 3 p.852-858dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2003.85203Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03238naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245019700168300001400365520201900379592002802398650001102426650000902437650001202446650001902458650002002477650001002497650001302507650002102520650001702541650001402558650001502572650000902587651001202596700002102608700001902629773009902648856008402747852000902831655001202840IND60085925420221119115646.0141101e20110801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008592542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2010.10.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarga, Andrea10aTectonic versus climatic control on the evolution of a loess–paleosol sequence at Beremend, Hungary: an integrated approach based on paleoecological, clay mineralogical, and geochemical data  ap. 71-86.  aThe role of two major factors, climate and tectonism, in controlling loess–paleosol evolution has been evaluated in the present study based on a multi-proxy dataset comprising mollusc, bulk and clay mineralogical, and geochemical data. A recent trend has been to use chemical indices such as the chemical index of alteration (CIA) for paleoclimate reconstructions in loess–paleosol sequences spanning several hundreds of thousands of years, but without any tectonic interpretation. Possible effects of geodynamic factors on physical erosion, chemical weathering and consequently weathering proxies are discussed. Clearly, the relative rates of physical erosion and chemical weathering in a sedimentary environment could be significantly influenced by geodynamic factors and governed not just by climate. Intensifying tectonic uplift gives rise to enhanced physical erosion, leading to increased supply of fresh mineral surfaces having less time to react with weathering agents. In theory, this process may point towards decreasing chemical weathering in a sequence without any real changes of climate. In the studied loess–paleosol sequence at Beremend (Hungary) a trend of decreasing chemical weathering has been observed, which can be explained by a global climate deterioration and accelerating uplift in and around the sedimentary basin. Increasing dust sedimentation could theoretically also contribute to this process as a result of increasing aridification and wind strength reflecting climate change in weathering records following a non-linear amplification. The findings refer to the fact that the impact of tectonism should also be taken into consideration in tracing past chemical weathering trends on timescales of hundreds of thousands (or millions) of years. This is because tectonic effects may impose on the CIA signal and distort it suggesting a potential bias in reconstructing paleoclimate change based only on this proxy from certain loess sequences associated with young orogenic belts.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclay 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aloess 3amolluscs 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3atectonics 3aweathering 3awind 3aHungary1 aÚjvári, Gábor1 aRaucsik, Béla0 tQuaternary international.g2011 Aug. 1, v. 240, no. 1-2 p.71-86dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2010.10.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03257naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002900169245007600198300001600274520147100290592002801761650001201789650001201801650002801813650002301841650001001864650000801874650002301882650001301905650000901918650001701927650001001944650001001954650003001964650002901994650002802023650005802051650002802109650001902137650001102156650002702167650001102194650002302205650000902228650003102237650001602268650001702284700001902301700001502320700001402335700001702349700001902366700001402385700001602399773012302415856008402538852000902622655001202631IND60083759620221119014945.0141101e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008375962DNAL7 a201718542pmid7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2009.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarnevale Schianca, G.P.10aApoB/apoA-I ratio is better than LDL-C in detecting cardiovascular risk  ap. 406-411.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cardiovascular (CV) events occur even when LDL-C are <100mg/dL. To improve the detection of CV risk we investigated the apoB/apoA-I ratio versus LDL-C in subjects considered normal glucose tolerant (NGT) by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 616 NGT (273 men and 343 women), and we measured insulin resistance, lipid profile, apoB/apoA-I and the factors compounding the metabolic syndrome (MetS). An unfavourable apoB/apoA-I (≥0.9 for males and ≥0.8 for females) was present in 13.9% of 108 patients with LDL-C <100mg/dL: compared to subjects with lower apoB/apoA-I (<0.9 for males and <0.8 for females), they had more elements of MetS and their lipid profile strongly correlated with high CV risk. Out of 314 patients with lower apoB/apoA-I, 40.12% had LDL-C ≥130mg/dL: these retained a more favourable lipid profile than corresponding subjects with elevated apoB/apoA-I ratio. Finally, we found a significant correlation between LDL-C and apoB/apoA-I ratio (r=0.48, p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In NGT with LDL-C <100mg/dL, a higher apoB/apoA-I exhibited an atherogenic lipid profile, indicating that LDL-C alone is insufficient to define CV risk. Independent from LDL-level, when apoB/apoA-I is lower, the lipid profile is, in fact, less atherogenic. This study demonstrates that apoB/apoA-I is at least complementary to LDL-C in identifying the “effective” CV risk profile of asymptomatic NGT subjects.  aPublisher supplied data 3afemales 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance tests 3ainsulin resistance 3amales 3amen 3ametabolic syndrome 3apatients 3arisk 3arisk profile 3awomen 2aAdult 2aApolipoprotein A-Ixblood 2aApolipoproteins Bxblood 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxbloodxdiagnosisxpathology. 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aCohort Studies 2aFemale 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aHumans 2aInsulin Resistance 2aMale 2aMetabolic Syndromexblood. 2aMiddle Aged 2aRisk Factors1 aPedrazzoli, R.1 aOnolfo, S.1 aColli, E.1 aCornetti, E.1 aBergamasco, L.1 aFra, G.P.1 aBartoli, E.0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2011 June, v. 21, no. 6 p.406-411dElsevier B.V.x0939-47537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2009.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03271naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013900166300001600305520175400321592002802075596007302103596007302176650001402249650002002263650001602283650000902299650001402308650001602322650002302338650001202361650001702373650002002390650000902410650001202419651001502431700002902446700001902475700001902494700002202513700002202535700001602557773013602573856008302709852000902792655001202801IND60773461820221119202247.0220507e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077346182DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-021-00818-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeal, Richard10aUnderstanding the economic and farming practices driving species selection in aquaculture within the Mymensingh division of Bangladesh  ap. 773-789.  aAquaculture is a major supplier of animal protein for Bangladesh’s population, and the Mymensingh division is a major contributor to finfish aquaculture, producing 43% of the total pond pangasius and 9% of the total amount of tilapia (figures from 2018). We conducted a finfish farmer survey covering Netrokona, Jamalpur and Mymensingh districts to understand current finfish farming practices and identify factors that drive farmers in their species choice between pangasius or tilapia cultivation. We found that most finfish farmers in Mymensingh are experienced practitioners and practise polyculture with a range of stocking densities for each species. Using an economic model of polyculture practice, we have shown that over a production cycle, pangasius gain body mass at a rate nearly 4 times greater than that for tilapia, resulting in substantially larger revenues and providing a strong incentive for their culture. High levels of tilapia aquaculture likely persist due to their short production cycle and an associated decreased economic risk due to crop loss from disease, both factors providing a strong incentive for their culture. Our findings also indicate production yield differences through different species selection in polyculture systems. For example, co-culturing pangasius, tilapia and carp together was less productive than co-culture of pangasius with tilapia. Furthermore, higher yields of tilapia were obtained when co-cultured with carp compared with pangasius, the reasons for which are not known and warrant further investigation. Our study uses information provided by finfish farmers to produce a useful guide on fish species choices to maximise production yields, and therefore food production, from their ponds.  aPublisher supplied data  aBB/N00504X/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  aBB/N00504X/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council 3aPangasius 3aanimal proteins 3abody weight 3acarp 3acoculture 3acrop losses 3aeconometric models 3afarmers 3afish culture 3afood production 3arisk 3asurveys 3aBangladesh1 aHaque, Mohammad Mahfujul1 aHasan, Neaz A.1 aNagoli, Joseph1 aArifuzzaman, Syed1 aTyler, Charles R.1 aBass, David0 tAquaculture international.g2022 Apr., v. 30, no. 2 p.773-789dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl57531x0967-61207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-021-00818-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03931naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003400139245011800173300001800291520213200309592002802441650001402469650002102483650002202504650001502526650002202541650001202563650001702575650002602592650002502618650002202643650002602665650001602691650001002707650001202717650001302729650001202742650001302754650002602767650001902793650001002812650001502822650001302837650001702850650001502867650001902882650001102901650001102912650002002923650002202943651001502965700001602980700002302996700001903019700002103038700002003059700002103079773009903100856007303199852000903272655001203281IND60478621820221119021531.0160112e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047862182DNAL7 a10.1890/14-2153.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJardine, T.

We combined two tracers, stable isotope (SI) ratios and fatty acids (FA), to investigate linkages among ecological compartments (water column, benthos, riparian zone) in food webs in waterholes of a dryland river network, the Border Rivers in southwestern Queensland, Australia. Comprehensive analyses of sources (plankton, periphyton, leaf litter, riparian grasses) and animals (benthic insects, mollusks, large crustaceans, fishes) for SI and FA showed that all three zones contribute to animal biomass, depending on species and life stage. Large fishes derived a subsidy from the riparian/floodplain zone, likely through the consumption of terrestrial and semi‐aquatic insects and prawns that fed on detritivorous insects. Importantly, post‐larval bony bream (Nematalosa erebi) and golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) were tightly connected to the water column, as evidenced by ¹³C‐depleted, ¹⁵N‐enriched isotope ratios and a high content of plankton‐derived polyunsaturated fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA; 20:5ω3] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA; 22:6ω3]). These observations were consistent with expectations from nutritional requirements of fish early life stages and habitat changes associated with maturity. These results highlight the importance of high‐quality foods during early development of fishes, and show that attempting to attribute food‐web production to a single source pathway overlooks important but often subtle subsidies that maintain viable populations. A complete understanding of food‐web dynamics must consider both quantity and quality of different available organic matter sources. This understanding can be achieved with a combined SI and FA approach, but more controlled dietary studies are needed to estimate how FA profiles are modified by animals when consuming a diverse range of diets of variable quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacquaria 3aNematalosa erebi 3aaquatic food webs 3aarid lands 3abenthic organisms 3abiomass 3adetritivores 3adiet study techniques 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aearly development 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afloodplains 3afoods 3agrasses 3ahabitats 3ainsects 3amolluscs 3anutrient requirements 3aorganic matter 3aperch 3aperiphyton 3aplankton 3aplant litter 3apostlarvae 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3ashrimp 3astable isotopes 3atracer techniques 3aQueensland1 aWoods, Ryan1 aMarshall, Jonathan1 aFawcett, James1 aLobegeiger, Jaye1 aValdez, Dominic1 aKainz, Martin J.0 tEcology.g2015 Dec., v. 96, no. 12 p.3257-3269dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/14-2153.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245010300164520139100267592002801658650001601686650001701702650001201719650002001731650001601751650002301767650002201790650001201812700001901824700002701843700002401870700002501894700002401919773012301943856007502066852000902141655001202150IND60782448220221121231947.0220708e20220629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078244822DNAL7 a10.3390/nu141327122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuszyński, Tomasz 10aVitamin D—The Nutritional Status of Post-Gastrectomy Gastric Cancer Patients—Systematic Review  aGastric cancer is a malignant neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract, with one of the standard treatment methods remaining gastrectomy. The authors conducted a systemic review of the Medline and Embase databases concerning the serum vitamin D level in post-gastrectomy gastric cancer patients, regarding all articles published until 22 May 2022 according to the PRISMA guidelines. 18 studies with a total number of 908 gastric cancer survivors were included in the analysis. The initial rate of vitamin D deficiency in gastric cancer patients undergoing gastrectomy appears to be similar to the global population deficiency. In post-gastrectomy survivors, the level of 25(OH)D may remain stable or decrease, while the level of 1, 25(OH)₂D remains normal. Supplementation with vitamin D results in an improvement in its serum concentration and positively affects bone mineral density, which is gradually reduced in post-gastrectomy survivors. Combining vitamin D supplementation with calcium and bisphosphonates enables us to obtain better results than vitamin D and calcium only. The type of surgery influences the level of serum vitamin D and its metabolites, with total or partial gastrectomy and maintenance of the duodenal food passage remaining the most important factors. There is a strong need for randomized, controlled trials that would investigate this matter in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3abone density 3acalcium 3adigestive tract 3ametabolites 3anutritional status 3astomach neoplasms 3asurgery1 aPolak, Karina 1 aFrątczak, Aleksandra 1 aMiziołek, Bartosz 1 aBergler-Czop, Beata 1 aSzczepanik, Antoni 0 tNutrients.g2022 June 29, v. 14, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141327123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04718naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024004700135040001800182100001500200245010400215300001600319520224700335592002802582650003102610650001002641650002602651650002002677650002202697650000902719650002002728650001002748650002402758650001302782650001702795650002002812650001702832650001802849650001102867650002702878650001502905650001302920650002802933650001702961650001302978650001202991650004303003650002703046650001103073650003003084650002903114650002303143650003803166650001303204650004003217650000903257650002003266650002003286650001403306650002803320650002003348650001703368650002603385650002603411650002703437700001703464700001803481700001503499700001603514700001703530700001403547700001503561700001703576700002003593700001803613773009603631856009303727990002303820852000903843655001203852IND60088863420221120110510.0141102e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008886342DNAL7 a217629172pmid7 aPMC31768042pmcid7 a10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinson, A.10aGenetical genomics of Th1 and Th2 immune response in a baboon model of atherosclerosis risk factors  ap. 387-394.  aOBJECTIVE: CD4⁺ T-cells mediate inflammation in atherosclerosis, but additive genetic effects on associated pathways of Th1 and Th2 immune response have not been described. We sought to characterize heritability, pleiotropy, and QTL effects on the expression of genes implicated in Th1 and Th2 immune response in a baboon model of risk factors for atherosclerosis. METHODS: We employed a maximum likelihood-based variance decomposition approach to estimate additive genetic effects on transcript levels generated from a gene expression profile of lymphocytes in 499 pedigreed baboons maintained on a basal diet. Transcript levels for 57 genes implicated in Th1 and Th2 immune response were selected for analysis based on significant heritability in this profile. Multipoint whole genome scans were conducted on heritable transcript levels to localize QTLs influencing these measures. To evaluate pleiotropic effects on transcript levels, we estimated genetic and phenotypic correlations among transcript measures, and assessed their correspondence using a Mantel test. Network analysis using GeneGo's MetaCore™ software was conducted to characterize known interaction among coded proteins. RESULTS: Heritabilities for candidate gene transcript levels ranged from 0.092–0.786 (median h²=0.278, P=4.72×10⁻⁴). Linkage analyses yielded significant evidence (LOD≥2.73) for 14 eQTLs (LOD score range 2.76–14.87, genome-wide P=4.9×10⁻²–1.03×10⁻¹⁴). Estimates of genetic correlation supported shared additive genetic effects incorporating all 57 transcripts (null hypothesis of ρG=0 rejected at FDR≤0.05 for 522 of 1596 estimates), and accounted for most of the observed phenotypic correlation among transcripts (Mantel test, r[ρP], [ρG]=0.781, P<0.0001). Network analysis revealed direct interactions among 54 of the 57 coded proteins. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that major genetic effects influence expression levels of multiple genes implicated in Th1 and Th2 immune response. Additionally, we find that expression levels of these candidate genes are characterized by extensive pleiotropy, consistent with known interaction among their coded proteins, many of which are independently associated with atherosclerosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aPapio 3aadditive gene effects 3aatherosclerosis 3acomputer software 3adiet 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetic correlation 3agenomics 3aheritability 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3aphenotypic correlation 3apleiotropy 3aproteins 3aquantitative trait loci 3arisk factors 3avariance 2aAnimals 2aAtherosclerosisxgeneticsximmunology. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Regulatory Networks 2aGenetic Pleiotropy 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aHeredity 2aInflammationxgeneticsximmunology. 2aMale 2aModels, Genetic 2aPapio hamadryas 2aPhenotype 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aRisk Assessment 2aRisk Factors 2aTh1 Cellsximmunology 2aTh2 Cellsximmunology 2aTranscription, Genetic1 aCurran, J.E.1 aJohnson, M.P.1 aDyer, T.D.1 aMoses, E.K.1 aBlangero, J.1 aCox, L.A.1 aRogers, J.1 aHavill, L.M.1 aVandeBerg, J.L.1 aMahaney, M.C.0 tAtherosclerosis.g2011 Aug., v. 217, no. 2 p.387-394dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0021-91507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.06.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245004900170300001800219520135900237592002801596650002601624650002201650650001901672650001901691650001801710650001801728650001601746650001801762650001601780650001101796650002901807650002201836650002201858650002201880650001201902651001001914653002201924653001801946653002701964653000901991653001002000700002202010773010502032856008402137852000902221655001202230IND60122669020221118151410.0150325e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012266902DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2013.8005902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaxena, Pallavi10aOrnamental plants as sinks and bioindicators  ap. 3059-3067.  aMitigation of urban air pollution is a big challenge, especially for the metropolitan cities of the world. In an Indian metropolis like Delhi, even after the implementation of several control policies, no such remarkable change has been observed in its air quality. Globally, afforestation or greenbelt development is an effective and well-recognized pollution abatement process. The aim of our present study was to examine the biochemical response of some naturalized ornamental plant species, viz. Dracaena deremensis, Tagetes erecta, Rosa indica and Dianthus caryophyllus . During experimental study, plants were kept at selected sites which were categorized in terms of traffic density (emission source) and vegetative pattern during winter months for 120 days. Four biochemical parameters, viz. total chlorophyll, ascorbic acid, pH, relative water contents along with Air Pollution Tolerance Indices were determined from foliar samples at each selected site. D. deremensis and T. erecta were classified under tolerant while R. indica and D. caryophyllus were marked as in sensitive category. Based on the sensitivity of selected plant species, it has been recommended that D. deremensis and T. erecta may be used as sinks for the abatement of air pollution at highly polluted sites whereas R. indica and D. caryophyllus can be used as bioindicators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDianthus caryophyllus 3aDracaena fragrans 3aRosa chinensis 3aTagetes erecta 3aafforestation 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aascorbic acid 3achlorophyll 3acities 3aenvironmental technology 3aissues and policy 3aornamental plants 3apollution control 3atraffic 3aIndia 0aornamental plants 0aair pollution 0abiochemical parameters 0aAPTI 0aDelhi1 aGhosh, Chirashree0 tEnvironmental technology.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 34, no. 23 p.3059-3067dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2013.8005903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03675naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245016100171300001600332520178300348592002802131596007502159596008102234596008302315596009002398596007302488650002502561650001802586650001602604650002602620650002502646650001202671650001802683650001802701650000902719650001102728650001502739650001802754650001602772650001102788651001702799651001102816700002602827700002402853700002902877700002302906773013602929856008303065852000903148655001203157IND60773462120221119202644.0220507e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077346212DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-021-00822-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDantas, Daniela P.10aEconomic effects of production scale, use of agricultural greenhouses, and integration of tropical aquaculture species when farming in a subtropical climate  ap. 547-579.  aFresh and local production of tropical fish species are growing in demand in subtropical and temperate regions. However, their productions are limited by the short growing season and uncertainty related to using agricultural greenhouses. Thus, this study evaluated the economic feasibility of Amazon River prawn (Macrobrachium amazonicum) and tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) grow-outs in monoculture and integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems carried out in a subtropical region of Brazil, considering the transfer of the fish to agricultural greenhouses to complete the grow-out during the winter season. Simulations were performed of each system on small- (1 ha) and medium (5 ha)-sized properties to test the effects of production system and scale on cost return and cash flow, economic indicators, and sensitivity (risk) to productivity and market changes. Treatments were prawn monoculture (PRWN), tambaqui monoculture (FISH), IMTA of prawns and tambaqui reared free-swimming (IMTA), and IMTA of prawns reared free-swimming and tambaqui reared in net cages (CAGE). Harvested prawns were marketed for recreational fishing and the tambaqui is traded for the next grow-out phase after overwintering in greenhouses. Internal rate of return (IRR), net present value (NPV), payback period (PP), and benefit–cost ratio (BCR) showed economic feasibility for all systems, and shorter PP and greater profitability were observed with an increased size of the properties. In addition, the integrated systems showed resilience by remaining economically feasible when subjected to variations in productivity, major costs, and selling price. Further research should test the technical feasibility of producing tambaqui in greenhouses during the winter in colder climates.  aPublisher supplied data  a2010/51271-6cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a140306/2013cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a306361/2014-0cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a88887.571010/2020-00cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aColossoma macropomum 3aMacrobrachium 3aaquaculture 3acost benefit analysis 3aeconomic feasibility 3amarkets 3aoverwintering 3aprofitability 3arisk 3ashrimp 3asubtropics 3atropical fish 3auncertainty 3awinter 3aAmazon River 3aBrazil1 aFlickinger, Dallas L.1 aCosta, Gelcirene A.1 aMoraes-Valenti, Patricia1 aValenti, Wagner C.0 tAquaculture international.g2022 Apr., v. 30, no. 2 p.547-579dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl57531x0967-61207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-021-00822-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245016000162300001600322520156500338592002801903650001201931650002001943650001801963650002601981650001702007650000902024650003302033650002402066650002702090650001602117700002302133700002002156700002002176773010002196856007402296852000902370655001202379IND60125899820221119062414.0150428e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012589982DNAL7 a10.1111/jtxs.120952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchenkel, Philipp10aCharacterization of Commercial Cheese Regarding Thermophysical Properties and Application of Multivariate Statistical Analysis to Elaborate Product Mapping  ap. 440-451.  aA variety of 25 commercial cheese were analyzed by means of four different methods to evaluate thermophysical parameters in order to estimate methods with high potential to differentiate between cheese varieties. Rheological properties of different temperatures were obtained by a dynamic oscillatory shear test. Furthermore, stretchability, meltability and the formation of free oil were obtained. Principal component analysis was applied to the data set to receive a mapping of the cheese. A reduction of the analyzed parameters to three principal components accounting for 76.3% of the total variation was achieved, indicating that the methods are well suited to characterize the cheese samples. Mapping of the obtained scores points out gaps and indicates missing products. This was demonstrated by including different experimental cheese with modified manufacturing protocols to the data set. Therefore, mapping supports cheese producers to design new products with specified characteristics by influencing the manufacturing protocol. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Mapping of different commercial cheese visualizes cheese products in terms of thermophysical properties. This identifies missing products and supports accelerated product development by creating products with defined properties by influencing the manufacturing protocol. Furthermore, the availability of reliable methods and parameters to describe the thermophysical properties of cheese is of major importance for the cheese manufacturer in terms of quality management and characterizing cheese.  aPublisher supplied data 3acheeses 3adata collection 3amanufacturing 3amultivariate analysis 3anew products 3aoils 3aprincipal component analysis 3aproduct development 3arheological properties 3atemperature1 aHartmann, Katja I.1 aSamudrala, Ravi1 aHinrichs, Jörg0 tJournal of texture studies.g2014 Dec., v. 45, no. 6 p.440-451dBlackwell Pub.x0022-49017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jtxs.120953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03289naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245009100211300002000302520150600322592002801828650002501856650001301881650002101894650001701915650003801932650001501970650002301985650003302008650001502041650002602056650002102082650001902103650001502122650001102137650002102148650001502169653001302184653001402197653001402211653001502225653001202240653000902252700002102261700002002282700001802302700002102320700002102341700005802362700006302420773014602483856008502629852000902714655001202723IND60619933220190201000000.0181105e20181005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061993322DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b026592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaretto, Alessio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1635-865110aFully Biobased Polyesters Based on an Isosorbide Monomer for Coil Coating Applications  ap. 14125-14134.  aIn this work, novel fully biobased polyester resins are presented for use as binders in the field of coil coating technology. These new materials are based on the copolymerization of isosorbide (ISo) with different industrially available aliphatic biobased building blocks. In order to assess the effect of chemical composition on the chemical–physical properties of such biobased polyester resins, the amount of ISo was systematically varied (18–36 wt %), and the molecular weight and thermal response of the resulting materials were evaluated by means of gel permeation chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric analysis. It was found that by tuning the ISo content in the resins, their glass transition temperature (Tg) could be controlled (−22 to 28 °C) without considerably affecting their molecular weight (in the range of 4000–5000 g/mol). The resulting cross-linked coatings (both clear and pigmented) were found to exhibit excellent mechanical properties as well as chemical and photochemical durability, as evidenced by comparative microindentation, hydrolysis, and accelerated weathering tests conducted on the new biobased systems and on commercial oil-based benchmarks. The results of this study demonstrate a versatile approach to tune the chemical–physical response of fully biobased polyester coatings and provide evidence of the potential of ISo-based polyester binders as sustainable high-performance materials for coil coating applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3acoatings 3acopolymerization 3acrosslinking 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adurability 3agel chromatography 3aglass transition temperature 3ahydrolysis 3amechanical properties 3amolecular weight 3aphotochemistry 3apolyesters 3aresins 3athermogravimetry 3aweathering 0aBiobased 0aRenewable 0aPolyester 0aIsosorbide 0aCoating 0aCoil1 aPassoni, Valeria1 aBrenna, Nicolò1 aSitta, Matteo1 aOgliosi, Lorenzo1 aCatel, Guglielmo1 aTurri, Stefano1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8996-06031 aGriffini, Gianmarco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9924-17220 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Oct. 05, v. 6, no. 11 p.14125-14134dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b026593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02020naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245017000158300002000328520077500348592002801123650002201151650002101173650001501194650001501209650001901224650001901243650001301262650002501275650003201300650003301332650002301365700001301388700001301401700001301414773012401427856007401551852000901625655001201634IND60667495420221121232154.0190919e20150610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066749542DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra04488j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Jia-Ping10aHydrophilic molecularly imprinted microspheres functionalized with amino and carboxyl groups for highly selective recognition of human hemoglobin in aqueous solution  ap. 51392-51398.  aThe hydrophilic molecularly imprinted microspheres (HMIMs) functionalized with amino and carboxyl groups have been synthesized successfully using human hemoglobin as a template.

Elucidating the changes in biofluid small metabolite concentration during AD could improve both diagnosis and treatment. Ginsenosides Rg1 (GRg1) and Rb1 (GRb1), the pharmacologically active ingredients in ginseng, reportedly offer protection against AD symptoms, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. These were investigated in the present study by examining the metabolite profiles of AD mice. The cognitive function of mice was tested in the Morris water maze and pathological changes to the brain were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Global metabolite profiling by ultra performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and principal component analysis were carried out to identify metabolites that are differentially expressed in AD animals with or without ginsenosides treatment. A total of 10 potential biomarkers were identified that were associated with the metabolism of lecithin, amino acids, and sphingolipids in AD mice. The peak intensities of lysophosphatidylcholine, tryptophan, and dihydrosphingosine were lower, while that of phenylalanine was higher, in AD than in control mice. GRg1 treatment affected all three metabolic pathways, while GRb1 treatment affected lecithin and amino acid but not sphingolipid metabolism. These results provide the first evidence of a link between metabolite imbalance and AD, and reveal a molecular basis for the therapeutic benefits of ginsenosides in AD treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aPanax 3aactive ingredients 3aanimal models 3abiochemical pathways 3abiomarkers 3abrain 3acognition 3agene expression regulation 3aginsenosides 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alysophosphatidylcholine 3amass spectrometry 3amedicinal properties 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amice 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aphenylalanine 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprotective effect 3asphingolipids 3atryptophan 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aAlzheimer's disease 0aMetabolomics 0aUPLC–MS 0aGinsenosides Rg1 and Rb11 aZhou, Ling1 aLi, Wei1 aLiu, Ying1 aWang, Jiahe1 aHe, Ping0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2015 Mar. 15, v. 985 p.54-61dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245009300171520151000264592002801774650002101802650000901823650002001832650001801852650002601870650002101896650001901917650001301936650002301949650001801972650001701990650001502007653001702022653002002039653001302059653002602072653001902098700001602117700001502133700001702148700002202165700001202187700005102199773009202250856009002342852000902432655001202441IND60777373720221119081404.0220830e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077737372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1349212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zeyou10aNaCl salinity enhances tetracycline bioavailability to Escherichia coli on agar surfaces  aSoil salinity is a worldwide problem and is damaging soil functions. Meanwhile, increasing amounts of anthropogenic antibiotics are discharged to agricultural soils. Little is known about how soil salinity (e.g., NaCl) could influence the bioavailability of antibiotics to bacteria. In this study, a tetracycline-responsive Escherichia coli bioreporter grew on the surfaces of agar microcosms at the same tetracycline concentration (200 μg/L), but various NaCl concentrations (0.5–19.2 g/L) with estimated osmotic potential of −0.18 to −1.80 MPa, and agar content (0.3%–5%) with estimated intrinsic permeability of 38 to 32,928 nm². These agar microcosms mimicked very fine textured soils with a range of NaCl salinity. Increasing agar content lowered the intrinsic permeability hence decreasing tetracycline bioavailability to E. coli, due likely to the reduced mass transfer of tetracycline via water flow. Intriguingly, tetracycline bioavailability increased with increasing NaCl concentration which caused the increase in osmotic stress. This is contradictory to the notion that osmotic stress reduces bacterial chemical uptake. Further analysis of E. coli membrane integrity demonstrated that the enhanced tetracycline bioavailability to bacteria could result from the compromised cell membranes and enhanced membrane permeability at higher NaCl salinity. Overall, this study suggests that high soil salinity (NaCl) may enhance the selection pressure exerted by antibiotics on bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aagar 3abioavailability 3amass transfer 3amembrane permeability 3aosmotic pressure 3aosmotic stress 3asalinity 3aselection pressure 3asoil salinity 3atetracycline 3awater flow 0aTetracycline 0aBioavailability 0aSalinity 0aAntibiotic resistance 0aClimate change1 aYin, Lichun1 aZhang, Wei1 aPeng, Anping1 aSallach, J.

Our goal was to study parasitism in migratory caribou (Rangifertarandus (L., 1758)) of North America and Greenland. A total of 1507 caribou were sampled across 12 herds to assess seven of their main helminth and arthropod macroparasites between 1978 and 2010. We sought to determine which factors such as sex, age class, herd size, and season best explained the prevalence and intensity of those parasites. Intensity of warble fly (Hypoderma tarandi (L., 1758)) larvae increased with age for males, whereas the opposite was observed in females. Prevalence of giant liver flukes (Fascioloides magna (Bassi, 1875) Ward, 1917), tapeworm Taenia hydatigena Pallas, 1766, and nose bot fly (Cephenemyia trompe (Modeer, 1786)) larvae was higher in adults than in calves. Prevalence of F. magna and T. hydatigena was higher at high herd size than at lower herd size. Greenland herds had the lowest prevalence of T. hydatigena and of the tapeworm Taenia krabbei Moniez, 1879, a higher intensity of H. tarandi, and a higher prevalence of C. trompe than the other herds. Of the herds from Quebec and Labrador, the Rivière-George herd had a higher prevalence of F. magna than the Rivière-aux-Feuilles herd. Our research provides the first comparative survey of these parasites of caribou across a broad spatial–temporal range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCephenemyia trompe 3aFascioloides magna 3aGasterophilus haemorrhoidalis 3aHypoderma tarandi 3aRangifer tarandus 3aTaenia hydatigena 3aadults 3aarthropods 3acalves 3afemales 3aherd size 3ahost-parasite relationships 3alarvae 3aliver flukes 3amales 3aparasitism 3asurveys 3atapeworms 3awildlife 3aGreenland 3aQuebec 0acomparative 0aparasite 0acaribou 0aRangifer tarandus 0ahelminth 0aarthropod 0amonitoring1 aKutz, Susan J.,1 aDucrocq, Julie1 aBeckmen, Kimberlee1 aBrodeur, Vincent1 aCampbell, Mitch1 aCroft, Bruno1 aCuyler, Christine1 aDavison, Tracy M.,1 aElkin, Brett1 aGiroux, Tina1 aKelly, Allicia1 aRussell, Don1 aTaillon, Joëlle1 aVeitch, Alasdair1 aCôté, Steeve D.,0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2016 June 8, v. 94, no. 9 p.607-617dNRC Research Pressx1480-32837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2015-01903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01853naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009000169520088700259592002801146650001901174650001401193650001801207650001701225650001401242650000901256653001801265653001701283653001901300653001601319773010101335856008201436852000901518655001201527IND60733214220221119092134.0220207e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073321422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gfs.2021.1005312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorley, Andrew G.10aLinking armed conflict to malnutrition during pregnancy, breastfeeding, and childhood  aWomen in LMICs are important agricultural actors; however, these same women, and with their children, suffer high rates of acute malnutrition during armed conflicts. A review was undertaken of peer-reviewed literature to describe how armed conflict drives acute malnutrition in pregnant and breastfeeding women and their children.

While in all cases an associative interchange mechanism was found, the associative character was found to increase with increasing charge on the overall system, which in turn is governed by the charge on the ligand Lⁿ. Including the CPCM solvent model into the system decreases the amplitude of the energetic effects, but leaves the general trend intact. Furthermore, the binding energy of a fourth water molecule and the overall exchange activation energy were found to increase with the overall charge on the system. The structures are also influenced by the charge, but to a smaller extent. The Be–O distances to the second coordination sphere water molecule and the distances to the entering/leaving water molecules in the transition state are significantly shortened in the higher charged systems. These effects can be attributed to electrostatic interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aberyllium 3acations 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy 3aligands 3amodels 3aquantum mechanics 3asolvents1 aPuchta, Ralph0 tRSC advances.g2012 June 13, v. 2, no. 13 p.5815-5821dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ra20665j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245013900158300001800297520113100315592002801446650001501474650002301489650002501512650001001537650003001547650001801577650001001595650001501605650002101620651001701641700002401658700001701682700001801699700001701717773014401734856008001878852000901958655001201967IND60757334720221123044418.0211124s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075733472DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2020-01642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuiyuan,10aInvasive dreissenid mussel effects on phosphorus dynamics in Lake Ontario: insights from integrated hydrodynamic–ecological modeling  ap. 1816-1832.  aInvasive dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis) have a profound effect on the total phosphorus (TP) budget in Lake Ontario, which in turn influences ecological processes such as the resurgence of the benthic alga Cladophora. A validated three-dimensional integrated hydrodynamic and ecological modeling framework is applied to quantify the impact that dreissenids have on the spatial and species distribution of TP in the lake. Model results for April to September 2013 show that dreissenids decrease TP in the water column by about 1812 metric tonnes, which is about 60% of the tributary TP loading to the lake. This reduction in TP affects other processes controlling its distribution. Physical transport of TP from nearshore to offshore waters is reduced, and the amount of TP involved in chemical reactions is reduced, while TP processed by biological transformations is increased. This study provides the first attempt to quantify the TP budget changes in Lake Ontario by dreissenids using numerical modeling, and findings of this study can be generalized to other lakes with similar conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladophora 3aDreissena bugensis 3aDreissena polymorpha 3aalgae 3ageographical distribution 3ahydrodynamics 3alakes 3aphosphorus 3atotal phosphorus 3aLake Ontario1 aAtkinson, Joseph F.1 aZhu, Zhenduo1 aSchlea, Derek1 aRedder, Todd0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2021, v. 78, no. 12 p.1816-1832dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2020-01643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245009900164300002000263520134700283592002801630650002401658650001201682650001701694650002201711650001901733650001401752650001701766650001101783650002101794650001101815650002901826650002101855650001101876650002201887650001001909650001401919650001001933650001301943653002801956653002801984653001302012653002802025700001502053700001502068700001602083700005802099700005202157773014702209856008502356852000902441655001202450IND60619933420221120110239.0181105e20180904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061993342DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b026862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hong10aInnovative Reactive Distillation Process for the Sustainable Synthesis of Natural Benzaldehyde  ap. 14114-14124.  aBenzaldehyde (BA) is an aromatic flavor compound with a distinctive bitter almond taste and odor, being the second most produced and valuable natural fruit flavor (after vanillin). Compared to the chemical synthesis route, the BA production from natural resources is very expensive hence significant research effort has spurred into finding more feasible solutions. This study presents a novel reactive distillation (RD) process for the synthesis of natural BA by the alkaline hydrolysis reaction of cinnamaldehyde using β-cyclodextrin as phase transfer catalyst. A rigorous model of the RD process was developed for the plant design and scale-up, and pilot-scale experiments were used to validate the model. Also, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the effects of key operating variables on the RD process performance. The techno-economic analysis shows that the process is feasible, with over 97% and 70% reduction in CapEx and OpEx, over 88% savings in total annual costs, and 70% less CO₂ emissions as compared to the batch technology. Higher conversion and yield can be obtained by RD, within shorter residence time (only 2.9 h instead of 18 h) and using a lower reactants ratio (water:cinnamaldehyde = 11.5 instead of 200) as compared to the conventional process. However, the yield still needs to be further improved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline hydrolysis 3aalmonds 3abenzaldehyde 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3adistillation 3aflavor 3aflavor compounds 3afruits 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amodel validation 3amodels 3anatural resources 3aodors 3asynthesis 3ataste 3avanillin 0aProcess intensification 0aExperimental validation 0aScale-up 0aPhase-transfer catalyst1 aMeng, Ying1 aShu, Chang1 aLi, Xingang1 aKiss, Anton A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5099-606X1 aGao, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0739-84400 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Sept. 04, v. 6, no. 11 p.14114-14124dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b026863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013100167300001800298500001500316520128300331592002801614650004401642650002201686650001201708650002101720650001201741650001401753650001301767650003301780650001601813650003001829650001801859650002101877650001301898650001301911650001201924650002901936650001301965653002501978653001502003653002302018653001702041653006502058653000802123700001802131700001802149700001902167700002002186700001502206700001802221700002602239700002802265700001702293773010502310856008402415852000902499655001202508IND60122669420221118150854.0150325e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012266942DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2013.8031342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZekker, Ivar10aDeammonification process start-up after enrichment of anammox microorganisms from reject water in a moving-bed biofilm reactor  ap. 3095-3101.  a2019-12-04  aDeammonification via intermittent aeration in biofilm process for the treatment of sewage sludge digester supernatant (reject water) was started up using two opposite strategies. Two moving-bed biofilm reactors were operated for 2.5 years at 26 (±0.5)°C with spiked influent (and hence free ammonia (FA)) addition. In the first start-up strategy, an enrichment of anammox biomass was first established, followed by the development of nitrifying biomass in the system (R ₁). In contrast, the second strategy aimed at the enrichment of anammox organisms into a nitrifying biofilm (R ₂). The first strategy was most successful, reaching higher maximum total nitrogen (TN) removal rates over a shorter start-up period. For both reactors, increasing FA spiking frequency and increasing effluent concentrations of the anammox intermediate hydrazine correlated to decreasing aerobic nitrate production (nitritation). The bacterial consortium of aerobic and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria in the bioreactor was determined via denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis, polymerase chain reaction and pyrosequencing. In addition to a shorter start-up with a better TN removal rate, nitrite oxidizing bacteria (Nitrospira) were outcompeted by spiked ammonium feeding from R ₁.  aPublisher supplied data 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3asequence analysis 3aammonia 3anitrogen content 3abiofilm 3ahydrazine 3aaeration 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abioreactors 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asewage sludge 3asewage treatment 3anitrites 3anitrates 3abiomass 3aenvironmental technology 3abacteria 0afree ammonia spiking 0aNitrospira 0aanammox enrichment 0areject water 0acompletely autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite (CANON) 0aDIB1 aRikmann, Ergo1 aTenno, Toomas1 aKroon, Kristel1 aVabamäe, Priit1 aSalo, Erik1 aLoorits, Liis1 adC Rubin, Sergio S.C.1 aVlaeminck, Siegfried E.1 aTenno, Taavo0 tEnvironmental technology.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 34, no. 23 p.3095-3101dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2013.8031343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245013800166300001600304520195700320592002802277650002002305650001102325650002402336650001102360650001902371650001302390650000902403650001802412650001102430650001502441650001102456650001602467650001802483700003702501773010002538856007402638852000902712655001202721IND60125900220221120123900.0150428e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012590022DNAL7 a10.1111/jtxs.120972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChhanwal, Narayansing10aTemperature‐ and Moisture‐Based Modeling for Prediction of Starch Gelatinization and Crumb Softness during Bread‐Baking Process  ap. 462-476.  aTemperature, starch gelatinization, moisture content and softness of bread define the formation of crust and crumb regions during the baking process. A computational model was developed to study the volume expansion, temperature profile and moisture content of the bread during the baking process. An arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian method was applied to describe mesh movement during volume expansion. Model predictions were validated with experimental measurements of bread temperature, moisture content and volume expansion. Occurrence of two distinct zones having different moisture contents, i.e., crust (<10%) and crumb (≈39%), was observed. Extent of starch gelatinization and browning of the bread surface was also studied using earlier published kinetic model. Moreover, softness development for the bread crumb was also modeled based on the degree of starch gelatinization. This study concluded that apart from heat and mass transfer, inclusion of volume expansion in the model predicts more accurate bread temperature, starch gelatinization and crumb softness. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Crumb softness and starch gelatinization of bread can be predicted based on temperature and moisture content of bread using computational modeling approach. A finite element model (FEM) is developed for the bread‐baking process, accounting for heat and mass transfer along with the volume expansion of bread. FEM model is validated with the experimental measurements of temperature, moisture content and volume expansion during bread‐baking process. This model helps in predicting the major quality attributes of the bread such as starch gelatinization, browning of the bread surface and crumb softness. Therefore, this model can be useful in predicting temperature, moisture along with other bread quality parameters. For the bakery industry, it will help to determine the baking time of bread with desired product quality based on oven temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3abakery industry 3abaking 3abreadmaking quality 3abreads 3agelatinization 3ahardness 3aheat 3amass transfer 3amodels 3aprediction 3astarch 3atemperature 3awater content1 aAnandharamakrishnan, Chinnaswamy0 tJournal of texture studies.g2014 Dec., v. 45, no. 6 p.462-476dBlackwell Pub.x0022-49017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jtxs.120973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245016900161520175300330592002802083650001202111650001902123650002502142650001002167650001502177650001502192650002402207650002402231650000902255650001302264650001902277651001902296651001202315700002102327700002402348700002702372700002102399700002002420700001702440700002002457700002802477700001902505700002102524700002202545700002002567700003102587773012302618856007502741852000902816655001202825IND60782448820221121222224.0220708e20220629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078244882DNAL7 a10.3390/nu141327182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukhtar, Maryam 14aThe Associations of Selenoprotein Genetic Variants with the Risks of Colorectal Adenoma and Colorectal Cancer: Case–Control Studies in Irish and Czech Populations  aBackground: Selenium manifests its biological effects through its incorporation into selenoproteins, which play several roles in countering oxidative and inflammatory responses implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis. Selenoprotein genetic variants may contribute to colorectal cancer (CRC) development, as we previously observed for SNP variants in a large European prospective study and a Czech case–control cohort. Methods: We tested if significantly associated selenoprotein gene SNPs from these studies were also associated with CRC risk in case–control studies from Ireland (colorectal neoplasia, i.e., cancer and adenoma cases: 450, controls: 461) and the Czech Republic (CRC cases: 718, controls: 646). Genotyping of 23 SNPs (20 in the Irish and 13 in the Czechs) was performed by competitive specific allele-specific PCR (KASPar). Multivariable adjusted logistic regression was used to assess the associations with CRC development. Results: We found significant associations with an increased CRC risk for rs5859 (SELENOF) and rs2972994 (SELENOP) in the Irish cohort but only with rs4802034 (SELENOV) in the Czechs. Significant associations were observed for rs5859 (SELENOF), rs4659382 (SELENON), rs2972994 (SELENOP), rs34713741 (SELENOS), and the related Se metabolism gene variant rs2275129 (SEPHS1) with advanced colorectal neoplasia development. However, none of these findings retained significance after multiple testing corrections. Conclusions: Several SNPs previously associated with CRC risk were also associated with CRC or colorectal neoplasia development in either the Irish or Czech cohorts. Selenoprotein gene variation may modify CRC risk across diverse European populations, although the specific variants may differ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenoma 3acarcinogenesis 3acolorectal neoplasms 3agenes 3agenotyping 3ametabolism 3aprospective studies 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3aselenium 3aselenoproteins 3aCzech Republic 3aIreland1 aAshfield, Niall 1 aVodickova, Ludmila 1 aVymetalkova, Veronika 1 aLevý, Miroslav,1 aLiska, Václav 1 aBrůha, Jan,1 aBendova, Petra 1 aO’Sullivan, Jacintha 1 aDoherty, Glen 1 aSheahan, Kieran 1 aNolan, Blathnaid 1 aVodicka, Pavel 1 aHughes, D.

In order to study the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution in rat, a specific ultra-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) method was developed with midazolam as internal standard. The calibration curves in plasma and tissues were linear in the range of 5–5000ng/mL (r2>0.99). The recoveries were better than 80.4% and matrix effects ranged from 96.9% to 105.1%. Then, the developed UPLC–MS/MS method was applied to determine the concentration of XL184 in blood and tissues. The pharmacokinetics of four different dosages (iv 5, 10mg/kg and ig 15, 30mg/kg) revealed that XL184 was eliminated slowly, the t1/2 was longer than 10h and the absolute bioavailability was 25.6±8.3%. The concentration distribution of XL184 in tissues was liver>lung>kidney>spleen>heart. Based on the concentration–time of XL184 in tissues, a BP-ANN distribution model was developed with good performance, and can be used to predict the concentration of XL184 in tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3ablood 3aheart 3akidneys 3aliquid chromatography 3aliver 3alungs 3amodels 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 3areceptor protein-tyrosine kinase 3aspleen 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atissue distribution 0aCabozantinib 0aUPLC–MS/MS 0aPharmacokinetics 0aBP-ANN1 aWang, Shuanghu1 aLin, Feiyan1 aZhang, Qingwei1 aChen, Huiling,1 aWang, Xianchuan1 aWen, Congcong1 aMa, Jianshe1 aHu, Lufeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3494-24050 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2015 Mar. 01, v. 983-984 p.125-131dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.01.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245012500207300002000332520126200352592002801614650002301642650001301665650001101678650001401689650002301703650001101726650001101737650001501748650001701763650000901780650001601789650001401805650001501819650001101834650000901845653002301854653001301877653002601890653002801916653001701944700001901961700002001980700005202000773014702052856008502199852000902284655001202293IND60619933720221120093153.0181105e20180912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061993372DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b027622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yi-Meng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0976-767310aIn Situ Fabrication of Electro-Fenton Catalyst from Fe²⁺ in Acid Mine Drainage: Influence of Coexisting Metal Cations  ap. 14154-14161.  aThe air-cathode fuel cell (AC-FC) technology provides a facile approach to in situ utilize Fe²⁺ in acid mine drainage (AMD) for the fabrication of iron oxide/carbon composite with electro-Fenton (EF) catalytic activity. Herein, the impacts of coexisting metal cations other than the Fe²⁺ in AMD on such an EF catalyst fabrication process are investigated. The results show that coexisting metal cations are able to be introduced into the Fe₃O₄/GF composite and influence iron content in it. The Ni²⁺, Zn²⁺, Al³⁺, and Cu²⁺ in AMD lower iron content in the prepared composite and thus present a detrimental effect on its EF catalytic activity. In comparison, the Co²⁺ and Mn²⁺ hardly affect iron content in the composite. Instead, they are doped into the Fe₃O₄ structure to give mixed-metal oxides with enhanced EF catalytic activities. Practice on the treatment of real AMDs suggests the practical effectiveness of AC-FC technology for the simultaneous removal of heavy metal cations and fabrication of heterogeneous EF catalyst from real AMDs. Notably, the AC-FC technology is expected to provide a prospective approach for fabricating transition metal doped iron oxides from AMD rich in Fe²⁺ and transition metal cations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid mine drainage 3aaluminum 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3acopper 3afuel cells 3aheavy metals 3airon 3airon oxides 3amanganese 3ametal ions 3anickel 3azinc 0aAcid mine drainage 0aFe3O4/GF 0aAir-cathode fuel cell 0aElectro-Fenton catalyst 0aMetal cation1 aZhai, Lin-Feng1 aDuan, Ming-Feng1 aSun, Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7527-67120 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Sept. 12, v. 6, no. 11 p.14154-14161dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b027623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04016naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004700113040001800160100002000178245009100198300001600289520167500305592002801980650001002008650002102018650002002039650001602059650001502075650001902090650001102109650001902120650001502139650000902154650002202163650000902185650001502194650002502209650002102234650001202255650005402267650004502321650005402366650003902420650003302459650002702492650001102519650002902530650000902559650000902568650002302577650001902600650005602619650003502675650003002710650006802740650002802808700002002836700001902856700001902875700001702894700002302911700002202934700002202956700001602978700002102994700002203015773009603037856009303133990002303226852000903249655001203258IND60088864020221120031836.0141102e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008886402DNAL7 a215145912pmid7 a10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.03.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaima, Nobuhiro10aImaging mass spectrometry-based histopathologic examination of atherosclerotic lesions  ap. 427-432.  aAIMS: Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) enables the visualization of individual molecules present on tissue sections. We attempted to identify and visualize specific markers for aortic atherosclerotic lesions. METHODS AND RESULTS: Atherosclerotic lesions were obtained from aortic roots of apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-deficient mice at 60 weeks of age and from femoral arteries of humans with peripheral artery occlusive disease. IMS was performed with a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry time-of-flight (TOF)/TOF-type instrument. The molecular ions at m/z 671.6 and 673.6 were found to be specific molecules in the mouse and human lipid-rich regions. These molecules were assigned as cholesterol linoleate (CE 18:2) and cholesterol oleate (CE 18:1). In the case of the human samples, triacylglycerol was also localized in the lipid-rich regions. The distributions of the molecular ions at m/z 804.5 and 832.5 were the same as the distribution of both the mouse and the human SMCs. These molecules were assigned as phosphatidylcholine (PC) (diacyl 16:0/20:4) and PC (diacyl 18:0/20:4). The molecular ion at m/z 566.9 was localized in the mouse calcified regions, and the molecular ions at m/z 539.0 were localized in the human calcified regions. CONCLUSIONS: The IMS-based histopathologic examination (IbHE) revealed the characteristic peaks of lipid-rich regions, SMCs, and calcified regions in the atherosclerotic lesions.

Here we show that the two methods can be combined in one molecule to obtain both accurate distance information and the kinetics of intramolecular contact formation. In a first step, we show that the fluorescent dyes Alexa 488 and Alexa 594, which are frequently used as a donor and acceptor for single-molecule FRET, are also suitable as PET probes with tryptophan as a fluorescence quencher. We then performed combined FRET/PET experiments with FRET donor- and acceptor-labeled polyproline peptides. The placement of a tryptophan residue into the polyglycylserine tail incorporated in the peptides allowed us to measure both FRET efficiencies and the nanosecond dynamics of contact formation between one of the fluorescent dyes and the quencher. Variation of the linker length between the polyproline and the Alexa dyes and in the position of the tryptophan residue demonstrates the sensitivity of this approach. Modeling of the combined photon statistics underlying the combined FRET and PET process enables the accurate analysis of both the resulting transfer efficiency histograms and the nanosecond fluorescence correlation functions. This approach opens up new possibilities for investigating single biomolecules with high spatial and temporal resolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3amodels 3apeptides 3aphotons 3aphysical chemistry 3astatistics 3atryptophan1 aZosel, Franziska1 aReymond, Luc1 aNettels, Daniel1 aSchuler, Benjamin0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2013 Oct. 24, v. 117, no. 42 p.13015-13028dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp402352s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012500158300002000283520123000303592002801533650002301561650002201584650003701606650001401643650001301657650001901670650001501689650001501704650003401719650001101753650002101764650003701785650003701822700001801859700001301877700001301890700001801903773012401921856007402045852000902119655001202128IND60667496420221117223019.0190919e20150602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066749642DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra04508h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Xiu-Zhi10aImproved chemical stability of silver by selective distribution of silver particles on reduced graphene oxide nanosheets  ap. 49257-49262.  aThe chemical stability of particles on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets is an important issue for the RGO/particles hybrid materials. Here we report that the chemical stability of environmentally sensitive silver can be significantly improved by controlling the distribution of silver particles on RGO nanosheets. By switching the sequence of “deoxygenation” and “deposition”, two kinds of RGO/silver hybrids are prepared. The structure and chemical state of silver particles on RGO are investigated by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, Raman spectra, transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscope. It is found that the graphene/Ag hybrid prepared by “deposition” and then “deoxygenation” can still exhibit obvious surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signals after 10-month storage, compared with the hybrid material fabricated in inverse order. The selective distribution of silver particles and non-uniform dispersion of electrons on RGO nanosheets are responsible for the different performances. This study provides a new insight into preparing chemically stable RGO/particle hybrid materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aelectrons 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ananosheets 3ananosilver 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asilver 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aChen, Xuelong1 aWu, Gang1 aHu, Xiao1 aYang, Jinglei0 tRSC advances.g2015 June 02, v. 5, no. 61 p.49257-49262dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra04508h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02785naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245008700170300001800257520137700275536011501652592002801767650002401795650001401819650002001833650001201853650001201865650001401877650001301891650001801904650001401922650001701936650002701953650002301980650001702003650001502020650001402035651001502049700002302064700001902087773014402106856008002250852000902330655001202339IND60757335320221120052327.0211124s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075733532DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2020-04672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuchanan, Rebecca A.10aOutmigration survival of a threatened steelhead population through a tidal estuary  ap. 1869-1886.  aJuvenile steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are exposed to numerous threats in heterogeneous, estuarine environments, yet understanding of survival patterns and processes during this migratory stage is often limited by studies that use surrogate species or are restricted in duration and spatial specificity. Lack of detailed survival information in this critical migratory stage limits the effectiveness of management to maintain juvenile life history diversity in threatened populations. We used acoustic telemetry with multistate mark–recapture models to investigate survival patterns during a key stage of the juvenile emigration of anadromous steelhead through the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta of California, United States, over multiple years, including three drought years. Survival was highly variable both within and among the six years of the study; estimated total survival through the Delta ranged from 0.06 (May 2014) to 0.69 (March 2011). Survival in the upstream reaches was associated with river discharge into the Delta, while survival through the lower reaches was associated with migration route. The lack of a single factor associated with survival in all reaches counteracts preconceived ideas of survival processes. Hydrodynamic manipulation and habitat improvements are recommended to support this anadromous population in a changing climate.  aThis research was supported by the US Bureau of Reclamation (contract No. R11AC20116, R13AC20506, R17AC00042).  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aacoustics 3aanadromous fish 3aclimate 3adrought 3aestuaries 3ahabitats 3ahydrodynamics 3ajuveniles 3alife history 3amark-recapture studies 3amigratory behavior 3ariver deltas 3ariver flow 3atelemetry 3aCalifornia1 aButtermore, Elissa1 aIsrael, Joshua0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2021, v. 78, no. 12 p.1869-1886dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2020-04673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245008100163300001600244520140400260592002801664650002501692650001401717650001401731650001401745650000901759650000901768650001301777650001501790650001101805650001301816650001401829650001401843650003201857650001401889650001901903650001601922653002001938653001401958653001401972653001501986653001102001653001302012653001202025653002502037653002502062653002002087653001502107653001502122700002002137700001902157773010802176856007702284852000902361655001202370IND60550157120221116154445.0160909e20160617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055015712DNAL7 a10.1139/cjz-2016-00882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCatania, S.V.L.10aSize-dependent predation alters interactions between parasites and predators  ap. 631-635.  aIncreasing evidence indicates that parasites play an important role within many systems as prey for higher trophic levels. Predation on parasites can decrease their numbers and may affect host infection rates. Cercariae, a free-living infectious stage of trematode parasites, are abundant in freshwater systems and are directly consumed by a number of freshwater predators. However, few studies have tested whether predators exhibit a preference for cercariae when alternative prey are available or how these preferences vary across predator body sizes. We assessed whether dragonfly larvae (dot-tailed whiteface, Leucorrhinia intacta (Hagen, 1861)), top predators in freshwater systems without fish, foraged preferentially when presented with two prey types, cercariae and zooplankton, and whether foraging preferences changed across predator body size. Body size of larval dragonfly predators was found to be significantly, and negatively, related to the fraction of cercariae in the diet. Larger bodied dragonfly larvae shifted their diet choice from cercariae to zooplankton. Changes in foraging selectivity as body size increases across a predator’s ontogeny can alter the strength of predator–prey interactions. Further investigation into size-selective foraging on parasites may provide new insights into the effects of predation on parasite abundance and transmission in natural systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnisoptera (Odonata) 3aTrematoda 3abody size 3acercariae 3adiet 3afish 3aforaging 3afreshwater 3alarvae 3aontogeny 3aparasites 3apredation 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredators 3atrophic levels 3azooplankton 0apredator–prey 0afood webs 0atrematode 0aparasitism 0alentic 0aforaging 0aOdonata 0aLeucorrhinia intacta 0adot-tailed whiteface 0aDiplostomatidae 0aStrigeidae 0aDaphnia sp1 aKoprivnikar, J.1 aMcCauley, S.J.0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2016 June 17, v. 94, no. 9 p.631-635dNRC Research Pressx1480-32837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2016-00883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245015500152300001800307520143800325592002801763650002201791650001101813650003701824650002001861650002101881650001701902650002201919650003301941650001901974650001301993650001202006650003702018700001202055700001902067700001602086700001502102700001402117700001502131700001502146700001902161773012102180856007402301852000902375655001202384IND60664104620221120231049.0190910e20120806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066410462DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ra20675g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Fei10aMorphology-controllable synthesis and enhanced luminescence properties of β-NaLuF₄:Ln (Ln = Eu, Tb and Ce/Tb) microcrystals by solvothermal process  ap. 7569-7577.  aControlled synthesis of β-NaLuF₄ with uniform morphology, dimension and considerable monodispersity was designed via a gentle solvothermal process by using ethylenediamine (EDA) and ethylene glycol (EG) as the mixed solvent and NaNO₃ as a mineralizer. X-ray diffraction (XRD), field scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS) and down-conversion (DC) photoluminescence spectra were used to characterize the samples. The results indicate that the as-prepared β-NaLuF₄ microcrystals can be rationally modified in phase, size and morphology by tuning the solvent constitution, NaNO₃ content, and reaction time. Moreover, the crystal growth process was thoroughly discussed through a series of time-dependent experiments and a possible formation mechanism was proposed. Furthermore, the DC luminescence properties as well as the emission mechanisms of β-NaLuF₄:Ln³⁺ (Ln = Eu, Tb and Ce/Tb) microcrystals were systematically investigated. It is found that the DC luminescence properties can be improved observably by introducing Ce³⁺ into the β-NaLuF₄ microcrystals and the doping concentration of the Ce³⁺ is optimized under a fixed concentration of Tb³⁺. It is expected that the synthesis strategy can be applied to prepare many other types of micro- and nano-crystals as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acerium 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aethylene glycol 3aethylenediamines 3ananocrystals 3aphotoluminescence 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium nitrate 3asolvents 3aterbium 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aNiu, Na1 aZhang, Zhenguo1 aZhang, Xiao1 aWang, Dong1 aBai, Ling1 aGai, Shili1 aLi, Xingbo1 aYang, Piaoping0 tRSC advances.g2012 Aug. 6, v. 2, no. 19 p.7569-7577dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ra20675g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245014700178520158900325592002801914650001501942650002801957650001301985650001501998650001402013650001402027650002002041650001102061650000902072650000902081650001102090653001802101653002202119653003002141653002502171653001902196653001402215700002802229700002402257700002102281700002902302773009202331856009002423852000902513655001202522IND60777374520221119081336.0220621e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077737452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1349292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalar, Carlin Geor10aModelling of urea hydrolysis kinetics using genetic algorithm coupled artificial neural networks in urease immobilized magnetite nanoparticles  aThe presence of urea in runoff from fertilized soil could be contributing to the growth of dangerous blooms. Enzymatic urea hydrolysis is a well-known outstanding process that, when integrated with nanotechnology, would be much more efficient. This research provides a novel perspective on magnetic nanobiocatalysts that reduce diffusion barriers in effective urea hydrolysis. Surprisingly, the model developed with the use of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) demonstrated that the system's diffusion restrictions were reduced. In order to forecast accurate outputs using artificial intelligence (AI), a neural network with one hidden layer and 20 neurons was built utilizing multilayer feed-forward network and showed highest output (diffusion co-efficient) with least mean square error (MSE). The diffusion coefficients of free urease, urease immobilized onto porous MNs (U-aMNs), and nanobiocatalyst, i.e. urease immobilized onto surface modified MNs (U-MNᵦ), were 1.9 × 10⁻¹⁷, 12.62 × 10⁻¹⁶, and 15.48 × 10⁻¹⁶ cm²/min, respectively. These results revealed that the addition of Chitosan to the surface of MNs had a considerable impact on enzyme dispersion. The decrease in Damkohler number (Da) from 2.37 ± 0.26 for U-aMNs to 2.19 ± 0.11 for U-MNᵦ suggested a beneficial effect in overcoming diffusion constraints. Pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order models were used to analyze urea uptake kinetics, with the former model offering the best fit to the system, with R² values that were much closer to unity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3achitosan 3ahydrolysis 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3aneural networks 3arunoff 3asoil 3aurea 3aurease 0aNanoparticles 0aGenetic algorithm 0aArtificial neural network 0aDiffusion limitation 0aImmobilization 0aMagnetite1 aSeenuvasan, Muthulingam1 aMurugesan, Mohanraj1 aRon Carter, S.B.1 aKumar, Kannaiyan Sathish0 tChemosphere.g2022 Sept., v. 303 p.134929-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1349293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245009000168300001600258520198000274592002802254650002302282650001102305650001102316650002902327650001602356651001702372653003302389653001202422653004202434653004502476653001702521700002102538700002202559700001802581700002402599700002302623773013202646856007802778852000902856655001202865IND60557898520221120185806.0161103e20161021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055789852DNAL7 a10.1515/johh-2016-00492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapaioannou, George10aJoint modelling of flood peaks and volumes: A copula application for the Danube River  ap. 382-392.  aFlood frequency analysis is usually performed as a univariate analysis of flood peaks using a suitable theoretical probability distribution of the annual maximum flood peaks or peak over threshold values. However, other flood attributes, such as flood volume and duration, are necessary for the design of hydrotechnical projects, too. In this study, the suitability of various copula families for a bivariate analysis of peak discharges and flood volumes has been tested. Streamflow data from selected gauging stations along the whole Danube River have been used. Kendall’s rank correlation coefficient (tau) quantifies the dependence between flood peak discharge and flood volume settings. The methodology is applied to two different data samples: 1) annual maximum flood (AMF) peaks combined with annual maximum flow volumes of fixed durations at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 60 days, respectively (which can be regarded as a regime analysis of the dependence between the extremes of both variables in a given year), and 2) annual maximum flood (AMF) peaks with corresponding flood volumes (which is a typical choice for engineering studies). The bivariate modelling of the extracted peak discharge - flood volume couples is achieved with the use of the Ali-Mikhail-Haq (AMH), Clayton, Frank, Joe, Gumbel, Hüsler-Reiss, Galambos, Tawn, Normal, Plackett and FGM copula families. Scatterplots of the observed and simulated peak discharge - flood volume pairs and goodness-of-fit tests have been used to assess the overall applicability of the copulas as well as observing any changes in suitable models along the Danube River. The results indicate that for the second data sampling method, almost all of the considered Archimedean class copula families perform better than the other copula families selected for this study, and that for the first method, only the upper-tail-flat copulas excel (except for the AMH copula due to its inability to model stronger relationships).  aPublisher supplied data 3abivariate analysis 3afloods 3amodels 3aprobability distribution 3astream flow 3aDanube River 0aBivariate frequency analysis 0aCopulas 0aDependence of flood peaks and volumes 0aKendall’s rank correlation coefficient 0aDanube River1 aKohnová, Silvia1 aBacigál, Tomáš1 aSzolgay, Ján1 aHlavčová, Kamila,1 aLoukas, Athanasios0 tJournal of hydrology and hydromechanics.g2016 Oct. 21, v. 64, no. 4 p.382-392dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:21369x1338-43337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/johh-2016-00493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013400162300001800296520104000314592002801354650002301382650002301405650002301428650002001451650001401471650001701485650001201502650002001514650001601534653004001550653002901590653004201619653002501661700001201686700001901698700001601717700001401733700001401747700001701761700001601778773008101794856008101875852000901956655001201965IND60551526420221122042238.0161018e20151021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055152642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2015.08.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yuling10aSynthesis and properties of hyperbranched fluorescence/phosphorescence hybrid copolymers for white polymer light emitting devices  ap. 8052-8058.  aA series of hyperbranched fluorescence/phosphorescence hybrid copolymers with 9,9-dioctylfluorene and bis(1-phenyl-isoquinoline)(acetylacetonato)iridium(III) (Ir(piq)2acac) as the branches and the three-dimensional structured spiro[3,3]heptane-2,6-dispirofluorene (SDF, 10 mol%) as the core have been synthesized by adjusting the feeding ratios of Ir(piq)2acac (0.02–0.05 mol%).

A comprehensive review of its bioactives, metabolism, action mechanisms, and therapeutic merits  aManuka honey (MH) is a mono-floral honey obtained from the Manuka tree (Leptospermum scoparium) belonging to the Myrtaceae family and grows as a shrub or a small tree mostly throughout New Zealand and Eastern Australia. MH is highly valued for its non-peroxide antibacterial properties mainly attributed to its exclusive content of methylglyoxal (MGO). Additionally, MH is rich in macro-and micro-nutrients including, sugars, free amino acids, proteins, enzymes, essential minerals, vitamins, and various secondary metabolites (flavonoids, phenolic acids, and 1, 2-dicarbonyl compounds). The presence of these beneficial phytochemicals is directly linked to its favored health benefits viz., wound healing, anticancer, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. Significant modern pharmacological and clinical evidence have highlighted the wide medicinal applications of MH as a unique mono-floral honey. This comprehensive review capitalizes on MH with emphasis on the interrelationship between its holistic chemical composition, metabolism, action mechanisms, and health effects. Moreover, the review recapitulates the diverse health benefits of MH and related patents in food and functional food applications. MH health benefits are credited to its unique chemical composition. It represents an alternative remedy for different ailments to include bacterial, fungal, parasitic, and viral infections, and is currently exploited in a massive number of patents. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to uncover its action mechanism in wound healing, how to improve its pharmacokinetics, and to identify its bio-transformed metabolites inside the body.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeptospermum scoparium 3aantioxidants 3abioactive compounds 3aflavonoids 3afunctional foods 3afungi 3amanuka honey 3apharmacokinetics 3asecondary metabolites 3ashrubs 3atherapeutics 3atrees 3aAustralia 3aNew Zealand 0aManuka honey 0aChemical composition 0aHealth benefits 0aClinical studies 0aPatents1 aHegazi, Nesrine M.1 aAbd Elghani, Ghada E.1 aFarag, Mohamed A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5139-18630 tFood bioscience.g2021 Aug., v. 42 p.101038-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1010383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04054naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245013700166520270400303592002803007650001503035650001803050650001403068650001203082650001303094650001503107650001503122650000903137650002703146650002603173650002903199650001603228650001303244650000903257650002203266650001603288650002603304700002503330700002503355700002103380773012303401856007503524852000903599655001203608IND60782449520221121222203.0220708e20220630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078244952DNAL7 a10.3390/nu141327242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkolmowska, Dominika 10aEffectiveness of Dietary Interventions to Treat Iron-Deficiency Anemia in Women: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials  aIron-deficiency anemia is the most frequent nutritional deficiency, with women of reproductive age being particularly at risk of its development. The aim of the systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of dietary interventions to treat iron-deficiency anemia in women based on the randomized controlled trials. The systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines and registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42021261235). The searching procedure was based on PubMed and Web of Science databases, while it covered records published until June 2021. It included all randomized controlled trials assessing effectiveness of various dietary interventions on treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in women of childbearing age. The total number of 7825 records were screened, while 14 of them were finally included in the systematic review. The studies were screened, included, and reported, and the risk of bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials by two independent researchers. The included studies compared the effectiveness of various dietary interventions with supplementation, placebo, control, or any other dietary intervention, while the assessed dietary interventions were based either on increasing iron supply and/or on increasing its absorption (by increasing vitamin C or vitamin D or decreasing phytate intake). The duration of applied intervention was diversified from 3 months or less, through 4 or 5 months, to half of a year or more. Among the assessed biochemical measures, the following were analyzed in majority of studies: hemoglobin, ferritin, transferrin receptor, hematocrit, and transferrin. The majority of included studies supported the influence of dietary interventions on the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia, as the applied dietary intervention was not effective in only three studies. The majority of included studies were assessed as characterized by medium risk of bias, while the overall risk was high for only four studies, which resulted from the randomization process, deviations from the intended interventions, and selection of the reported result. The majority of included studies were conducted for increasing iron supply and/or increasing vitamin C supply; however, only for the interventions including increasing iron supply and simultaneously increasing its absorption by vitamin C supply were all results confirmed effective. Vitamin D also seems to be an effective dietary treatment, but further studies are necessary to confirm the observations. Considering this fact, dietary interventions recommended for anemic female patients should include increased intake of iron and vitamin C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aascorbic acid 3adatabases 3afemales 3aferritin 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3airon 3airon deficiency anemia 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutritional intervention 3aphytic acid 3aplacebos 3arisk 3asystematic review 3atransferrin 3atransferrin receptors1 aGłąbska, Dominika 1 aKołota, Aleksandra 1 aGuzek, Dominika 0 tNutrients.g2022 June 30, v. 14, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141327243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010500171300001200276520160500288592002801893650001501921650000801936650002401944650001201968650000901980650001801989650001702007650001402024650001402038650001702052650001302069650000702082650001102089650001902100650001302119650001002132700002002142700002602162700003002188700002202218700002202240700002402262773014102286856008302427852000902510655001202519IND60773463320221119202417.0220505e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077346332DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-022-05610-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusso, Telma Belen10aMudstones as Landfill Liner Material for Heavy Metal Removal: Equilibrium and Dynamic Sorption Study  ap. 144.  aClay materials used as low-permeability barriers at landfill sites can also chemically attenuate inorganic contaminants (heavy metals) in leachate. In this study, Cu(II) removal capacity from aqueous media of a raw calcareous mudstone, used as a liner material, was evaluated through both batch and column tests. Batch experiments were conducted varying contact time, pH, and Cu(II) concentration. In order to simulate waste leachates composition, the effect of the presence of some organic compounds on Cu(II) uptake was also evaluated. Column tests of compacted calcareous mudstone-sand mixtures were performed to evaluate sorption in dynamic systems. The studied calcareous mudstone exhibited higher removal capacity in a wider pH range than a commercial Na-bentonite, which is a widely used heavy metal sorbent and clay liner. It was evidenced that calcite, an important component of the calcareous mudstone and found as very small and highly porous calcareous nannofossils, contributed to its sorption properties playing a significant role in the Cu(II) removal. The presence of an anionic surfactant or phenol slightly affected the removal of Cu(II). In the clay fraction (< 2 µm), Cu(II) sorption was favored by the presence of humic acids, which add new adsorption sites for this metal. The extremely high retardation factor obtained for the raw calcareous mudstone is in good agreement with the high adsorption capacity experimentally proved in batch tests and demonstrated a great ability of this material to retain heavy metal mass during the transport in solution within porous media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3aanionic surfactants 3acalcite 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3aheavy metals 3alandfills 3aleachates 3amicrofossils 3amudstone 3apH 3aphenol 3asoil pollution 3asorbents 3awater1 aCarlos, Luciano1 aParolo, Maria Eugenia1 aFrancisca, Franco Matías1 aPettinari, Gisela1 aGiuliano, Valeria1 aRuffato, Marianerla0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2022 Apr., v. 233, no. 4 p.144-144dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-022-05610-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02252naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012200156300002000278520116200298592002801460650002501488650002301513650002001536650002001556650001901576650001501595650002301610650002001633700001401653700001401667700001401681773012401695856007401819852000901893655001201902IND60667496720221117222807.0190919e20150608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066749672DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra04512f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ling10aIonic strength-modulated catalytic efficiency of a multienzyme cascade nanoconfined on charged hierarchical scaffolds  ap. 50807-50812.  aUnderstanding the effect of ionic strength on the efficiency of this enzyme cascade within charged hierarchical nanospace is not only fundamentally interesting, but also important for translating biochemical pathways to noncellular environments. We herein report ionic strength-modulated efficiency for the enzyme cascade (glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)) within the dendritic polyethylene-cationic poly(p-phenylene ethynylene) (DPE-PPE⁺) biocompatible scaffold. The largest enhancement in activity is observed for DPE-PPE⁺/GOx/HRP system with adding simple salt sodium chloride (0.9 M), which is almost 3 times higher than the corresponding control without the addition of salt. A decrease in the transient time is experimentally observed in DPE-PPE⁺/GOx/HRP system with increasing salt concentration from 0 M to 0.9 M, being in good agreement with the salt-regulated efficiency results. The cationic conjugated PPE⁺ shell of DPE-PPE⁺ is employed as a probe to monitor the ionic strength-modulated electrostatic shielding effects, which has influence on the enzyme release and enzymatic activity for the DPE-PPE⁺/GOx/HRP.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical pathways 3acatalytic activity 3aenzyme activity 3aglucose oxidase 3aionic strength 3aperoxidase 3asalt concentration 3asodium chloride1 aJiang, Li1 aLiu, Yuan1 aYin, Qihe0 tRSC advances.g2015 June 08, v. 5, no. 63 p.50807-50812dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra04512f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010100165300001800266520177500284592002802059650001602087650002202103650002302125650001502148650001502163650001302178650002302191650001702214650001902231650002902250650001902279650001702298650002602315650000902341650001202350650001302362650001502375650000902390650001102399650002302410650001702433650002502450653003002475653001702505653001202522653002502534653002002559700002302579700002102602700001902623773010502642856008402747852000902831655001202840IND60122670320221118171351.0150325e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012267032DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2013.8082432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Y.R.10aUtilizing acid mine drainage sludge and coal fly ash for phosphate removal from dairy wastewater  ap. 3177-3182.  aThis study aims to investigate a new and sustainable approach for the reuse of industrial by-products from wastewater treatment. The dairy industry produces huge volumes of wastewater, characterized by high levels of phosphate that can result in eutrophication and degradation of aquatic ecosystems. This study evaluated the application of acid mine drainage (AMD) sludge, coal fly ash, and lignite as low-cost adsorbents for the removal of phosphate from dairy wastewater. Material characterization using X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area analysis revealed significant amounts of crystalline/amorphous Fe/Al/Si/Ca-based minerals and large surface areas of AMD sludge and fly ash. Batch adsorption isotherms were best described using the Freundlich model. The Freundlich distribution coefficients were 13.7 mg ⁰.⁵⁷⁷ L ⁰.⁴²³ g ⁻¹ and 16.9 mg ⁰.⁴⁷⁸ L ⁰.⁵²² g ⁻¹ for AMD sludge and fly ash, respectively, and the nonlinearity constants suggested favourable adsorption for column applications. The breakthrough curves of fixed-bed columns, containing greater than 10 wt% of the waste materials (individual or composite blends) mixed with sand, indicated that phosphate breakthrough did not occur within 100 pore volumes while the cumulative removal was 522 and 490 mg kg ⁻¹ at 10 wt% AMD sludge and 10 wt% fly ash, respectively. By contrast, lignite exhibited negligible phosphate adsorption, possibly due to small amounts of inorganic minerals suitable for phosphate complexation and limited surface area. The results suggest that both AMD sludge and fly ash were potentially effective adsorbents if employed individually at a ratio of 10 wt% or above for column application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacid mine drainage 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acoal fly ash 3adairy industry 3aenvironmental technology 3aeutrophication 3afluorescence 3aindustrial byproducts 3airon 3alignite 3aminerals 3aphosphates 3asand 3asludge 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3awastewater treatment 0aacid mine drainage sludge 0acoal fly ash 0alignite 0aphosphate adsorption 0awaste recycling1 aTsang, Daniel C.W.1 aOlds, William E.1 aWeber, Paul A.0 tEnvironmental technology.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 34, no. 24 p.3177-3182dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2013.8082433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245016700165300001200332520133900344592002801683596005801711650000801769650001801777650001701795650000901812650001201821650001401833650001601847650001901863650000901882650000901891650001801900650001901918650001701937650001001954700002001964773014101984856008302125852000902208655001202217IND60773463420221119202336.0220505e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077346342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-022-05591-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Anamika10aAmino-functionalized Magnetic Iron Nanoparticles As a Carrier for Laccase Enzyme and Its Potential to Degrade Chlorpyrifos in Contaminated Soil: Fate and Kinetics  ap. 145.  aThe present study utilizes the covalent-crosslinking method to immobilize the laccase enzyme on magnetic iron nanoparticles and further assess its potential in degrading chlorpyrifos in pesticide spiked soil. The soil texture analysis revealed the presence of clay, silt and sand accounting to 7.1%, 14.3%, and 78.6%, respectively. The degradation of chlorpyrifos in spiked soil using laccase enzyme immobilized magnetic iron nanoparticles was measured for 60 days in a batch process. The results revealed a gradual increase in degradation efficiency showing around 29.3%, 43.8%, 56.3%, and 67.3% at the 20th, 30th, 40th, and 50th day of incubation. A maximum degradation of 83.6% was observed on the 60th day of incubation. Intermediate products 2,4-bis(1,1 dimethylethyl) phenol, 1,2 benzenedicarboxylic acid, bis(2-methyl propyl) ester and piperidine confirmed the degradation of chlorpyrifos in soil. The piperidine originated in the chromatogram between 20–40 days of incubation and diminished later. Chlorpyrifos degradation followed pseudo first-order kinetics with a R² of 0.96. Further, the nanoparticles showed no negative impact on soil bacterial population during the antibacterial assay. The study confirms the degradation of chlorpyrifos in contaminated soil using laccase-immobilized nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data  aF.14-2(SC)/2010(SA-III)cUniversity Grants Commission 3aair 3abatch systems 3achlorpyrifos 3aclay 3alaccase 3amagnetism 3apiperidines 3apolluted soils 3asand 3asilt 3asoil bacteria 3asoil pollution 3asoil texture 3awater1 aYogalakshmi, KN0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2022 Apr., v. 233, no. 4 p.145-145dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-022-05591-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245009300167300001800260520120000278592002801478650002501506650002401531650002001555650002101575650002301596650001601619650001401635650001101649650001001660650001501670650002301685650001401708651001201722700002301734700002301757700002201780700002101802700002301823700001801846700002101864700002201885773014401907856008002051852000902131655001202140IND60757335620221120052252.0211124s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075733562DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2020-04842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJames, Clayton T.10aWhirling disease in the Crowsnest River: an emerging threat to wild salmonids in Alberta  ap. 1855-1868.  aWe provide the first documented case of whirling disease (WD) impacts to wild, self-sustaining rainbow trout (RNTR, Oncorynchus mykiss) populations in Canada. Myxobolus cerebralis (Mc), the causative agent of WD, was first confirmed in Alberta in 2016. However, evidence of disease in local fish populations was unknown. Using a weight-of-evidence approach, we examined multiple parasite life cycle stages in the Crowsnest River, Alberta. Percentage of infected Tubifex tubifex worms actively shedding triactinomyxons (TAMs) exceeded known thresholds of Mc establishment and TAM densities instream exceeded thresholds known to cause ≥90% declines in RNTR populations. Mc was detected at 5 of 6 study sites in water, fish, and worms. Disease severity was highest in the lower watershed where 100% of sentinel fish tested positive for Mc 7 to 14 days post-exposure; up to 85% of wild fingerling RNTR showed clinical signs of disease and yearling trout were largely absent from the river suggesting reduced survival. Our findings indicate conditions necessary for outbreak of WD exist in Alberta, highlighting the need to consider this disease as an emerging threat to wild salmonid populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyxobolus cerebralis 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aTubifex tubifex 3adisease severity 3aetiological agents 3afingerlings 3aparasites 3arivers 3atrout 3awatersheds 3aweight-of-evidence 3ayearlings 3aAlberta1 aVeillard, Marie F.1 aMartens, Amanda M.1 aPila, Emmanuel A.1 aTurnbull, Alyssa1 aHanington, Patrick1 aLuek, Andreas1 aAlexander, Julie1 aNehring, R.

In addition to being used to prevent microbial spoilage in foods, it can also form due to different factors in foods. Hippuric acid found in the natural content of milk can be converted into benzoic acid naturally and can be found in different levels in dairy products. The present study aimed to determine the naturally-forming benzoic acid values in fresh and ripened traditional type cheese varieties and to determine the effect of some physicochemical and microbiological changes of cheeses on the amount of benzoic acid. In this research, benzoic acid levels of six different cheese types (White pickled cheese (traditional-industrial), Tulum cheese (canned or goat skin-packed), and Kashar cheese (fresh and ripened)) were determined. As a result of the analysis performed by HPLC, the amount of benzoic acid in cheese samples varied between 5.95 and 55.72 mg/kg, and it was determined that the microbiota of cheese significantly affected the formation of benzoic acid (p < 0.05). Especially, a lower benzoic acid level was observed in fresh Kashar and industrial White pickled cheeses with short shelf life, whereas a higher shelf-life was observed in cheese types such as ripened traditional White pickled and skin-packed Tulum cheese (p < 0.05). Although there is a difference according to the cheese types, especially between hippuric acid content and changes in pH, and Lactococcus and Enterococcus, a correlation was found between benzoic acid content and yeast-molds changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus 3aLactococcus 3abenzoic acid 3acarboxylic acids 3acorrelation 3agoat cheese 3agoats 3ahippuric acid 3amicroorganisms 3amilk 3apH 3aresearch 3ashelf life 3aspoilage 3asynthesis 0aBenzoic acid 0aHippuric acid 0aTraditional cheeses 0aAntimicrobial compounds1 aGucer, Leyla1 aAkan, Ecem1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6479-73361 aMeric, Saban1 aAydin, Emel1 aKinik, Ozer0 tFood bioscience.g2021 June, v. 41 p.101040-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1010403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01889naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245008400158520092900242592002801171650000901199650002001208650002301228650001101251651001001262700001901272700001801291700001701309700001901326700001301345773011901358856007701477852000901554655001201563IND60757795520221120171642.0211125e20211029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075779552DNAL7 a10.3390/land101111542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYing, Shen 10aObject Analysis and 3D Spatial Modelling for Uniform Natural Resources in China  aNatural resource management has entered a new stage in 2018 in the People’s Republic of China (China) marked by the establishment of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China (MNRPRC).

Vast wax ester reserves of Limnocalanus were accumulated in a period of only two months, and comprised mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and saturated fatty alcohols. In winter, the mobilization of wax esters was selective, and the proportion of long-chain polyunsaturated wax esters declined first. PUFA accounted for >50 % of all fatty acids throughout the year reaching up to ca. 65 % during late summer and fall. Long-chain PUFA 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 together comprised 17–40 % of all fatty acids. The rarely reported C24 and C26 very-long-chain PUFA (VLC-PUFA) comprised 6.2 ± 3.4 % of all fatty acids in August and 2.1 ± 1.7 % in September. The VLC-PUFA are presumably synthesized by Limnocalanus from shorter chain-length precursors because they were not found in the potential food sources. We hypothesize that these VLC-PUFA help Limnocalanus to maximize lipid reserves when food is abundant. Sterol content of Limnocalanus, consisting ca. 90 % of cholesterol, did not show great seasonal variation. As a lipid-rich copepod with high abundance of PUFA, Limnocalanus is excellent quality food for fish. The VLC-PUFA were also detected in planktivorous fish, suggesting that these compounds can be used as a trophic marker indicating feeding on Limnocalanus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopepoda 3acholesterol 3afatty acid composition 3afatty alcohols 3afish 3afish feeds 3afood quality 3alakes 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3awax esters 3awinter1 aStrandberg, Ursula1 aKeinänen, Markku,1 aTaipale, Sami1 aKankaala, Paula0 tLipids.g2014 Sept., v. 49, no. 9 p.919-932dSpringer-Verlagx0024-42017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11745-014-3933-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04383naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245015900171300001600330500001500346520246100361592002802822650002102850650001402871650001402885650001502899650001102914650001002925650003102935650002402966650002802990650001803018650001003036650002003046650000903066650001403075650001403089650001103103650001803114650002203132650001103154650001503165650002703180650002503207650001303232650001903245650000903264650001203273650001603285650001903301650002803320650002503348651001003373653004303383700002203426700001603448700002003464700002203484700002803506773011803534856004803652852000903700655001203709IND50065444720221120154021.0130426e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006544472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-012-9403-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaileslassie, Amare10aExtractable soil nutrient effects on feed quality traits of crop residues in the semiarid rainfed mixed crop–livestock farming systems of Southern India  ap. 723-741.  a2019-12-04  aIn the mixed crop–livestock systems, while general relation among feed quality, productivity and soil nutrient management have been reported, information on the effects of extractable soil nutrients on crop residue (CR) feed quality traits is scarce (e.g. in semiarid regions of Karnataka, India). In view of the increasingly important role of CR as feed components, in these farming systems, generating such information is a relevant research issue for sustainable development. Here, we report the occurrence and strength of relationships among extractable nutrients in soils and CR feed quality traits, and the effects of improved nutrients input on feed availability and feed quality of CR. Soil samples were collected from farmers’ fields in the semiarid zone of Karnataka and analyzed for available phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sulphur (S), zinc (Zn) and boron (B) using standard laboratory methods. Soil test results were clustered as low, medium or high based on the level of nutrient concentration. Four major farming systems involving nine crops and 419 farms were selected for on-farm trials. Under every sample farm, a plot with farmer’s practice (control) and improved fertilizer inputs (combined application of nutrients found deficient by soil testing) were laid. Performance of crops was recorded. Samples were collected for CR feed quality trait analysis using Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy. The result showed that for cereal and oil crops, extractable soil S was significantly negatively associated with anti-feed quality traits such as neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF), acid detergent lignin (ADL) (P < 0.01), but significantly positively related to metabolizable energy (ME) and in vitro digestibility (P < 0.01). Extractable B and K levels were associated positively and significantly with NDF, ADF and ADL for oil crops and cereals. Crop level associations, for most crops, showed similar trend. Improved fertilizer inputs affected CR yield much more than it did the quality. It increased ME productivity (ME ha⁻¹) and thereof the potential milk yield ha⁻¹ by as high as 40 % over the control. Therefore, balanced nutrient inputs on crop land positively impact productivity of the livestock compartment of mixed crop–livestock farming system, and this knowledge can build on the currently perceived need and benefits of balanced nutrient replenishment in crop–livestock system.  aPublisher supplied data 3anutrient content 3aoil crops 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3asulfur 3afarms 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3anutrient management 3asustainable development 3acrop residues 3aboron 3afarming systems 3asoil 3alivestock 3apotassium 3agrains 3asoil sampling 3asoil productivity 3alignin 3amilk yield 3ain vitro digestibility 3aacid detergent fiber 3acropland 3asoil nutrients 3azinc 3afarmers 3afertilizers 3asemiarid zones 3aneutral detergent fiber 3ametabolizable energy 3aIndia 0anear-infrared reflectance spectroscopy1 aBlümmel, Michael1 aWani, S.

To investigate the use of phospholipid fatty acids as phenotypic characteristics in taxonomic studies and biomarkers for ecological studies, 18 chytrid fungi isolated from soil to freshwater samples were grown in defined media and their phospholipid fatty acid profile determined. Gas chromatographic/mass spectral analysis indicated the presence of fatty acids typically associated with fungi, such as 16:1(n-7), 16:0, 18:2(n-6), 18:3(n-3) 18:1(n-9), and 18:0, as well as, a number of odd-chain length fatty acids, including two polyunsaturated C-17 fatty acids. Conversion to their 3-pyridylcarbinol ester facilitated GC–MS determination of double-bond positions and these fatty acid were identified as 6,9-17:2 [17:2(n-8)] and 6,9,12-17:3 [17:3(n-5)]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of polyunsaturated C-17 fatty acids isolated from the phospholipids of chytrid fungi. Cluster analysis of PLFA profiles showed sufficient correlation with chytrid phylogeny to warrant inclusion of lipid analysis in species descriptions and the presence of several phospholipid fatty acids of restricted phylogenetic distributions suggests their usefulness as biomarkers for ecological studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acluster analysis 3afatty acid composition 3afreshwater 3afungi 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aphylogeny 3asoil 3aspectral analysis 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3atumor necrosis factors1 aLefevre, Emilie1 aPowell, Martha J.1 aFindlay, Robert H.0 tLipids.g2014 Sept., v. 49, no. 9 p.933-942dSpringer-Verlagx0024-42017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11745-014-3934-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006900144245021700213300001800430500002000448520106400468592002801532650001501560650002101575650003401596650001501630650001201645650001601657650002101673650002901694650002601723650001501749700002801764700003001792700001701822773013301839856007801972852000902050655001202059IND60637368020221117213055.0190417e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063736802DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2018011952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Fernanda das Neves1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8826-682010aPreparative mass‐spectrometry profiling of minor concentrated metabolites in Salicornia gaudichaudiana Moq by high‐speed countercurrent chromatography and off‐line electrospray mass‐spectrometry injection  ap. 1528-1541.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSalicornia species have just been introduced to the European market as a vegetable named ‘samphire’, ‘green asparagus’, or ‘sea asparagus’. Due to its increasing attention, and associated value, minor compounds of Salicornia gaudichaudiana Moq were investigated. The use of countercurrent chromatography and mass spectrometry enabled the search for known, as well as potentially novel natural products. Their identification was achieved based on molecular weights and mass‐spectrometric fragmentation data. Low detection limits enabled the visualization of all compounds with their identification in almost real time close to the preparative countercurrent chromatography experiment. A list of known natural products from Salicornia genus guided the identification process of compounds occurring in Salicornia gaudichaudiana Moq by tandem mass spectrometry fragment comparison. The natural product classes were divided into four groups: chlorogenic acid derivatives; flavonoid derivatives; pentacyclic triterpenoid saponins; and other compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalicornia 3achlorogenic acid 3acountercurrent chromatography 3aflavonoids 3amarkets 3ametabolites 3amolecular weight 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atriterpenoid saponins 3avegetables1 aBorges, Ricardo Moreira1 aLeitão, Gilda Guimarães1 aJerz, Gerold0 tJournal of separation science.g2019 Apr., v. 42, no. 8 p.1528-1541dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2018011953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245008700173300002200260520103900282592002801321650003101349650002301380650005201403650001501455650001701470650002001487650002001507653001001527653001501537653001301552653001701565653003101582653001401613653003901627653000901666653000801675653000901683653001401692653001301706700003001719700002101749700002001770700002101790700001801811700002201829700001801851700002101869700002201890700002201912700001501934700002201949700003001971700002802001773010202029856008302131852000902214655001202223IND60713251520221118222427.0211123e20201125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071325152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2020.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeckiff, Benjamin J.10aImbalance of Regulatory and Cytotoxic SARS-CoV-2-Reactive CD4+ T Cells in COVID-19  ap. 1340-1353.e16.  aThe contribution of CD4⁺ T cells to protective or pathogenic immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown. Here, we present single-cell transcriptomic analysis of >100,000 viral antigen-reactive CD4⁺ T cells from 40 COVID-19 patients. In hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients, we found increased proportions of cytotoxic follicular helper cells and cytotoxic T helper (TH) cells (CD4-CTLs) responding to SARS-CoV-2 and reduced proportion of SARS-CoV-2-reactive regulatory T cells (TREG). Importantly, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, a strong cytotoxic TFH response was observed early in the illness, which correlated negatively with antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Polyfunctional TH1 and TH17 cell subsets were underrepresented in the repertoire of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4⁺ T cells compared to influenza-reactive CD4⁺ T cells. Together, our analyses provide insights into the gene expression patterns of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4⁺ T cells in distinct disease severities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aantibodies 3acytotoxicity 3agene expression 3atranscriptomics 0ahuman 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aCOVID-19 0aCD4+ T cells 0asingle-cell RNA sequencing 0ascRNA-seq 0aantigen-reactive T cell enrichment 0aARTE 0aTFH 0aTREG 0acytotoxic 0aCD4-CTLs1 aRamírez-Suástegui, Ciro1 aFajardo, Vicente1 aChee, Serena J.1 aKusnadi, Anthony1 aSimon, Hayley1 aEschweiler, Simon1 aGrifoni, Alba1 aPelosi, Emanuela1 aWeiskopf, Daniela1 aSette, Alessandro1 aAy, Ferhat1 aSeumois, Grégory1 aOttensmeier, Christian H.1 aVijayanand, Pandurangan0 tCell.g2020 Nov. 25, v. 183, no. 5 p.1340-1353.e16dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003100110040001800141100002800159245006300187300001600250500002000266520124400286592002801530596003201558650001201590650001201602650001901614650002601633650000901659650001801668650002401686650002301710650001501733650001201748650001501760650001401775650002101789650001401810650002601824650001201850650002201862650003501884650004601919650003201965650001201997650002402009650005402033773012502087852000902212856007802221655001202299IND2181320520221118023239.0220703e199612  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218132052DNAL7 a89720702pmid7 a10.1136/vr.139.23.5672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarcourt‐Brown, F.

This study is a preliminary investigation into the dietary habits of pet rabbits. Owners were questioned about the feeding preferences of their pets. Manufacturers of rabbit foods were asked about the calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D content of their foods and how they had decided upon the formulation of their rations. Samples of rabbit food were analysed for calcium and phosphorus. Rabbits were found to be selective feeders. Rabbit food from pet shops consists of a mixed ration, of which the most commonly rejected ingredients were pellets and whole grain. The food manufacturers reported that calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D supplements are incorporated into the pellets. Food analyses demonstrated that rejection of the pellets and whole grain from the food can reduce a rabbit's calcium intake to below the minimum dietary requirement. The rabbit's unusual calcium metabolism is discussed. Calcium deficiency may cause osteomalacia but dietary excess may cause urolithiasis. Vitamin D deficiency may also exacerbate calcium deficiency. Recommendations are made for preventing calcium deficiency and dental disease in rabbits.  aPublisher supplied data  cClinical Studies Trust Fund 3arabbits 3acalcium 3atooth diseases 3anutrient deficiencies 3adiet 3acalcification 3afeeding preferences 3amineral metabolism 3aguidelines 3asurveys 3aphosphorus 3avitamin D 3anutrient content 3apet foods 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domestic 2aCalciumxanalysisxdeficiency. 2aCalcium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRabbits 2aTooth Calcification 2aTooth Diseasesxprevention & controlxveterinary.0 tVeterinary record.g1996 Dec., v. 139, no. 23 p.567-571dBMJ Publishing Group LimitedwJournal:jnl45502x0042-49007nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1136/vr.139.23.5673Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03951naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001900188245012300207300001200330506007600342520234000418592002802758506003702786650001802823650002502841650002602866650001602892650001902908650002602927650001402953650002702967650002802994650001503022650002803037650001503065700002703080700002103107700002103128700001903149700002203168700001803190700002203208700001903230773010503249856008203354852000903436655001203445IND60555774020221207144743.0191003e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055577402DNAL7 a252608692pmid7 aPMC41808572pmcid7 a10.1186/s12870-014-0252-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerson, Tobias10aTrans-Golgi network localized small GTPase RabA1d is involved in cell plate formation and oscillatory root hair growth  ap. 252.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Small Rab GTPases are important regulators of vesicular trafficking in plants. AtRabA1d, a member of the RabA1 subfamily of small GTPases, was previously found in the vesicle-rich apical dome of growing root hairs suggesting a role during tip growth; however, its specific intracellular localization and role in plants has not been well described. RESULTS: The transient expression of 35S::GFP:RabA1d construct in Allium porrum and Nicotiana benthamiana revealed vesicular structures, which were further corroborated in stable transformed Arabidopsis thaliana plants. GFP-RabA1d colocalized with the trans-Golgi network marker mCherry-VTI12 and with early FM4-64-labeled endosomal compartments. Late endosomes and endoplasmic reticulum labeled with FYVE-DsRed and ER-DsRed, respectively, were devoid of GFP-RabA1d. The accumulation of GFP-RabA1d in the core of brefeldin A (BFA)-induced-compartments and the quantitative upregulation of RabA1d protein levels after BFA treatment confirmed the association of RabA1d with early endosomes/TGN and its role in vesicle trafficking. Light-sheet microscopy revealed involvement of RabA1d in root development. In root cells, GFP-RabA1d followed cell plate expansion consistently with cytokinesis-related vesicular trafficking and membrane recycling. GFP-RabA1d accumulated in disc-like structures of nascent cell plates, which progressively evolved to marginal ring-like structures of the growing cell plates. During root hair growth and development, GFP-RabA1d was enriched at root hair bulges and at the apical dome of vigorously elongating root hairs. Importantly, GFP-RabA1d signal intensity exhibited an oscillatory behavior in-phase with tip growth. Progressively, this tip localization dissapeared in mature root hairs suggesting a link between tip localization of RabA1d and root hair elongation. Our results support a RabA1d role in events that require vigorous membrane trafficking. CONCLUSIONS: RabA1d is located in early endosomes/TGN and is involved in vesicle trafficking. RabA1d participates in both cell plate formation and root hair oscillatory tip growth. The specific GFP-RabA1d subcellular localization confirms a correlation between its specific spatio-temporal accumulation and local vesicle trafficking requirements during cell plate and root hair formation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAllium porrum 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3abrefeldin A 3acell membranes 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aendosomes 3agrowth and development 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3amicroscopy 3aphysiological transport 3aroot hairs1 avon Wangenheim, Daniel1 aTakáč, Tomáš1 aŠamajová, Olga1 aRosero, Amparo1 aOvečka, Miroslav1 aKomis, George1 aStelzer, Ernst HK1 aŠamaj, Jozef,0 tBMC plant biology.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.252-252dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-014-0252-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005400142245013900196500002000335520180800355592002802163596008002191596008402271650001102355650001302366650001502379650001102394650002002405650002602425650001302451650001702464650001402481650001502495651001502510700005502525700005302580700005702633773013702690856007702827852000902904655001202913IND60790241920221120093713.0220824e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079024192DNAL7 a10.1029/2020JB0199612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPreine, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4481-281510aWhen There Is No Offset: A Demonstration of Seismic Diffraction Imaging and Depth‐Velocity Model Building in the Southern Aegean Sea  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA vast majority of marine geological research is based on academic seismic data collected with single‐channel systems or short‐offset multichannel seismic cables, which often lack reflection moveout for conventional velocity analysis. Consequently, our understanding of Earth processes often relies on seismic time sections, which hampers quantitative analysis in terms of depth, formation thicknesses, or dip angles of faults. In order to overcome these limitations, we present a robust diffraction extraction scheme that models and adaptively subtracts the reflected wavefield from the data. We use diffractions to estimate insightful wavefront attributes and perform wavefront tomography to obtain laterally resolved seismic velocity information in depth. Using diffraction focusing as a quality control tool, we perform an interpretation‐driven refinement to derive a geologically plausible depth‐velocity model. In a final step, we perform depth migration to arrive at a spatial reconstruction of the shallow crust. Further, we focus the diffracted wavefield to demonstrate how these diffraction images can be used as physics‐guided attribute maps to support the identification of faults and unconformities. We demonstrate the potential of this processing scheme by its application to a seismic line from the Santorini Amorgos Tectonic Zone, located on the Hellenic Volcanic Arc, which is notorious for its catastrophic volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis. The resulting depth image allows a refined fault pattern delineation and, for the first time, a quantitative analysis of the basin stratigraphy. We conclude that diffraction‐based data analysis has a high potential, especially when the acquisition geometry of seismic data does not allow conventional velocity analysis.  aPublisher supplied data  a03SX427BcFederal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy of Germany (BMWi)  aHU698/25‐1cGerman Science Foundation (Deutsche Forschungs Gesellschaft, DFG) 3abasins 3ageometry 3ageophysics 3amodels 3aquality control 3aquantitative analysis 3aresearch 3astratigraphy 3atectonics 3atomography 3aAegean Sea1 aSchwarz, B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9913-73111 aBauer, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5484-32201 aHübscher, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7380-23440 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Sept., v. 125, no. 9 p.e2020JB019961-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JB0199613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245009000197500002000287520175400307592002802061650001102089650001302100650001502113650002002128650000902148650001302157700002002170700001202190700001802202773013702220856007702357852000902434655001202443IND60790242020221120074229.0220824e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079024202DNAL7 a10.1029/2020JB0196852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xinming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4910-825310aDeep Learning for Characterizing Paleokarst Collapse Features in 3‐D Seismic Images  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPaleokarst systems are found extensively in carbonate‐prone basins worldwide. They can form large reservoirs and provide efficient pathways for hydrocarbon migration, but they can also create serious engineering geohazards. The full delineation of potentially buried paleokarst systems plays an important role for reservoir characterization, oil and gas production, and other engineering tasks. We propose a supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically and accurately characterize paleokarst and associated collapse features from 3‐D seismic images. To avoid time‐consuming manual labeling for training the CNN, we propose an efficient workflow to automatically generate numerous 3‐D training image pairs including synthetic seismic images and the corresponding label images of the collapsed paleokarst features simulated in the seismic images. With this workflow, we are able to simulate realistic and diverse geologic structures and collapsed paleokarst features in the training images from which the CNN can effectively learn to recognize the collapsed paleokarst features in real field seismic images. Two field examples from the Fort Worth Basin demonstrate that our CNN‐based method is superior to conventional automatic methods in delineating paleokarst collapse features from seismic images. From the CNN‐based paleokarst characterization, we can further automatically extract 3‐D collapsed paleokarst systems and quantitatively measure their geometric parameters. Our CNN‐based method is highly efficient and takes only seconds to classify collapsed paleokarst features a 3‐D seismic image with 320 × 1, 024 × 1, 024 samples (approximately 268 km²) by using one graphics processing unit.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3ageometry 3ageophysics 3aneural networks 3aoils 3aresearch1 aYan, Shangsheng1 aQi, Jie1 aZeng, Hongliu0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Sept., v. 125, no. 9 p.e2020JB019685-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JB0196853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245012700195300001600322500002000338520144400358592002801802596006301830596001101893596004201904650001901946650001601965650001201981650001001993650001702003650001502020650000902035650001802044700001402062700001502076700001202091700001702103700001602120700001802136773013202154856007302286852000902359655001202368IND60745665120221122064802.0210723e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074566512DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.149982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheema, A.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3481-525410aImpact of expression mode and timing of sample collection, relative to milk ejection, on human milk bacterial DNA profiles  ap. 988-995.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: To investigate the impact of expression mode: electric breast pump or hand expression, and timing of sample collection: pre‐ and post‐milk ejection on human milk (HM) bacterial DNA profiles. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three HM samples from the same breast were collected from 30 breastfeeding mothers: a pre‐milk ejection pump‐expressed sample (pre‐pump), a post‐milk ejection pump‐expressed sample (post‐pump) and a post‐milk ejection hand‐expressed sample (post‐hand). Full‐length 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to assess milk bacterial DNA profiles. Bacterial profiles did not differ significantly based on mode of expression nor timing of sample collection. No significant differences were detected in the relative abundance of any OTUs based on expression condition (pre‐pump/ post‐pump and post‐pump/post‐hand) with univariate linear mixed‐effects regression analyses (all P‐values > 0·01; α = 0·01). Similarly, no difference in richness was observed between sample types (number of observed OTUs: post‐pump/post‐hand P = 0·13; pre‐pump/post‐pump P = 0. 45). CONCLUSION: Bacterial DNA profiles of HM did not differ according to either expression method or timing of sample collection. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Hand or pump expression can be utilized to collect samples for microbiome studies. This has implications for the design of future HM microbiome studies.  aPublisher supplied data  aAPP #1144040cNational Health and Medical Research Council  cMedela  cWomen and Infants Research Foundation 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3abreasts 3agenes 3amicrobiology 3amicrobiome 3amilk 3amilk ejection1 aLai, C.T.1 aDymock, M.1 aRae, A.1 aGeddes, D.T.1 aPayne, M.S.1 aStinson, L.F.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2021 Aug., v. 131, no. 2 p.988-995dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.149983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04187naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100003500188245013100223300001200354506007600366520175500442592002802197506003702225650001502262650001302277650002302290650001502313650002202328650002402350650002702374650002002401650003102421650001002452650004202462650001202504650001802516650001102534650001902545650001502564650002602579650001302605650002502618650001402643650001602657650002802673650004302701650005202744650002002796650001602816650001002832700003002842700001902872700002802891700002502919700002802944700001502972700003902987700002303026700003503049700001903084700002703103700002903130700003203159700004203191773010503233856008203338852000903420655001203429IND60555774120221207144759.0191003e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055577412DNAL7 a252609632pmid7 aPMC41897572pmcid7 a10.1186/s12870-014-0256-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamargo, Eduardo Leal Oliveira10aContrasting nitrogen fertilization treatments impact xylem gene expression and secondary cell wall lignification in Eucalyptus  ap. 256.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Nitrogen (N) is a main nutrient required for tree growth and biomass accumulation. In this study, we analyzed the effects of contrasting nitrogen fertilization treatments on the phenotypes of fast growing Eucalyptus hybrids (E. urophylla x E. grandis) with a special focus on xylem secondary cell walls and global gene expression patterns. RESULTS: Histological observations of the xylem secondary cell walls further confirmed by chemical analyses showed that lignin was reduced by luxuriant fertilization, whereas a consistent lignin deposition was observed in trees grown in N-limiting conditions. Also, the syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio was significantly lower in luxuriant nitrogen samples. Deep sequencing RNAseq analyses allowed us to identify a high number of differentially expressed genes (1,469) between contrasting N treatments. This number is dramatically higher than those obtained in similar studies performed in poplar but using microarrays. Remarkably, all the genes involved the general phenylpropanoid metabolism and lignin pathway were found to be down-regulated in response to high N availability. These findings further confirmed by RT-qPCR are in agreement with the reduced amount of lignin in xylem secondary cell walls of these plants. CONCLUSIONS: This work enabled us to identify, at the whole genome level, xylem genes differentially regulated by N availability, some of which are involved in the environmental control of xylogenesis. It further illustrates that N fertilization can be used to alter the quantity and quality of lignocellulosic biomass in Eucalyptus, offering exciting prospects for the pulp and paper industry and for the use of short coppices plantations to produce second generation biofuels.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEucalyptus 3abiofuels 3abiomass production 3acell walls 3achemical analysis 3afertilizer analysis 3afertilizer application 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahybrids 3alignification 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3ametabolism 3amicroarray technology 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aphenotype 3aplantations 3apulp and paper industry 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asecondary xylem 3atree growth 3atrees1 aNascimento, Leandro Costa1 aSoler, Marçal1 aSalazar, Marcela Mendes1 aLepikson-Neto, Jorge1 aMarques, Wesley Leoricy1 aAlves, Ana1 aTeixeira, Paulo José Pereira Lima1 aMieczkowski, Piotr1 aCarazzolle, Marcelo Falsarella1 aMartinez, Yves1 aDeckmann, Ana Carolina1 aRodrigues, José Carlos,1 aGrima-Pettenati, Jacqueline1 aPereira, Gonçalo Amarante Guimarães0 tBMC plant biology.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.256-256dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-014-0256-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03891naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016900166300001600335520237100351592002802722650001802750650002102768650002602789650001702815650002702832650000902859650001702868650001402885650001302899650001202912650001202924650001102936650001002947650002302957650000902980650001002989650001002999650002203009650001903031650001203050650001103062650002003073650001203093651001103105700002303116700002003139773008703159856008103246961001303327852000903340655001203349IND50070531320221119052021.0150210e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007053132DNAL7 a10.1007/s00049-013-0139-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aByers, John A.10aAggregation pheromones of bark beetles, Pityogenes quadridens and P. bidentatus, colonizing Scotch pine: olfactory avoidance of interspecific mating and competition  ap. 251-261.  aThe bark beetles Pityogenes bidentatus and Pityogenes quadridens (Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Scolytinae) are sibling species that feed and reproduce in bark areas on branches of Scotch pine, Pinus sylvestris. To identify aggregation pheromone components of both species, hindguts and head/thoraxes of males and females of both species feeding in hosts were extracted in pentane and analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Hindguts of male P. bidentatus contained grandisol as the major component along with small amounts of (4S)-cis-verbenol and other monoterpenes. Dose–response bioassays in the laboratory showed the components were attractive at 0.2 ng/min to walking beetles from a distance of ≥25 cm. In the field in southern Sweden, grandisol and (4S)-cis-verbenol were weakly attractive alone when released at rates of 0.05 and 0.5 mg/day, respectively, from a slow-rotating trap pair. Catch increased 3.6- to 13-fold when the two components were released together. The male proportion of the catch was 0.8 early in the flight period, declined to 0.5 on the peak flight day, and then declined further during the next 2 weeks to 0.2 on the last day of the flight period. Hindguts of male P. quadridens contained (2S,5R)- and (2S,5S)-chalcogran, as well as (E)-2-(3,3-dimethylcyclohexylidene)ethanol (E-grandlure 2) and E/Z-mixture of 2-(3,3-dimethylcyclohexylidene)acetaldehyde (grandlures 3 and 4), while female hindguts had only a trace amount of chalcogran. Laboratory studies proved E-grandlure 2 is an essential pheromone component for P. quadridens. Field bioassays with a slow-rotating trap pair in which the attractiveness of blends containing various candidate components were compared with that of less complete mixtures, showed that chalcogran and E-grandlure 2 were synergistic aggregation pheromone components of P. quadridens. Field tests also showed that grandisol (from P. bidentatus) reduced attraction of P. quadridens to its aggregation pheromone, whereas E-grandlure 2 and chalcogran (from P. quadridens) reduced response of P. bidentatus to its aggregation pheromone. Our results suggest that aggregation pheromone components from males of each species not only attract conspecifics but also aid individuals in avoiding interspecific mating and competition for food and spatial resources within the bark phloem layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurculionidae 3aPinus sylvestris 3aPityogenes bidentatus 3aacetaldehyde 3aaggregation pheromones 3abark 3abark beetles 3abioassays 3abranches 3aethanol 3afemales 3aflight 3afoods 3agas chromatography 3ahead 3ahosts 3amales 3amass spectrometry 3amonoterpenoids 3apentane 3aphloem 3asibling species 3awalking 3aSweden1 aBirgersson, Göran1 aFrancke, Wittko0 tChemoecology.g2013 Dec., v. 23, no. 4 p.251-261dSpringer-Verlagx0937-74097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00049-013-0139-93Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03707naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015300168300001800321520155600339592002801895650003001923650002001953650001201973650001501985650004302000650001402043650001202057650002402069650001802093650002302111650002402134650002602158650002302184651001002207651001702217651001002234651001202244651000902256653002002265653002902285653002002314653001602334700006202350700001802412700002102430700006002451700003402511700002002545700006402565700002402629700002702653773034302680856008503023852000903108655001203117IND60741167020221120202013.0210820e20210826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074116702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2021.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIssaka, Ayuba10aAssociations between obesity indices and both type 2 diabetes and impaired fasting glucose among West African adults: Results from WHO STEPS surveys  ap. 2652-2660.  aVarious obesity indices such as BMI, waist circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio, (WHR) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) are associated with the risk of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Given few studies examining the strength of the association in this population, we aimed to identify which obesity indices are most strongly associated with T2DM and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) among adults from five West African countries.Data from 15,520 participants from the World Health Organisation (WHO) STEPs surveys in Burkina Faso, Benin, Mali, Liberia, and Ghana were included in analyses. Multinomial logistic regression was used to calculate the relative risk (RR) per standard deviation (SD) of each anthropometric measure, modelled as both continuous variables and as categorical variables based on established cut-points. In the analyses with continuous variables, the unadjusted RRs for T2DM per SD were 1.30 (1.23, 1.37) for body mass index (BMI); 1.56 (1.46, 1.67) for WC; 2.57 (2.15, 3.09) for WHtR and 1.16 (1.03, 1.31) for WHR. WHtR showed the strongest association with T2DM in all adjusted analyses. For models using categorical variables based on established cut-points, obesity defined using waist circumference (OB-WC) and OB-BMI showed the strongest associations with T2DM, and OB-WHR, the weakest association in all adjusted analyses.WHtR and WC appear to be the indices most strongly associated with T2DM and IFG respectively. Given its simplicity, WC may be the metric that most usefully conveys risk for T2DM in West African adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3abody mass index 3aglucose 3ametabolism 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutrition 3aobesity 3aregression analysis 3arelative risk 3astandard deviation 3awaist circumference 3awaist-to-height ratio 3awaist-to-hip ratio 3aBenin 3aBurkina Faso 3aGhana 3aLiberia 3aMali 0aType 2 diabetes 0aImpaired fasting glucose 0aObesity indices 0aWest Africa1 aCameron, Adrian J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0568-54971 aParadies, Yin1 aKiwallo, Jean B.1 aBosu, William K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0094-98331 aHouehanou, Yèssito Corine N.1 aWesseh, Chea S.1 aHouinato, Dismand S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6007-02841 aNazoum, Diarra J.P.1 aStevenson, Christopher0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2021 Aug. 26, v. 31, no. 9 p.2652-2660dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2021.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245007800166300001400244520123300258592002801491650001301519650001801532650001401550650003701564650001501601650001001616650001801626650002201644650001301666651001201679651001101691651001101702651001601713700001801729700001901747700002101766773009901787856008401886852000901970655001201979IND60085922120221119121754.0141101e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008592212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2010.07.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRøed, K.H.10aElucidating the ancestry of domestic reindeer from ancient DNA approaches  ap. 83-88.  aDespite the importance of the reindeer husbandry in the subsistence of many northern cultures the origin and spread of domestic reindeer is still highly debated. Recent analyses of mitochondrial DNA in reindeer herds across Eurasia revealed distinct geographic structures of domestic reindeer in Fennoscandia and Russia, pointing towards independent origins of domestic reindeer in these areas. A high degree of haplotype sharing between the extant wild reindeer population in the Hardangervidda mountain region in southern Norway and the domestic herds in Fennoscandia indicate that this population could have contributed in the early domestication or augmented the domestic population. However, genetic analyses of excavated reindeer remains from the early medieval period from the Hardangervidda region revealed no haplotype sharing with extant domestic reindeer, demonstrating that reindeer from Hardangervidda did not contribute in the early domestication process in Fennoscandia. The substantial temporal genetic alteration observed in this population is related to introgression of domestic reindeer into the wild gene pool in the 19th century during periods when reindeer husbandry was practiced in this mountain region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aancestry 3adomestication 3agene pool 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3ahaplotypes 3aherds 3aintrogression 3amitochondrial DNA 3areindeer 3aEurasia 3aNorway 3aRussia 3aScandinavia1 aFlagstad, Ø.1 aBjørnstad, G.1 aHufthammer, A.K.0 tQuaternary international.g2011 June 1, v. 238, no. 1-2 p.83-88dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2010.07.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01833naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245002500167300001600192520107000208592002801278650002301306650003201329650001401361650002301375650001301398773008701411856004801498852000901546655001201555IND50070531420221119052153.0131109e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007053142DNAL7 a10.1007/s00049-013-0140-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeldon, Paul J.10aChemical aposematism  ap. 201-202.  aDiscussions of aposematism traditionally have focused on the visual displays of prey that denote unpalatability or toxicity to predators. However, the construct of aposematism accommodates a spectrum of unprofitable traits signaled through various sensory modalities, including contact and distance chemoreception. Aposematism, involving learned aversions by signal receivers or selection for their unlearned avoidances, arises in predator–prey or other interspecific interactions where a mutually beneficial avoidance of signal emitters by signal receivers exists. Aposematism evolves by selection against signal receivers, e.g., predators, imposed by signal emitters, e.g., unprofitable prey, and vice versa, where both nondiscriminating signal receivers and unrecognized signal emitters are imperiled. Chemical aposematism entails concurrent reciprocal selection where signal emitters select for chemosensory avoidance responses in signal receivers, and where signal receivers select for the emission of identifiable (distinctive) chemicals in signal emitters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aavoidance behavior 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredators 3asensory properties 3atoxicity0 tChemoecology.g2013 Dec., v. 23, no. 4 p.201-202dSpringer-Verlagx0937-74097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00049-013-0140-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03837naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011800171300001600289520229200305592002802597650001702625650001502642650002602657650001102683650001202694650001602706650001102722650001802733650001302751650001902764650001102783650001902794650002002813650002202833650001102855650001802866650003002884650002302914650001402937651001002951700002202961700001702983700002003000700001603020700002103036700002203057700002203079773010103101856008403202852000903286655001203295IND60085922320221119115728.0141101e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008592232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2009.11.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, S. Masood10aHigh-resolution carbon and oxygen isotope records from a scleractinian (Porites) coral of Lakshadweep Archipelago  ap. 107-114.  aA 17-year-long δ¹³C and δ¹⁸O record from a scleractinian coral (Porites spp.) of Bangaram island (Lakshadweep Archipelago) is based on a nearly-monthly sample interval. This live coral head of Porites spp. was recovered from the lagoon of Bangaram (Lakshadweep) island at ∼20m water-depth. The skeletal δ¹³C and δ¹⁸O values varied approximately in phase and exhibit a positive relationship with each other. High-density (monsoon) bands are characterized by enriched δ¹⁸O values and low-density (non-monsoon) bands by depleted δ¹⁸O values. Coral δ¹³C and δ¹⁸O primarily reflects local oceanographic and climatic variability. The high-density bands were formed during the southwest monsoon (June–September) because of increased turbidity and cloud cover, whereas low-density bands were deposited during the non-monsoon months (October–May). Temporal changes in coral-derived sea surface temperature (SST) show a good agreement with instrumental SST record. The δ¹⁸O values in monsoon and non-monsoon bands are mainly due to the sea surface temperature (SST) changes, controlled by monsoon-induced upwelling and insolation changes. Coral-derived SST values clearly show warming events during summer 1993 and 1998. Spectral analysis of δ¹⁸O data reveals a teleconnection between the local SST and tropical Pacific climate variability. Enriched δ¹⁸O values for the monsoon months of 1984, 1985, 1993 and 1997 are probably indicative of cooler surface water due to the stronger upwelling at the studied location. Generally higher δ¹³C values correlate with enriched δ¹⁸O values of the monsoon bands. This increase in δ¹³C during the southwest monsoon months is attributed to a decrease in endosymbiotic photosynthesis. Alternatively, an increase in biological production, due to monsoon-induced upwelling, may have resulted in the δ¹³C enrichment of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in surface waters. However, other possibilities, such as higher δ¹³C values due to coral mass-spawning events during monsoon times cannot be ruled out. A progressive decrease of ∼0.5‰ in δ¹³C from 1985 to 2001 may be due to the changes in photosynthesis and/or changing food habits from autotrophy to heterotrophy as the coral grew in size.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScleractinia 3aautotrophs 3abiological production 3acarbon 3aclimate 3acloud cover 3acorals 3aeating habits 3aisotopes 3amonsoon season 3aoxygen 3aphotosynthesis 3asolar radiation 3aspectral analysis 3asummer 3asurface water 3asurface water temperature 3atemporal variation 3aturbidity 3aIndia1 aPadmakumari, V.M.1 aRaza, Waseem1 aVenkatesham, K.1 aSuseela, G.1 aSagar, Netramani1 aChamoli, Ashutosh1 aRajan, R.

In this perspective, the internal structure of the extensional seismically active Vado di Corno Fault Zone (VCFZ, Central Apennines, Italy) was quantified by combining high‐resolution structural mapping with 3‐D fault network analysis over ∼2 km along fault strike. The fault zone was exhumed from ∼2 km depth in carbonate rocks, accommodated 1.5–2 km of extensional throw since Early Pleistocene, and cuts through the Pliocene Omo Morto Thrust Zone (OMTZ) with partial reactivation in extension. The exceptional exposure of the footwall block allowed us to reconstruct in detail the geometry of the OMTZ and quantify the spatial arrangement of master/subsidiary faults and fault zone rocks within the extensional VCFZ. The combination of the structural map and the 3‐D fault network with kinematic and topological analyses pointed out the crucial role of the older thrust geometry (i.e., lateral ramps) in controlling the along‐strike segmentation and slip distribution of the VCFZ. These observations were discussed in the framework of regional extension through a slip tendency analysis and a simplified mechanical model, which suggest the activation of oblique inherited structures during the lateral propagation of the VCFZ segments. The interaction of the VCFZ with the OMTZ generated along strike and possibly downdip mechanical asperities. Considering the exhumed VCFZ as an analog for the shallow structure of other seismic sources in the Central Apennines, similar settings could play first‐order control on the spatio‐temporal evolution and rupture heterogeneity of earthquakes in the region.  aPublisher supplied data  a614705cEC | H2020 | H2020 Priority Excellent Science | H2020 European Research Council (ERC)  a614705cEuropean Research Council Consolidator Grant Project (NOFEAR) 3aPleistocene epoch 3aPliocene epoch 3acarbonates 3ageometry 3ageophysics 3amechanical models 3amechanics 3aresearch 3atopology 3aItaly1 aBalsamo, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1931-466X1 aBistacchi, A.1 aClemenzi, L.1 aDemurtas, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6925-47921 aStorti, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2809-94711 aDi Toro, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6618-34740 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Sept., v. 125, no. 9 p.e2019JB018926-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JB0189263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245011800164300002000282520120600302592002801508650002201536650001101558650001501569650002201584650001601606653001101622653002501633653002401658653002301682653002301705653001801728700002001746700001801766700001401784700005701798700005501855700001901910700005501929700005701984700005402041773014202095856007802237852000902315655001202324IND60749906420221119175723.0210908e20210825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074990642DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c103032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Han-Fang10aEvolution of Superconducting Properties in Fe₁.₁Se₀.₈Te₀.₂ Films Before and After Structure Avalanche  ap. 42138-42145.  aBy preparing a series of high-quality Fe₁.₁Se₀.₈Te₀.₂ films on the CaF₂ substrate via pulsed laser deposition, we reveal the evolution of the structure as well as the superconductivity with the film thickness. We have found that there exists a threshold thickness above which the critical temperature Tc reaches its optimal value of 23.18 K with large activation energy, promising for high-field technological applications. Most importantly, the thick films have been found in a metastable state due to the fragile balance between the increased strain energy and the large compressive stress. Once the balance is broken by an external perturbation, a unique structure avalanche happens with a large part of the film exfoliated from the substrate and curves out. The exfoliated part of the film remains a single phase, with its lattice parameter and Tc recovering the bulk values. Our results clearly demonstrate the close relation between the compressive stress of the film/substrate interface and the high critical temperature observed in FeSeTe films. Moreover, this also provides an efficient way to fabricate free-standing single-phase FeSeTe crystals in the phase-separation regime.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aenergy 3aseparation 3asuperconductivity 3atemperature 0aFeSeTe 0asuperconducting film 0astructure avalanche 0acritical thickness 0acompressive stress 0aphase diagram1 aChen, Xing-Hong1 aXiao, Qi-Ling1 aChen, Fei1 aFeng, Zhenjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5870-51591 aCao, Shixun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3915-26211 aZhang, Jincang1 aQi, Yanpeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2722-13751 aShi, Zhixiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3881-51521 aGe, Jun-Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5206-29300 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Aug. 25, v. 13, no. 35 p.42138-42145dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c103033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005900142245006600201500002000267520165200287592002801939596005301967650001402020650001502034650002502049650001302074650001502087700006102102700005802163700006602221773013702287856007702424852000902501655001202510IND60790242720221120074142.0220824e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079024272DNAL7 a10.1029/2020JB0195532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Shubham1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2308-234710aIs Coulomb Stress the Best Choice for Aftershock Forecasting?  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Coulomb failure stress (CFS) criterion is the most commonly used method for predicting spatial distributions of aftershocks following large earthquakes. However, large uncertainties are always associated with the calculation of Coulomb stress change. The uncertainties mainly arise due to nonunique slip inversions and unknown receiver faults; especially for the latter, results are highly dependent on the choice of the assumed receiver mechanism. Based on binary tests (aftershocks yes/no), recent studies suggest that alternative stress quantities, a distance‐slip probabilistic model as well as deep neural network (DNN) approaches, all are superior to CFS with predefined receiver mechanism. To challenge this conclusion, which might have large implications, we use 289 slip inversions from SRCMOD database to calculate more realistic CFS values for a layered half‐space and variable receiver mechanisms. We also analyze the effect of the magnitude cutoff, grid size variation, and aftershock duration to verify the use of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for the ranking of stress metrics. The observations suggest that introducing a layered half‐space does not improve the stress maps and ROC curves. However, results significantly improve for larger aftershocks and shorter time periods but without changing the ranking. We also go beyond binary testing and apply alternative statistics to test the ability to estimate aftershock numbers, which confirm that simple stress metrics perform better than the classic Coulomb failure stress calculations and are also better than the distance‐slip probabilistic model.  aPublisher supplied data  a251036843cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) 3adatabases 3ageophysics 3aprobabilistic models 3aresearch 3astatistics1 aHainzl, Sebastian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2875-09331 aZöeller, Gert1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2384-27241 aHolschneider, Matthias1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3987-105X0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Sept., v. 125, no. 9 p.e2020JB019553-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JB0195533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002100142245006100163300001600224500000900240520158300249592002801832650000901860650001201869650001901881650001201900650001501912650002601927650001501953650001501968650002001983651002402003700001902027773013602046852000902182856007902191655001202270IND4481133220221120112201.0191228e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448113322DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2003.68102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanda, Edward R.14aThe Life and Scientific Contributions of Lyman J. Briggs  ap. 681-693.  aepub  aLyman J. Briggs (1874–1963), an early twentieth century physicist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), made many significant contributions to our understanding of soil-water and plant-water interactions. He began his career at the Bureau of Soils (BOS) in 1896. At age 23, Briggs published (1897) a description of the roles of surface tension and gravity in determining the state of static soil moisture. Concepts he presented remain central to this subject more than 100 yr later. With J.W. McLane, Briggs developed the “moisture equivalent” concept (a precursor to the idea of field capacity) and a centrifuge apparatus for measuring it. Briggs left the BOS at the end of 1905, under pressure from Milton Whitney, and moved to the Bureau of Plant Industry. Briggs' multi-state experiments with H.L. Shantz on water-use efficiencies showed that in a climate like that of the Great Plains, plants use water more productively in the cooler north than in the warmer south. In 1920, he moved from the USDA to the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), rising to Director in 1933. Among his other contributions to the American scientific community was his leadership, beginning in 1939, of a top secret committee that evolved into the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb during World War II. A life-long baseball fan, Briggs at age 84, studied the speed, spin, and deflection of the curve ball, aided by manager Cookie Lavagetto and the pitching staff of the Washington Senators; he published these findings in a paper in the American Journal of Physics in 1959.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUSDA 3acookies 3afield capacity 3agravity 3aleadership 3aplant-water relations 3ascientists 3asoil water 3asurface tension 3aGreat Plains region1 aNimmo, John R.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2003 May, v. 67, no. 3 p.681-693dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2003.68103Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03895naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001700180245013900197300001600336500002000352506007600372520193100448592002802379506003702407650001602444650001702460650001602477650001602493650001002509650002202519650001402541650002402555650001002579650002402589650002302613650001502636650001402651650001702665650001602682650000902698650001202707650002102719650001102740650002902751650002602780650003102806650002202837650001702859700002202876700002002898700001702918700002002935700002402955700002102979700003403000773012903034856007303163852000903236655001203245IND60588072520221207140435.0180103e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058807252DNAL7 a10.1111/pbi.126442doi7 aPMC53626842pmcid7 a276830922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKudo, Madoka10aDouble overexpression of DREB and PIF transcription factors improves drought stress tolerance and cell elongation in transgenic plants  ap. 458-471.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough a variety of transgenic plants that are tolerant to drought stress have been generated, many of these plants show growth retardation. To improve drought tolerance and plant growth, we applied a gene‐stacking approach using two transcription factor genes: DEHYDRATION‐RESPONSIVE ELEMENT‐BINDING 1A (DREB1A) and rice PHYTOCHROME‐INTERACTING FACTOR‐LIKE 1 (OsPIL1). The overexpression of DREB1A has been reported to improve drought stress tolerance in various crops, although it also causes a severe dwarf phenotype. OsPIL1 is a rice homologue of Arabidopsis PHYTOCHROME‐INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4), and it enhances cell elongation by activating cell wall‐related gene expression. We found that the OsPIL1 protein was more stable than PIF4 under light conditions in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Transactivation analyses revealed that DREB1A and OsPIL1 did not negatively affect each other's transcriptional activities. The transgenic plants overexpressing both OsPIL1 and DREB1A showed the improved drought stress tolerance similar to that of DREB1A overexpressors. Furthermore, double overexpressors showed the enhanced hypocotyl elongation and floral induction compared with the DREB1A overexpressors. Metabolome analyses indicated that compatible solutes, such as sugars and amino acids, accumulated in the double overexpressors, which was similar to the observations of the DREB1A overexpressors. Transcriptome analyses showed an increased expression of abiotic stress‐inducible DREB1A downstream genes and cell elongation‐related OsPIL1 downstream genes in the double overexpressors, which suggests that these two transcription factors function independently in the transgenic plants despite the trade‐offs required to balance plant growth and stress tolerance. Our study provides a basis for plant genetic engineering designed to overcome growth retardation in drought‐tolerant transgenic plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aOryza sativa 3aamino acids 3acell growth 3acrops 3adrought tolerance 3aflowering 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3agrowth retardation 3ahypocotyls 3aphenotype 3aplant growth 3aprotoplasts 3arice 3asolutes 3astress tolerance 3asugars 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation 3atransgenic plants 3awater stress1 aKidokoro, Satoshi1 aYoshida, Takuya1 aMizoi, Junya1 aTodaka, Daisuke1 aFernie, Alisdair R.1 aShinozaki, Kazuo1 aYamaguchi‐Shinozaki, Kazuko0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2017 Apr., v. 15, no. 4 p.458-471dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774064x1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.126443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03316naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245007000174300001600244520140100260592002801661650002101689650002801710650001801738650001401756650002201770650002201792650002101814650002501835650002801860650001101888650002301899650001701922650001201939650001701951650001801968653002401986653002702010653002902037653002402066653000702090653000802097653000802105653000802113653000902121653000702130653001002137653000902147653000902156653001002165653000802175653000802183653000902191653000902200653000902209653000802218653000802226653000802234653001002242653001102252653000702263653000902270653001002279700002602289700002302315773013602338856008702474852000902561655001202570IND60782747020221119173235.0220830e20220930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078274702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.07.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJabbari, Farzaneh10aBacterial cellulose-based composites for nerve tissue engineering  ap. 120-130.  aNerve injuries and neurodegenerative disorders are very serious and costly medical challenges. Damaged nerve tissue may not be able to heal and regain its function, and scar tissue may restrict nerve cell regeneration. In recent years, new electroactive biomaterials have attracted widespread attention in the neural tissue engineering field. Bacterial cellulose (BC) due to its unique properties such as good mechanical properties, high water retention, biocompatibility, high crystallinity, large surface area, high purity, very fine network, and inability to absorb in the human body due to cellulase deficiency, can be considered a promising treatment for neurological injuries and disorders that require long-term support. However, BC lacks electrical activity, but can significantly improve the nerve regeneration rate by combining with conductive structures. Electrical stimulation has been shown to be an effective means of increasing the rate and accuracy of nerve regeneration. Many factors, such as the intensity and pattern of electrical current, have positive effects on cellular activity, including cell adhesion, proliferation, migration and differentiation, and cell-cell/tissue/molecule/drug interaction. This study discusses the importance and essential role of BC-based biomaterials in neural tissue regeneration and the effects of electrical stimulation on cellular behaviors.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3acell adhesion 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3adrug interactions 3aelectric current 3aelectrical treatment 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3ahumans 3anerve regeneration 3anerve tissue 3aneurons 3asurface area 3atissue repair 0aBacterial cellulose 0aElectrical stimulation 0aNerve tissue engineering 0aTissue regeneration 0aBC 0aPNS 0aPDA 0aRGD 0aLBLC 0aBP 0aBMSCs 0aEGCG 0aRSCs 0aRSMCs 0aGBM 0aPNI 0aNGCs 0aP3HT 0aPANI 0aPPy 0aPTh 0aCPs 0aPEDOT 0aSWCNTs 0aSC 0aNPCs 0aEGFRs1 aBabaeipour, Valiollah1 aBakhtiari, Samaneh0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Sept. 30, v. 217 p.120-130dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.07.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
