Phenolic compounds are extensively drained into the environment without proper treatment and cause several health hazards. Thus, to tackle this serious problem an electrochemical sensor based on SnO₂/GCE has been successfully engineered to monitor the low-level concentration of BPS in water samples. The fabrication of SnO₂ nanoparticles (SnO₂ NPs) was confirmed through FTIR, XRD, and TEM to examine the size, crystallinity, internal texture, and functionalities of the prepared material. The fabricated material was exploited as a chemically modified sensor for the determination of BPS in water samples collected from different sources. Under optimal conditions such as scan sweep 100 mV/s, PBS electrolyte pH of 6, potential window (0.3–1.3 V), the proposed sensor manifested an excellent response for BPS. The LOD of the present method for BPS was calculated as 0.007 μM, respectively. Moreover, the stability and selectivity profile of SnO₂/GCE for BPS in the real matrix was examined to be outstanding.  aPublisher supplied data 3abisphenol A 3acrystal structure 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aepoxides 3apH 3aplastics 3apollution 3asensors (equipment) 3atexture 3atin dioxide 0aBisphenol-S 0aTin oxide NPs 0aElectrochemical sensors 0aPhenolic compounds1 aAmeen, Sidra1 aKhand, Nadir H.1 aQambrani, Nadeem1 aBuledi, Jamil A.1 aJunejo, Bindia1 aSolangi, Amber R.1 aTaqvi, Syed Iqleem H.1 aDragoi, Elena-Niculina1 aZare, Najmeh1 aKarimi, Fatemeh1 aVasseghian, Yasser1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6225-627X0 tChemosphere.g2022 Sept., v. 303 p.135170-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1351703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02131naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245010800161300001800269520094500287592002801232650001601260650002201276650001201298650002601310650002301336650002101359650001401380650002201394650001401416650001501430700002501445700002201470700002101492700002301513773011901536856008101655852000901736655001201745IND60557966020221117164415.0161104e20161021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055796602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.6b020962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Sonu10aPalladium-Catalyzed Intramolecular Fujiwara-Hydroarylation: Synthesis of Benzo[a]phenazines Derivatives  ap. 9912-9923.  aAn atom-economical Pd-catalyzed approach for the synthesis of benzophenazine derivatives using substituted 2-aryl-3-(aryl/alkylethynyl) quinoxaline in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid at 65 °C has been described. The chemistry involves in situ generation of cationic Pd(II) species, which functionalized the aromatic C–H bonds via electrophilic metalation followed by concomitant intramolecular trans-insertion of C–C triple bond to aryl-Pd complex. The results were supported by various control experiments including with electron–deficient arenes and deuterium labeling studies. The deuterium labeling studies supports electrophilic palladation of aromatic C–H over activation of C–C triple bond of alkyne. The structure of synthesized compounds was further confirmed by X-ray crystallography studies. This catalytic protocol has been efficiently applied for novel synthesis of highly functionalized benzo fused phenazines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalkynes 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3adeuterium 3aorganic chemistry 3apalladium 3aphenazines1 aSaunthwal, Rakesh K.1 aMujahid, Mohammad1 aAggarwal, Trapti1 aVerma, Akhilesh K.0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2016 Oct. 21, v. 81, no. 20 p.9912-9923dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.6b020963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002100180245014600201300002000347506007600367520162100443592002802064506003702092650002502129650001202154650003002166650001702196650001902213650002402232700001402256700001502270700001302285773011302298856007502411852000902486655001202495IND60529874020221207084326.0160720e20141021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052987402DNAL7 a10.1021/ac50198432doi7 aPMC42049042pmcid7 a252543602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChingozha, Loice12aA Generalizable, Tunable Microfluidic Platform for Delivering Fast Temporally Varying Chemical Signals to Probe Single-Cell Response Dynamics  ap. 10138-10147.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUnderstanding how biological systems transduce dynamic, soluble chemical cues into physiological processes requires robust experimental tools for generating diverse temporal chemical patterns. The advent of microfluidics has seen the development of platforms for rapid fluid exchange allowing ease of changes in the cellular microenvironment and precise cell handling. Rapid exchange is important for exposing systems to temporally varying signals. However, direct coupling of macroscale fluid flow with microstructures is potentially problematic due to the high shear stresses that inevitably add confounding mechanical perturbation effects to the biological system of interest. Here, we have devised a method of translating fast and precise macroscale flows to microscale flows using a monolithically integrated perforated membrane. We integrated a high-density cell trap array for nonadherent cells that are challenging to handle under flow conditions with a soluble chemical signal generator module. The platform enables fast and repeatable switching of stimulus and buffer at low shear stresses for quantitative live, single-cell fluorescent studies. This modular design allows facile integration of any cell-handling chip design with any chemical delivery module. We demonstrate the utility of this device by characterizing heterogeneity of oscillatory response for cells exposed to alternating Ca²⁺ waveforms at various periodicities. This platform enables the analysis of cell responses to chemical perturbations at a single-cell resolution that is necessary in understanding signal transduction pathways.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioactive properties 3acalcium 3acellular microenvironment 3afluorescence 3amicrostructure 3asignal transduction1 aZhan, Mei1 aZhu, Cheng1 aLu, Hang0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 Oct. 21, v. 86, no. 20 p.10138-10147dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac50198433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013800170300001600308520098800324592002801312650002801340650001301368650001301381650002201394650001301416650001301429650001701442650002201459650001801481650001301499650001301512650001901525650001401544650001501558650001101573650001601584653001301600653001601613653001501629700002101644700001401665773010001679856008701779852000901866655001201875IND60610912620221123001755.0190402e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061091262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.10.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbhari, Negar10aStructure of starch aerogel as affected by crosslinking and feasibility assessment of the aerogel for an anti-fungal volatile release  ap. 147-152.  aStarch suspensions were crosslinked with trisodium citrate for either 0 or 17h, gelled and then freeze-dried to corresponding aerogels. The aerogel from the 17h-crosslinked suspension was loaded with the antifungal compound, trans-2-hexenal, and coated with the surfactant, sorbitan monooleate. Aerogel hardness was increased by the citrate-mediated crosslinking, whereas its adhesiveness decreased. Starch gelation decreased the crystallinity index (CrI) from 59% to ≈23%; however, the pre-gelation crosslinking resulted in a higher CrI value (i.e. ≈38%) for the aerogel. The voids at the internal microstructure of the 17h-crosslinked aerogel were more uniform and coating with surfactant closed the surface openings. The latter accordingly resulted in a more sustained release of the volatile, trans-2-hexenal, from the crosslinked starch aerogel and led to slower lethality of Aspergillus parasiticus cells inoculated on pistachio nuts compared with the non-coated condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus parasiticus 3aadhesion 3aaerogels 3aantifungal agents 3acitrates 3acoatings 3acrosslinking 3acrystal structure 3afreeze drying 3agelation 3ahardness 3amicrostructure 3amortality 3apistachios 3astarch 3asurfactants 0aVolatile 0aAntimicrobe 0aSurfactant1 aMadadlou, Ashkan1 aDini, Ali0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 221 p.147-152dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.10.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245017400178300001600352520162400368592002801992650000802020650001902028650001202047650001402059650002502073650001402098650001202112650002802124650002902152650002502181650002802206650001402234650002702248650004102275700001502316700001502331700001602346700001402362773009702376856008102473852000902554655001202563IND4398539220221119074655.0151024e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439853922DNAL7 a179290582pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-007-0760-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, X.

Thaparocleidus contained divergent genetic lineages and was not resolved as a monophyletic group. The first lineage was represented by two species found on Pangasium sutchi (Pangasidae), and the second one contained 12 species all from Silurus astus (Siluridae). Three clades were observed for species from S. astus, consistent with results of morphological analyses, indicating that 12 Thaparocleidus species could be divided into three groups by morphological examinations of the male copulatory organ (MCO). Pseudancylodiscoides spp. was more closely related to Thaparocleidus spp. from S. astus, and morphologically, it was found that shapes of MCOs of these species were the same type but different from that of Thaparocleidus spp. from P. sutchi. Therefore, based on results of molecular phylogenetic analyses and morphological examinations, we propose to abolish Pseudancylodiscoides and to erect a new genus to accommodate Thaparocleidus species from S. astus and Pseudancylodiscoides spp. It is also suggested to erect another new genus to accommodate two Thaparocleidus species from the P. sutchi, whose MCO shapes are different from other Thaparocleidus species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDactylogyridae 3aSilurus 3anew genus 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 2aAnimals 2aDNA, Helminthxanalysis 2aDNA, Ribosomalxanalysis 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTrematodaxclassificationxgenetics.1 aZhu, X.

A series of column experiments was conducted to evaluate the transport and retention of quantum dots (QDs) coated with a synthetic polymer, polyacrylic acid-octylamine (PAA-OA). Initial column studies, conducted with three size fractions of Ottawa sand, resulted in unusual solid-phase retention profiles, characterized by low QD deposition near the column inlet and increasing solid-phase concentrations along the column until a plateau or limiting capacity was reached near the column midpoint. Mathematical modeling studies indicated that the observed retention behavior could not be reproduced using one-dimensional simulators based on either clean-bed filtration theory or a modified filtration theory (MFT) model that incorporated a maximum retention capacity. Additional column studies demonstrated that changes in the inlet end plate configuration designed to ensure uniform flow did not alter the observed effluent breakthrough curves (BTCs) or shape of the retention profile. Subsequent QD transport experiments, pretreated by flushing with a pulse of PAA-OA solution, resulted in almost complete QD breakthrough with minimal retention. It is postulated that free polymer was preferentially adsorbed onto the solid surface near the column inlet, thereby preventing QD attachment, whereas in the down-gradient portion of the column, QDs attached to the solid phase without competition from the polymer. These findings reveal the importance of accounting for the influence of coconstituents on nanoparticle deposition and demonstrate the need to simulate both transport and retention data when assessing nanoparticle mobility in porous media.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3afiltration 3amathematical models 3ananoparticles 3apolymers 3aporous media 3aquantum dots 3asand1 aBecker, Matthew

Human activities could significantly contribute to the total PAH burden in river sediments. In this work, we document the analysis of PAHs in sediments taken in the middle stretch of the Biobio River in south central Chile. This river is a principal system, draining more than 24,000 km² and subjected to a diverse variety of human-made stressors (pulp mill and urban effluents, agricultural drainage systems, etc). During 2003, several sediment samples were taken in more than 45 sampling sites located in the river’s middle stretch. Due to the granulometric characteristics (mainly sandy sediments), only 17 samples were analyzed, taking into consideration the presence of a fine section within the sediment sample. Using HPLC with fluorescence detection, 15 EPA priority PAHs and perylene were analyzed. The composition of PAHs in the sediment samples is rather similar between sites and levels averaged 104 ± 78 ng g⁻¹ d.w. The highest levels were detected downstream from an industrial discharge. A good correlation was observed between PAH levels and organic carbon content in the tested sediments; however, concentrations above 134 ng g⁻¹ d.w. did not indicate correlation. The samples PAH ratios (Flu/Pyr and Chr/B(a)A) reveal a strong pyrolytic PAH pattern in the sediments tested, supporting evidence indicating that PAHs come mainly from pyrolytic sources. This result contrasts with previous records that have shown a natural influence in the upper basin and a petrogenic pattern near the mouth.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3aeffluents 3abasins 3arivers 3adrainage systems 3ahumans 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3afluorescence 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3acarbon 3atoxicity 3apulp 3aChile 0arecords1 aQuiroz, Roberto1 aSaez, Katia1 aAraneda, Alberto1 aUrrutia, Roberto1 aPopp, Peter0 tEnvironmental chemistry letters.g2009 June, v. 7, no. 2 p.133-139dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1610-36537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10311-008-0148-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245011300159300001600272500002000288520145500308592002801763650001201791650001901803650002001822650002901842650002501871650002301896650001801919650002501937650001201962650001301974650000901987650001701996650002502013650001602038651001202054700001902066700002202085700001802107700001902125700001502144773012902159856007202288852000902360655001202369IND60648198020221121175725.0190627e20150324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064819802DNAL7 a10.3390/f60408592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDalemans, Floris10aAssisting Sustainable Forest Management and Forest Policy Planning with the Sim4Tree Decision Support System  ap. 859-878.  aJournal Article  aAs European forest policy increasingly focuses on multiple ecosystem services and participatory decision making, forest managers and policy planners have a need for integrated, user-friendly, broad spectrum decision support systems (DSS) that address risks and uncertainties, such as climate change, in a robust way and that provide credible advice in a transparent manner, enabling effective stakeholder involvement. The Sim4Tree DSS has been accordingly developed as a user-oriented, modular and multipurpose toolbox. Sim4Tree supports strategic and tactical forestry planning by providing simulations of forest development, ecosystem services potential and economic performance through time, from a regional to a stand scale, under various management and climate regimes. Sim4Tree allows comparing the performance of different scenarios with regard to diverse criteria so as to optimize management choices. This paper explains the concept, characteristics, functionalities, components and use of the current Sim4Tree DSS v2.5, which was parameterized for the region of Flanders, Belgium, but can be flexibly adapted to allow a broader use. When considering the current challenges for forestry DSS, an effort has been made towards the participatory component and towards integration, while the lack of robustness remains Sim4Tree’s weakest point. However, its structural flexibility allows many possibilities for future improvement and extension.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3adecision support systems 3aeconomic performance 3aecosystem services 3aforest policy 3aforestry development 3aforests 3aplanning 3arisk 3astakeholders 3asustainable forestry 3auncertainty 3aBelgium1 aJacxsens, Paul1 aVan Orshoven, Jos1 aKint, Vincent1 aMoonen, Pieter1 aMuys, Bart0 tForests.g2015 Mar. 24, v. 6, no. 4 p.859-878dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f60408593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01271naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002600138245003000164300001800194520023000212592002800442650002300470650002300493650002400516650001800540650006600558650002400624700001800648700001400666700002100680700002200701773012900723856007200852852000900924655001200933IND60658064220221118080242.0190816e20070322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065806422DNAL7 a10.1039/b615276g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlemdaroglu, Fikri E.10aDNA multiblock copolymers  ap. 1358-1359.  aSingle stranded (ss) DNA block copolymers were applied to synthesize DNA multiblock architectures by hybridization; these polymeric bioorganic hybrids were characterized by gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3acomposite polymers 3agel electrophoresis 3ahybridization 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3asingle-stranded DNA1 aSafak, Meryem1 aWang, Jie1 aBerger, Rüdiger1 aHerrmann, Andreas0 tChemical communications.g2007 Mar. 22, , no. 13 p.1358-1359dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b615276g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013900173520108100312592002801393650001501421650001801436650001201454650002201466650002001488650001101508650001501519650001501534650003201549650001101581650001301592650003101605650001301636653002001649653002201669653001501691653003101706653003101737653001001768700001901778700002101797700001801818700002001836700006001856773010701916856008602023852000902109655001202118IND60684957220221118160939.0220118e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068495722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1160712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOjstršek, Alenka10aElectrospun nanofibrous composites from cellulose acetate / ultra-high silica zeolites and their potential for VOC adsorption from air  aThe optimized preparation of novel electrospun nanofibrous composites from cellulose acetate (CA) and ultra-high silica zeolites (UHSZ) are reported as a promising material for the adsorption of Volatile Organic Compound (VOCs). Two types of UHSZs, i.e. silicalite and USY were prepared by hydrothermal crystallization while the fabrication of composites was performed using single needle and needle-less electrospinning systems, demonstrating the scalability of the composite fibres’ manufactured. Herein, factors such as properties of spinning solutions and electrospinning process parameters were studied, as well as interactions between the CA and UHSZs. In addition, Quartz Crystal Microbalance - Dissipation technique (QCM-D) was employed with an aim to study the adsorption behaviour of newly developed composites using ammonia as a model pollutant. The QCM-D data revealed that the presence of UHSZs in the CA materials increased adsorption capacity, designating CA/UHSZ composites as potential materials suitable for a large-scale removal of VOCs from polluted air.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair pollution 3aammonia 3acellulose acetate 3acrystallization 3amodels 3ananofibers 3apollutants 3aquartz crystal microbalance 3asilica 3aspinning 3avolatile organic compounds 3azeolites 0aElectrospinning 0aCellulose acetate 0aNanofibres 0aUltra-high silica zeolites 0aVolatile organic compounds 0aQCM-D1 aFakin, Darinka1 aHribernik, Silvo1 aFakin, Tomaž1 aBračič, Matej1 aKurečič, Manja1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2029-51280 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2020 May 15, v. 236 p.116071-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1160713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01904naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245018600130300001600316500009800332520081800430592002801248650001501276650002401291650001601315650002501331650000901356650001501365650001301380700002101393773010901414852000901523939003301532946001301565655001201578991568405270742620221119185556.0181002e198612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aADL870507002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSAH, R.

The soils were amended with 0, 0.5, and 1.0% organic matter as cellulose and kept flooded for 85 d. The anaerobic decomposition of organic matter significantly increased the amorphous Fe content and produced significant transformations in inorganic P fractions. The Al-P decreased and Fe-P and RS-P fractions increased, due to the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. We concluded that the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter increased the transformation of crystalline iron into amorphous iron. This led to an increase in Fe-P and severe occlusion of P, resulting in the increase in RS-P fraction upon soil drainage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay soils 3asoil organic matter 3adegradation 3aanaerobic conditions 3airon 3aphosphates 3asorption1 aMIKKELSEN, D.

A pot experiment was conducted using different concentrations of exogenous selenite or selenate (0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg Se kg⁻¹ soil). Sequential extraction was used to determine the Se fractions in soil, and different models were used to study the behavior of Se in soil and its availability to wheat. Results showed that the distribution and availability of Se in soil and its accumulation in wheat affected both by Se concentrations and forms of exogenous Se. In selenite-treated soil, the proportion of exchangeable and carbonate-bound Se (EXC–Se) (21–42%) fraction increased compared to that in control (12%), while organic matter-bound Se (OM–Se) (23–33%) and Fe–Mn oxide-bound Se (FMO–Se) (11–15%) fractions decreased compare with those in control (37 and 32%, respectively). In selenate-treated soil, soluble-Se (SOL–Se) fraction (30–54%) increased and the OM–Se (9.8–20%) and FMO–Se (4.7–14.2%) fractions decreased compared with those in control. Residual Se (RES–Se) fraction was increased for selenite (7.4–13.4%) and selenate (12–20%) treatments compared with that in control (6.5%). In comparison with control, the available Se (SOL−Se + EXC−Se) fraction increased for both selenite (32–47%) or selenate (54–72%) treatments. Moreover, at the same rate of Se application, Se availability was higher in wheat grown in selenate-treated soils than that in selenite-treated soils. The redistribution index (U ₜₛ) of Se increased from 1 (in control) to 1.2–1.9 and 1.5–2 for selenite and selenate treatments, respectively; additionally, the mobility factor (MF) in selenate-treated soil was 40–90% higher than that in selenite-treated soil. Furthermore, relative bonding intensity (I R) for both selenite (0.38–0.45) and selenate treatment (0.33–0.41) decreased compared with that in control (0.55). These differences indicated that selenite and selenate varied in terms of fixation capacities in soil, in transformation and distribution of Se in soil fractions, and in their availability to plants. The results of Michaelis–Menten equation demonstrated the high affinity of leaf to selenate, and the high affinity of roots and grains to selenite. Selenate was dominant in nearly all parts of wheat plants and in each application level. However, the affinity of selenite to wheat grains suggests that selenite is a useful Se fertilizer that must be considered in biofortification programs. In-depth studies at the pot and field scales by using different wheat varieties and application methods of Se in different ecological zones must be conducted to elucidate the mechanism and biochemical properties of Se in soil-plant system and ultimately produce Se-rich staple foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3abioavailability 3abiofortification 3aecological zones 3aenzyme kinetics 3aleaves 3amodels 3aroots 3aselenates 3aselenites 3aselenium 3aselenium fertilizers 3asoil separates 3astaple foods 3awheat1 aPeng, Qin1 aWang, Dan1 aCui, Zewei1 aHuang, Jie1 aFu, Dongdong1 aLiang, Dongli0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Mar., v. 24, no. 9 p.8315-8325dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-8512-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01813naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008500168300001800253520081500271592002801086650001201114650001701126650001701143650001401160650001501174650001101189650002101200650002501221700001801246700001801264773010301282856008101385852000901466655001201475IND60158322820221122153953.0150530e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6015832282DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-015-1002-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Shivendra10aCost Evaluation of Water and Wastewater Treatment Plants Using Water Price Index  ap. 3343-3356.  aAs various technologies are used for water and wastewater treatment, a global strategy with the objective of comparing and containing the price of water in the future is required. A study was carried out for this reason on production cost component of the price of water. This paper extends the concept of previously reported Water Price Index (WPI) as a metric for the cost of water production that can be adapted to water and wastewater treatment plants to evaluate their performance. Equations that define the contribution of capital and operational expenditure to the WPI are presented. Case studies from Eraring Power Station, Marquette Water Filtration Plant, Perth Desalination II and a theoretically modelled plant demonstrated the applicability of WPI and the benefit it brings to water practitioners.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3acase studies 3adesalination 3aequations 3afiltration 3aprices 3aproduction costs 3awastewater treatment1 aGroth, Andrew1 aVlacic, Ljubo0 tWater resources management.g2015 July, v. 29, no. 9 p.3343-3356dSpringer-Verlagx0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-015-1002-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245008300164300002000247520115000267592002801417650001101445650002101456650001301477650001301490650002201503650001701525650000901542650001801551650002601569650001101595650001301606653003001619653002501649653002501674653004401699653001801743700001601761700005901777700001701836700001601853700001401869700001501883700005301898700006301951700005802014773014202072856007802214852000902292655001202301IND60707337620221122001227.0200819e20200728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070733762DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c095492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShang, Yuanyuan10aRapid Nanowelding of Carbon Coatings onto Glass Fibers by Electrothermal Shock  ap. 37722-37731.  aWith the rapid development of nanomanufacturing, scaling up of nanomaterials requires advanced manufacturing technology to composite nanomaterials with disparate materials (ceramics, metals, and polymers) to achieve hybrid properties and coupling performances for practical applications. Attempts to assemble nanomaterials onto macroscopic materials are often accompanied by the loss of exceptional nanoscale properties during the fabrication process, which is mainly due to the poor contacts between carbon nanomaterials and macroscopic bulk materials. In this work, we proposed a novel cross-scale manufacturing concept to process disparate materials in different length scales and successfully demonstrated an electrothermal shock approach to process the nanoscale material (e.g., carbon nanotubes) and macroscale (e.g., glass fiber) with good bonding and excellent mechanical property for emerging applications. The excellent performance and potentially lower cost of the electrothermal shock technology offers a continuous, ultrafast, energy-efficient, and roll-to-roll process as a promising heating solution for cross-scale manufacturing.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3aceramics 3acoatings 3aenergy efficiency 3aglass fibers 3aheat 3amanufacturing 3amechanical properties 3ametals 3apolymers 0across-scale manufacturing 0aelectrothermal shock 0anano- and macroscale 0amaterials across multiple length scales 0ahigh strength1 aShi, Baohui1 aDoshi, Sagar M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2057-711X1 aChu, Tiankuo1 aQiu, Guixue1 aDu, Aihua1 aZhao, Yong1 aXu, Fujun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6887-44201 aThostenson, Erik T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4196-07081 aFu, Kun Kelvin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4963-615X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 July 28, v. 12, no. 33 p.37722-37731dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c095493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012000166300001800286520117600304592002801480596005901508596006201567596005901629650002201688650001901710650002301729650001701752650001001769650002601779650002201805650004401827650001601871650002601887650001201913700001501925700001501940700002401955700001801979700001901997700001502016700001802031700001202049700001302061700001602074700001702090700005602107700001702163773014502180856008302325852000902408655001202417IND60682491820221121133616.0200324e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068249182DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-019-10217-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jingyu12aA new abyssomicin polyketide with anti-influenza A virus activity from a marine-derived Verrucosispora sp.

Based on the one strain-many compounds (OSMAC) strategy and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods, our continuing efforts on the investigation of novel active compounds from marine Verrucosispora sp. MS100137 has led to the identification of a new polycyclic metabolite, abyssomicin Y (1), together with six known abyssomicin and proximicin analogs (2–7). Abyssomicin Y is a type I abyssomicin with an epoxide group at C-8 and C-9. Compounds 1–3 showed potent inhibitory effects against the influenza A virus; their observed inhibition rates were 97.9%, 98.3%, and 95.9%, respectively, at a concentration of 10 μM, and they displayed lower cytotoxicity than 4. The structures were determined by different NMR techniques and HRMS experiments. This investigation revealed that OSMAC could serve as a useful method for enabling the activation of the silent genes in the microorganism and for the formation of previously unreported active secondary metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data  a31430002cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31720103901cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a21877038cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aInfluenza A virus 3aVerrucosispora 3aactive ingredients 3acytotoxicity 3agenes 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolyketides 3asecondary metabolites 3aviruses1 aLi, Bixiao1 aQin, Yujie1 aKarthik, Loganathan1 aZhu, Guoliang1 aHou, Chengjian1 aJiang, Lan1 aLiu, Miaomiao1 aYe, Xin1 aLiu, Mei1 aHsiang, Tom1 aDai, Huanqin1 aZhang, Lixin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6581-68181 aLiu, Xueting0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2020 Feb., v. 104, no. 4 p.1533-1543dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-019-10217-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002200124024001900146040001800165100002500183245010600208300001600314506007600330520118800406592002801594506003701622650001101659650001301670650001101683650001901694650001301713650001301726650002301739650001201762650001201774650001301786700001801799700003201817700002301849700002401872773009001896856008201986852000902068655001202077IND4487098320221207083031.0120502e20120107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448709832DNAL7 a10.1098/rspb.2011.08842doi7 aPMC32236592pmcid7 a216326282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFairhurst, Graham D.10aFeather corticosterone of a nestling seabird reveals consequences of sex-specific parental investment  ap. 177-184.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOffspring of long-lived species should face costs of parental trade-offs that vary with overall energetic demands encountered by parents during breeding. If sex differences exist in how parents make the trade-off, sex-specific differences may exist in the contribution of each parent to those costs. Adaptations of offspring facing such costs are not well understood, but the hormone corticosterone probably plays a role. We manipulated breeding effort in Cory's shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea) to increase costs to offspring and used an integrated measure of corticosterone from chick feathers to investigate how experimental variation in parental investment influences offspring physiology. Average foraging trip duration and foraging efficiency (FE) of breeding pairs were not related to chick corticosterone, but sex biases in FE were. Adult male investment was more strongly related to chick corticosterone than was female investment. Importantly, we show for the first time suppression of adrenocortical activity in nestling Procellariiform seabirds, and explain how our results indicate an adaptive mechanism invoked by chicks facing increased costs of parental trade-offs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3abreeding 3achicks 3acorticosterone 3afeathers 3aforaging 3agender differences 3aparents 3aprogeny 3aseabirds1 aNavarro, Joan1 aGonzÃ¡lez-SolÃ­s, Jacob1 aMarchant, Tracy A.1 aBortolotti, Gary R.0 tProceedings.g2012 Jan. 7, v. 279, no. 1726 p.177-184dRoyal Societyx0962-84527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2011.08843Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009800168300002000266520151800286592002801804650001301832650001601845650002101861650001401882650002201896650001701918650000901935650001901944650001101963650001301974650001401987650000702001650001302008650001602021650002502037650001502062700002802077700002102105773016902126856008202295852000902377655001202386IND60624622120221119061546.0190528e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062462212DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-0746-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima, Vanessa N.10aApplication of the Fenton’s process in a bubble column reactor for hydroquinone degradation  ap. 34851-34862.  aThe aim of this study was to assess the degradation and mineralization of hydroquinone (HQ) by the Fenton’s process in a bubble column reactor (BCR). The effect of the main operating variables, namely, air flow rate, effluent volume, hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) concentration, catalyst (Fe²⁺) dose, initial pH, and temperature, were assessed. For all air flow rates tested, no concentration gradients along the column were noticed, evidencing that a good mixing was reached in the BCR. For the best conditions tested ([H₂O₂] = 500 mg/L, [Fe²⁺] = 45 mg/L, T = 24 °C, Q ₐᵢᵣ = 2.5 mL/min, pH = 3.0, and V = 5 L), complete HQ degradation was reached, with ~ 39% of total organic carbon (TOC) removal, and an efficiency of the oxidant use—η H₂O₂—of 0.39 (ratio between TOC removed per H₂O₂ consumed normalized by the theoretical stoichiometric value); moreover, a non-toxic effluent was generated. Under these conditions, the intermediates and final oxidation compounds identified and quantified were a few carboxylic acids, namely, maleic, pyruvic, and oxalic. As a strategy to improve the TOC removal, a gradual dosage of the optimal H₂O₂ concentration was implemented, being obtained ~ 55% of mineralization (with complete HQ degradation). Finally, the matrix effect was evaluated, for which a real wastewater was spiked with 100 mg/L of HQ; no reduction in terms of HQ degradation and mineralization was observed compared to the solution in distilled water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3abioreactors 3acarboxylic acids 3acatalysts 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroquinone 3airon 3amineralization 3amixing 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apH 3aquinones 3atemperature 3atotal organic carbon 3awastewater1 aRodrigues, Carmen S.

Male rats (Rattus norvegicus var. alba) were divided into four groups, and the experiment was conducted over a 6-week period. The control groups (00; 0T) were provided with a standard ST-1 rodent mixture and received 10.5 mg of Zn/week. Groups P0 and PT were fed a mixture supplemented with the hyperaccumulating plant Arabidopsis halleri at a dosage of 123 mg Zn/week and 2.46 mg Cd/week. Groups 0T and PT were infected with the rat tapeworm (Hymenolepis diminuta). Fecal samples were collected 24 h post exposure. Zinc and cadmium concentrations in rat feces were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Tapeworm presence decreased the amount of metals excreted through the feces of the host throughout the entire experiment, with the exception of 1 week (control group). No statistically significant differences between zinc excretion rates in the control groups (00 and 0T) were detected at any time throughout the experiment. A statistically significant difference between zinc excretion rates (p < 0.05) in the exposed groups (P0 and PT) was detected in 2 of the 6 monitored weeks. Group PT excreted significantly less cadmium (p < 0.01) than group P0 did in three of the 6 weeks. Overall, our results indicate that tapeworms are able to influence the excretion of metals by their host. Tapeworms accumulate metals from intestinal contents. It is not clear whether tapeworms carry out this process before the host tissues absorb the metals from the intestines or the tapeworms accumulate metals excreted from the body of the host back to the intestines. Most likely, it is a combination of both phenomena.  aPublisher supplied data  a20182005cČeská Zemědělská Univerzita v Praze 3aArabidopsis halleri 3aHymenolepis diminuta 3aRattus norvegicus 3aabsorption 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3aexcretion 3afeces 3aintestines 3amales 3arats 3atapeworms 3azinc1 aJankovská, Ivana1 aSzáková, Jiřina1 aMagdálek, Jan1 aSloup, Simon1 aLangrová, Iva0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 Dec., v. 25, no. 35 p.35464-35470dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-3397-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03326naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001600191245011500207300001600322506007600338520150300414592002801917506003701945650003201982650001302014650001902027650002002046650001002066650001302076650001302089650001302102650001302115650001402128650002202142650001402164650001902178650001602197650001202213651001002225653003802235653001902273653001302292653002402305653001902329653001902348700001502367700001702382700002002399700001402419700001602433700001502449700001602464700001902480773010702499856008502606852000902691655001202700IND60611067920221207141342.0190403e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061106792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.12.0172doi7 aPMC71172832pmcid7 a280620002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yuqiu10aIdentification and molecular characterization of a novel serotype infectious bronchitis virus (GI-28) in China  ap. 108-115.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAvian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) is a major poultry pathogen. A characteristic feature of IBV is the occurrence of many different strains belonging to different serotypes, which renders complete control of the disease by vaccination a challenging task due to the poor cross-protection between different serotypes. In this study, based on the results of S1 sequence analysis and virus cross-neutralization tests, IBV strain ck/CH/LGX/111119 was found to be genetically and antigenically different from other known IBV types, representing not only a novel genotype, but also a novel serotype (designated as GI-28). Viruses belonging to this novel serotype have been isolated from several regions in China in recent years, suggesting endemic circulation of the serotype in various geographic locations in China. Further studies by complete genomic analysis showed that strain ck/CH/LGX/111119 may have originated from recombination events involving LX4 genotype IBVs and an as-yet-unidentified IBV donating a S1 gene, or from the result of accumulation of mutations and selections, especially in the S1 gene, from a LX4 genotype virus. ck/CH/LGX/111119 is a nephropathogenic strain, although it had broader tissue tropism (respiratory, digestive, urinary, and reproductive tracts) among chickens challenged at one day old. Infection of the oviducts with ck/CH/LGX/111119 found in this study may have severe implications because the virus will likely induce the occurrence of false layers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInfectious bronchitis virus 3achickens 3across immunity 3adisease control 3agenes 3agenomics 3agenotype 3amutation 3aoviducts 3apathogens 3asequence analysis 3aserotypes 3atissue tropism 3avaccination 3aviruses 3aChina 0aInfectious bronchitis coronavirus 0aGI-28 genotype 0aSerotype 0aNephropathogenicity 0aTissue tropism 0aCystic oviduct1 aJiang, Lei1 aZhao, Wenjun1 aLiu, Liangliang1 aZhao, Yan1 aShao, Yuhao1 aLi, Huixin1 aHan, Zongxi1 aLiu, Shengwang0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2017 Jan., v. 198 p.108-115dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006100144245012000205300002000325520150200345592002801847650001401875650001401889650002601903650002101929650001501950650001101965650001301976650001201989650002202001650001902023650001502042650002002057650002302077650001102100650001802111653002902129653003002158653001802188653002502206653001902231653002402250700002202274700005902296700005902355700005702414773014202471856007802613852000902691655001202700IND60707337820221122001121.0200819e20200805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070733782DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c096222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaumann, Avery E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8513-804910aGraphene–Metal–Organic Framework Composite Sulfur Electrodes for Li–S Batteries with High Volumetric Capacity  ap. 37173-37181.  aIn an age of rapid acceleration toward next-generation energy storage technologies, lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries offer the desirable combination of low weight and high specific energy. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been recently studied as functionalizable platforms to improve Li–S battery performance. However, many MOF-enabled Li–S technologies are hindered by low capacity retention and poor long-term performance due to low electronic conductivity. In this work, we combine the advantages of a Zr-based MOF-808 loaded with sulfur as the active material with a graphene/ethyl cellulose additive, leading to a high-density nanocomposite electrode requiring minimal carbon. Our electrochemical results indicate that the nanocomposites deliver enhanced specific capacity over conventionally used carbon/binder mixtures, and postsynthetic modification of the MOF with lithium thiophosphate results in further improvement. Furthermore, the dense form factor of the sulfur-loaded MOF–graphene nanocomposite electrodes provides high volumetric capacity compared to other works with significantly more carbon additives. Overall, we have demonstrated a proof-of-concept paradigm where graphene nanosheets facilitate improved charge transport because of enhanced interfacial contact with the active material. This materials engineering approach can likely be extended to other MOF systems, contributing to an emerging class of two-dimensional nanomaterial-enabled Li–S batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3acellulose 3acoordination polymers 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3agraphene 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3aspecific energy 3astorage technology 3asulfur 3athiophosphate 0alithium−sulfur battery 0ametal−organic framework 0ananocomposite 0ahigh packing density 0aenergy storage 0avolumetric capacity1 aDowning, Julia R.1 aBurns, David A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5067-55111 aHersam, Mark C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4120-14261 aThoi, V.

The aim of the present study was to explore perceptions regarding body size and weight loss in a sample of black women from a low-income community in Cape Town, SA. Qualitative pilot study including five focus groups. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Khayelitsha, Cape Town, SA. Twenty-one black SA women. The majority of participants had positive perceptions of overweight/obesity, which were influenced by community and cultural perceptions, but some inconsistencies were observed as overweight/obesity was also associated with ill health. Participants identified many benefits to weight loss, but due to the association with sickness, they were concerned about being stigmatised in their community. Although participants had knowledge about healthy eating, the main barrier to eating healthily included the perceived higher cost of healthier food and food insecurity. All participants saw exercise as a strategy to lose weight and improve health, and were interested in participating in a community-based exercise intervention, but negative community perceptions and conflicting views regarding who should lead the intervention were identified as barriers. These findings highlight the complexities surrounding participants’ perceptions regarding body size, weight loss and weight-loss interventions, and emphasise low socio-economic status as a barrier to change. The study also highlights the strong influence of cultural ideals and community perceptions on personal perceptions. These findings underscore the necessity for culturally appropriate weight-loss interventions in low-income, transitioning communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfricans 3aBlacks 3abody size 3aexercise 3afocus groups 3afood security 3ahealthy diet 3aobesity 3asocioeconomic status 3aweight loss 3awomen 0aCulture 0aSocio-economic status 0aDiet 0aExercise 0aInterventions 0aBody image 0aObesity1 aDavidowitz, Kesiah J1 aGoedecke, Julia H.,0 tPublic health nutrition.g2016 Feb., v. 19, no. 3 p.548-556dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800150016883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245005500190300001600245520138700261592002801648650000801676650001701684650001101701650000801712650001301720650002201733650002001755650001501775650001501790650001001805650001001815653001801825653001701843653001401860653003601874653000701910653003301917700002401950700001901974773013601993856008202129852000902211655001202220IND60516205020221122060108.0190726e20120128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051620502DNAL7 a217333052pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145110028812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBożek, Małgorzata10aOn a refinement of the ¹³C-mixed TAG breath test  ap. 211-217.  aThe present study was aimed to improve and simplify the ¹³C-mixed TAG (¹³C-MTG) breath test while keeping it acceptable for the patient. Healthy volunteers (ten women and eight men) were examined on four occasions, receiving in a random order 300 mg ¹³C-MTG: (1) contained in two wafers; (2) administered with a 50 g wheat roll; as well as given with either (3) 10 or (4) 30 g butter, spread onto a 50 g wheat roll, as the test meal, respectively. Samples of expiratory air were taken for 6 h postprandially for the mass spectroscopic measurement of ¹³CO₂ enrichment. After intake of the sole ¹³C-MTG, the cumulative ¹³C recovery in breath air (AUC) appeared to be unsatisfactory, as after 6 h it did not exceed 10 %. Application of the substrate with the 50 g wheat roll did not bring about any improvement in this parameter. The addition of the unlabelled fat to the test meal dramatically increased the cumulative ¹³C recovery. However, we found higher values for the momentary ¹³C recovery and AUC with 10 g butter compared with 30 g. It can be concluded that: (1) addition of unlabelled fat is indispensable to obtain a proper course of the breath ¹³C elimination during the conduct of the ¹³C-MTG breath test and (2) it is possible to apply a considerably smaller amount of the unlabelled fat than has previously been recommended for this test.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abreath tests 3abutter 3amen 3apatients 3aspectral analysis 3astable isotopes 3atest meals 3avolunteers 3awheat 3awomen 0a13C-mixed TAG 0aBreath tests 0aCarbon-13 0aIsotope application in medicine 0aMS 0aPancreatic exocrine function1 aJonderko, Krzysztof1 aPiłka, Monika0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2012 Jan. 28, v. 107, no. 2 p.211-217dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145110028813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03393naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002700167245015200194300001600346500001500362520166100377592002802038650001402066650001202080650002202092650001202114650002502126650001302151650002202164650001802186650001402204650002702218650003302245650002702278650001202305650002802317650002502345650001702370650002302387650002202410650004602432650001402478650005502492653002702547700001702574700002202591700002402613700002402637773008502661856008402746852000902830655001202839IND4457711620221119184525.0141111e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445771162DNAL7 a215309242pmid7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2011.02.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoulongne-Oriol, Marie10aQuantitative genetics to dissect the fungal–fungal interaction between Lecanicillium verticillium and the white button mushroom Agaricus bisporus  ap. 421-431.  a2019-12-05  aLecanicillium fungicola (formerly Verticillium fungicola) is responsible for dry bubble disease in the white button mushroom Agaricus bisporus. Selection for resistance to this pathogen raises an important challenge for mushroom breeders. We have investigated the inheritance of resistance to dry bubble under artificial inoculation in three independent experiments, using a progeny of 89 hybrids derived from an intervarietal A. bisporus var. bisporus×A. bisporus var. burnettii cross. Overall, phenotypic correlations were highly significant between the different experiments. Principal component analysis, together with analysis of variance results stated that the disease reactions were accurately assessed using the percentage of bubbles (PB) and the percentage of spotty cap mushrooms (PS) separately rather than with the combination of both. An original contribution of this study lies in the effective use of area under the disease-progress curve (AUDPC) to describe the dry bubble resistance. The continuous phenotypic distribution observed for the resistance traits suggested that tolerance to dry bubble was under polygenic control. Heritability estimates for either PB or AUDPC were high (0.67–0.86) while it was inconsistent for PS (0.33–0.68) suggesting a strong impact of the environment on this latter trait. Earliness and latent period were found highly correlated with disease incidence. The earliest strains appeared to be the most resistant ones. These results contribute to disentangle the complex fungal–fungal A. bisporus / L. fungicola interaction and to provide genetic basis as a prerequisite for mushroom breeding program.  aPublisher supplied data 3amushrooms 3ahybrids 3aAgaricus bisporus 3abubbles 3aanalysis of variance 3abreeding 3aearly development 3alatent period 3apathogens 3aphenotypic correlation 3aprincipal component analysis 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aprogeny 3aLecanicillium fungicola 3aenvironmental impact 3aheritability 3adry bubble disease 3adisease incidence 2aAgaricusxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPhenotype 2aVerticilliumxgrowth & developmentxpathogenicity. 0aVerticillium fungicola1 aRodier, Anne1 aRousseau, Thierry1 aLargeteau, Michèle1 aSavoie, Jean-Michel0 tFungal biology.g2011 , v. 115, no. 4-5 p.421-431dElsevier Ltdx1878-61467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2011.02.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011700161300001600278500002000294520162800314592002801942650002501970650002001995650002302015650002002038650001202058650001102070650001202081700002202093700001702115700002502132773013002157856007302287852000902360655001202369IND60587638520221120064230.0180102e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058763852DNAL7 a10.1890/12-2151.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBroms, Kristin M.10aSpatial occupancy models applied to atlas data show Southern Ground Hornbills strongly depend on protected areas  ap. 363-374.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDetermining the range of a species and exploring species–habitat associations are central questions in ecology and can be answered by analyzing presence–absence data. Often, both the sampling of sites and the desired area of inference involve neighboring sites; thus, positive spatial autocorrelation between these sites is expected. Using survey data for the Southern Ground Hornbill (Bucorvus leadbeateri) from the Southern African Bird Atlas Project, we compared advantages and disadvantages of three increasingly complex models for species occupancy: an occupancy model that accounted for nondetection but assumed all sites were independent, and two spatial occupancy models that accounted for both nondetection and spatial autocorrelation. We modeled the spatial autocorrelation with an intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR) model and with a restricted spatial regression (RSR) model. Both spatial models can readily be applied to any other gridded, presence–absence data set using a newly introduced R package. The RSR model provided the best inference and was able to capture small‐scale variation that the other models did not. It showed that ground hornbills are strongly dependent on protected areas in the north of their South African range, but less so further south. The ICAR models did not capture any spatial autocorrelation in the data, and they took an order of magnitude longer than the RSR models to run. Thus, the RSR occupancy model appears to be an attractive choice for modeling occurrences at large spatial domains, while accounting for imperfect detection and spatial autocorrelation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBucorvus leadbeateri 3aautocorrelation 3aconservation areas 3adata collection 3aecology 3amodels 3asurveys1 aJohnson, Devin S.1 aAltwegg, Res1 aConquest, Loveday L.0 tEcological applications.g2014 Mar., v. 24, no. 2 p.363-374dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/12-2151.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02085naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245011200174300001400286520111100300592002801411653003901439653002601478653002501504653002501529700002601554700002401580773009701604856008501701852000901786655001201795IND60679978420221119054255.0200106e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067997842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2018.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Borba, Marlon C.10aUlvan enhances seedling emergence and reduces Fusarium wilt severity in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)  ap. 66-71.  aThis study aimed to evaluate the potential of ulvan to control the bean Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli (Fop) as well as its effect on seedling emergence. Seed soaking was carried out for 4 h before sowing, whereas soil irrigation or foliar spraying were performed at 12 days after sowing. Ulvan reduced disease severity when sprayed onto leaves but did not show significant effect when applied via seed soaking or soil irrigation. However, when soaked in seeds, ulvan enhanced seedling emergence by 55%, 30% and 44% on Fop-infested, non-infested and sterilized substrate, respectively. The effect of ulvan spray frequency on Fusarium wilt progress and fungal colonization was analyzed in follow-up assays. Our results revealed that one, two or three applications of ulvan similarly protected bean plants by reducing Fop-colonization at earlier, but not at later phenological stages. As a consequence, ulvan significantly decreased the area under disease progress curve by 27%. Possible reasons why this protective effect can be obtained in certain circumstances are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 0aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli 0aAlgal polysaccharides 0aAcibenzolar-S-methyl 0aColony forming units1 ade Freitas, Mateus B.1 aStadnik, Marciel J.0 tCrop protection.g2019 Apr., v. 118 p.66-71dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2018.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03303naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245010800185300001600293520169400309592002802003650001102031650001202042650001202054650002802066650002202094650002002116650001402136650001802150650001702168650001502185650000902200650001402209650002502223650002002248650001602268650001902284650001102303650001402314650001402328650001102342651001102353653001902364653000902383653001102392653001902403700002002422700002002442700002202462700002302484773012702507856008202634852000902716655001202725IND60517498420221120182742.0190803e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051749842DNAL7 a260883632pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800150017802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurphy, Mary M10aDaily intake of dairy products in Brazil and contributions to nutrient intakes: a cross-sectional study  ap. 393-400.  aDairy products are sources of protein and micronutrients important in a healthy diet. The purpose of the present analysis was to estimate consumption of dairy products by Brazilians and identify contributions of dairy products to nutrient intakes. Dairy consumption data were obtained from 24 h dietary records. Dairy products were defined as milk (including flavoured), cheese and yoghurt. Estimates of dairy product intakes were generated for all individuals, individuals in urban and rural households and for age groups 10–18 years, 19–59 years and ≥60 years. Contributions to nutrient intakes were estimated for the total sample and sub-populations. Nationwide cross-sectional survey, 2008–2009. Nationally representative sample of individuals aged ≥10 years in the Individual Food Intake survey, a component of the Brazilian Household Budget Survey (n 34 003). Among individuals aged ≥10 years, per capita intake of dairy products was 142 (se 2·1) g/d. Dairy product intake was higher among individuals in urban compared with rural areas and among groups 10–18 years and ≥60 years compared with adults aged 19–59 years. Dairy products accounted for 6·1 % of daily energy intake, 7·3 % of protein, 16·9 % of saturated fat, 11·1 % and 4·3 % of total and added sugars, respectively, and 10·2–37·9 % of daily Ca, vitamin D, P, vitamin A and K. Dairy products were substantial contributors to daily intakes of selected nutrients of concern in Brazil, although mean daily dairy product consumption was less than a typical portion. Education efforts in Brazil to raise awareness about the nutritional role of dairy foods may serve to improve overall diet quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acalcium 3acheeses 3across-sectional studies 3adairy consumption 3adietary surveys 3aeducation 3aenergy intake 3ahealthy diet 3ahouseholds 3amilk 3anutrients 3anutritional adequacy 3aprotein sources 3arural areas 3asaturated fats 3asugars 3avitamin A 3avitamin D 3ayogurt 3aBrazil 0aDairy products 0aMilk 0aBrazil 0aDietary survey1 aBarraj, Leila M1 aToth, Lindsey D1 aHarkness, Laura S1 aBolster, Douglas R0 tPublic health nutrition.g2016 Feb., v. 19, no. 3 p.393-400dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800150017803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03662naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245018900163300001600352520153400368592002801902650002401930650002501954650001501979650001901994650002002013650001502033650001402048650002602062650002602088650001302114650002702127650001202154650001102166650000902177650001502186653000802201653000702209653001202216653000802228653000702236653000802243653000802251653000802259653000802267653000702275653000702282653000802289653000802297653002602305653002102331653002602352653000802378653000802386653004602394700002202440700001802462700001702480700001602497700002102513700001702534700002402551700001602575700002202591700002202613700001602635700002102651773012902672856008202801852000902883655001202892IND60573045620221119222155.0190408e20171002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057304562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.etp.2017.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaoud, Amal10aCardiopreventive effect of ethanolic extract of Date Palm Pollen against isoproterenol induced myocardial infarction in rats through the inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme  ap. 656-665.  aThe present study aimed to examine the putative preventive effect of the ethanolic extract Date Palm Pollen (DPP, Phoenix dactylifera L., family Arecaceae) on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in rats. Twenty four rats were randomly divided into four groups including control. They were treated with DPP extract (400mg/kg) and clopidogrel (0.2mg/kg) for 7days followed by myocardial injury induction using subcutaneous isoproterenol (100mg/kg) with an interval of 24h for two days (6th and 7th day). Administration of isoproterenol exhibited indicative changes in the ECG pattern evidenced by significant elevation of ST-segment and cardiac injury markers viz.; troponin-T, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) by 315%, 71%, 64% and 170%, respectively as compared to control. Additionally, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in plasma was increased by 33% associated to histological myocardial necrosis. However, pre-co-treatment with DPP extract improved the cardiac biomarkers injury, normalized cardiac function indices and prevented the ventricular remodeling process through inhibition of ACE activity by 34% and the inhibition of the generation of radical oxygen species. Extensive characterization of this DPP extract using LC-HRMS revealed numerous flavonoids and phenols compounds which could be endowed with cardiopreventive actions. Overall, these results proved that DPP extract has preventive effects on cardiac remodeling process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aalanine transaminase 3abiomarkers 3acardiac output 3acreatine kinase 3aflavonoids 3ahistology 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amyocardial infarction 3anecrosis 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3aphenols 3apollen 3arats 3atroponin T 0aDPP 0aMI 0aHRESIMS 0aECG 0aLV 0aCPK 0aALT 0aLDH 0aACE 0aTC 0aTG 0aECL 0aROS 0aDPP ethanolic extract 0aCardiopreventive 0aMyocardial infarction 0aACE 0aECG 0aElectrospray ionization mass spectrometry1 aBen mefteh, Fedia1 aMnafgui, Kais1 aTurki, Mouna1 aJmal, Salwa1 aBen amar, Rawdha1 aAyadi, Fatma1 aElFeki, Abdelfattah1 aAbid, Leila1 aRateb, Mostafa E.1 abelbahri, Lassaad1 aKadri, Adel1 aGharsallah, Neji0 tExperimental and toxicologic pathology.g2017 Oct. 02, v. 69, no. 8 p.656-665dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11954x0940-29937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.etp.2017.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002600166245008700192300001600279520118800295592002801483650001601511650001701527650000901544650002001553650001101573650003301584650002001617650002101637650001401658650003001672650003001702650001801732650002201750650001001772700002001782700002901802773009701831856008101928852000902009655001202018IND60120149520221123011345.0150131e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012014952DNAL7 a255667712pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-014-4291-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarros, Juliana H.

Here, we performed a genetic study with T. caninum samples obtained in different Brazilian regions. The study was based on PCR assays target to small and large subunit ribosomal DNA (rDNA) (18S rDNA and 24Sα rDNA), cytochrome B (Cyt b), and internal transcribed spacer 1 rDNA (ITS1 rDNA) following by the sequence analysis. Additionally, we used primers for the variable regions of kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) minicircles and endonucleases restriction in the ITS1 rDNA amplification product. T. caninum samples displayed the same patterns. Tree construction confirmed the close relationship between T. caninum samples, regardless of the molecular target used and endonuclease restriction digestion revealed that all samples have the same restriction profile. Therefore, T. caninum seems to be a genetically homogeneous specie. In the kDNA assay, T. caninum possessed a different molecular size profile with respect to others trypanosomes, 330 and 350 bp. This study provides nucleotide sequences from different regions of the genome of T. caninum that certainly facilitate future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrypanosoma 3acytochrome b 3adogs 3agenetic markers 3agenome 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3akinetoplast DNA 3amolecular weight 3aparasites 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3atrees1 aToma, Helena K.1 ade Fatima Madeira, Maria0 tParasitology research.g2015 Feb., v. 114, no. 2 p.777-783dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-014-4291-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03925naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011700165300001600282520181900298592002802117650003002145650002302175650002102198650001702219650001302236650001402249650001602263650002202279650003102301650001002332650002002342650001802362650002402380650001402404650002002418650002202438650004302460650002302503650002202526650001202548650001302560650001602573653000802589653001202597653000902609653000902618653000802627653000802635653000802643653000802651653000802659653000802667653000802675653000802683653000802691653002202699653003202721653003002753653002302783653002002806700001802826700001302844700001502857700001502872700001402887700001402901700001302915700001602928773009502944856008303039852000903122655001203131IND60530145620221119152319.0180830e20160401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053014562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2015.12.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qiong12aA novel homolog of protein tyrosine kinase Fyn identified in Lampetra japonica with roles in the immune response  ap. 193-200.  aThe non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase (nrPTK) Fyn, a member of the avian sarcoma virus transforming gene (Src) kinase family, plays a very significant role in cell growth, survival, apoptosis, tumor formation and immune response. In this study, a homolog of nrPTK Fyn was identified for the first time in the lamprey, Lampetra japonica and was named “Lja-Fyn”. The cDNA fragment of lamprey lja-fyn contains a 1611-bp open reading frame, which encodes a protein of 537 amino acids. Multiple sequence alignment analysis showed that it shares four conserved domains (Src homology (SH) 4, SH3, SH2 and protein kinases catalytic domains) and a variable unique domain with vertebrates Fyn molecules. Though Lja-Fyn has high sequence similarity with typical Fyn and Yes molecules of jawed vertebrates, the identities among Lja-Fyn and typical Fyn molecules in unique domain are relatively higher than that among Lja-Fyn and typical Yes molecules. The result indicates that Lja-Fyn is a homolog of Fyn rather than Yes. The phylogenetic analysis showed that Fyn, Yes and Src molecules are grouped into three distinct phylogenetic clusters, and Lja-Fyn is grouped as a single branch in Fyn cluster. The real-time quantitative PCR assay revealed the wide distribution of the lja-fyn mRNA in lamprey immune related tissues. After stimulation with mixed antigens, the levels of lja-fyn mRNA were obviously up-regulated in the gill and lymphocyte-like cells, and the similar results were got by western blot analysis of Lja-Fyn protein expression. These results indicated that nrPTK Lja-Fyn was likely to be involved in immune response. Furthermore, our present findings also provide the necessary information for understanding the distinction between lamprey Lja-Fyn and other members of jawed vertebrates in Src family.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLethenteron camtschaticum 3aRous sarcoma virus 3aWestern blotting 3aactive sites 3aantigens 3aapoptosis 3acell growth 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aimmune response 3amessenger RNA 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3aprotein kinases 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asequence alignment 3asequence homology 3atissues 3atyrosine 3avertebrates 0aFyn 0aLja-Fyn 0aRACE 0aqPCR 0aSrc 0aYes 0aFgr 0aLyn 0aLck 0aBlk 0aHck 0aYrk 0aTec 0aLampetra japonica 0aTyrosine protein kinase Fyn 0aPhylogenetic relationship 0aExpression pattern 0aImmune response1 aSong, Xueying1 aSu, Peng1 aLi, Ranran1 aLiu, Chang1 aGou, Meng1 aWang, Hao1 aLiu, Xin1 aLi, Qingwei0 tGene.g2016 Apr. 01, v. 579, no. 2 p.193-200dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2015.12.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245013500188300001600323520173400339592002802073650002802101650002102129650001402150650002402164650002802188650002402216650001702240650001802257650001302275650001602288650001502304650001802319650000802337650001102345650001502356650001402371650001602385650002202401650001002423650002402433650001602457650001002473653002202483653001402505653001802519653002102537700002202558700002702580700001702607700002502624773012702649856008202776852000902858655001202867IND60517498520221120172246.0190803e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051749852DNAL7 a260740022pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800150018582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, Camilla P10aIntake of ruminant trans-fatty acids, assessed by diet history interview, and changes in measured body size, shape and composition  ap. 494-502.  aStudies have suggested that total intake of trans-fatty acids (TFA) is positively associated with changes in body weight and waist circumference, whereas intake of TFA from ruminant dairy and meat products (R-TFA) has not been associated with weight gain. However, these previous studies are limited by self-reported measures of body weight and waist circumference or by a cross-sectional design. The objective of the present study was to investigate if R-TFA intake was associated with subsequent changes in anthropometry (body weight, waist and hip circumference) measured by technicians and body composition (body fat percentage). A 6-year follow-up study. Information on dietary intake was collected through diet history interviews, and anthropometric and bioelectrical impedance measurements were obtained by trained technicians at baseline (1987–1988) and at follow-up (1993–1994). Multiple regression with cubic spline modelling was used to analyse the data. Copenhagen County, Denmark. Two hundred and sixty-seven men and women aged 35–65 years from the Danish MONICA (MONItoring of trends and determinants in CArdiovascular diseases) cohort. The median R-TFA intake was 1·3 g/d (5th, 95th percentile: 0·4, 2·7 g/d) or 0·6 % of the total energy intake (5th, 95th percentile: 0·2, 1·1 %). No significant associations were observed between R-TFA intake and changes in body weight, waist and hip circumference or body fat percentage. R-TFA intake within the range present in the Danish population was not significantly associated with subsequent changes in body size, shape or composition and the 95 % confidence intervals indicate that any relevant associations are unlikely to have produced these observations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioelectrical impedance 3abody composition 3abody size 3abody weight changes 3acardiovascular diseases 3aconfidence interval 3adiet history 3aenergy intake 3afat body 3afood intake 3ainterviews 3ameat products 3amen 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aruminants 3atechnicians 3atrans fatty acids 3awaist 3awaist circumference 3aweight gain 3awomen 0aTrans-fatty acids 0aRuminants 0aAnthropometry 0aBody composition1 aHeitmann, Berit L1 aSørensen, Thorkild IA1 aOvervad, Kim1 aJakobsen, Marianne U0 tPublic health nutrition.g2016 Feb., v. 19, no. 3 p.494-502dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800150018583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01998naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011900169300001500288520068700303592002800990650002201018650002401040650001001064650002001074650001401094650001201108650001201120650001301132650001401145650001501159653001501174653000901189653002601198653001301224653002001237700001701257700001601274700001601290700001701306700001701323773010601340856008501446852000901531655001201540IND60611068120221118063559.0190403e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061106812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Wenming10aNovel variants of clade 2.3.2.1 H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in migratory waterfowl of Hongze Lake  ap. 99-103.  aWild birds are known to play a major role in the evolution, maintenance, and spread of the avian influenza viruses (AIVs). More specifically, the waterfowl are thought to be the natural reservoirs of AIVs. Here, we conducted a survey in 2015 at the Hongze Lake and characterized 11 H5N1 highly pathogenic AIVs isolated from wild waterfowls which were found to belong to clade 2.3.2.1. In contrast, the 11 variants of H5N1 viruses did not align with the three previously defined monophyletic subclades. Antigenicity analysis revealed that antigenic drift occurred in these H5N1 variants. Hence, current vaccines may fail to confer protection against the H5N1 AIV variants in poultry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aantigenic variation 3alakes 3amigratory birds 3amonophyly 3apoultry 3asurveys 3avaccines 3awaterfowl 3awild birds 0aWild birds 0aH5N1 0aAvian influenza virus 0aVariants 0aAntigenic drift1 aHou, Guangyu1 aLi, Jinping1 aPeng, Cheng1 aWang, Suchun1 aChen, Jiming0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2017 Jan., v. 198 p.99-103dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03992naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010600165300001800271520195000289592002802239596006902267596005902336596006902395596009102464596011002555596006602665596005902731650002102790650002602811650002602837650001702863650002502880650001502905650002202920650002302942650001602965650002502981650002503006700005603031700001503087700001303102700001803115700001803133700001303151700001803164700001303182700001803195773014503213856008303358852000903441655001203450IND60682492320221121133726.0200324e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068249232DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-019-10279-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Xunchao10aCharacterizing community dynamics and exploring bacterial assemblages in two activated sludge systems  ap. 1795-1808.  aBacterial communities in the activated sludge (AS) determine the wastewater treatment performance in the municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Aiming at identifying the affecting factors and the variation patterns of the bacterial assemblages in AS, a 2-year time-series AS samples were collected from two separated WWTPs and metagenomic sequencing was conducted. Obvious seasonal shift and succession of the bacterial community were observed in both WWTPs on the genus and species levels, especially for the persistent taxa, implying that temperature was a decisive factor for maintaining bacterial assemblage patterns in long-term period. Taxa abundance distribution (TAD) concerning occurrence frequency and average abundance were found fitting for exponential formulations, and the approximately equal total abundance of persistent taxa suggested that stable and high abundance (~ 90%) of core functional bacterial groups would help to maintain wastewater treatment performance. Drastic changes of environmental factors were found causing temporally significant bacterial structure variation, while the innate correlations between bacterial species could recover the community gradually and maintain relative stability of the AS system. Delayed correlations between environmental factors and abundant (persistent or intermittent) bacterial species were observed widely, while synchronous biotic interactions were identified more frequently. Besides, bacterial species with similar functions were prone to cluster together and shared the same seasonal variation pattern, implicating that the cooperation of functional correlated taxa played the most dominant role in shaping the bacterial assemblages. Furthermore, rare bacterial groups were to be explored for removing emerging pollutants with lower concentrations. The results of this study would assist dealing with operational defect and optimize the treatment system in WWTPs.  aPublisher supplied data  a51608329; 51708358cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41907214cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017A030313315cNatural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province  aJCYJ20160520165135743, JCYJ20170412171918012cShenzhen Science and Technology Projects  a2017ZX07202cNational Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment (CN)  a827-000223cNatural Science Foundation of Shenzhen University  a2019M653053cPostdoctoral Research Foundation of China 3aactivated sludge 3abacterial communities 3aenvironmental factors 3ametagenomics 3amunicipal wastewater 3apollutants 3apollution control 3aseasonal variation 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3awastewater treatment1 aMao, Yanping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7466-629X1 aXu, Jianyu1 aTian, Li1 aWang, Yicheng1 aIqbal, Waheed1 aYang, Bo1 aLiu, Changkun1 aZhao, Xu1 aWang, Yuexing0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2020 Feb., v. 104, no. 4 p.1795-1808dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-019-10279-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03631naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245016700170300001600337520172200353592002802075650001602103650003702119650001902156650001602175650002802191650001302219650002102232650002002253650003102273650002502304650001402329650001102343650002102354650001402375650004302389650001602432650001402448650001102462650001102473650002002484653001202504653000802516653001002524653000802534653000902542653000902551653000802560653000902568653000802577653002202585653001602607653001602623653001502639653002102654700001702675700002602692700002602718700002602744773009502770856008302865852000902948655001202957IND60530145720221119152419.0180830e20160401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053014572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2015.12.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGovindaraj, Lekha10aGenome-wide identification, characterization of sugar transporter genes in the silkworm Bombyx mori and role in Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) infection  ap. 162-171.  aSugar transporters play an essential role in controlling carbohydrate transport and are responsible for mediating the movement of sugars into cells. These genes exist as large multigene families within the insect genome. In insects, sugar transporters not only have a role in sugar transport, but may also act as receptors for virus entry. Genome-wide annotation of silkworm Bombyx mori (B. mori) revealed 100 putative sugar transporter (BmST) genes exists as a large multigene family and were classified into 11 sub families, through phylogenetic analysis. Chromosomes 27, 26 and 20 were found to possess the highest number of BmST paralogous genes, harboring 22, 7 and 6 genes, respectively. These genes occurred in clusters exhibiting the phenomenon of tandem gene duplication. The ovary, silk gland, hemocytes, midgut and malphigian tubules were the different tissues/cells enriched with BmST gene expression. The BmST gene BGIBMGA001498 had maximum EST transcripts of 134 and expressed exclusively in the malphigian tubule. The expression of EST transcripts of the BmST clustered genes on chromosome 27 was distributed in various tissues like testis, ovary, silk gland, malphigian tubule, maxillary galea, prothoracic gland, epidermis, fat body and midgut. Three sugar transporter genes (BmST) were constitutively expressed in the susceptible race and were down regulated upon BmNPV infection at 12h post infection (hpi). The expression pattern of these three genes was validated through real-time PCR in the midgut tissues at different time intervals from 0 to 30hpi. In the susceptible B. mori race, expression of sugar transporter genes was constitutively expressed making the host succumb to viral infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3aBombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus 3aanimal ovaries 3achromosomes 3aexpressed sequence tags 3afat body 3agene duplication 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aglucose transporters 3ahemocytes 3amidgut 3amultigene family 3aphylogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asilk glands 3asilkworms 3asugars 3atestes 3avirus receptors 0aB. mori 0ahpi 0aBmNPV 0aBVs 0aODVs 0aqPCR 0aPIB 0aDEPC 0aRIN 0aSugar transporter 0aBombyx mori 0aBmNPV entry 0aMicroarray 0aSusceptible race1 aGupta, Tania1 aEsvaran, Vijaya Gowri1 aAwasthi, Arvind Kumar1 aPonnuvel, Kangayam M.0 tGene.g2016 Apr. 01, v. 579, no. 2 p.162-171dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2015.12.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01435naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245011100152300002000263520037600283592002800659650002300687650002300710650001300733650001600746650001000762650001700772650001100789650001900800650001100819700001900830700001800849773013500867856007401002852000901076655001201085IND60659961520221123000806.0190823e20131003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065996152DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc45222k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNi, Lei12aA visible-light-induced overall water-splitting photocatalyst: conduction-band-controlled silver tantalate  ap. 10094-10096.  aVisible-light-induced water splitting was achieved by increasing the visible-light sensitivity of AgTaO₃, by the introduction of Nb, generating AgTa₁₋ₓNbₓO₃.

These include actions such as assisted migration, and the application of climate‐change‐informed triage principles for decision‐making (e.g., forgoing attention to target species deemed no longer viable). Little is known however, about the levels of expert agreement across different conservation adaptation actions, or the preferences that may come to shape policy recommendations. In this paper, we report findings from a web‐based survey of biodiversity experts that assessed: (1) perceived risks of climate change (and other drivers) to biodiversity, (2) relative importance of different conservation goals, (3) levels of agreement/disagreement with the potential necessity of unconventional‐taboo actions and approaches including affective evaluations of these, (4) preferences regarding the most important adaptation action for biodiversity, and (5) perceived barriers and strategic considerations regarding implementing adaptation initiatives. We found widespread agreement with a set of previously contentious approaches and actions, including the need for frameworks for prioritization and decision‐making that take expected losses and emerging novel ecosystems into consideration. Simultaneously, this survey found enduring preferences for conventional actions (such as protected areas) as the most important policy action, and negative affective responses toward more interventionist proposals. We argue that expert views are converging on agreement across a set of taboo components in ways that differ from earlier published positions, and that these views are tempered by preferences for existing conventional actions and discomfort toward interventionist options.

Since 1999, due to the occurrence of many BV outbreaks in dairy farms across all Brazilian regions, there is a need to improve the control and prevention measures of the disease. Vaccination is one of the major tools to prevent viral diseases, and it could be an alternative for BV prevention. The main objective of this study was the development of vaccine formulations against BV using the inactivated VACV strain GP2 as antigen combined with different adjuvants. Potency tests were performed in mice, which were vaccinated with two doses at a 21-day interval, and then challenged with the vaccine homologous virus. VACV strain GP2 inactivated by beta-propiolactone (BPL) in association with adjuvants was effective in inducing a humoral immune response against VACV, as measured by neutralizing antibody (NA) titers, and was variable depending on the adjuvant used in each vaccine formulation. The vaccine formulation containing aluminum hydroxide (AH) associated with saponin as adjuvant induced the production of high NA titers in all vaccinated mice, giving 100% protection in Balb/c murine model after challenge with homologous virus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVaccinia virus 3aadjuvants 3aaluminum hydroxide 3aanimal models 3aantigens 3adairy cows 3adairy farming 3ahands 3ahumoral immunity 3alesions (animal) 3amice 3aneutralizing antibodies 3asaponins 3ateats 3avaccination 3avaccine development 3avaccines 3aviruses 3azoonoses 0aBovine vaccinia 0aImmune response 0aVaccine 0aVaccinia virus 0aMurine model1 aGuedes, Maria Isabel Maldonado Coelho1 aRehfeld, Izabelle Silva1 aCosta, Erica Azevedo1 aCosta, Aristoteles Gomes1 aSilva, Natalia Lopes da1 aLage, Andrey Pereira1 aLobato, Zélia Inês Portela0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2017 May, v. 204 p.84-89dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03620naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245012100174300001600295520190300311592002802214650002102242650001302263650001102276650001902287650003002306650000902336650002302345650001302368650001302381650001102394650001202405650002302417650001602440650002602456650001902482650002502501650002102526653002902547653001602576653001702592653002202609653001902631653001802650700001902668700002502687700001902712700001902731700001902750700002402769700006002793773009502853856008502948852000903033655001203042IND60573046620221119221905.0180831e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057304662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2017.05.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMulat, Daniel Girma10aExogenous addition of H2 for an in situ biogas upgrading through biological reduction of carbon dioxide into methane  ap. 146-156.  aBiological reduction of CO2 into CH4 by exogenous addition of H2 is a promising technology for upgrading biogas into higher CH4 content. The aim of this work was to study the feasibility of exogenous H2 addition for an in situ biogas upgrading through biological conversion of the biogas CO2 into CH4. Moreover, this study employed systematic study with isotope analysis for providing comprehensive evidence on the underlying pathways of CH4 production and upstream processes. Batch reactors were inoculated with digestate originating from a full-scale biogas plant and fed once with maize leaf substrate. Periodic addition of H2 into the headspace resulted in a completely consumption of CO2 and a concomitant increase in CH4 content up to 89%. The microbial community and isotope analysis shows an enrichment of hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium and the key role of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis for biogas upgrading to higher CH4 content. Excess H2 was also supplied to evaluate its effect on overall process performance. The results show that excess H2 addition resulted in accumulation of H2, depletion of CO2 and inhibition of the degradation of acetate and other volatile fatty acids (VFA). A systematic isotope analysis revealed that excess H2 supply led to an increase in dissolved H2 to the level that thermodynamically inhibit the degradation of VFA and stimulate homo-acetogens for production of acetate from CO2 and H2. The inhibition was a temporary effect and acetate degradation resumed when the excess H2 was removed as well as in the presence of stoichiometric amount of H2 and CO2. This inhibition mechanism underlines the importance of carefully regulating the H2 addition rate and gas retention time to the CO2 production rate, H2-uptake rate and growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in order to achieve higher CH4 content without the accumulation of acetate and other VFA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanobacterium 3aacetates 3abiogas 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide production 3acorn 3aheadspace analysis 3ahydrogen 3aisotopes 3aleaves 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3athermodynamics 3avolatile fatty acids 3awaste management 0aIn situ biogas upgrading 0aH2 addition 0aPower to gas 0aHomo-acetogenesis 0aStable isotope 0aCO2 reduction1 aMosbæk, Freya1 aWard, Alastair James1 aPolag, Daniela1 aGreule, Markus1 aKeppler, Frank1 aNielsen, Jeppe Lund1 aFeilberg, Anders1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5807-13360 tWaste management.g2017 Oct., v. 68 p.146-156dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.05.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014600171300001800317520118800335592002801523650001801551650001201569650001301581650001901594650000901613650001401622650001101636650002801647650001901675650001501694650001601709650003001725650003701755650001101792650001401803650001301817650002101830650001501851650002501866651001101891700002701902700002301929700002601952700002701978700002602005700002402031700001802055700002502073773014602098856008102244852000902325655001202334IND60572348020221119040826.0170717e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057234802DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-8513-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aČučak, Dragana I.12aA chemical and microbiological characterization and toxicity assessment of the Pančevo industrial complex wastewater canal sediments, Serbia  ap. 8458-8468.  aThe wastewater canal Vojlovica of the Pančevo industrial area, Serbia, is the main collector of the effluents from the local industrial complex. The canal is directly connected to the Europe’s second largest river, the Danube. Here, we present a chemical and microbiological analysis of the sediment in order to determine the fate of pollutants over the years, as well as its current condition. Dry matter, clay and organic matter content, a Kjeldahl ammonia, phosphorus, metals, and polychlorinated biphenyls as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons concentrations were measured. Microbiological analysis included heterotrophic and oil-degrading bacterial counts, isolation of the phenanthrene-degrading bacteria, and identification of cyanobacteria. Generally, in comparison to the results from previous studies, concentrations of the measured pollutants have been in a decline. Specifically, the metal and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations were reduced whereas microbial counts and toxicity tests did not indicate significant pollution. The obtained results are probably a consequence of an improved wastewater treatment and microbial degradation of pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aammonia 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3aclay 3aeffluents 3ametals 3amicrobiological quality 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3aplate count 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arivers 3asediments 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3aSerbia1 aSpasojević, Jelena M.1 aBabić, Olivera B.1 aMaletić, Snežana P.1 aSimeunović, Jelica B.1 aRončević, Srđan D.1 aDalmacija, Božo D.1 aTamaš, Ivica1 aRadnović, Dragan V.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Mar., v. 24, no. 9 p.8458-8468dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-8513-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245017700158300001400335520126400349592002801613650002301641650001501664650003101679650001401710650001201724650001701736650002501753650001801778650001501796650002301811650001601834651003101850653000801881653001701889653002101906653001701927653001801944653002001962700002101982700002302003700002302026700002402049700002402073700002402097773010702121856007102228852000902299655001202308IND60477902020221118030435.0160108s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047790202DNAL7 a10.1071/WF150922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOttmar, Roger D.10aPre-fire and post-fire surface fuel and cover measurements collected in the south-eastern United States for model evaluation and development – RxCADRE 2008, 2011 and 2012  ap. 10-24.  aA lack of independent, quality-assured data prevents scientists from effectively evaluating predictions and uncertainties in fire models used by land managers. This paper presents a summary of pre-fire and post-fire fuel, fuel moisture and surface cover fraction data that can be used for fire model evaluation and development. The data were collected in the south-eastern United States on 14 forest and 14 non-forest sample units associated with 6 small replicate and 10 large operational prescribed fires conducted during 2008, 2011, and 2012 as part of the Prescribed Fire Combustion and Atmospheric Dynamics Research Experiment (RxCADRE). Fuel loading and fuel consumption averaged 6.8 and 4.1Mgha-1 respectively in the forest units and 3.0 and 2.2Mgha-1 in the non-forest units. Post-fire white ash cover ranged from 1 to 28%. Data were used to evaluate two fuel consumption models, CONSUME and FOFEM, and to develop regression equations for predicting fuel consumption from ash cover. CONSUME and FOFEM produced similar predictions of total fuel consumption and were comparable with measured values. Simple linear models to predict pre-fire fuel loading and fuel consumption from post-fire white ash cover explained 46 and 59% of variation respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFraxinus americana 3acombustion 3aenergy use and consumption 3aequations 3aforests 3afuel loading 3afuels (fire ecology) 3alinear models 3aprediction 3aprescribed burning 3auncertainty 3aSoutheastern United States 0aash 0afire effects 0afuel consumption 0afuel loading 0alongleaf pine 0aprescribed fire1 aHudak, Andrew T.1 aPrichard, Susan J.1 aWright, Clinton S.1 aRestaino, Joseph C.1 aKennedy, Maureen C.1 aVihnanek, Robert E.0 tInternational journal of wildland fire.g2016, v. 25, no. 1 p.10-24dCSIRO Publishingx1049-80017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF150923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03595naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011500162300001600277500002000293500001500313520216100328592002802489650002002517650001302537650001902550650001102569650002302580650001002603650001202613650000902625650001902634650001102653650001702664650002502681650001802706650001402724650001502738650001102753651001402764651002302778653001402801700001802815700002202833700002202855773013002877856007303007852000903080655001203089IND60587639420221120025951.0180102e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058763942DNAL7 a10.1890/13-0640.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKauffman, J.

Deforestation and conversion of these ecosystems continue to be high and have been predicted to result in significant carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Yet few studies have quantified the carbon stocks or losses associated with conversion of these ecosystems. In this study we quantified the ecosystem carbon stocks of three common mangrove types of the Caribbean as well as those of abandoned shrimp ponds in areas formerly occupied by mangrove—a common land‐use conversion of mangroves throughout the world. In the mangroves of the Montecristi Province in Northwest Dominican Republic we found C stocks ranged from 706 to 1131 Mg/ha. The medium‐statured mangroves (3–10 m in height) had the highest C stocks while the tall (>10 m) mangroves had the lowest ecosystem carbon storage. Carbon stocks of the low mangrove (shrub) type (<3 m) were relatively high due to the presence of carbon‐rich soils as deep as 2 m. Carbon stocks of abandoned shrimp ponds were 95 Mg/ha or ∼11% that of the mangroves. Using a stock‐change approach, the potential emissions from the conversion of mangroves to shrimp ponds ranged from 2244 to 3799 Mg CO₂e/ha (CO₂ equivalents). This is among the largest measured C emissions from land use in the tropics. The 6260 ha of mangroves and converted mangroves in the Montecristi Province are estimated to contain 3 841 490 Mg of C. Mangroves represented 76% of this area but currently store 97% of the carbon in this coastal wetland (3 696 722 Mg C). Converted lands store only 4% of the total ecosystem C (144 778 Mg C) while they comprised 24% of the area. By these metrics the replacement of mangroves with shrimp and salt ponds has resulted in estimated emissions from this region totaling 3.8 million Mg CO₂e or ∼21% of the total C prior to conversion. Given the high C stocks of mangroves, the high emissions from their conversion, and the other important functions and services they provide, their inclusion in climate‐change mitigation strategies is warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland use change 3awetlands 3acarbon dioxide 3ashrubs 3aecosystem services 3aponds 3atropics 3asoil 3aclimate change 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3acarbon sequestration 3adeforestation 3aemissions 3aecosystems 3ashrimp 3aCaribbean 3aDominican Republic 0amangroves1 aHeider, Chris1 aNorfolk, Jennifer1 aPayton, Frederick0 tEcological applications.g2014 Apr., v. 24, no. 3 p.518-527dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-0640.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01177naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245006400161300001800225520023000243592002800473650001400501650002300515650002300538650001700561650001400578700002500592700001400617700002300631773012800654856007200782852000900854655001200863IND60657516620221121040901.0190816e20040604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065751662DNAL7 a10.1039/b402378a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelville, James L.10aComputational screening of combinatorial catalyst libraries  ap. 1410-1411.  aA catalyst design methodology, utilizing combinatorial synthesis in parallel with chemometric analysis, is presented, which considers the 3D steric and electrostatic properties of substituents about a constant core structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3achemometrics 3ascreening1 aAndrews, Benjamin I.1 aLygo, B.,1 aHirst, Jonathan D.0 tChemical communications.g2004 June 4, , no. 12 p.1410-1411dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b402378a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002200150245009200172300001800264520172000282592002802002650001902030650001702049650001402066650001502080650001202095650001102107650001702118650001202135650001102147650001102158650001702169651001002186700002202196700002702218700002102245700002702266773009402293856008602387852000902473655001202482IND4459027620221119184710.0141110e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445902762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGÃ³mez, Antonio13aThetechnical potential of first-generation biofuels obtained from energy crops in Spain  ap. 2143-2155.  aBiofuels have been recently the subject of a sustained interest due to the ambitious goals set out in developed, and some developing, countries as they transition to more sustainable and self-sufficient energy models. Thus, EU Directive 2003/30 established certain minimimun shares of biofuels in the transport sector for the member states, viz 2% by 2005 and 5.75% by 2010. More recently, the EU Directive 2009/28/EC imposes a target share of 10% renewables in the transport sector by 2020. Different roadmaps can be envisaged based on the varying contributions from first and second-generation biofuels; the controversial role of biomass imports for biofuel production adds some additional uncertainties. Against this backdrop, this work presents a comprehensive view of the technical potential for first-generation biofuels (biodiesel and bioethanol) from energy crops in Spain, and their prospects in the short and mid terms. The methodology has been implemented in a Geographical Information System. The calculated technical potentials for biodiesel range between 730 and 1830Â ktoeÂ yearâ»Â¹ for land occupations of 10% and 25% of the arable land, respectively. The corresponding bioethanol potentials for the same levels of land occupation are 1228 and 3070Â ktoeÂ yearâ»Â¹. The calculated potentials indicate that the Spanish agricultural system would be severely strained if the 2020 target, 4755Â ktoeÂ yearâ»Â¹, is to be met with locally-grown biofuel crops. The study further estimates the resulting first-generation biofuel costs, and concludes that incentives are needed for the price to be competitive with that of oil-based fuels, even in a scenario of high oil prices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aarable soils 3abiodiesel 3abioethanol 3abiomass 3aenergy 3aenergy crops 3aimports 3amodels 3aprices 3aspatial data 3aSpain1 aRodrigues, Marcos1 aMontaÃ±Ã©s, Carlos1 aDopazo, CÃ©sar1 aFueyo, N.q(Norberto),0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2011 May, v. 35, no. 5 p.2143-2155dElsevier Ltdx0961-95347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016100167300002000328520136300348592002801711596006601739596006501805596010801870650001201978650001701990650001602007650001202023650001602035650001402051650002002065650001602085650001802101650001802119650002102137650001002158650001402168650001102182650001302193700001902206700002302225700002602248700002202274700002502296773016902321856008202490852000902572655001202581IND60624623620221119061813.0190528e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062462362DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-3534-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTot, Aleksandar10aEvaluation of the impact of different alkyl length and type of substituent in imidazolium ionic liquids on cucumber germination, growth and oxidative stress  ap. 35594-35601.  aIn this work, the effect on cucumber growth of seven different imidazolium-based ionic liquids, namely 1-(2-oxybutyl)-3-methylimidazolium chloride, [C₂OC₂mIm][Cl]; 1-(2-oxypropyl)-3-methylimidazolium chloride, [C₁OC₂mIm][Cl]; 1-(3-hydroxypropyl)-3-ethylimidazolium chloride, [OHC₃eIm][Cl]; 1-(3-hydroxypropyl)-3-methylimidazolium chloride, [OHC₃mIm][Cl]; 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium chloride, [OHC₂mIm][Cl], 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, [bmim][Cl] and imidazolium chloride, [Im][Cl], were examined. The influence of polarity of the alkyl side chain of the imidazolium cation on the reduction of the ionic liquid’s toxicity is investigated. For all investigated seedlings, significant reduction of biomass was noted, with the incoherent influence of the ionic liquid (IL) concentration. The total inhibition of germination was shown at the highest used concentration for some of the used ionic liquids. Although investigated ILs affected root and shoot growth of cucumber, the effect on stress marker (MDA) as well as biosynthesis of chlorophyll and carotenoids was negligible. The data collected in this research suggest that tuning of the lipophilicity of imidazolium cations by the introduction of polar groups in the side alkyl chain does not have pronounced effect on cucumber, as it was shown for other plant species.  aPublisher supplied data  aON172012cMinistarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i Tehnološkog Razvoja  aTR31036cMinistarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i Tehnološkog Razvoja  a142-451-2766/2018-01/02cThe Provincial Secretariat for Higher Education and Scientific Research of APV 3abiomass 3abiosynthesis 3acarotenoids 3acations 3achlorophyll 3acucumbers 3adata collection 3agermination 3aionic liquids 3alipophilicity 3aoxidative stress 3aroots 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3atoxicity1 aVraneš, Milan1 aMaksimović, Ivana1 aPutnik-Delić, Marina1 aDaničić, Milena1 aGadžurić, Slobodan0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 Dec., v. 25, no. 35 p.35594-35601dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-3534-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013900164300001600303520157600319592002801895650001001923650002901933650001501962650001601977650001601993650001002009650001302019650001402032650001302046650002402059650002402083650001402107650002002121650001902141650002102160650001402181650001402195650001402209650004402223650001302267650001402280650002102294653000902315653002902324653001202353653002002365700001702385700001802402700002102420773010702441856008502548852000902633655001202642IND60611069020221118063647.0190705e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061106902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Min10aImmunogenicity and safety of a live Riemerella anatipestifer vaccine and the contribution of IgA to protective efficacy in Pekin ducks  ap. 132-138.  aRiemerella anatipestifer (RA) infections cause major economic losses in the duck industry.In this study, we developed an RA vaccine to control virulent serotype 1 and 2 RA, which predominate in worldwide prevalence. We established a strategy for vaccine candidate screening, and selected strains D15-RDA-92 (serotype 1) and D14-RDA-8 (serotype 2). These strains were characterized by ≤50% embryo mortality and <3.0 serum resistance assay values in in vitro screening. We evaluated the protective efficacy of live bivalent RA vaccines against virulent homologous serotype RA. Ducklings received two oral immunizations with the bivalent vaccine and showed significant protection against two virulent strains (serotypes 1 and 2) at 21 days post-immunization. No death or clinical signs of diarrhea, tremors, or limb swelling were observed in the immunized ducks. In a safety evaluation, ducks immunized with 100 times higher doses showed no clinical signs, mortality, gross lesions, or histological lesions, and body weight of the ducks showed no significant difference compared to that of negative controls. In addition, IgA analysis showed a significant increase in secretory IgA antibodies generated in the trachea and duodenum of orally immunized ducks at 28 days of age. The IgA might be involved in one of the major immune responses to RA and contributes to protecting against virulent RA. In this study, we developed monovalent and bivalent RA vaccines that were safe in ducks and provided significant protective efficacy against virulent homologous RA strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPekin 3aRiemerella anatipestifer 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3adeath 3adiarrhea 3aducklings 3aduodenum 3aembryonic mortality 3afinancial economics 3ahistology 3aimmune response 3aimmunogenicity 3aimmunoglobulin A 3amortality 3ascreening 3aserotypes 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3avaccines 3avirulence 3avirulent strains 0aDuck 0aRiemerella anatipestifer 0aVaccine 0aImmune response1 aSeo, Hye-Suk1 aSoh, Sang-Hee1 aJang, Hyung-Kwan0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2018 Aug., v. 222 p.132-138dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02297naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245013600161300001800297520103600315592002801351650002301379650001401402650001901416650001301435650002101448650000901469650001101478650001101489650001101500650001801511650001801529650001501547650001901562651001001581700001401591700001901605700001501624773014601639856008101785852000901866655001201875IND60572348320221119041142.0170717e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057234832DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-8532-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Zhuo10aAtmospheric wet deposition of nitrogen in a subtropical watershed in China: characteristics of and impacts on surface water quality  ap. 8489-8503.  aAtmospheric wet deposition of nitrogen (N) is an important process in global N cycling, having significant impacts on both water quality and aquatic ecosystems worldwide. The aims of this study were to clarify the N wet deposition first flush effect and estimate the contribution of N wet deposition on both N export and water quality in a subtropical watershed. Results showed that total nitrogen (TN) flux was 41.72 kg N hm⁻² year⁻¹ and dissolved total nitrogen (DTN) was 23.18 kg N hm⁻² year⁻¹, respectively. Light rain events lead to the highest DTN and dissolve inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations of wet deposition. Rainstorm concentrations were lowest during spring rainfall–runoff events. In contrast to the baseflow, the different N forms were higher than they were under the rainfall–runoff. Rainfall event contributions on N export were greater than 93.2% in the watershed for the whole year. Finally, TN concentrations were higher than river eutrophication thresholds for the entire watershed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abase flow 3aeutrophication 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3arain 3arivers 3arunoff 3aspring 3asurface water 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3awet deposition 3aChina1 aGao, Yang1 aYang, Tiantian1 aTian, Jing0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Mar., v. 24, no. 9 p.8489-8503dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-8532-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03652naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002000165245013600185300001600321520144500337592002801782650002001810650001401830650000901844650002001853650001401873650001401887650001401901650002501915650002301940650001301963650001401976650000901990650005001999650002002049650005502069650002402124650002202148650001102170650004902181650005602230650002602286650001102312650002102323650001902344650000902363650005902372650001602431650005002447650002302497650006702520650006402587651001102651700002002662700002102682700002202703700002202725700002302747700001502770773009002785856008202875852000902957655001202966IND4471233020221119184721.0141110e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447123302DNAL7 a210749102pmid7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2010.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlek, Stanislaw14aThe immunomodulating enteral nutrition in malnourished surgical patients – A prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial  ap. 282-288.  aBACKGROUND & AIM: The immunomodulating nutrition was supposed to reduce the incidence of complications in surgical patients, but many authors have questioned its value recently. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of enteral immunonutrition in postoperative period. METHODS: Between January 2003 and December 2009, 305 malnourished patients (123 F, 182 M, m. age 60.8) undergoing resection for pancreatic or gastric cancer, after preoperative 14 days of parenteral feeding, were randomized in double-blind manner to receive either postoperative immunomodulating enteral diet (IMEN) or standard oligopeptide diet (SEN). Outcome measures of the intend-to-treat analysis were: number and type of complications, length of hospitalization, mortality, and vital organ function. RESULTS: Median postoperative hospital stay was 17.1 days in SEN and 13.1 days in IMEN group (p = 0.006). Infectious complications were observed in 60 patients (39.2%) in SEN and 43 (28.3%) in IMEN group (p = 0.04). Differences were also observed in overall morbidity (47.1 vs 33.5%, p = 0.01) and mortality (5.9 vs 1.3%, p = 0.03), but the ratio of surgical complications, organ function, and treatment tolerance did not differ. CONCLUSIONS: The study proved that postoperative immunomodulating enteral nutrition should be the treatment of choice in malnourished surgical cancer patients.

The obtained MCNT@ZIF-67 composite was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). Static adsorption experiments demonstrated that the maximum adsorption capacity of MCNTs@ZIF-67 for tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is 83.23 mg g⁻¹, and the sorption isotherm was fitted well by the Freundlich adsorption model. Dynamic adsorption experiments illustrated that the adsorption of TBBPA on MCNTs@ZIF-67 can reach equilibrium in 20 min, and the adsorption kinetics of TBBPA were fitted well by a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The adsorption of TBBPA on MCNTs@ZIF-67 showed favorable selectivity. The pH and the NaCl and NH₄Cl common salts did not affect the TBBPA adsorption. Then, the proposed magnetic composite was applied as the adsorbent for the rapid removal of TBBPA in water samples, and the removal ratio of MCNTs@ZIF-67 for TBBPA in different spiked water samples with different volumes was above 95% with RSD < 5%. Furthermore, as a new removal sorbent, the removal reproducibility of MCNTs@ZIF-67 for TBBPA was favorable and stable, with only a 6.0% decrease after 6 cycles.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 21577043che National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aammonium chloride 3acarbon 3acobalt 3akinetics 3amagnetism 3amodels 3anitrates 3apH 3asilica 3asodium chloride 3asorption isotherms 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aTao, Yun1 aXu, Yinghu1 aLuo, Dan1 aHu, Liqin1 aFeng, Jingwen1 aJing, Tao1 aZhou, Yikai1 aMei, Surong0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 Dec., v. 25, no. 35 p.35602-35613dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-3239-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01809naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245005500172300001600227520088400243592002801127650001601155650001301171650001901184650001201203653001201215653001101227653002401238653002601262700002401288773011101312856005101423852000901474655001201483IND50076502920221119173656.0140410e20130313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007650292DNAL7 a10.1080/87559129.2012.7144342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRafiqul, I.

Industrially, xylitol is manufactured through a chemical process that has some disadvantages, including a high energy requirement, extensive purification steps, and a high cost of product. The microbial production of xylitol has been examined as an alternative to the chemical process, which on an industrial scale is time-consuming mainly due to sterilization and inoculum development. The enzymatic production of xylitol from lignocellulosics is an attractive and promising alternative to the chemical process, potentially eliminating the major disadvantages of conventional processes. This article reviews the literature on xylitol production processes and identifies ways to further improve xylitol synthesis to compete with the current chemical process.  aPublisher supplied data 3achewing gum 3ainoculum 3alignocellulose 3axylitol 0aXylitol 0aXylose 0aXylose fermentation 0aXylose reductase (XR)1 aSakinah, A.

This study evaluated the inhibitory effect of Brazilian red propolis on mono-species biofilms of C. albicans (ATCC 90028) and co-culture biofilms of C. albicans (ATCC 90028) and C. glabrata (ATCC 2001), developed on titanium surfaces. METHODS: Titanium specimens were pre-conditioned with artificial saliva and submitted to biofilm formation (1 × 10⁶ CFU/mL). After 24 h (under microaerophilic conditions at 37 °C) biofilms were submitted to treatment for 10 min, according to the groups: sterile saline solution (growth control), 0.12% chlorhexidine and 3% red propolis extract. Treatments were performed every 24 h for 3 days and analyses were conducted 96 h after initial adhesion. After that, the metabolic activity (MTT assay) (n = 12/group), cell viability (CFU counts) (n = 12/group) and surface roughness (optical profilometry) (n = 6/group) were evaluated. Data from viability and metabolic activity assays were evaluated by ANOVA and Tukey tests. Surface roughness analysis was determined by Kruskal Wallis e Mann Whitney tests. RESULTS: Regarding the mono-species biofilm, the cell viability and the metabolic activity showed that both chlorhexidine and red propolis had inhibitory effects and reduced the metabolism of biofilms, differing statistically from the growth control (p < 0.05). With regards the co-culture biofilms, chlorhexidine had the highest inhibitory effect (p < 0.05). The metabolic activity was reduced by the exposure to chlorhexidine and to red propolis, different from the growth control group (p < 0.05). The surface roughness (Sa parameter) within the mono-species and the co-culture biofilms statistically differed among groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Brazilian red propolis demonstrated potential antifungal activity against Candida biofilms, suggesting it is a feasible alternative for the treatment of peri-implantitis.  aPublisher supplied data  a001cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCandida albicans 3aCandida glabrata 3aadhesion 3aanalysis of variance 3aantifungal properties 3abiochemical pathways 3abiofilm 3acell viability 3achlorhexidine 3acoculture 3adentures 3ainflammation 3alongevity 3ametabolism 3apropolis 3asaliva 3asodium chloride 3asurface roughness 3atitanium 3atoxicity testing1 aCavalcanti, Yuri Wanderley1 ade Almeida, Leopoldina de Fátima Dantas0 tBMC complementary medicine and therapies.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.104-104dBioMed CentralwJournal:27308x2662-76717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-020-02893-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013600158300002000294520190000314592002802214650000802242650001102250650001402261650002302275650001102298650001102309650001402320650001302334650002202347650000902369650001102378650001702389700002102406700002702427700002102454773012502475856007402600852000902674655001202683IND60742129420221119210702.0210623e20210607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074212942DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra03762e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakamaki, Aoi10aPrecursor accumulation on nanocarbons for the synthesis of LaCoO₃ nanoparticles as electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction  ap. 20313-20321.  aOxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key step in energy storage devices. Lanthanum cobaltite (LaCoO₃) perovskite is an active catalyst for OER in alkaline solutions, and it is expected to be a low-cost alternative to the state-of-the-art catalysts (IrO₂ and RuO₂) because transition metals are abundant and inexpensive. For efficient catalysis with LaCoO₃, nanosized LaCoO₃ with a high surface area is desirable for increasing the number of catalytically active sites. In this study, we developed a novel synthetic route for LaCoO₃ nanoparticles by accumulating the precursor molecules over nanocarbons. This precursor accumulation (PA) method for LaCoO₃ nanoparticle synthesis is simple and involves the following steps: (1) a commercially available carbon powder is soaked in a solution of the nitrate salts of lanthanum and cobalt and (2) the sample is dried and calcined in air. The LaCoO₃ nanoparticles prepared by the PA method have a high specific surface area (12 m² g⁻¹), comparable to that of conventional LaCoO₃ nanoparticles. The morphology of the LaCoO₃ nanoparticles is affected by the nanocarbon type, and LaCoO₃ nanoparticles with diameters of less than 100 nm were obtained when carbon black (Ketjen black) was used as the support. Further, the sulfur impurities in nanocarbons significantly influence the formation of the perovskite structure. The prepared LaCoO₃ nanoparticles show excellent OER activity owing to their high surface area and perovskite structure. The Tafel slope of these LaCoO₃ nanoparticles is as low as that of the previously reported active LaCoO₃ catalyst. The results strongly suggest that the PA method provides nanosized LaCoO₃ without requiring the precise control of chemical reactions, harsh conditions, and/or special apparatus, indicating that it is promising for producing active OER catalysts at a large scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3aenergy 3alanthanum 3anitrates 3aoxygen production 3asoot 3asulfur 3asurface area1 aOgihara, Hitoshi1 aYoshida-Hirahara, Miru1 aKurokawa, Hideki0 tRSC advances.g2021 June 07, v. 11, no. 33 p.20313-20321dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra03762e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011100161300001800272520124800290592002801538650004401566650002201610650003701632650001501669650002401684650002601708650002001734650001201754650001901766650002101785650001301806650001701819650003301836650001701869653003101886653001901917653001201936653001501948653002001963653002101983700001802004700001602022773012702038856007302165852000902238655001202247IND60527430520221121022116.0160715e20120926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052743052DNAL7 a10.1021/am30131042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Zheng-Hong10aGlucose-Promoted Zn-Based Metal–Organic Framework/Graphene Oxide Composites for Hydrogen Sulfide Removal  ap. 4942-4947.  aZinc-based metal–organic frameworks/graphene oxide (MOF-5/GO) composites were synthesized via the solvothermal method. The materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and their performances for hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) removal were evaluated by dynamic testing at room temperature. The composites exhibit microporous structure with a small amount of mesopores, and the structure is highly dependent on the amount of GO loaded. The surface area and pore volume first increase and then decrease with increasing GO, reaching the maximum value when the GO ratio is 5.25%. The composites exhibit high adsorption capacities for H₂S, with the maximum uptakes reaching up to 130.1 mg/g. Although the loading of GO makes a contribution to the enhancement of dispersive force in the porous structure, it leads to the crystal distortion of MOF-5. The introduction of glucose can restrain this distortion to maintain the structure stability. A good match between GO and glucose have a well synergy effect to develop the porous structure, resulting in the highest H₂S adsorption capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3acoordination polymers 3adynamic testing 3aglucose 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrogen sulfide 3anitrogen 3aporous media 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 0ametal−organic frameworks 0agraphene oxide 0aglucose 0acomposites 0adesulfurization 0ahydrogen sulfide1 aLiu, Guoqiang1 aKang, Feiyu0 tACS applied materials .g2012 Sept. 26, v. 4, no. 9 p.4942-4947dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am30131043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01829naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012100162300002000283520081400303592002801117650001501145650001401160650002001174650001401194650000901208650001101217650001601228650001601244700002301260773013601283856007501419852000901494655001201503IND60537631020221121053336.0160809e20131218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053763102DNAL7 a10.1021/ie402654u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Ganapati D.10aSelective Green Synthesis of 1,5-Benzodiazepine over Modified Heteropolyacid as Nanocatalyst: Kinetics and Mechanism  ap. 17812-17820.  aThe present work deals with synthesis of 2,3-dihydro-1H-1,5-benzodiazepine from o-phenylenediamine and acetophenone at 100 °C using a variety of solid acid catalysts, among which 20% w/w Cs₂.₅H₀.₅PW₁₂O₄₀ (Cs-DTP)/K-10 clay was the best.

The studies were extended to synthesis of various derivatives of benzodiazepines, which are biologically active.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aagitation 3abenzodiazepines 3acatalysts 3aclay 3aenergy 3aengineering 3atemperature1 aYadav, Akhilesh R.0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2013 Dec. 18, v. 52, no. 50 p.17812-17820dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie402654u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245010100211300001300312500001900325520158800344592002801932596010701960650001602067650002502083650001702108650001402125650001202139650002402151650002202175650001302197650001202210650001302222650001102235650002402246650001302270650001102283651001002294700002002304700002102324700002402345773017202369856008202541852000902623655001202632IND60730296720221120232502.0210306e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073029672DNAL7 a10.1007/s40011-020-01188-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandal, Vivekananda1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6523-806910aHarvesting Strategy for Different Mango Varieties Based on Comparative Sugar and Phenol Contents  ap. 1-11.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe main objective of the study is to assess the key harvesting time based on the comparative evaluation of the total sugar and phenol contents and also their health beneficial antioxidant potentiality during the stages of fruit development of three mango cultivars, viz. Amrapali, Laxmanbhog, and Gooti, to extend the post-harvest storage and shelf-life for mango fruit consumption and processing. The study reflects that the gross total sugar contents (30–80 mg/g) of all three varieties were the same at the final stage of ripening, while there were remarkable differences in phenol and antioxidant contents. Total phenol contents (TPCs) in the epicarp and mesocarp region of fruits were ranged from 10 to 95 µg/g and 7 to 40 µg/g, respectively, in the different varieties. The Amrapali variety showed the highest TPC in the epicarp in stage one (95 µg/g) than the other cultivars. The antioxidant capacity of this variety gradually increased with the ripening stages which were quite contradictory to the other two varieties. The greater antioxidant activity of Amrapali and Laxmanbhog was observed throughout the developmental stages than the wild cultivar, Gooti. These results indicate that the late 3rd stage or early 4th stage would be the key harvesting time and post-harvest storage with extended shelf-life with reduced incidence of anthracnose and other fruit spoilage diseases. The high sugar and antioxidant contents in these cheap fruits, apart from delicacies, could contribute a valuable source of antioxidants to all classes of people in their daily diet.  aPublisher supplied data  aDST-SERB/F/5369/2013-’14; dated 19.11.2013cScience for Equity, Empowerment and Development Division 3aanthracnose 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acultivars 3aexocarp 3aextended shelf life 3afruit consumption 3afruiting 3amangoes 3amesocarp 3aphenol 3apostharvest storage 3aspoilage 3asugars 3aIndia1 aKundu, Satarupa1 aBarman, Jayashri1 aAdhikary, Rajsekhar0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, India, Section B: biological sciences.g2021 Mar., v. 91, no. 1 p.1-11dSpringer IndiawJournal:20704x0369-82117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40011-020-01188-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010800168300001800276520125300294592002801547650002601575650003401601650002801635650001101663650002401674650001301698650001301711650002101724650001701745650001401762650002301776650001801799650001101817650000901828651001001837653000801847653001901855653001401874653002301888653001801911700001701929700001201946700001801958773013701976856008702113852000902200655001202209IND60676122720221121023452.0200523e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067612272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.11.0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Rong10aRecent progress in the research of yam mucilage polysaccharides: Isolation, structure and bioactivities  ap. 1262-1269.  aYam (Dioscorea spp.), known as an edible and medicinal tuber crop in China, has been used historically for the treatment of diabetes, diarrhea, asthma, and other ailments in traditional Chinese medicine. Moreover, it has been consumed as starchy food for thousands of years in China. Modern phytochemistry and pharmacological experiments have been proved that non-starch polysaccharide is one of the main bioactive substances of yam. Many studies have been focused on the isolation and identification of polysaccharides and their bioactivities of Chinese yam. However, due to the difference in the variety of raw materials and the method of polysaccharides extracting, the structure and biological activity of the obtained polysaccharides also differ. It has been demonstrated that Chinese yam polysaccharide has various important biological activities, such as hypoglycemia, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and antitumor activities. This paper is aimed at summarizing previous and current references of the isolation processes, structural features and bioactivities of yam polysaccharides. The review will serve as a useful reference material for further investigation and application of yam polysaccharides in functional foods and medicine fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDioscorea polystachya 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aantineoplastic activity 3aasthma 3abioactive compounds 3adiabetes 3adiarrhea 3afunctional foods 3ahypoglycemia 3amucilages 3aplant biochemistry 3araw materials 3atubers 3ayams 3aChina 0aYam 0aPolysaccharide 0aIsolation 0aStructure features 0aBioactivities1 aXie, Jianhua1 aYu, Yue1 aShen, Mingyue0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 July 15, v. 155 p.1262-1269dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.11.0953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010900169300001600278520140200294592002801696650000901724650001401733650002001747650002401767650001601791650001601807650001201823650003301835650001401868650002901882650001201911650004401923653001501967653002301982653001802005653001402023653002302037653003302060700001802093700001602111700001402127700001702141700001802158700001502176700001402191773010002205856008702305852000902392655001202401IND60610911620221120033658.0190402e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061091162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.10.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Maomao10aInhibitory profiles of chilli pepper and capsaicin on heterocyclic amine formation in roast beef patties  ap. 404-411.  aThe inhibitory profiles of chilli pepper and capsaicin, as well as their relationship to the formation of heterocyclic amines (HAs) in roast beef patties were investigated using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) combined with principal component analysis (PCA). HAs including 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), 2-amino-1,6-dimethylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (DMIP), 2-amino-1,5,6-trimethylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (1,5,6-TMIP), 2-amino-3-methyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (IQx), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (4,8-DiMeIQx), 1-methyl-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole (harman) and 9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole (norharman) were detected and quantified in beef patties. Different levels of chilli pepper and capsaicin had different inhibitory profiles on HA formation, but had no significant (P>0.05) effect on the texture of the patties. Furthermore, all levels of chilli pepper and capsaicin reduced total HA and PhIP concentrations dose-dependently, with the highest inhibitions of 80% and 98% at 2mg of capsaicin. Moreover, capsaicin inhibited all HAs more than chilli pepper, implying that ingredients other than capsaicin in chilli pepper may promote the formation of HAs. These results could be useful for the reduction of HA, during food processing procedures, by spices  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3acapsaicin 3afood processing 3aheterocyclic amines 3ahot peppers 3aingredients 3apatties 3aprincipal component analysis 3apyridines 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atexture 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aUPLC-MS/MS 0aInhibitory profile 0aChilli pepper 0aCapsaicin 0aHeterocyclic amine 0aPrincipal component analysis1 aZhang, Mengru1 aHe, Zhiyong1 aQin, Fang1 aTao, Guanjun1 aZhang, Shuang1 aGao, Yahui1 aChen, Jie0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 221 p.404-411dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.10.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245020300205300001600408520150400424592002801928596003101956650001101987650001601998650002502014650001302039650002602052650001202078650000902090650001002099650001402109650000902123700006802132700005702200773012402257856008202381852000902463655001202472IND60701690220221121162538.0200713e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070169022DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-020-02146-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHawari, Israa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7413-559514aThe Role of Lead, Manganese, and Zinc in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) and Attention-Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): a Case-Control Study on Syrian Children Affected by the Syrian Crisis  ap. 107-114.  aAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are two developmental disorders that affect children worldwide, and are linked to both genetic and environmental factors. This study aims to investigate the levels of lead, manganese, and zinc in each of ASD, ADHD, and ASD with comorbid ADHD in Syrian children born or grown during the Syrian crisis. Lead and manganese were measured in the whole blood, and zinc was measured in the serum in 31 children with ASD, 29 children with ADHD, and 11 children with ASD with comorbid ADHD (ASD-C) compared with 30 healthy children, their ages ranged between 3 and 12 years. Blood lead levels were higher in the groups of ASD-C (245.42%), ASD (47.57%), and ADHD (14.19%) compared with control. Lead levels were significantly higher in children with ASD in the age of 5 or less compared with control, and they were also higher in the male ASD compared with females (P = 0.001). Blood manganese levels were lower in the groups of ASD-C (10.35%), ADHD (9.95%, P = 0.026), and ASD (9.64%, P = 0.046). However, serum zinc levels were within the reference range in all groups of study. Lead and manganese were positively correlated with each other (P = 0.01). Lead increase and manganese decrease may associate with the incidence of ASD, ADHD, or the co-occurrence of both of them together. Further studies are needed to examine the relationship between metal levels and the co-occurrence of ASD and ADHD together.  aPublisher supplied data  a200 $cDamascus university 3aautism 3ablood serum 3acase-control studies 3achildren 3aenvironmental factors 3afemales 3alead 3amales 3amanganese 3azinc1 aEskandar, Mohamad Bashar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9567-00361 aAlzeer, Samar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5119-32690 tBiological trace element research.g2020 Sept., v. 197, no. 1 p.107-114dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-020-02146-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001900161245009500180300001400275500000900289520126200298592002801560650001301588650001201601650001901613650001001632650001201642650001301654650002301667650001701690700002001707773014001727856009601867852000901963655001201972IND60668438920221119120827.0191125s1939    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066843892DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1939.036159950003000C0007x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoynton, Damon12aA Way of Sampling Soil Gases in Dense Subsoils, and some of Its Advantages and Limitations  ap. 37-42.  aepub  aSummary and ConclusionsAlthough it is being used successfully in light soils, the method described in this paper is particularly valuable for seasonal studies of the aeration of dense subsoils. Use of the sampling well makes it possible to obtain samples of gases when these subsoils are almost saturated with water and it is impossible to get samples by other methods. The fact that the sampling location remains the same eliminates soil heterogeneity as a possible reason for variations in analysis and increases the probable significance of small variations and minor trends. On the basis of the data presented it is concluded that samples taken after evacuation of 150 cc. are representative of the zone in which the sampling well is located. Although there seems to be a maximum possible increase of two units in carbon dioxide percentage due to a tension of 20 cm. of mercury, field studies indicate that in many instances, perhaps most of the time, the increase in carbon dioxide percentage due to tension is negligible. While it is possible to keep the samples of gas for as long as three days in wet bottles, usually without serious changes in percentages, occasional changes of considerable magnitude point to the desireability of prompt analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3abottles 3acarbon dioxide 3agases 3amercury 3asoil air 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil texture1 aReuther, Walter0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1939, v. 3, no.

The in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and transient reaction studies demonstrated that the Eley–Rideal mechanism (i.e., the reaction of adsorbed NH₃ species with gaseous NO) and the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism (i.e., the reaction of adsorbed NH₃ species with adsorbed NOₓ species) both contributed to N₂O formation. However, N₂O selectivity of NO reduction over Mn–Fe spinel through the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism was much less than that through the Eley–Rideal mechanism. The ratio of NO reduction over Mn–Fe spinel through the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism remarkably increased; therefore, N₂O selectivity of NO reduction over Mn–Fe spinel decreased with the decrease of the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV). As the gaseous NH₃ concentration increased, N₂O selectivity of NO reduction over Mn–Fe spinel increased because of the promotion of NO reduction through the Eley–Rideal mechanism. Meanwhile, N₂O selectivity of NO reduction over Mn–Fe spinel decreased with the increase of the gaseous NO concentration because the formation of NH on Mn–Fe spinel was restrained. Therefore, N₂O selectivity of NO reduction over Mn–Fe spinel was related to the GHSV and concentrations of reactants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aammonia 3anitric oxide 3anitrous oxide1 aXiong, Shangchao1 aLiao, Yong1 aXiao Xin,1 aQi, Feihong1 aPeng, Yue1 aFu, Yuwu1 aShan, Wenpo1 aLi, Junhua0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 Sept. 02, v. 48, no. 17 p.10354-10362dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes502585s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002300115245008300138300001400221500015000235500001500385520158700400592002801987650002302015650002402038650002602062650001102088650001602099651001002115653001702125773010702142852000902249939003302258946001302291655001202304991568418530742620221119191037.0181002e198701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aADL870418332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZIBILSKE, LARRY M.10aDynamics of nitrogen and carbon in soil during papermill sludge decomposition1  ap. 26-33.  aAffiliations: 1Contribution from the Dept. of Plant and Soil Sciences, Univ. of Maine, Orono, Maine 04469.

By the end of the incubation, extractable N levels were reduced from approximately 3 to 80% of the controls incubated at 12°C and from approximately 1 to 84% of the controls incubated at 25°C. A highly significant negative relationship between extractable N and sludge addition was determined at day 250. Statistical analyses indicated significant differences in the polynomial regression equations for each temperature. Total carbon mineralized was significantly increased with incremental sludge addition. Mineralized Carbon (as a percentage of added sludge C) ranged from approximately 7% in the 267-g/kg rate to approximately 24% in the 17-g/kg rate incubated at 12°C, and from 17% in the 267-g/kg rate to 65% in the 17-g/kg rate incubated at 25°C. Organic matter determined on day 250 indicated that the 133− and 267-g/kg rates significantly increased organic matter content at both incubation temperatures. Results suggest that, with proper management, papermill sludge could be useful in conservation of soil N and organic matter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3asoil organic matter 3apulp and paper sludge 3acarbon 3adegradation 3aMaine 0asoil biology0 tSoil science.g1987 Jan., v. 143, no. 1 p.26-33dWilliams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19870720c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02977naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002500155245011600180520149800296592002801794650001501822650001501837650003101852650001701883650000701900650001601907650001701923650001601940650001401956650001501970650002501985653001702010653001402027653001602041653001702057653002402074653002102098700001602119700002302135700002102158700002302179700002002202700002202222700001702244700001902261773009202280856009002372852000902462655001202471IND60778709920221116210603.0220628e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077870992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1351462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajendran, Saravanan12aA critical and recent developments on adsorption technique for removal of heavy metals from wastewater-A review  aThis review provides a quantitative description of the nano-adsorbent processing and its viability against wastewater detoxification by extracting heavy metal ions. The impact of nano-adsorbent functionalities on specific essential attributes such as the surface area, segregation, and adsorption capacity were comprehensively evaluated. A detailed analysis has been presented on the characteristics of nanomaterials through their limited resistance to adsorb some heavy metal ions. Experimental variables such as the adsorbent dosage, pH, substrate concentration, response duration, temperature, and electrostatic force that influence the uptake of metal ions have been studied. Besides, separate models for the adsorption kinetics and isothermal adsorption have been investigated to understand the mechanism behind adsorption. Here, we reviewed the different adsorbent materials with nano-based techniques for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater and especially highlighted the nano adsorption technique. The influencing factors such as pH, temperature, dosage time, sorbent dosage, adsorption capacities, ion concentration, and mechanisms related to the removal of heavy metals by nano composites are highlighted. Lastly, the application potentials and challenges of nano adsorption for environmental remediation are discussed. This critical review would benefit engineers, chemists, and environmental scientists involved in the utilization of nanomaterials for wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aheavy metals 3apH 3aremediation 3asurface area 3atemperature 3aviability 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aHeavy metals 0aPollution 0aRemediation 0aNanomaterial 0aAdsorption kinetics 0aAdsorption model1 aPriya, A.K.1 aKumar, P.

However, there are associated health risks from contaminant exposure. The aim of this paper was to use risk-benefit analysis methods to determine the best fish species for consumption. Composite samples consisting of 14 fish species were collected from major fishing villages in 2016 and measured for total mercury, arsenic, selenium, and omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA). Food frequency questionnaires were randomly distributed to 400 participants from different locations on the island. Participants were asked to identify the types of fish, portion size, and the frequency of consumption. An estimate of their weight was also recorded. Total mercury concentrations in fish samples ranged from 0.003 to 0.215 μg/g. The range of arsenic concentrations was 0.11 to 7.8 μg/g. The range of selenium concentrations was 0.302 μg/g to 1.08 μg/g. The mean omega-3 fatty acid concentration was 123.1 ± 93.6 mg/100 g. The fish consumption rates range from 3.2 to 1132.8 g/day. Cod fish was the most consumed species at 23.2 g/day. Four risk-benefit analysis methods were able to recommend four fish species that were best for consumption based on the levels of mercury, arsenic, selenium, and omega-3 fatty acids. They were doctorfish, parrotfish, snappers, and cod fish. The results of this study concluded that there was a low risk of mercury exposure from fish consumed in Jamaica.  aPublisher supplied data  aCSC\R1\170037cThe Royal Society 3aScaridae 3aarsenic 3acod (fish) 3aeconomic development 3afatty acid composition 3afish consumption 3afish industry 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood security 3afoodways 3amercury 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aportion size 3arisk 3arisk-benefit analysis 3aselenium 3asnapper 3avillages 3aJamaica1 aVoutchkov, Mitko1 aChan, Hing Man0 tBiological trace element research.g2020 Sept., v. 197, no. 1 p.262-270dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-019-01965-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245020100159300001800360520131900378592002801697650002601725650002101751650002601772650002401798650001301822650002301835650001201858650002001870650001301890650001501903650001901918650001201937650002401949650001801973650001701991650001902008650001702027650002002044653001302064653003802077653002402115653002602139700001802165700002202183700001802205700001802223700001702241700002102258700001702279700002602296700001702322773015402339856007802493852000902571655001202580IND60539589620221119205524.0190318e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053958962DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2015-94422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBudri, P.E.10aEffect of essential oils of Syzygium aromaticum and Cinnamomum zeylanicum and their major components on biofilm production in Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from milk of cows with mastitis  ap. 5899-5904.  aBovine mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary glands of cows and causes significant economic losses in dairy cattle. Staphylococcus aureus is one of the microorganisms most commonly isolated. Novel agents are required in agricultural industries to prevent the development of mastitis. The production of biofilm by Staph. aureus facilitates the adhesion of bacteria to solid surfaces and contributes to the transmission and maintenance of these bacteria. The effect of the essential oils of Syzygium aromaticum (clove; EOSA) and Cinnamomum zeylanicum (cinnamon; EOCZ) and their major components, eugenol and cinnamaldehyde, on Staph. aureus biofilm formation on different surfaces was investigated. The results showed a significant inhibition of biofilm production by EOSA on polystyrene and stainless steel surfaces (69.4 and 63.6%, respectively). However, its major component, eugenol, was less effective on polystyrene and stainless steel (52.8 and 19.6%, respectively). Both EOCZ and its major component, cinnamaldehyde, significantly reduced biofilm formation on polystyrene (74.7 and 69.6%, respectively) and on stainless steel surfaces (45.3 and 44.9%, respectively). These findings suggest that EOSA, EOCZ, and cinnamaldehyde may be considered for applications such as sanitization in the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCinnamomum aromaticum 3aCinnamomum verum 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aSyzygium aromaticum 3abacteria 3abacterial adhesion 3abiofilm 3abovine mastitis 3acinnamon 3adairy cows 3aessential oils 3aeugenol 3afinancial economics 3afood industry 3ainflammation 3amammary glands 3apolystyrenes 3astainless steel 0amastitis 0aantibiofilm Staphylococcus aureus 0aSyzygium aromaticum 0aCinnamomum zeylanicum1 aSilva, N.C.C.1 aBonsaglia, E.C.R.1 aFernandes, A.1 aAraújo, J.P.1 aDoyama, J.T.1 aGonçalves, J.L.1 aSantos, M.V.1 aFitzgerald-Hughes, D.1 aRall, V.L.M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2015 Sept., v. 98, no. 9 p.5899-5904dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-94423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01619naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245007300162300002000235520065100255592002800906650001500934650001600949650001600965650001700981650003000998700002401028700001901052700002601071773012501097856007401222852000901296655001201305IND60742129720221119210540.0210623e20210608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074212972DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra04099e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhilip, Rose Mary10aApplications of aryl-sulfinamides in the synthesis of N-heterocycles  ap. 20591-20600.  aEnantiopure aryl-sulfinamides are important chiral auxiliaries in the asymmetric synthesis of amines and their derivatives.

The immunosensor presented uses immunoreagents specifically developed for the broad recognition of the sulfonamide antibiotic family, a graphite composite electrode (GEC), biofunctionalized magnetic μ-particles and electrochemical nanoprobes prepared by labeling the specific antibodies with CdS nanoparticles (CdSNP). After the immunochemical reaction, the CdSNP are dissolved and the metal ions released are reduced at the electrode and read as in the form of current or charge signal, by the well-known anodic stripping technique. Due to the amplification effect on the amperometric/coulombimetric signal produced by the CdSNP, a high detectability can be reached. Thus, sulfapyridine (SPY), one of the most widely used sulfonamide congeners, can be detected in buffer with an IC50current of 0.20±0.25μgL−1. The immunosensor has been applied to the analysis of residues of this antibiotic in honey samples. Due to the reported formation of sulfonamide–sugar conjugates in this type of matrix, honey samples are first hydrolyzed in acidic media. The use of magnetic particles minimizes the matrix effect allowing to reach a detectability (LOD, limit of detection) of 0.11μgkg−1 (current measurements), far below the limits established in some countries for these types of residues in honey samples. Due to the use of magnetic racks, multiple samples can be run simultaneously. The whole analysis process can be performed in around 22min.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic residues 3aantibiotics 3aantibodies 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agraphene 3ahoney 3aimmunosensors 3ametal ions 3ananoparticles 3asulfapyridine 0aImmunosensor 0aCdS nanoparticles 0aElectrochemical nanoprobes 0aSulfonamide antibiotic residues 0aHoney 0aFood safety1 aMuriano, Alejandro1 aPividori, Isabel1 aSánchez-Baeza, Francisco1 aMarco, M.-P.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2013 May 15, v. 43 p.211-217dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2012.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01886naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245006300169300001600232520074300248592002800991650002101019650001101040650002501051650001001076650001801086650002301104650001101127650001701138650001401155653002101169653002301190653001501213653001701228653001301245700002001258700002701278773011101305856005101416852000901467655001201476IND50076503220221119173732.0140410e20130313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007650322DNAL7 a10.1080/87559129.2012.7515462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCilla, Antonio10aGlycosaminoglycans from Animal Tissue Foods and Gut Health  ap. 192-200.  aGlycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are a special group of carbohydrates with structures that clearly distinguishes them from glycoproteins, and exert biological effects beyond basic nutrition. The complex nature of cell-surface and GAG-related structures present in extracellular matrix has led to the neglect of this potential therapeutic site for a long time. Consideration about carbohydrates only as energy source has become reoriented because of their pivotal roles in many biological processes; however, scarce advances have been made on GAG characterization in foods. This review focuses on the potential consequences of dietary GAGs on human intestinal health, considering nutritional aspects and biological processes such as inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adigestive system 3aenergy 3aextracellular matrix 3afoods 3aglycoproteins 3aglycosaminoglycans 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3anutrition 0aFunctional foods 0aGlycosaminoglycans 0aGut health 0aInflammation 0aMinerals1 aOlivares, Marta1 aLaparra, José Moisés0 tFood reviews international.g2013 Mar. 13, v. 29, no. 2 p.192-200dTaylor & Francis Groupx1525-61037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/87559129.2012.751546  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245018200172300001600354520083200370592002801202650001901230650001501249650002301264650002601287650001501313650001501328650001401343650002601357650002601383650001501409650000901424650002901433650001601462650001001478653002201488653002601510653002201536653003101558653001801589653001301607700001201620700001301632773007701645856008901722852000901811655001201820IND60556741220221120074321.0161102e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055674122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.09.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Nannan10aWeather dependent dynamics of the herbicides florasulam, carfentrazone-ethyl, fluroxypyr-meptyl and fluroxypyr in wheat fields through field studies and computational simulation  ap. 320-328.  aA dynamic model of dynamiCROP was applied to study environmental fate and behavior of four herbicides in wheat including florasulam, carfentrazone-ethyl, fluroxypyr-meptyl, and fluroxypyr. Meantime, their residue in wheat and dissipation half-lives in plant determined by field trials using QuEChERS liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry were used to verify modelling results. The combination of experimental verification and modelling prediction deciphered the fate of four pesticides in wheat field ecosystem. Besides, temperature difference of 3 °C only resulted in lower than 15% half-life difference. By quantifying the contribution of temperature, the predominant role of rain on pesticide dissipation was highlighted for the first time, namely higher precipitation leaded to faster degradation and vice versa.  aPublisher supplied data 3adynamic models 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental fate 3afield experimentation 3aflorasulam 3afluroxypyr 3ahalf life 3aliquid chromatography 3apesticide persistence 3aprediction 3arain 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atemperature 3awheat 0aDynamic modelling 0aLiquid chromatography 0aMass spectrometry 0aPesticide residue analysis 0aPrecipitation 0aQuEChERS1 aCui, Yu1 aHu, Jiye0 tChemosphere.g2016 Dec., v. 165 p.320-328dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.09.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03449naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245013300161506002800294520166300322592002801985506003702013650002402050650002302074650002202097650001202119650002302131650002102154650002802175650001602203650002102219650002302240650001502263650001702278650001402295650001702309650002702326650001702353650001302370650001002383653001702393653001502410653001602425653002702441653001702468653002502485700002302510700001602533700001902549700002102568700001702589700001802606700001602624773012002640856007802760852000902838655001202847IND60775001620221207115803.0220330s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077500162DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha501125902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAGHA, Syed I.10aCharacterization of broad-spectrum biocontrol efficacy of Bacillus velezensis against Fusarium oxysporum in Triticum aestivum L.  aResource is Open Access  aFungi are the most important phytopathogens that cause yield losses. The mycotoxins released by fungi cause spoilage of stored food consumed by humans and feed supplied to animals. Fungi-antagonistic microbes are gaining attention as potential biocontrol agents (BCAs). This study was designed to isolate bacterial isolates from different crops and evaluate their in vitro antifungal assay against three phytopathogens, plant growth promoting (PGP) characteristics, molecular identification, and in vivo efficiency against the most devastating phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum Schltdl. In the in vitro experiment, the 3 isolates BA, GL-1, and 5a out of 360 isolates showed more than 60% inhibitory activity against the selected fungi in this study. On the basis of 16S rRNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, BA isolate was identified as Bacillus velezensis. All three isolates produced indole acetic acid (IAA), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), and cellulase enzymes, while the BA and GL-1 isolates also produced siderophores and the BA isolate also produced ammonia. BA was selected on basis of not only Biocontrol efficacy but also maximum PGPR activity compared to GL-1 and 5a. In vivo assay, the isolate BA showed a significant decrease in disease severity caused by Fusarium oxysporum by 64.97% after 100 days of inoculation on wheat (FD-08) seedlings in a greenhouse assay and enhanced the shoot root height, fresh and dry mass. The wide-ranging antagonistic action of Bacillus velezensis isolated from the phyllosphere of wheat crops showed promising fungicidal and plant growth-promoting capabilities, suggesting it can be used as a biofungicide.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus velezensis 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aTriticum aestivum 3aammonia 3abiological control 3adisease severity 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3agreenhouses 3ahydrogen cyanide 3aindole acetic acid 3amycotoxins 3aphyllosphere 3aphylogeny 3aplant growth 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3asiderophores 3aspoilage 3awheat 0aantagonistic 0aantifungal 0agreen house 0aplant growth promotion 0aphyllosphere 0aTriticum aestivum L.1 aNuṣrat Jahān̲,1 aAZEEM, Saba1 aPARVEEN, Samia1 aTABASSUM, Bushra1 aRAHEEM, Asif1 aUllah, Hamid,1 aKHAN, Anwar0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2022, v. 50, no. 1dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha501125903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03250naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245017600159300001800335500001500353520135800368592002801726650003401754650001301788650001301801650001501814650001401829650003001843650001101873650002401884650001601908650001201924650001601936650001501952650001601967650004501983650001102028650001102039650002502050650001402075650001302089650002202102650001802124650001502142650001502157650001302172650001702185653001402202653002702216653001202243653003102255653001702286653001402303700001902317700001802336700001702354773015402371856007802525852000902603655001202612IND60539589720221119205414.0190318e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053958972DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2015-94502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSah, B.N.P.10aEffect of refrigerated storage on probiotic viability and the production and stability of antimutagenic and antioxidant peptides in yogurt supplemented with pineapple peel  ap. 5905-5916.  a2019-12-06  aFruit by-products are good resources of carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, and minerals, which may function as growth nutrients for probiotic bacteria. This research aimed at evaluating effects of pineapple peel powder addition on the viability and activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus (ATCC 4356), Lactobacillus casei (ATCC393), and Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei (ATCC BAA52) in yogurts throughout storage at 4°C for 28d. Plain and probiotic yogurts supplemented with or without pineapple peel powder or inulin were prepared. The probiotic counts in supplemented yogurts at 28d of storage ranged from 7.68 and 8.03 log cfu/g, one log cycle higher compared with nonsupplemented control yogurt. Degree of proteolysis in synbiotic yogurts was significantly higher than plain yogurts and increased substantially during storage. Crude water-soluble peptide extract of the probiotic yogurt with peel possessed stronger antimutagenic and antioxidant activities [evaluated measuring reducing power and scavenging capacity of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl; 2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), and hydroxyl radicals] than control and maintained during storage. Pineapple peel, a by-product of juice production, could be proposed as a prebiotic ingredient in the manufacture of yogurts with enhanced nutrition, and functionality.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3apeptides 3avitamins 3aprebiotics 3anutrients 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3ajuices 3aLactobacillus casei 3aingredients 3apowders 3aproteolysis 3abyproducts 3afruit peels 3aLactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei 3ayogurt 3ainulin 3aantioxidant activity 3aviability 3aproteins 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amanufacturing 3aprobiotics 3apineapples 3aminerals 3acold storage 0aprobiotic 0aantioxidative activity 0apeptide 0aand antimutagenic activity 0aantioxidants 0apineapple1 aVasiljevic, T.1 aMcKechnie, S.1 aDonkor, O.N.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2015 Sept., v. 98, no. 9 p.5905-5916dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-94503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002100161245008800182300001600270500000900286520146400295592002801759650001301787650001501800650001501815650001401830650001301844650001301857650002301870650000901893650001301902650001401915650001001929650001601939650000701955650001201962650002401974650001401998650001302012650002002025650001102045650002202056651002802078651002302106700001502129700001402144773014802158856009602306852000902402655001202411IND60668439120221119120852.0191125e198607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066843912DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1986.03615995005000040031x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNettleton, W.

The soils have formed in colluvium derived from Darrington phyllite and an admixture of 1 to 30 dag tephra kg⁻¹. Four of the pedons form a climosequence on steep, south-facing slopes. The fifth is at the foot of the mountain, on an east-facing slope, and is more weathered than one would have predicted from its low elevation. The three pedons sampled above 700 m have horizons that meet the chemical criteria for Spodosols. These three, as well as the fourth of the climosequence, have silt-size pellets and cracked coatings. The fifth, at low elevation, has a horizon that meets both the chemical and morphological criteria for Spodosols. All of these pedons have one or more horizons that have the high NaF pH, high 15-bar to clay and CEC to clay ratios, and the smeary feel characteristic of horizons that contain amorphous material. However, unlike Andepts these pedons have E horizons that contain crystalline silicate clays, mostly smectite, have low NaF pH, and lack the smeary feel. Except for the fourth pedon of the climosequence, the pedons meet the humic acid color criteria recently proposed for Spodosols. Some of the B horizons have >2 dag kg⁻¹ of (NH₄)₂C₂O₄ extractable Al and ≥1.5 dag kg⁻¹ of 4 M KOH extractable Al, but are not thick enough for the soils to be placed in the proposed Andisols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndisols 3aB horizons 3aE horizons 3aSpodosols 3aaltitude 3aaluminum 3aammonium compounds 3aclay 3acoatings 3acolluvium 3acolor 3ahumic acids 3apH 3apellets 3apotassium hydroxide 3asilicates 3asmectite 3asodium fluoride 3atephra 3atopographic slope 3aCascade Mountain region 3aWashington (state)1 aGoldin, A.1 aEngel, R.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1986 July, v. 50, no. 4 p.987-992dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1986.03615995005000040031x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01586naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002600169245009000195300001600285500001500301520056200316592002800878650001800906650001200924650001300936650001500949650001100964651002100975653001000996700002301006773010501029856011701134852000901251655001201260IND60131434420221122064347.0151127e200212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013143442DNAL7 a10.1676/0043-5643(2002)114[0520:BONPIT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHAZLITT, STEPHANIE L.10aBlack oystercatcher natal philopatry in the queen charlotte islands, british columbia  ap. 520-522.  a2019-12-04  aVery little demographic data is available for rocky intertidal shorebirds, including the long-lived Black Oystercatcher (Haematopus bachmani).

The treatment with CGA could decrease significantly the levels of blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine in DN rats. Moreover, CGA significantly increased the activity of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase. Moreover, the level of lipid peroxidation malondialdehyde was reduced markedly after CGA administration. Immunohistochemical analysis also showed that CGA downregulated significantly cyclooxygenase-2 protein expression in renal tissue, which is considered as one of the major pathogeneses of oxidative stress. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CGA could block the expression of activating transcription factor-6, C/EBP homology protein and the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α and double stranded RNA-activated protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase.

Our data provided evidence to support this fact that CGA attenuated oxidative stress in streptozocin-induced DN rats.

Clogging of filtration membrane pores, called membrane fouling, is one of the most serious issues for the sustainable operation of AnMBR. Although the physical and chemical mechanisms of the membrane fouling have been widely studied, the biological mechanisms are still unclear. The biofilm formation and development on the membrane might cause the membrane fouling. In this study, the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbiomes of the membrane-attached biofilms in an AnMBR treating a model slurry of organic solid waste were investigated by non-destructive microscopy and high-throughput sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA genes. The non-destructive visualization indicated that the biofilm was layered with different structures. The lowermost residual fouling layer was mesh-like and composed of filamentous microorganisms, while the upper cake layer was mainly the non-dense and non-cell region. The principal coordinate and phylogenetic analyses of the sequence data showed that the biofilm microbiomes were different from the sludge. The lowermost layer consisted of operational taxonomic units that were related to Leptolinea tardivitalis and Methanosaeta concilii (9.53–10.07% and 1.14–1.64% of the total prokaryotes, respectively) and Geotrichum candidum (30.22–82.31% of the total eukaryotes), all of which exhibited the filamentous morphology. Moreover, the upper layer was inhabited by the presumably cake-degrading bacteria and predatory eukaryotes. The biofilm microbiome features were consistent with the microscope-visualized structure. These results demonstrated that the biofilm structure and microbiome were the layer specific, which provides better understanding of biological mechanisms of membrane fouling in the AnMBR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeotrichum candidum 3aMethanosaeta 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3aeukaryotic cells 3afiltration 3afouling 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amembrane bioreactors 3amicrobiome 3amicroscopy 3aphylogeny 3aprokaryotic cells 3aribosomal RNA 3asludge 3aslurries 3asolid wastes 0aBiofilm 0aMembrane fouling 0aMicrobiome 0aConfocal reflection microscopy 0aAnaerobic membrane bioreactor 0aOrganic solid waste1 aAoyagi, Tomo1 aHori, Tomoyuki1 aCharfi, Amine1 aSuh, Changwon1 aLee, Jong-Hoon,1 aSato, Yuya1 aOgata, Atsushi1 aAizawa, Hidenobu1 aHabe, Hiroshi0 tChemosphere.g2020 Sept., v. 254 p.126810-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1268103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01902naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245009000172300001400262506002800276520062300304592002800927506003700955650002000992650001201012650001001024650001601034650002001050650001201070650001201082653001301094653002501107653002201132700001501154700001601169700001601185773020501201856008901406852000901495655001201504IND60775001820221207115812.0180524e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077500182DNAL7 a10.17721/1728_2748.2016.71.77-812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUstjansky, O.10aRegulation of trypsin-like enzyme activity in the tissues of white rats with thiamine  ap. 77-81.  aResource is Open Access  aThe effect of intramuscular thiamine injection on the activity of trypsin-like enzymes in the liver, kidneys, stomach and small intestine of white rats has been researched.

However, as has frequently been mentioned in the scientific literature, quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the project benefits, if any, and their sustainability are hindered by the difficulty in assessing the responses of aquatic and riparian communities to the methods employed. A case study was conducted on a by‐passed section of the Upper Rhine River (France and Germany) to investigate the effects of instream flow increase and gravel augmentation on selected aquatic and riparian communities (macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, and riparian plants). This paper presents the results of a 6‐year interdisciplinary, before‐after control‐impact design monitoring study. The complexity of the study lies in carrying out a separate assessment of the cumulative effects on a site‐based, project‐specific basis. The results showed that (a) the instream flow increase resulted in greater richness of macrophyte species in the newly created backwaters, (b) the artificial gravel bar favoured the recruitment of pioneer species, including invasive species, although gravel redistribution by floods prevented their development, and (c) gravel augmentation tended to promote the taxonomic richness of macroinvertebrate communities with the appearance of species adapted to the new substrate areas. These findings should help to fill the knowledge gaps in large‐scale restoration and contribute key responses to the most frequently arising issues in this area, especially those concerning the efficiency and sustainability of river restoration projects.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3aecological restoration 3aengineering 3afloods 3agravel 3ainvasive species 3amacroinvertebrates 3amacrophytes 3amonitoring 3apioneer species 3arivers 3astream flow 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aRhine River1 aArnaud, F.1 aCombroux, I.1 aSchmitt, L.1 aTrémolières, M.1 aGrac, C.1 aPiégay, H.1 aBarillier, A.1 aChardon, V.1 aBeisel, J.‐N.0 tRiver research and applications.g2018 Feb., v. 34, no. 2 p.153-164dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938474x1535-14597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.32373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245011400163300001800277520192600295592002802221650001202249650002302261650002502284650001502309650001102324650001502335650001202350650001802362700002302380700002502403773009202428856007302520852000902593655001202602IND60519319720221119104846.0160426e20160515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051931972DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.107362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJarden, Kimberly M.10aAssessing the effects of catchment‐scale urban green infrastructure retrofits on hydrograph characteristics  ap. 1536-1550.  aRun‐off from impervious surfaces has pervasive and serious consequences for urban streams, but the detrimental effects of urban stormwater can be lessened by disconnecting impervious surfaces and redirecting run‐off to decentralized green infrastructure. This study used a before–after‐control‐impact design, in which streets served as subcatchments, to quantify hydrologic effectiveness of street‐scale investments in green infrastructure, such as street‐connected bioretention cells, rain gardens and rain barrels. On the two residential treatment streets, voluntary participation resulted in 32.2% and 13.5% of parcels having green infrastructure installed over a 2‐year period. Storm sewer discharge was measured before and after green infrastructure implementation, and peak discharge, total run‐off volume and hydrograph lags were analysed. On the street with smaller lots and lower participation, green infrastructure installation succeeded in reducing peak discharge by up to 33% and total storm run‐off by up to 40%. On the street with larger lots and higher participation, there was no significant reduction in peak or total stormflows, but on this street, contemporaneous street repairs may have offset improvements. On the street with smaller lots, lag times increased following the first phase of green infrastructure construction, in which streetside bioretention cells were built with underdrains. In the second phase, lag times did not change further, because bioretention cells were built without underdrains and water was removed from the system, rather than just delayed. We conclude that voluntary green infrastructure retrofits that include treatment of street run‐off can be effective for substantially reducing stormwater but that small differences in design and construction can be important for determining the level of the benefit.

An accurate study of the crystalline orientation of these systems has been accomplished by means of X-ray microdiffraction. While polymer residual film exhibits isotropic character, edge-on lamellae are formed upon approaching the polymer/membrane interface. This effect might be due to the elongational flow that takes place in the molten state as polymer chains infiltrate the AAO membrane. At the interface, edge-on and flat-on crystalline lamellae coexist as a consequence of the strong interaction between the polymer and the AAO surface. Inside the nanopores, the confined environment induces a kinetic selection of polymer crystals which only allows the growth of crystalline lamellae with its a-axis parallel to that of the pore. In the case of PTT/SWCNT nanocomposites, this effect, in conjunction with the strong interaction between polymer and AAO surface, seems to prevail over the templating effect of the carbon nanotubes and a similar orientation to that of the neat PTT case is observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aaluminum oxide 3acarbon nanotubes 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3ananocomposites 3ananopores 3ananorods 3apolymers 0apolymer crystallization 0amelt wetting 0aconfinement 0ananocomposites 0asynchrotron radiation 0apoly(trimethylene terephthalate)1 aGarcía-Gutiérrez, Mari-Cruz1 aRueda, Daniel R.1 aLinares, Amelia1 aHernández, Jaime J.1 aEzquerra, Tiberio A.1 aReynolds, Michael0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2013 June 12, v. 5, no. 11 p.5324-5329dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam401194p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245010900164520165800273592002801931650002401959650001201983650002101995650001402016650001302030650002002043650000902063650001402072650001102086650002602097650002002123650002102143650001902164650001002183650001902193650001702212653002002229653002102249653002402270653003002294700001302324700001902337700001802356700001602374700001402390700001602404773012102420856008502541852000902626655001202635IND60674183920221118143750.0191220e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067418392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2019.1134102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Rong10aCadmium absorption and translocation of amaranth (Amaranthus mangostanus L.) affected by iron deficiency  aAmaranth (Amaranthus mangostanus L.) has superior capability for accumulating cadmium (Cd) and has the potential to be used for phytoremediation of Cd contaminated soils. Iron (Fe) is chemically similar to Cd and may mediate Cd-induced physiological or metabolic impacts in plants. The purpose was to investigate the model of time-dependent and concentration-dependent kinetics of Cd absorption under Fe deficiency, understanding the physiological mechanism of Cd absorption in amaranth roots. The kinetic characteristics of Cd uptake by amaranth grown in Cd enriched nutritional solution with or without Fe addition and with methanol-chloroform, carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), and lanthanum chloride (LaCl3) were compared using 109Cd2+ isotope labeling technique. The results showed that Cd uptake was time-dependent and about 90–93% of uptake occurred during the first 150 min. The kinetics of Cd uptake showed that two stages were involved. The saturation stage fitted the Michaelis-Menten model when concentrations of Cd were lower than 12.71 μmol/L and then the absorption of Cd by roots was increased linearly during the second stage. Only linear absorption was observed with methanol-chloroform treatment while the metabolic inhibitor CCCP inhibited only the saturation absorption process, and the Ca channel inhibitor LaCl3 partially inhibited the two stages of absorption. These results indicated that the root absorption of 109Cd2+ was enhanced under Fe deficiency which induced more Fe transporters in the root cell membrane, and the Ca channel, apoplastic and symplastic pathways enhanced the Cd absorption in roots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus tricolor 3acadmium 3acalcium channels 3achlorides 3acyanides 3aenzyme kinetics 3airon 3alanthanum 3amodels 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrient uptake 3aphytoremediation 3apolluted soils 3aroots 3asoil pollution 3atransporters 0aCadmium isotope 0aIron transporter 0aMetabolic inhibitor 0aCalcium channel inhibitor1 aWang, Li1 aLi, Yuncong C.1 aTong, Zhaohui1 aHuo, Wenmin1 aChi, Keyu1 aFan, Hongli0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Jan., v. 256 p.113410-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.1134103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100001800185245013200203300001400335520126700349592002801616650001201644650001901656650001701675650001201692650001601704650001201720650001701732650001101749650001301760650002201773650000701795650002001802650002601822650001701848650001301865650000901878650001901887650002001906650001401926650001601940700001901956700002101975700002201996700002402018700001902042700002102061700002102082700002102103773010702124856008102231852000902312655001202321IND60555579920221122180658.0170725e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055557992DNAL7 a10.1007/s13199-016-0396-92doi7 a10.1007/s13199-016-0396-92chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgom, Mariama10aTolerance to environmental stress by the nitrogen-fixing actinobacterium Frankia and its role in actinorhizal plants adaptation  ap. 17-29.  aEnvironmental stresses are caused by human activities or natural events. Several of them including salinity, heavy metals, and extreme temperature affect both soil characteristics and plant growth and productivity. Actinorhizal plants are pioneer species that are able to grow in poor soils and improve soil fertility. They are widely used in agroforestry for different purposes including reclamation of degraded and contaminated lands. This capacity is mainly due to the plants forming a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with actinobacteria known as Frankia. In comparison to uninoculated plants, plants in symbiosis with Frankia have significantly improved plant growth, total biomass, and nitrogen and chlorophyll content which enhance the development of actinorhizal plants and their resistance to abiotic stresses. However, to optimize the adaptation of actinorhizal species to different environments, selection of both symbiotic partners is necessary. Frankia strains vary in their sensitivity and response to stress including salinity, heavy metals, extreme pH and drought. In this paper, we review the response of different Frankia strains to environmental stresses and their role that they play in the adaptation of actinorhizal plants to stressful conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrankia 3aabiotic stress 3aagroforestry 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3adrought 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3apH 3apioneer species 3aplant characteristics 3aplant growth 3asalinity 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3astress response 3asymbiosis 3atemperature1 aOshone, Rediet1 aDiagne, Nathalie1 aCissoko, Maimouna1 aSvistoonoff, Sergio1 aTisa, Louis S.1 aLaplaze, Laurent1 aSy, Mame Ourèye1 aChampion, Antony0 tSymbiosis.g2016 June, v. 70, no. 1-3 p.17-29dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl40712x0334-51147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-016-0396-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001400138245012600152300001600278500002000294520113300314592002801447650002401475650001201499650001801511650001501529650001601544650001401560650002501574650001001599651001001609651001101619651001801630700001801648700001801666773012901684856007201813852000901885655001201894IND60648196820221121230742.0190627e20150319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064819682DNAL7 a10.3390/f60308092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jun10aChina’s National Monitoring Program on Ecological Functions of Forests: An Analysis of the Protocol and Initial Results  ap. 809-826.  aJournal Article  aInformation on the ecological functions of forests is important for sustainable forest management. In this study, we introduced the national monitoring program which has been used in China to evaluate the overall health status and ecological functions of forests. We also compared it to similar monitoring programs operating in Europe and the United States of America. We revealed the strength and drawbacks of China’s monitoring program by analyzing the initial evaluation results. Our analysis showed that among the three programs, the European program gives the most detailed measurements of conditions of forests while the U.S. program generates the most detailed information on individual trees. In comparison, China’s monitoring program has a higher spatial resolution but is narrowly focused on trees and uses coarse classifications of indicators. The health status of forests in China suggested that more resources should be invested to improve the health of existing forests, especially plantations. The limitations in China’s monitoring program need to be addressed to improve the accuracy of future assessments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological function 3aforests 3ahealth status 3amonitoring 3aplantations 3aprotocols 3asustainable forestry 3atrees 3aChina 3aEurope 3aUnited States1 aDai, Guanghui1 aWang, Shurong0 tForests.g2015 Mar. 19, v. 6, no. 3 p.809-826dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f60308093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011700172300001600289500001500305520092500320592002801245650002501273650001101298650002001309650001201329650001801341650002401359650002601383650002101409650001601430653002001446653002001466653002501486653002901511653001301540653002501553700001901578700001801597773010401615856005101719852000901770655001201779IND50076503620221119174147.0140410e20130703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007650362DNAL7 a10.1080/87559129.2013.7900472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Nhat Minh12aA Review on the Phytochemical Composition and Potential Medicinal Uses of Horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) Root  ap. 261-275.  a2019-12-05  aThe current review focuses on a plant with a wide spectrum of potential uses, Armoracia rusticana (syn.

However, owing to side effects and the emergence of resistant virus strains, the use of currently available anti-influenza drugs may be limited. In order to identify novel anti-influenza drugs, we investigated the antiviral effects of phillyrin against influenza A virus infection in vivo. The mean survival time, lung index, viral titers, influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein and serum cytokines levels, and histopathological changes in lung tissue were examined. Administration of phillyrin at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day for 3 days significantly prolonged the mean survival time, reduced the lung index, decreased the virus titers and interleukin-6 levels, reduced the expression of HA, and attenuated lung tissue damage in mice infected with influenza A virus. Taken together, these data showed that phillyrin had potential protective effects against infection caused by influenza A virus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aadverse effects 3aantiviral agents 3aantiviral properties 3ablood proteins 3ahemagglutinins 3ahistopathology 3ainfluenza 3ainterleukin-6 3alungs 3amice 3aprotective effect 3apublic health 3aviral load 3aviruses1 aLi, Qing-jun1 aZhang, Hui-min1 aZhang, Xiao-juan1 aShi, Peng-hui1 aZhang, Xiu-juan1 aYang, Jing1 aZhou, Zhe1 aWang, Sheng-qi0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2016 July, v. 39, no. 7 p.998-1005dPharmaceutical Society of Koreax0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12272-016-0775-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245011200155300001600267500002000283520166100303592002801964650002401992650002302016650002702039650002102066650002002087650001202107650002302119650002302142650001302165650001102178650001302189650001002202700001502212700001802227700001902245700001902264700001702283773013302300856007202433852000902505655001202514IND60589275820221118004609.0180210e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058927582DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.32322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmaral, S.D.10aTo swim or to jump? Passage behaviour of a potamodromous cyprinid over an experimental broad‐crested weir  ap. 174-182.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPhysical stressors, such as man‐made obstacles, are considered one of the main causes that negatively affect freshwater fish. Even small weirs may impact fish populations, including potamodromous cyprinids, by partially or totally blocking upstream migratory movements. Some studies have addressed the effect of key hydraulic parameters on upstream movements past small weirs, but little is known on how these parameters interact to induce swimming or jumping behaviour in negotiating such obstacles. This study aims to evaluate the passage behaviour (swimming vs. jumping) of Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus bocagei), a potamodromous species, over an experimental small broad‐crested weir, considering the effect of different plunge pool depths (D), waterfall heights (H), and weir discharges (Q). Results revealed that passage behaviour was highly dependent on combinations of plunge pool depths and waterfall heights. Barbel navigated most configurations by swimming (overall outcomes: 81.5% swimming vs. 18.5% jumping), except the ones with the higher waterfall heights (25 cm) tested. Therefore, higher waterfalls proved to be preponderant in the switching of passage behaviour from swimming to jumping. Regarding the discharge over the 1‐m‐wide weir (overall outcomes: 85% swimming vs. 15% jumping), contrary to what was expected, there was no evidence that passage behaviour was discharge‐related, for the range of discharges tested (25–100 L/s). These results are useful to identify potential migration obstacles and should be taken into consideration in river restoration projects and when designing fishways for potamodromous cyprinids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLuciobarbus bocagei 3aLuciobarbus comizo 3aecological restoration 3afish communities 3afreshwater fish 3ajumping 3amigratory behavior 3apotamodromous fish 3araceways 3arivers 3aswimming 3aweirs1 aBranco, P.1 aKatopodis, C.1 aFerreira, M.T.1 aPinheiro, A.N.1 aSantos, J.M.0 tRiver research and applications.g2018 Feb., v. 34, no. 2 p.174-182dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938474x1535-14597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.32323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245012900176300001400305520144300319592002801762650001501790650000901805650001701814650001901831650001301850650001001863650002201873650002101895650001701916650001801933650002201951650001501973650001501988700002102003773012102024856008902145852000902234655001202243IND60630865020221119203952.0190214e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063086502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2016.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorcelli, Angela10aCardiolipin as key lipid of mitochondria in health and disease. 2nd Edition, Florence, Italy, September 30–October 1, 2015  ap. 10-12.  aThe second edition of the workshop dedicated to cardiolipin, the signature lipid of mitochondria, was held as a satellite meeting of the 13th Euro Fed Lipid international congress in Florence, Italy, at the end of September 2015. During the workshop various aspects of basic cardiolipin functions in biomembranes of prokaryotes and animal cells were discussed, highlighting connections between cardiolipin research and human physiology in particular. Alteration of the cardiolipin species pattern and a parallel increase of monolysocardiolipin is the hallmark of Barth syndrome, an X linked genetic disease. Furthermore literature reports suggest the involvement of cardiolipin in other pathologies associated with an imbalance in bioenergetic functions, such as diabetes. The Cardiolipin Workshop was a low budget meeting sponsored by the University of Bari Aldo Moro and the Barth Syndrome Foundation. The organizers are grateful to the invited speakers, poster presenters and chairpersons as they supported the meeting by sustaining their travel and lodging expenses. Before the starting of the scientific sessions, the families of Italian boys affected by Barth syndrome (recently affiliated with the Barth Syndrome Foundation, USA) could meet scientists, biologists and pediatricians involved in research, diagnosis and cure of the disease. The family meeting was chaired by Daniela Toniolo, who discovered the tafazzin gene in 1997.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiologists 3aboys 3acardiolipins 3acell membranes 3adiabetes 3agenes 3agenetic disorders 3ahuman physiology 3amitochondria 3apediatricians 3aprokaryotic cells 3asatellites 3ascientists1 aSchlame, Michael0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2016 June, v. 198 p.10-12dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl20199x0009-30847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2016.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245015600174520101200330592002801342650001101370650001401381650001501395650001201410650001801422650001901440650001101459650001901470650001501489650002201504650003001526650001501556650001301571650002501584650001001609650002101619650002501640653000901665653002601674653002001700653002201720653001501742700001701757700001701774700001401791700001301805700001501818700001701833700001901850700001701869700001701886700001201903773009201915856009002007852000902097655001202106IND60688991720221122131523.0201125e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068899172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1268132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Shenglei10aPhotocatalytic properties, mechanical strength and durability of TiO2/cement composites prepared by a spraying method for removal of organic pollutants  aTiO₂/cement composites were prepared by a spraying method to degrade organic pollutants.

The TiO₂/cement mortars had good mechanical strengths, meeting the mechanical demands of wastewater treatment tanks. In durability, the TiO₂/cement mortars had better water penetration resistance, chloride penetration resistance and anti-carbonation than pure cement mortars.  aPublisher supplied data 3acement 3achlorides 3adurability 3aliquids 3amethyl orange 3amethylene blue 3apastes 3aphotocatalysis 3apollutants 3apollution control 3aresistance to penetration 3arhodamines 3aspraying 3astrength (mechanics) 3atanks 3atitanium dioxide 3awastewater treatment 0aTiO2 0aPhotocatalytic cement 0aSpraying method 0aOrganic pollutant 0aDurability1 aSong, Junwei1 aLiu, Fanghua1 aFu, Xiang1 aGuo, Hui1 aZhu, Jielu1 aZeng, Qingli1 aPeng, Xiaoying1 aWang, Xinfei1 aOuyang, Yong1 aLi, Fei0 tChemosphere.g2020 Sept., v. 254 p.126813-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1268133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02295naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245011900163300001400282520120600296592002801502650001101530650002701541650002301568650001801591650002701609650001801636650001501654650000901669650001901678650001801697700001801715700001901733700002001752773009201772856004801864852000901912655001201921IND4485413720221120173313.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448541372DNAL7 a10.1007/s10164-011-0285-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkuno, Masaki10aPlasticity of grooming behavior against entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae in the ant Lasius japonicus  ap. 23-27.  aSocial insects employ many types of defense mechanisms against parasites and pathogens because they face high risks from infections due to crowded living conditions with closely related nestmates. Grooming behavior, including self-grooming and allogrooming, can remove fungal spores on the cuticles of social insects and may be a behavioral defense mechanism to improve survivorship. Allogrooming between nestmates has been predicted to be especially important as a defense against ectoparasites. However, little is known about the plasticity of grooming behavior in susceptible environments. Here, we show that the ant Lasius japonicus increases the frequency of allogrooming rather than self-grooming to improve survivorship against the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae. We found that increasing fungal dosage and ant group size influenced the plasticity of grooming behavior. Additionally, the survival rate of the ants over 30Â days improved with increased group size. Our results suggest that social insects opt for altruistic behavior to prevent the spread of diseases. This study illustrates how ants maintain colonies through grooming behavior in the presence of fungal spores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLasius 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3adefense mechanisms 3aectoparasites 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3afungal spores 3agroup size 3arisk 3asocial insects 3asurvival rate1 aTsuji, Kazuki1 aSatō, Hiroki,1 aFujisaki, Kenji0 tJournal of ethology.g2012 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.23-27dSpringer-Verlagx0289-07717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10164-011-0285-x  aDNAL 7aarticle01746naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245006100179300001600240520069100256592002800947650001700975650001600992650001101008650000901019650001601028653001601044653001001060653001601070653002701086653002701113700002101140700001901161700002801180773010401208856005101312852000901363655001201372IND50076503820221119173949.0140410e20130703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007650382DNAL7 a10.1080/87559129.2013.7900492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCandrawinata, Vincent I.10aFrom Apple to Juice—The Fate of Polyphenolic Compounds  ap. 276-293.  aApples are a rich source of polyphenolic compounds and significantly contribute to the antioxidants in our diet.

Ninety-six sediment samples were taken in the rainy and dry season on 13 sampling sites, distributed over the lower reaches of the River, to analyze for exchangeable concentration of 11 heavy metals and metalloid (Al, B, Cd, Co, Fe, In, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, and Zn), pH, EC, organic carbon content, and particle-size distribution. Generally, the concentration of 11 elements was ranked in the order Mn > Al > Fe > Zn > Sr > In > B > Ni > Co > Pb > Cd. Hierarchical cluster analysis grouped 13 sampling sites into two parts based on the similar concentration of the 11 elements. Three-way analysis of variance showed that the total exchangeable concentration of 11 elements was significantly higher in the rainy season than in the dry season and in the upper part than in the lower part of the river. Principal component analysis/factor analysis and correlation analysis revealed that three pollution sources (PS) may contribute to enriching the 11 examined elements in the sediment. These sources included (PS1) from catchment through water erosion over natural areas, explaining 83%, (PS2) mixed sources from catchment through water erosion over agricultural fields and inside Ho Chi Minh City, accounting for 6%, and (PS3) mixed sources from lowland areas, explaining 7.8% of the total variance of the elements. In brief, the sediment concentration of 11 metals and metalloid varied with season and space and three major pollution sources from river catchment, inside Ho Chi Minh City, and lowland contributively enriched the elements in the sediment of the River.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aanalysis of variance 3aboron 3acadmium 3acluster analysis 3acobalt 3adry season 3aelectrical conductivity 3afactor analysis 3aheavy metals 3aindium 3airon 3alead 3alowlands 3amanganese 3anickel 3aorganic carbon 3apH 3aparticle size distribution 3apollution 3aprincipal component analysis 3arivers 3asediments 3astrontium 3avariance 3awater erosion 3awatersheds 3awet season 3azinc 3aVietnam 0aSediment 0aSeasonal variation 0aPollution sources 0aSaigon river1 aDo, Dung Doan1 aNguyen, Tong Xuan1 aNguyen, Vinh Ngoc1 aPhuc Nguyen, Duong Thuy1 aNguyen, My Hoang1 aThi Truong, Huong Thu1 aDong, Hao Phu1 aLe, Anh Hung1 aBach, Quang-Vu0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Jan., v. 256 p.113412-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.1134123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245014700166300001400313520134700327592002801674650004401702650001301746650001401759650002101773650001301794650002101807650002101828650001801849650001901867650001801886650002001904650001901924650002101943653002301964653001401987653001302001653001702014653002002031700002102051700001802072700002002090773011702110856008002227852000902307655001202316IND60616760120221121010149.0181020e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061676012DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175080904992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Chang-Jung13aAn Improvement on Water Retaining and Agent Distribution of PET Non-woven Fabrics Treated with the Low Molecular Weight Polyurethane Solutions  ap. 59-68.  aIn this study, diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI), 2,2-bis(hydroxymethy)-propionic acid (DMPA), and polytetramethyleneglycol (PTMG) were employed to polymerize the low molecular weight polyurethane (LMWPU). The mole ratios for the LMWPUs were 4.0:1.5:0.5, 4.0:1.0:1.0, and 4.0:0.5:1.5, respectively. The three LMWPUs were dissolved in lithium chloride/tetrahydrofuran (UCV THF) to prepare the finishing solutions. The water retaining values of the treated non-woven fabrics with the solutions increased by the increase of the component of the PTMG contained in LMWPU. This higher content of PTMG in LMWPU resulted in a lower add-on value and a lower degree of the blocking deposited in the gaps among fibers. Both of these could significantly improve the water retaining property. The water retaining values for the LMWPU solutions were dramatically higher than those for commercial water soluble polyurethane and LMWPU emulsions. The functional groups of LMWPU were confirmed with the analyses of the spectra of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The average molecular weights of the three LMMTUs ranged from 2000 to 3800 g/mole and the average particle sizes ranged from 140 to 1140 nm. The degree of polymer crystals obtained from LMWPU solutions is lower, which could also significantly improve the water retaining property.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acrystals 3aemulsions 3alithium chloride 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3anonwoven fabrics 3aparticle size 3apolymerization 3apolyurethanes 3atetrahydrofuran 3atextile fibers 3awater solubility 0aagent distribution 0aamorphous 0anonwoven 0apolyurethane 0awater retaining1 aSuen, Maw-Cherng1 aChen, Hung-En1 aChen, Cheng-Chi0 tTextile research journal.g2009 Jan., v. 79, no. 1 p.59-68dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175080904993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009900165300001600264520169000280592002801970650002001998650001102018650001202029650001802041650001402059650003002073650001102103650001402114650001702128650000902145650001102154650002302165650001102188651002102199653002302220653001802243653002702261653002302288700001802311700002102329700001802350773010402368856008502472852000902557655001202566IND60609253520221119210352.0181207e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060925352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2017.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyomi10aAssessment of temporal variation for the risk of particulate matters on asthma hospitalization  ap. 542-550.  aIncreased ambient concentration of particulate matters are considered as one of major causes for increased prevalence or exacerbation of asthma or asthma like symptoms. Recently, possible temporal variation in risks of PM on mortality has been suggested.We investigated short-term effect of both PM10 and PM2.5 on asthma hospitalization, and assessed temporal variation of PM risks in Seoul, Korea, 2003–2011.Generalized additive model was used to estimate PM risks on asthma hospitalization with consideration by long-term trend, influenza epidemic, day of week, meteorological factors. To assess temporal variation of PM risks, year-round PM risks were estimated. Stratified analysis by season and age-group were also conducted.Estimated RRs of PM on asthma hospitalization by an increase of 10㎍/㎥were 1.0084 (95% CI: 1.0041–1.0127) and 1.0156 (95% CI: 1.0055–1.0259) respectively with 7-days lag periods (lag06). PM2.5 had stronger effect than PM10 for all age group. Elderly group was most affected by PM. For the analysis of temporal variation of PM risks, we found increasing trend in total population and the elderly group. In the season-specific analysis, we also found increasing trend in winter for PM10, and in spring for PM2.5.PM10 and PM2.5 has adverse effect on asthma hospitalization with evidence suggesting temporal variation in PM risks. Further research will be needed to confirm the temporal variation of PM risk on asthma hospitalization, and to identify casual factors affecting this temporal variation. This study results could be evidentiary materials for establishing valid public health policies to reduce health burden or economic burden of asthma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aasthma 3aelderly 3ahealth policy 3ainfluenza 3ameteorological parameters 3amodels 3amortality 3aparticulates 3arisk 3aspring 3atemporal variation 3awinter 3aKorean Peninsula 0aParticulate matter 0aFine particle 0aAsthma hospitalization 0aTemporal variation1 aKim, Honghyok1 aPark, Yoon-hyung1 aLee, Jong-Tae0 tEnvironmental research.g2017 July, v. 156 p.542-550dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02346naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245009500187300001400282520097300296592002801269650001801297650001001315650001301325650001001338650001001348650001801358650002201376650001601398650002501414650001701439650000901456650001201465650001701477653001601494653001401510653001601524653002201540700001901562700001901581700002201600700001701622773013401639856008201773852000901855655001201864IND60516203520221123023102.0190726e20120114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051620352DNAL7 a217333332pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145110026742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSomekawa, Shinji10aDietary free glutamate prevents diarrhoea during intra-gastric tube feeding in a rat model  ap. 20-23.  aRecent studies indicate that l-glutamate (l-Glu), abundant in many foods, is a stimulator of gastric vagal afferent nerves. The aim of the present study was to examine the possibility that l-Glu supplementation of a protein-rich liquid diet may prevent the incidence of diarrhoea during repetitive intra-gastric tube feeding. The gastric vagal afferent nerve recording of rats indicated that intra-gastric administration of a protein-rich liquid diet supplemented with 0·5 % monosodium glutamate enhanced the basal afferent activities seen with the protein-rich diet alone. The examination of the faeces showed that the addition of monosodium glutamate to the liquid diet significantly prevented the incidence of diarrhoea induced by repetitive gastric feeding. In conclusion, supplementation of an enteral liquid diet with free l-Glu may ameliorate diarrhoea during intra-gastric tube feeding by sending visceral glutamate information from the stomach to the brain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3abrain 3adiarrhea 3afeces 3afoods 3aglutamic acid 3ahigh protein diet 3aliquid diet 3amonosodium glutamate 3anerve tissue 3arats 3astomach 3atube feeding 0al-Glutamate 0aDiarrhoea 0aVagal nerve 0aEnteral nutrition1 aHayashi, Naoki1 aNiijima, Akira1 aUneyama, Hisayuki1 aTorii, Kunio0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2012 Jan. 14, v. 107, no. 1 p.20-23dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145110026743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012700165300001800292520168300310592002801993650001202021650001202033650002102045650001302066650001602079650001102095650001102106650002102117650001502138651001002153700001702163700001702180700001502197700002002212773010302232856008102335852000902416655001202425IND60158265220221121094653.0150530e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6015826522DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-015-0997-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Ziqiang10aSpatial Characterization and Bivariate Frequency Analysis of Precipitation and Runoff in the Upper Huai River Basin, China  ap. 3291-3304.  aThe variability of the relationship between precipitation and runoff is of vital importance to study the characteristics of regional water cycle and water resource management and planning. In this study, in order to explore the relationship between precipitation and runoff of the different hydrological patterns, the analysis of bivariate precipitation and runoff distributions and the simultaneous occurrence probability was analyzed by employing the Archimedean copula, based on the monthly runoff and precipitation data during 1960 ~ 2000 in the upper Huai river basin, China. The results indicated that: (I) the study region could be classified into four hydrological patterns, namely the Huai river valley zone, Huaibei plain zone, Huainan mountain zone and Huaibei mountain zone, with Xixian, Zhuanqiao, Meishan and Zhaopingtai as the maximal loading subbasin respectively. (II) There were positive dependence structure between precipitation and runoff in the study area, and the bivariate frequency distributions could be fitted best by the Gumbel-Hougaard copula. (III) The simultaneous occurrence probability of bivariate drought events was remarkable higher than that of corresponding classification of bivariate flood events; besides, the simultaneous occurrence probability of bivariate extreme events was maximum in the Huainan mountain zone, followed by the Huai river valley zone and Huaibei mountain zone, while that was minimum in the Huaibei plain zone. These results would be of essential guiding significance for water resource management and planning, flood and drought control and layout optimization of water conservancy projects in the study region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeishan 3adrought 3ahydrologic cycle 3aplanning 3aprobability 3arivers 3arunoff 3awater management 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aYan, Denghua1 aZhang, Cheng1 aWang, Gang1 aZhang, Dongdong0 tWater resources management.g2015 July, v. 29, no. 9 p.3291-3304dSpringer-Verlagx0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-015-0997-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03573naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245006600163300001600229520176300245592002802008650001702036650001902053650002302072650002202095650001402117650003902131650001002170650001602180650001302196650001102209650003002220650003502250650001202285650001402297653000902311653000802320653000802328653000802336653001102344653000902355653001102364653000802375653000902383653000902392653000702401653000802408653001302416653002302429653002702452653002202479653001602501700001302517700001602530700001902546700001702565700001702582700001802599700001602617700001302633700001402646700001602660773009502676856008302771852000902854655001202863IND60530143720221119152434.0180830e20160310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053014372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2015.12.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Fuhua10aARHGAP4 mutated in a Chinese intellectually challenged family  ap. 205-209.  aMental retardation is characterized by lower intelligence compared to the average intelligence of persons the same age. These patients have low adaptive capacity acquired by society. The genetic factors of causing MR include monogenic disease, chromosome structural aberration, and chromosome number aberration and so on. We explored the cause of a Chinese family suffering from mental retardation.We used karyotyping technology to determine the karyotype of the proband, and we used FISH to verify the result of the karyotyping. We used whole-exome sequencing to identify the disease-causing gene and used Sanger sequencing to verify the result of whole-exome sequencing to assess the family's gene expression.The G-banding of the karyotype revealed that the patient's karyotype is 46, XY. FISH revealed that the patient does not have a trisomy syndrome. The karyotype of the proband is normal. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified 108,767 variants in the exome gene of the patient, including 101,787 SNPs and 6980 InDels. Combining clinical information and bioinformatics analysis, including databases filtering and SIFT analysis, we found ARHGAP4 in X chromosome was candidate MR disease-causing gene. PCR and Sanger sequencing results were consistent with whole-exome sequencing. ARHGAP4 (T491M) mutation was present in the genome of the proband and his mother is a carrier, while his father, sister, and brother do not carry this mutation.According to clinical information, whole-exome sequencing results and Sanger verification results, ARHGAP4 (T491M) mutation may be disease-causing gene of the MR patient. The relation between ARHGAP4 mutation and MR clinical characteristic is needed to be illuminated with participation of more MR patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX chromosome 3abioinformatics 3achromosome banding 3achromosome number 3adatabases 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenes 3akaryotyping 3apatients 3apeople 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asociety 3atrisomics 0aXLMR 0aEEG 0aMRI 0aPHA 0aLM-PCR 0aSNPs 0aInDels 0aBWA 0aSIFT 0aFISH 0aIQ 0aNDI 0aX-linked 0aMental retardation 0aWhole-exome sequencing 0aSanger sequencing 0aKaryotyping1 aGuo, Hui1 aOu, Minglin1 aHou, Xianliang1 aSun, Guoping1 aGong, Weiwei1 aJing, Huanyun1 aTan, Qiupei1 aXue, Wen1 aDai, Yong1 aSui, Weiguo0 tGene.g2016 Mar. 10, v. 578, no. 2 p.205-209dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2015.12.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245018300172300001600355520133300371592002801704650001901732650001801751650001101769650001201780650002901792650001101821650002601832650001701858650002401875650001301899650001701912650001301929653002501942653004001967653001902007653005102026700002202077700001902099700002802118700001902146700001802165700002002183700002002203700002402223700002702247700002202274773010402296856008502400852000902485655001202494IND60609253720221119210331.0181207e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060925372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2017.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoppa, Vanessa J.10aArterial blood pressure responses to short-term exposure to fine and ultrafine particles from indoor sources – A randomized sham-controlled exposure study of healthy volunteers  ap. 225-232.  aParticulate air pollution is linked to adverse cardiovascular effects. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of short-term exposure to indoor particles on blood pressure (BP).We analyzed the association of particle emissions from indoor sources (candle burning, toasting bread, frying sausages) with BP changes in 54 healthy volunteers in a randomized cross-over controlled exposure study. Particle mass concentration (PMC), size-specific particle number concentration (PNC) and lung-deposited particle surface area concentration (PSC) were measured during the 2h exposure. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured before, during, directly, 2, 4 and 24h after exposure. We performed multiple mixed linear regression analyses of different particle metrics and BP.BP significantly increased with increasing PMC, PSC and PNC resulting from toasting bread. For example, an increase per 10µg/m3 PM10 and PM2.5, systolic BP increased at all time points with largest changes 1h after exposure initiation of 1.5mmHg (95%-CI: 1.1; 1.9) and of 2.2mmHg (95%-CI: 1.3; 3.1), respectively.Our study suggests an association of short-term exposure to fine and ultrafine particles emitted from toasting bread with increases in BP. Particles emitted from frying sausages and candle burning did not consistently affect BP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute exposure 3aair pollution 3abreads 3aburning 3adiastolic blood pressure 3afrying 3aparticulate emissions 3aparticulates 3aregression analysis 3asausages 3asurface area 3atoasting 0aIndoor air pollution 0aFine and ultrafine indoor particles 0aBlood pressure 0aControlled exposure, particle characterization1 aSchins, Roel P.F.1 aHennig, Frauke1 aNieuwenhuijsen, Mark J.1 aHellack, Bryan1 aQuass, Ulrich1 aKaminski, Heinz1 aSasse, Birgitta1 aShinnāwī, Samīr,1 aKuhlbusch, Thomas A.J.1 aHoffmann, Barbara0 tEnvironmental research.g2017 Oct., v. 158 p.225-232dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03462naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245007800161300001400239500002000253520210600273592002802379650002102407650002002428650001702448650001202465650002002477650002502497650001002522650001302532650002302545650001102568650001502579650002202594650000902616650001502625650001402640650002502654651001502679651001802694700002102712700001902733700001702752773012802769856007402897852000902971655001202980IND60587636920221121140351.0180117e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058763692DNAL7 a10.1890/12-0826.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoykan, Candan U.10aPrediction of fishing effort distributions using boosted regression trees  ap. 71-83.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aConcerns about bycatch of protected species have become a dominant factor shaping fisheries management. However, efforts to mitigate bycatch are often hindered by a lack of data on the distributions of fishing effort and protected species. One approach to overcoming this problem has been to overlay the distribution of past fishing effort with known locations of protected species, often obtained through satellite telemetry and occurrence data, to identify potential bycatch hotspots. This approach, however, generates static bycatch risk maps, calling into question their ability to forecast into the future, particularly when dealing with spatiotemporally dynamic fisheries and highly migratory bycatch species. In this study, we use boosted regression trees to model the spatiotemporal distribution of fishing effort for two distinct fisheries in the North Pacific Ocean, the albacore (Thunnus alalunga) troll fishery and the California drift gillnet fishery that targets swordfish (Xiphias gladius). Our results suggest that it is possible to accurately predict fishing effort using <10 readily available predictor variables (cross‐validated correlations between model predictions and observed data ∼0.6). Although the two fisheries are quite different in their gears and fishing areas, their respective models had high predictive ability, even when input data sets were restricted to a fraction of the full time series. The implications for conservation and management are encouraging: Across a range of target species, fishing methods, and spatial scales, even a relatively short time series of fisheries data may suffice to accurately predict the location of fishing effort into the future. In combination with species distribution modeling of bycatch species, this approach holds promise as a mitigation tool when observer data are limited. Even in data‐rich regions, modeling fishing effort and bycatch may provide more accurate estimates of bycatch risk than partial observer coverage for fisheries and bycatch species that are heavily influenced by dynamic oceanographic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThunnus alalunga 3aXiphias gladius 3abiogeography 3abycatch 3adata collection 3afisheries management 3agears 3agillnets 3amigratory behavior 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprotected species 3arisk 3asatellites 3atelemetry 3atime series analysis 3aCalifornia 3aPacific Ocean1 aEguchi, Tomoharu1 aKohin, Suzanne1 aDewar, Heidi0 tEcological applications.g2014 Jan., v. 24, no. 1 p.71-83dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/12-0826.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245011100163300001400274520141200288592002801700650000801728650002101736650001401757650002101771650001901792650002801811650001901839650002401858650001001882650001201892650001801904650001301922650002401935650001301959650000901972650002601981650003202007653000902039653000802048653000902056653001102065653000802076653000902084653000802093653000802101653000702109653000802116653000802124653000902132653001002141653001002151653000802161653001602169653003202185653002502217653002402242653001402266653001702280700001602297700001802313700001602331700001702347700001802364700001602382700001402398773009302412856008302505852000902588655001202597IND60530143920221119152604.0180830e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053014392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2015.12.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jian10aCardioprotective effect of miRNA-22 on hypoxia/reoxygenation induced cardiomyocyte injury in neonatal rats  ap. 17-22.  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are implicated in the regulation of pathological and physiological processes in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R). Recent studies have revealed that miR-22 might provide a potential cardioprotective effect on ischemic heart disease. However, the mechanism by which miR-22 prevents MI/R is still not fully clear. Here, we investigated the role of miR-22 in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced cardiomyocyte injury. MI/R was simulated in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with 2h hypoxia followed by 4h reoxygenation. Prior to H/R, cells were transfected by Ad-miR-22 or Ad-scramble. It was revealed that H/R dramatically increased the release of CK and LDH, accompanied by a downregulation of miR-22 expression. Overexpression of miR-22 attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis and miR-22 target gene CREB binding protein (CBP) protein level, as determined by flow cytometry analysis and Western blot respectively. We further identified that miR-22 significantly inhibited CBP-related transcriptional factor AP-1 DNA binding activity under H/R. In addition, miR-22 could efficiently change Bcl-2/Bax ratio, and suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) induced by H/R. In conclusion, these results suggest that miR-22 plays an important cardioprotective role partly via regulating CBP/AP-1 pathway to reduce cell apoptosis and inflammatory damage during MI/R injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3abinding proteins 3acardiomyocytes 3acardioprotective effect 3aflow cytometry 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahypoxia 3ainterleukin-6 3amicroRNA 3amyocardial ischemia 3aneonates 3arats 3atranscription factors 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aMI/R 0aCBP 0aAP-1 0aNF-κB 0aH/R 0aDMEM 0aFBS 0aMOI 0aCK 0aLDH 0aECL 0aEMSA 0aELISA 0aANOVA 0aSNK 0aMicroRNA-22 0aIschemia/reperfusion injury 0aCREB binding protein 0aActivator protein-1 0aApoptosis 0aInflammation1 aChen, Lihua1 aDing, Jiawang1 aZhang, Jing1 aFan, Zhixing1 aYang, Chaojun1 aYu, QinQin,1 aYang, Jun0 tGene.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 579, no. 1 p.17-22dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2015.12.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02015naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002400149245010300173300001600276520096700292592002801259650001301287650001301300650001401313650001501327650001801342650001101360650001001371650000901381650001501390650001401405700002801419700002201447773009001469856008501559852000901644655001201653IND4449737520221118105443.0141111e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444973752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2010.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Aken, George A.10aTextural perception of liquid emulsions: Role of oil content, oil viscosity and emulsion viscosity  ap. 789-796.  aThis work describes a study on the in-mouth textural perception of thickened liquid oil-in-water emulsions.

Based on the experimental results and findings from previous studies, this work shows that the emulsion droplets influence textural sensory perception of liquid emulsions by three main mechanisms, each of which relate to changes in specific sensory attributes, and none of which were found to be significantly dependent on the viscosity of the oil: 1) by increasing the viscosity, 2) by becoming incorporated in the mucous oral coating, and 3) by spreading oil at the oral surfaces. Based on these results, the possibility for replacement of emulsified fat by a polysaccharide thickener is evaluated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3agum arabic 3alipid content 3alipids 3aodors 3aoils 3athickeners 3aviscosity1 aVingerhoeds, Monique H.1 ade Wijk, René A.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2011 June, v. 25, no. 4 p.789-796dElsevier Ltdx0268-005X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2010.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002800142245015300170300001800323520171600341592002802057650002302085650001602108650002502124650001002149650001602159650000902175650001402184650001602198650001402214650001202228650002402240650001602264650001302280653002502293653001602318653001302334653001602347653001102363653002202374653002302396653001402419700001802433700002302451700002102474773012702495856007802622852000902700655001202709IND60477899220221122100957.0160106e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047789922DNAL7 a10.2983/035.034.03332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoordin, Noordiyana Mat10aEffects of Dietary Fish Oil to Soybean Oil Ratio on Survival, Development, and Growth of Early Juveniles of the Blue Swimmer Crab Portunus pelagicus  ap. 1065-1072.  aIdentifying suitable alternatives to fish oil for inclusion in formulated diets for aquaculture species is becoming increasingly important; however, relatively few studies have assessed the potential of terrestrial oils as possible replacements for fish oil in diets for marine crustaceans. This study examined the potential of soybean oil as a partial or complete replacement for fish oil in diets for blue swimmer crab Portunus pelagicus juveniles. Seven iso-nitrogenous and iso-lipidic diets were formulated to contain soybean oil to fish oil ratios of 1:0. 3:1. 2:1. 1:1. 1:2. 1:3. and 0:1. They were fed to first-stage crabs over four molts and survival, development, and growth of the crabs were measured. Crabs fed the diet containing soybean oil as the sole lipid source (i.e., soybean oil:fish oil ratio 1:0 treatment) recorded the lowest survival among treatments, significantly longer intermolt duration, and significantly lower specific growth rates compared with other treatments. Improved performance was shown by crabs fed diets containing fish oil at the same, or higher, dietary level than soybean oil but the best survival, shortest intermolt duration, and fastest growth rates were recorded for crabs fed the diet containing the soybean oil:fish oil ratio of 1:1. The results indicated that P. pelagicus juveniles require a balance of dietary n-3 and n-6 fatty acids and thus dietary lipid requirements can be met partially by soybean oil. Diets containing soybean oil are cheaper to produce than traditional fish oil—based diets and soybean oil is a more sustainably sourced ingredient than fish oil. Our results should support further development of the P. pelagicus aquaculture industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPortunus pelagicus 3aaquaculture 3aaquaculture industry 3acrabs 3adietary fat 3afish 3afish oils 3aingredients 3ajuveniles 3amolting 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3asoybean oil 3asoybeans 0afish oil replacement 0asoybean oil 0asurvival 0adevelopment 0agrowth 0ablue swimmer crab 0aPortunus pelagicus 0ajuveniles1 aZeng, Chaoshu1 aSouthgate, Paul C.1 aRomano, Nicholas0 tJournal of shellfish research.g2015 Sept., v. 34, no. 3 p.1065-1072dNational Shellfisheries Associationx0730-80007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2983%2F035.034.03333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245018700163300001800350520147200368592002801840650002301868650002101891650001101912650001301923650001401936650001101950650002301961650001301984650001201997650001302009650001902022650002402041650001802065650001602083653002302099653001402122653001102136653002302147653001302170653001602183700002202199700002002221700002102241700002202262773012702284856007802411852000902489655001202498IND60477899320221122101019.0160106e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047789932DNAL7 a10.2983/035.034.03342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastejón, Diego14aThe Effects of Temperature and Salinity on the Survival, Growth and Duration of the Larval Development of the Common Spider Crab Maja brachydactyla (Balss, 1922) (Brachyura: Majidae)  ap. 1073-1083.  aThe effect of temperature and salinity on the larval development of the common spider crab Maja brachydactyla (Balss, 1922) were studied in the laboratory. Larvae were reared at different salinities (0–45) at constant temperature, and under six different combinations of temperature (18 and 21°C) and salinity (30, 35, and 40). The survival and developmental time from newly hatched zoeae to the megalopa stage and from megalopa to the first juvenile stage was quantified; the 24 h median lethal salinity (LS₅₀) for first zoeal stage was calculated. Dry mass (DM), elemental body composition (Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen) and carbon: nitrogen ratio (C:N) were determined in both starved and nourished zoeae. The lower and upper LS₅₀ for M. brachydactyla first zoea in 24 h were 19.9 and 56.0, respectively; similar to other marine stenohaline brachyuran larvae. The megalopa stage was reached in a salinity range from 30 to 40. The highest survival rates to the first juvenile stage were observed at salinity: 35 and temperature: 21°C. Salinity was the key parameter for the survival to first juvenile, whereas the temperature had a higher effect over the duration of the larval development. The greatest loss of DM in starving and nourished zoeae was observed at low salinity (25). No differences were found in DM or C:N during the megalopa stage. The culture and ecological implications of the salinity tolerance of M. brachydactyla larvae are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaja brachydactyla 3abody composition 3acarbon 3ahydrogen 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3alarval development 3anitrogen 3arearing 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3astenohaline species 3asurvival rate 3atemperature 0aMaja brachydactyla 0aBrachyura 0agrowth 0alarval development 0asalinity 0atemperature1 aRotllant, Guiomar1 aGiménez, Luis,1 aTorres, Gabriela1 aGuerao, Guillermo0 tJournal of shellfish research.g2015 Sept., v. 34, no. 3 p.1073-1083dNational Shellfisheries Associationx0730-80007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2983%2F035.034.03343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013800166300001400304520180300318592002802121650002902149650001102178650001302189650001202202650000902214650002202223650002802245650001402273650001202287650001002299650001302309653002902322653002202351653002202373653001202395653002402407700002002431700002802451773011502479856008302594852000902677655001202686IND60564379220221121110857.0190318e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056437922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2017.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLü, Jianhua,10aInsecticidal potential of a synthetic zeolite against the cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Bruchidae)  ap. 28-34.  aThe insecticidal potential of a synthetic zeolite was evaluated against the cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus (Fabricius). The synthetic zeolite was applied to concrete surfaces at 0, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 g/m2, and the mortality of adults was assessed after 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h at 28 °C and 65% r.h. The residual efficacy of zeolite applied at 5 g/m2 was evaluated on concrete surfaces at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 months post-treatment. Adults of C. maculatus were exposed to cowpeas treated with zeolite at 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 g/kg. The number of eggs deposited on cowpea kernels and their hatchability were determined after 7 and 14 d, respectively. The cumulative adult mortality was recorded after 1, 2, 3, and 4 d, and adult progeny production after 42 d. The residual efficacy of zeolite on cowpeas was tested at 0, 1, 2 and 3 months after treatment. On concrete, zeolite applied at ≥ 5 g/m2 resulted in 100% mortality of C. maculatus adults after 24–72 h of exposure. Zeolite at 5 g/m2 exhibited high residual efficacy with 100% mortality of C. maculatus adults after 36 h exposure on treated surfaces for up to 4 months. The mortality of C. maculatus adults exposed to zeolite-treated cowpeas increased with increasing concentration and exposure time. The number of eggs laid by C. maculatus, number of kernels with eggs, and adult progeny production decreased with increasing zeolite concentration. Zeolite applied to cowpeas at 1 g/kg produced 100, 99 and 77% adult mortality at 1, 2, and 3 months post-treatment. Progeny production on zeolite-treated cowpeas was significantly lower than that on untreated cowpeas. These results show that the synthetic zeolite is effective on concrete surfaces and on cowpeas in controlling C. maculatus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCallosobruchus maculatus 3aadults 3aconcrete 3acowpeas 3aeggs 3aexposure duration 3ainsecticidal properties 3amortality 3aprogeny 3aseeds 3azeolites 0aCallosobruchus maculatus 0aSynthetic zeolite 0aConcrete surfaces 0aCowpeas 0aEfficacy assessment1 aSehgal, Blossom1 aSubramanyam, Bhadriraju0 tJournal of stored products research.g2017 May, v. 72 p.28-34dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2017.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01948naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009800168300001800266500001900284520098600303592002801289650001701317650002201334650001601356650001401372700001801386700002301404773012901427856008101556852000901637655001201646IND60714608920221119210915.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071460892DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954201001172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadchenko, O.

Molecular genetic analysis demonstrates that the genus is heterogeneous in the contemporary composition and is divided into Pacific and Arctic-Atlantic groups. In the Pacific group, a close phylogenetic relationship is found between the species M. stelleri, M. polyacanthocephalus, and M. jaok. The representative of the Arctic-Atlantic group, M. quadricornis, is monotypic and sister to Megalocottus platycephalus. Close relations of M. scorpius and the sculpins of the Pacific group are revealed on the basis of the molecular genetic and karyological data. Analysis of M. brandtii, M. ochotensis, and M. jaok from different parts of their habitats shows the absence of karyological variability. The degree and direction of the divergence of the karyotypes in Pacific species M. brandtii, M. ochotensis, M. jaok, M. polyacanthocephalus, M. stelleri, and M. scorpius are established.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMegalocottus 3agenetic variation 3akaryotyping 3aphylogeny1 aMoreva, I.

DNA fingerprinting methods include different markers; however, our work is based on the identification of olive oil cultivars by using simple sequence repeats analysis. As previously reported in the literature, this proposed method shows good capability to amplify, for example, DNA from wine and table grape varieties. In our paper, we suggest an easy methodology, which allows direct amplification of DNA and bypassing of the extraction of DNA using an engineered DNA polymerase, KAPA3G Plant DNA polymerase, improved to tolerate plant PCR inhibitors. This new procedure is more efficient, faster and cheaper than traditional methods of DNA extraction and amplification and leads to more accurate results. This innovative protocol, without the addition of chemical solutions, has provided good results and has permitted traceability of virgin olive oils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3acultivars 3afood research 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aolives 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atable grapes 3atraceability 3atrees 3avirgin olive oil 3aItaly 3aMediterranean region1 aPisani, Francesca1 aGreco, Federica1 aChiappetta, Adriana0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2015 July, v. 241, no. 1 p.151-155dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-015-2455-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245008400173300001400257520107000271592002801341650002901369650001301398650001701411650001701428650002701445650001401472650002001486650001801506650002001524650001101544650001401555650001301569653002101582653001301603653001701616653001301633653002001646700001701666700001701683700001801700700001301718700001801731700001801749700001401767700001501781700001701796700001701813700001601830700002001846773007601866856009001942852000902032655001202041IND60567626120221119083120.0170627e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056762612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.04.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zishan12aA novel antigen delivery system induces strong humoral and CTL immune responses  ap. 51-63.  aNew strategies with the ability to enhance both the humoral and cellular immune responses remain a priority for the development of future therapeutic cancer vaccines. In this study, we took advantage of β-glucan particles (GPs) derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae baker's yeast and a novel reverse micro-emulsion method to prepare an antigen-loaded GP carrier system for dendritic cell (DC) specific antigen delivery, followed by careful evaluation of the immune functions of the prepared particles in initiating both the humoral and cellular immune responses through in vitro and in vivo experiments. The prepared particles greatly promoted DC activation and cytokine production and cross presented the antigen to CD8 cells, inducing very strong OVA specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Treatment with these particles significantly prevented the growth of implanted EG7-OVA tumors in a prophylactic and pre-established tumor model. These results suggest that our strategy may be able to be utilized as a promising platform for cancer immunotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aantigens 3abakers yeast 3abeta-glucans 3acell-mediated immunity 3acytokines 3aimmune response 3aimmunotherapy 3ain vivo studies 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3avaccines 0aGlucan particles 0aChitosan 0aCTL response 0aAdjuvant 0aDendritic cells1 aXu, Miaomiao1 aJia, Zhenghu1 aZhang, Yuting1 aWang, Li1 aZhang, Hongru1 aWang ,Jingya,1 aSong, Mei1 aZhao, Yapu1 aWu, Zhenzhou1 aZhao, Liqing1 aYin, Zhinan1 aHong, Zhangyong0 tBiomaterials.g2017 July, v. 134 p.51-63dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.04.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006500149245015200214300001600366500001900382520119900401592002801600650002301628650001801651650001001669650002501679650001501704650001001719650001301729650001401742650001601756650001601772650001401788650002001802653004201822653002301864653002101887653002101908653002601929700005901955700002102014773013102035856008402166961001302250852000902263655001202272IND60731190520221118061652.0210322e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073119052DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-10-20-0475-IA2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichards, Jonathan K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9342-359510aBotrytis spp.: A Contemporary Perspective and Synthesis of Recent Scientific Developments of a Widespread Genus that Threatens Global Food Security  ap. 432-436.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis perspective presents a synopsis of the topics contained in the Phytopathology Pathogen Spotlight on Botrytis spp. causing gray mold, including pathogen biology and systematics, genomic characterization of new species, perspectives on genome editing, and fungicide resistance. A timely breakthrough to engineer host plant resistance against the gray mold fungus has been demonstrated in planta and may augment chemical controls in the near future. While B. cinerea has garnered much of the research attention, other economically important Botrytis spp. have been identified and characterized via morphological and genome-based approaches. Gray mold control is achieved primarily through fungicide applications but resistance to various chemical classes is a major concern that threatens global plant health and food security. In this issue, new information on molecular mechanism(s) of fungicide resistance and ways to manage control failures are presented. Finally, a significant leap in fundamental pathogen biology has been achieved via development of CRISPR/Cas9 to assess gene function in the fungus which likely will spawn new control mechanisms and facilitate gene discovery studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3afood security 3afungi 3afungicide resistance 3afungicides 3agenes 3agenomics 3agray mold 3ahost plants 3anew species 3apathogens 3aplant pathology 0aantimicrobial or fungicide resistance 0adisease resistance 0aemerging species 0afungal pathogens 0ahost plant resistance1 aXiao, Chang-Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2453-13621 aJurick, Wayne M.0 tPhytopathology.g2021 Mar., v. 111, no. 3 p.432-436dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-10-20-0475-IA3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001600156245014000172300001400312520152200326592002801848650002601876650001501902650001301917650002401930650002001954650001701974650001901991650002002010650001602030650003102046650001802077650001702095650001402112650001502126653002202141653004202163653003102205653001202236653001302248653002702261653000802288653000902296653001002305653000802315700001302323700002802336700001602364700001902380700003102399700001502430700001802445700002102463700002502484773007602509856009002585852000902675655001202684IND60567626220221119083027.0170627e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056762622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.04.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTa, Hang T.10aMolecular imaging of activated platelets via antibody-targeted ultra-small iron oxide nanoparticles displaying unique dual MRI contrast  ap. 31-42.  aMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful and indispensable tool in medical research, clinical diagnosis, and patient care due to its high spatial resolution and non-limited penetration depth. The simultaneous use of positive and negative MRI imaging that employs the same contrast agents will significantly improve detection accuracy. Here we report the development of functional multimodal iron oxide nanoparticles for targeted MRI of atherothrombosis using a combination of chemical and biological conjugation techniques. Monodisperse, water-soluble and biocompatible ultra-small magnetic dual contrast iron oxide nanoparticles (DCIONs) were generated using a high-temperature co-precipitation route and appeared to be efficient positive and negative dual contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging. Using a unique chemo-enzymatic approach involving copper-free click chemistry and Staphylococcus aureus sortase A enzyme conjugation, DCIONs were functionalized with single-chain antibodies (scFv) directed against activated platelets for targeting purposes. The DCIONs were also labelled with fluorescent molecules to allow for optical imaging. The antigen binding activity of the scFv was retained and resulted in the successful targeting of contrast agents to thrombosis as demonstrated in a range of in vitro and in vivo experiments. T1- and T2-weighted MRI of thrombi was recorded and demonstrated the great potential of dual T1/T2 contrast iron oxide particles in imaging of cardiovascular disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abiomedical research 3acoprecipitation 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3ain vivo studies 3airon oxides 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3ananoparticles 3apatient care 3asortase A 3athrombosis 0aMolecular imaging 0aDual contrast iron oxide nanoparticle 0aMagnetic resonance imaging 0aSortase 0aPlatelet 0aCardiovascular disease 0aMRI 0ascFv 0aDCION 0aCHO1 aLi, Zhen1 aHagemeyer, Christoph E.1 aCowin, Gary1 aZhang, Shaohua1 aPalasubramaniam, Jathushan1 aAlt, Karen1 aWang, Xiaowei1 aPeter, Karlheinz1 aWhittaker, Andrew K.0 tBiomaterials.g2017 July, v. 134 p.31-42dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.04.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01719naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245019600153300001800349520050300367592002800870650001400898650001500912650001300927650001600940650002000956650001100976650001800987650001901005650001601024700001601040700001601056700001901072700001801091700001501109773012601124856007401250852000901324655001201333IND60639893520221120045626.0190503e20160711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063989352DNAL7 a10.1039/c6gc00866f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Wei10aSynthetic ultra-long chain fatty acyl based amphiphilic lipids as a dual function excipient for the production of surfactant-free solid lipid nanoparticles (SF-SLNs): a physico-chemical study  ap. 3962-3971.  aTwo arrays of behenoyl (22 : 0) based amphiphilic lipids with sugar alcohols as a flexible linker were synthesized through acylation of sugar alcohol mono-behenates with diacetyl tartaric anhydride or acetoxy succinic anhydride and some of the resulting products are capable of yielding stable and uniform solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) (mean diameter ∼100 nm, PDI < 0.2) without any additive surfactant, displaying excellent dual functions (as both a solid lipid excipient and emulsifier).  aPublisher supplied data 3aacylation 3aanhydrides 3adiacetyl 3aemulsifiers 3agreen chemistry 3alipids 3ananoparticles 3asugar alcohols 3asurfactants1 aLu, Xiaonan1 aWang, Zegao1 aDong, Mingdong1 aFeng, Fengqin1 aGuo, Zheng0 tGreen chemistry.g2016 July 11, v. 18, no. 14 p.3962-3971dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6gc00866f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245009800167300001600265520123700281592002801518650002401546650001401570650001101584650001801595650001901613650001401632650001301646650001401659700001701673700001901690773013101709856007901840852000901919655001201928IND60569428420221118105211.0170528e20161013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056942842DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2016-01202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakasuka, Akinori10aDynamics of growth-based survival mechanisms in Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) larvae  ap. 812-823.  aThree growth-based survival mechanisms were tested for multiple cohorts of Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) larvae in Sagami Bay. Through otolith microstructure analysis, growth trajectories and histories of samples of the survivors were compared with those of the original populations to examine size- and growth-selective mortality to test the “bigger is better” and “growth-selective predation” mechanisms, respectively. The effects of growth rates on the timing of metamorphosis were examined to test the “stage duration” mechanism. The bigger is better and growth-selective predation mechanisms were detected to be effective in two and six of eight seasonal cohorts, respectively. Results contrary to the bigger is better and growth-selective predation mechanisms were obtained from three and two of eight cohorts, respectively. The stage duration mechanism was evaluated to be effective for both of two cohorts that were testable. Overall, none of the three mechanisms were universally appropriate for all of the cohorts. The relative contributions of the three mechanisms were dynamic, although the growth-selective predation mechanism was identified to be the major one in anchovy larvae in the study site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEngraulis japonicus 3aanchovies 3alarvae 3ametamorphosis 3amicrostructure 3amortality 3aotoliths 3apredation1 aSakai, Ayumu1 aAoki, Ichirō,0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2016 Oct. 13, v. 74, no. 6 p.812-823dNRC Research Pressx1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2016-01203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245014200209300001600351520103900367592002801406650001201434650001201446650001501458650001401473650002001487650001901507650001501526650001601541650001401557650001301571650001301584650001601597650002501613650001401638650001601652650001301668650002001681650001401701650001101715653003301726653002301759653002201782653002901804653003201833653001301865700002401878700001701902700002501919700002001944700002501964773010201989856008502091852000902176655001202185IND60710671620221117110536.0220906e20210102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071067162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2020.08.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedhi, Srawanti1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7204-381410aAnalysis of high performing graphene oxide nanosheets based non-damaging drilling fluids through rheological measurements and CFD studies  ap. 379-395.  aThis research presents a detailed study on the effect of synthesized graphene oxide nanosheet (GO-NS) on Non-Damaging Drilling Fluid (NDDF) through steady-state rotational and dynamic oscillation rheological measurements along with fluid loss estimation. Synthesis of GO-NS was conducted by following Hummers' method. It was found that GO-NS acts as an excellent thermal stabilizer for NDDF which better preserves viscosity at high temperatures up to 98%. Apart from strengthening viscoelastic solid properties, addition of >0.5 wt% GO-NS also induces superior structural stability showing a recovery of 93.84%. More than 50% reduction in filtrate loss volume was observed with an addition of 0.8 wt% GO-NS in NDDF. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations showed that the overall cutting retention is least with 0.096% for 0.5 wt% GO-NS NDDF with less eddy viscosity, higher velocity and reduced skewness. Pressure drop calculations indicated assured flowability of GO-NS NDDF even though it bears viscoelastic solid nature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUrsidae 3acutting 3aestimation 3afiltrates 3afluid mechanics 3agraphene oxide 3ananosheets 3aoscillation 3apreserves 3apressure 3aresearch 3astabilizers 3astatistical analysis 3asynthesis 3atemperature 3avelocity 3aviscoelasticity 3aviscosity 3avolume 0aComputational Fluid Dynamics 0aFluid loss control 0aGenetic Algorithm 0aGraphene oxide nanosheet 0aNon Damaging Drilling Fluid 0aRheology1 aChowdhury, Satyajit1 aBhatt, Naman1 aGupta, Dharmendra K.1 aRana, Sravendra1 aSangwai, Jitendra S.0 tPowder technology.g2021 Jan. 02, v. 377 p.379-395dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.08.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003600143245009200179300001600271520150800287592002801795650002501823650002101848650001801869650001601887650001401903650000901917650001801926650001501944650001801959650002101977650003101998650004302029650001102072650001502083650001302098650001402111650001402125650002702139650001302166650001502179653002402194653001302218653002502231653002102256653001302277700002302290700002502313700003202338700003102370773012902401856007802530852000902608655001202617IND60731190720221118061620.0210915e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073119072DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2020.01682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPineda-Alegría, Jesús Antonio10aNematicidal Effect of Shiitake (Lentinula edodes) Extracts Against Haemonchus contortus  ap. 953-959.  aDuring the previous decades, the indiscriminate use of anthelmintics for the control of gastrointestinal nematodes has generated anthelmintic resistance in different parts of the world. It is necessary to search for new sustainable control alternatives, such as the use of extracts from plants and edible mushrooms. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the nematicidal activity of extracts and fractions of the edible mushroom Lentinula edodes against Haemonchus contortus eggs and infective larvae. The basidiomata of L. edodes ECS-401 were provided by the Tropical Fungi Laboratory of El Colegio de la Frontera Sur and were extracted with ethyl acetate, methanol, and water. Fractionation of the most active extract was carried out by open column chromatography. The bioassays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates using 100 eggs/larvae, a final volume of 100 μL, and different concentrations of extracts/fractions (n = 4). Bioassay readings were taken at 48 h for egg hatching inhibition (EHI) and at 24, 48 and 72 h for larval mortality (LM). The ethyl acetate extract exhibited the highest percentage of EHI (100%). For the LM bioassay, the aqueous extract was the most active (69%), but its fractions did not show larvicidal activity. The chemical profile of the aqueous extract was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography, which showed the presence of phenols, flavonoids, and terpenes. L. edodes extracts showed ovicidal and/or larvicidal activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aLentinula edodes 3aanthelmintics 3abasidiomata 3abioassays 3aeggs 3aethyl acetate 3aflavonoids 3afractionation 3afunctional foods 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alarvae 3alarvicides 3amethanol 3amortality 3amushrooms 3anematicidal properties 3aovicides 3aterpenoids 0abioactive compounds 0aextracts 0aHaemonchus contortus 0aLentinula edodes 0aShiitake1 aSánchez, José E.1 aVentura-Zapata, Elsa1 aGonzález-Cortazar, Manases1 aAguilar-Marcelino, Liliana0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 24, no. 9 p.953-959dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl57082x1557-76007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jmf.2020.01683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01693naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245009000161300001800251520058400269592002800853650001200881650002000893650003600913650002300949650002100972650002900993650001001022650002001032650002001052700001501072700001801087700001701105773012601122856007401248852000901322655001201331IND60639893720221120033818.0190503e20160613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063989372DNAL7 a10.1039/c6gc00872k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeong, Siew Ping10aCopper catalysed alkynylation of tertiary amines with CaC₂via sp³ C–H activation  ap. 3499-3502.  aA mild and easy-to-handle protocol to produce propargylamines with a terminal alkyne through catalytic cross-coupling of tertiary amines and calcium carbide has been developed.

Poly(1‐octene‐co‐BMA) copolymers with well‐controlled molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distribution were obtained throughout the polymerization. The copolymers have been well characterized by different analytical techniques such as SEC, FT‐IR, NMR, SEM, AFM, XRD, and TG analyses. FT‐IR and NMR analyses confirmed the synthesis of poly(1‐octene‐co‐BMA) copolymers. SEM and AFM analyses demonstrated the wavy‐lamellar morphological structure of the copolymers. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed good thermal stability of poly(1‐octene‐co‐BMA) copolymers synthesized via RAFT mediated polymerization. The thermokinetic parameters were evaluated by adopting model‐free methods of Friedman and Flynn–Wall–Ozawa using the nonisothermal thermogravimetric data. The multivariate nonlinear regression analysis established the most appropriate kinetic model and the corresponding kinetic parameters of thermal decomposition of poly(1‐octene‐co‐BMA) copolymers were also calculated. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Significant differences in the content and composition of phospholipids were revealed between the cell lines. Phosphatidylcholines (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) were predominant phospholipids in embryogenic cell lines, whereas non-embryogenic cell lines featured a high content of phosphatidic acid (>64% of total phospholipids). The PC/PE ratio known to characterize the membrane structure and function was 1.4–3.8 times higher for embryogenic cell lines than for non-embryogenic lines; this was probably caused by the involvement of these phospholipids in tissue differentiation. The content of phosphatidylinositols differed significantly for embryogenic and non-embryogenic cell lines, where it equaled to 0.50–1.06 and 0.17–0.34 mg/g dry wt, respectively. The observed variations in the composition of phospholipids between the cell lines with different embryogenic potential provide evidence for the important role of these lipids in embryogenesis at the stage of embryo formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarix sibirica 3aembryogenesis 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphosphatidylinositols 3aplant physiology1 aShmakov, V.

Research on the dynamics of residential fire incident response times has barely begun, a situation arguably underpinned by limited access to disaggregate command and control data. In this paper we draw on unit record data and employ quantile regression to examine the role that socio-demographic, infrastructure characteristics and temporal factors play on response times. Results reveal that response times are slower during the winter, in locales with larger numbers of children (aged 14 years and below) and low socioeconomic households, and in areas that have more complex street layouts. We conclude through emphasising the importance of these findings in their capacity to contribute to a new evidence base to inform policy decisions from a resource allocation perspective through the spatial allocation of finite fire resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeath 3aelderly 3ageography 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apeople 3aresource allocation 3awinter 0aResidential fire 0aResponse time 0aSpatial pattern 0aQuantile regression modelling1 aCorcoran, Jonathan0 tApplied geography.g2017 July, v. 84 p.64-74dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01944naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003000143245009600173300001800269520069700287592002800984650002401012650001301036650002101049650001901070650002101089650001201110650001801122650001001140653005301150653001601203653002901219700003101248700003301279700002801312773013101340856007801471852000901549655001201558IND60731190820221118061617.0211020e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073119082DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2020.02062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCortez-Navarrete, Marisol10aMomordica Charantia: A Review of Its Effects on Metabolic Diseases and Mechanisms of Action  ap. 1017-1027.  aThe global rise in the prevalence of metabolic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia is a serious public health issue. The search for safe and effective complementary and alternative therapies to treat metabolic disorders is a key field of research. Momordica charantia (MC) is a tropical and subtropical vine of the Cucurbitaceae family used as a medicinal plant since ancient times. Although MC has been widely studied for its hypoglycemic potential, hypolipidemic and antiobesity effects have also been reported in preclinical studies and clinical trials. This study aims to review the metabolic effects of MC reported in clinical trials as well as its mechanisms of action.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMomordica charantia 3adiabetes 3afunctional foods 3ahyperlipidemia 3amedicinal plants 3aobesity 3apublic health 3avines 0adyslipidemia • Momordica charantia • obesity 0aprediabetes 0atype 2 diabetes mellitus1 aMéndez-del Villar, Miriam1 aRamos-González, Elsy Janeth1 aPérez-Rubio, Karina G.0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 24, no. 10 p.1017-1027dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl57082x1557-76007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jmf.2020.02063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03677naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245008500209520196200294592002802256650001602284650001002300650002302310650002802333650000902361650001402370650001102384650002002395650002202415650001002437650001502447650001302462650001802475650001102493650002202504650001602526651001502542653001702557653001802574653002302592653001502615653001102630653001202641653001902653700002402672700001702696700002402713700002102737700002402758700002602782700002002808700002002828700003802848773009402886856008602980852000903066655001203075IND60717991020221119023633.0210723e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071799102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e055212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRana, Md Sohel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9965-614310aEpidemiological study of human rabies cases in Bangladesh through verbal autopsy  aIdentification of risk factors is crucial to find ways to reduce rabies deaths. We investigated the hospital records of rabies deceased through contact tracing of the relatives of the victims using enhanced verbal autopsies (VA) to identify why the people had to die from rabies in recent years in Bangladesh. Patients whose deaths were confirmed by physicians based on the history of animal exposure and clinical signs were taken into account for VA. Socio-demographic profile of the deceased, animal exposure, nature of the wound, and history of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) data were obtained and analysed. The study found 256 cases in which the cause of death was attributed to rabies, most of the victims were male (71.88%), resided in the rural community (80.47%), dependent (49.22%), and children below the age of 15 years (47.27%). Dogs were the single most responsible (81.64%); however, cats (12.11%), jackals (3.91%) and mongoose (2.34%) were also found accountable for rabies incidence (P < 0.05). Significantly, limbs were the most common (67.97%) site of exposure, and the shortest incubation period was identified in the case of bites to head and face (P < 0.05). The majority (86.72%) of the deceased did not receive any PEP; whereas, 66.80% sought treatment from traditional healers. Among the deceased (13.28%, n = 34) who had received PEP, only 8.82% of them completed the full course of the vaccination regimen (P < 0.01); however, none of them had history of taking rabies immunoglobulin (RIG). The study recommends extensive public health awareness programs in the rural community and establishing methods to improve healthcare-seeking behaviours, including receiving PEP instead of visiting traditional healers. Moreover, the availability and accessibility of PEP in the government hospital facilities are desirable, and laboratory-based surveillance with compatible rapid data reporting may be incorporated in the existing policy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHerpestidae 3adeath 3adisease prevention 3aepidemiological studies 3aface 3ahospitals 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulins 3aissues and policy 3amales 3amonitoring 3anecropsy 3apublic health 3arabies 3arural communities 3avaccination 3aBangladesh 0aEpidemiology 0aPublic health 0aInfectious disease 0aBangladesh 0aRabies 0aVaccine 0aVerbal autopsy1 aSiddiqi, Umme Ruman1 aGhosh, Sumon1 aJahan, Afsana Akter1 aIslam, Md Kamrul1 aAli Shah, Md Rashed1 aUllah, Sayed Mohammed1 aAli, S.M.

In atom transfer radical coupling (ATRC) with radical trap assistance, to achieve significant coupling requires excess metal catalyst, ligand, and a reducing agent that is often additional metal. In this work, activators generated by electron transfer (AGET) and radical trap assistance are used in the ATRC sequence to successfully lead to chain‐end coupling without the need for the oxidatively unstable copper (I) and with environmentally friendlier agents in place of copper metal. High extents of coupling (Xc) were achieved using ascorbic acid (AA) as the reducing agent and copper(II) bromide as the oxidized version of the catalyst, and when combined with AGET ATRP to prepare the PSBr precursor, only a fraction of the total metal was required compared to traditional atom transfer reactions, while still retaining similar Xc values. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The E1 scenario is designed to limit global annual mean warming to 2 °C or less above pre-industrial levels. A multi-model ensemble consisting of ten coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation models is analyzed, which includes five Earth System Models containing interactive carbon cycles. The aim of the study is to assess the changes that could be mitigated under the E1 scenario and to identify regions where even small climate change may lead to strong changes in precipitation, cloud cover and evapotranspiration. In these regions the hydrological cycle is considered particularly vulnerable to climate change, highlighting the need for adaptation measures even if strong mitigation of climate change would be achieved. In the A1B projections, there are significant drying trends in sub-tropical regions, precipitation increases in high latitudes and some monsoon regions, as well as changes in cloudiness and evapotranspiration. These signals are reduced in E1 scenario projections. However, even under the E1 scenario, significant precipitation decrease in the subtropics and increase in high latitudes are projected. Particularly the Amazon region shows strong drying tendencies in some models, most probably related to vegetation interaction. Where climate change is relatively small, the E1 scenario tends to keep the average magnitude of potential changes at a level comparable to current intra-seasonal to inter-annual variability at that location. Such regions are mainly located in the mid-latitudes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevapotranspiration 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3amonsoon season 3asubtropics 3aclimate change 3alatitude 3aemissions 3ahydrologic cycle 3arisk reduction 3adrying 3aissues and policy 3avegetation 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aAmazonia 0aadaptation1 aSanderson, M.

Three PRV subtypes are currently reported as causative agents of or in association with diseases in different salmonid species. PRV-1 causes heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and is associated with jaundice syndrome in farmed chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). PRV-2 causes erythrocytic inclusion body syndrome (EIBS) in coho salmon in Japan. PRV-3 has recently been associated with a disease in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) characterized by anaemia, heart and red muscle pathology; to jaundice syndrome in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). In this study, we conducted a 10-week long experimental infection trial in rainbow trout with purified PRV-3 particles to assess the causal relationship between the virus and development of heart inflammation. The monitoring the PRV-3 load in heart and spleen by RT-qPCR shows a progressive increase of viral RNA to a peak, followed by clearance without a measurable change in haematocrit. The development of characteristic cardiac histopathological findings occurred in the late phase of the trial and was associated with increased expression of CD8+, indicating cytotoxic T cell proliferation. The findings indicate that, under these experimental conditions, PRV-3 infection in rainbow trout act similarly to PRV-1 infection in Atlantic salmon with regards to immunological responses and development of heart pathology, but not in the ability to establish a persistent infection.  aPublisher supplied data  aAquaexcel grant agreement No 652831cH2020 Research Infrastructures  a# 237315/E40cBioforsk  aIcar International FellowshipcNational Bureau of Agriculturally Important Microorganisms0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOncorhynchus kisutch 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aOncorhynchus tshawytscha 3aOrthoreovirus 3aRNA 3aSalmo salar 3aT-lymphocytes 3aanemia 3aaquaculture 3acell proliferation 3achronic diseases 3acytotoxicity 3afish 3aheart 3ahematocrit 3ahistopathology 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3ajaundice 3amonitoring 3amuscles 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3askeletal muscle 3aspleen 3aviruses 3aJapan1 aKannimuthu, Dhamotharan1 aOlsen, Anne Berit1 aCuenca, Argelia1 aTeige, Lena Hammerlund1 aWessel, Øystein1 aIburg, Tine Moesgaard1 aDahle, Maria Krudtaa1 aRimstad, Espen1 aOlesen, Niels Jørgen0 tVeterinary research.g2019 Dec., v. 50, no. 1 p.14-14dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4142873x1297-97167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13567-019-0632-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245013300199300001800332500002000350520140600370592002801776650001101804650004401815650001901859650001901878650002001897650002301917650001401940700001801954700002201972773013501994856007402129852000902203655001202212IND60673149620221118141315.0191018e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067314962DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.248802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitra, Nilanjan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0639-463X10aIdentification of molecular vibrations associated with tacticity in polypropylene: Density functional theory‐based simulations  ap. 1378-1385.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe polymerization of vinyl monomers with achiral carbon center forms polymers with different spatial arrangements resulting in products with a different set of mechanical and thermal properties. Therefore, control of the tacticity (stereochemistry) is of major importance for controlling the polymer properties. It is possible to manipulate the polymer stereoregularity through the application of appropriate synthetic protocols. However, the polymers obtained using these protocols are not perfect, and thereby, it is essential to know the amount of different stereoregular units in a polymer mass. Generally, extensive NMR techniques and vibrational spectroscopy are used in this regard. To investigate further, a detailed DFT has been employed in this manuscript for syndio and isotactic polypropylene. The DFT allows generation of the vibrational spectra in the far‐infrared (0–400 cm⁻¹) region, demonstrating the distinct nature of both types of polymers. The vibrational spectra for pure syndio and isotactic polypropylene as well as their conformer defects have been identified in this study. These studies of vibration spectra in the far‐infrared regime can be used to identify signatures of pure racemo and meso dyads along with the type of conformer defects present in pristine varieties. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Statistical properties and monthly average data or climatological data of sea surface temperature (SST), wind speed (WS), wind direction (WD), chlorophyll (CH) and sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) for the Indonesian seas are investigated. The results indicate negative dependence between SST and WS. The correlation between SST and WS has a 1-month phase difference. CH and SSHA are considered local data and reveal no apparent characteristics for the Indonesian seas as a whole. Seasonal changes of the indices, coupled with a north–south change, are observed. This analysis confirms several characteristics of the Indonesian seas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aseasonal variation 3asurface temperature 3awind direction 3awind speed1 aTanaka, Tasuku1 aIshida, Haruma0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2012 Apr. 20, v. 33, no. 8 p.2378-2394dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2011.608739  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245008900208300001400297520153100311592002801842650001201870650001601882650001101898650001401909650002301923650003001946650001701976650002701993653003002020653003002050653000902080653003802089653003002127653000902157653001002166653001002176653001202186653001202198653000802210653000802218700002302226700003202249700002102281700003202302700002302334773008802357856008402445852000902529655001202538IND60592342620221119003859.0180402e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059234262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2017.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrnković, Ana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0581-188713aAn archaeal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex for improved substrate quality control  ap. 36-45.  aAminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) decode genetic information by coupling tRNAs with cognate amino acids. In the archaeon Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus arginyl- and seryl-tRNA synthetase (ArgRS and SerRS, respectively) form a complex which enhances serylation and facilitates tRNASᵉʳ recycling through its association with the ribosome. Yet, the way by which complex formation participates in Arg-tRNAᴬʳᵍ synthesis is still unresolved. Here we utilized pull down and surface plasmon resonance experiments with truncated ArgRS variants to demonstrate that ArgRS uses its N-terminal domain to establish analogous interactions with both SerRS and cognate tRNAᴬʳᵍ, providing a rationale for the lack of detectable SerRS•[ArgRS•tRNAᴬʳᵍ] complex. In contrast, stable ternary ArgRS•[SerRS•tRNASᵉʳ] complex was easily detected supporting the model wherein ArgRS operates in serylation by modulating SerRS affinity toward tRNASᵉʳ. We also found that the interaction with SerRS suppresses arginylation of unmodified tRNAᴬʳᵍ by ArgRS, which, by itself, does not discriminate against tRNAᴬʳᵍ substrates lacking posttranscriptional modifications. Hence, there is a fundamentally different participation of the protein partners in Arg-tRNA and Ser-tRNA synthesis. Propensity of the ArgRS•SerRS complex to exclude unmodified tRNAs from translation leads to an attractive hypothesis that SerRS•ArgRS complex might act in vivo as a safeguarding switch that improves translation accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aamino acids 3amodels 3aribosomes 3aserine-tRNA ligase 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atransfer RNA 3atranslation (genetics) 0aAminoacyl-tRNA synthetase 0aMultisynthetase complexes 0atRNA 0aPosttranscriptional modifications 0aSurface plasmon resonance 0aaaRS 0aArgRS 0aSerRS 0aMtArgRS 0aMtSerRS 0aMSC 0aSPR1 aČavužić, Mirela1 aGodinić-Mikulčić, Vlatka1 aAnderluh, Gregor1 aWeygand-Đurašević, Ivana1 aGruić-Sovulj, Ita0 tBiochimie.g2018 Apr., v. 147 p.36-45dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6254x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2017.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02159naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245005200169300001600221520100600237592002801243650002401271650003501295650001601330650001601346650001801362650001001380650001501390650001101405650001101416650001201427650001201439650001401451650001401465650001201479700002401491700002201515773012201537856008101659852000901740655001201749IND60438172820221119041429.0151023e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043817282DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-015-2456-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaria, Długaszek10aLithium content in the tea and herbal infusions  ap. 289-293.  aTea infusions provide many valuable nutrients, including elements. Lithium (Li) is an element which appears rather in small amounts both in environment and in the human tissues or body fluids. Now it is known that it plays a part in many important vital functions. Content of Li in food products is generally small, which is associated with its low consumption. The aim of the study was to examine the concentration of Li in the infusions prepared from different sort of teas available in the market. The content of Li was examined in 55 infusions of black, green, red, fruit and herbal teas. Quantitative studies were performed using atomic absorption spectrometry with atomization in graphite furnace. The largest amount of Li was extracted from the leaves of red tea and rooibos as well as some herbal teas. The determined content of Li in tea infusions was in the range 0.02–1.36 µg/g of tea, and 1 cup (250 mL) of analysed infusions (together with a tap water) provides 2.2–3.0 µg of Li.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspalathus linearis 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aatomization 3abody fluids 3afood research 3afoods 3aherbal tea 3ahumans 3aleaves 3alithium 3amarkets 3anutrients 3atap water 3atissues1 aŻaneta, Kurpiewska1 aJadwiga, Mierczyk0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2015 Aug., v. 241, no. 2 p.289-293dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-015-2456-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009600165300001600261500001900277520128500296592002801581650001701609650001501626650001701641650001301658650001001671650002401681650002601705650001101731653001701742653002001759653001301779653003101792653000801823700001901831700001501850700001701865700001301882700001601895700001201911700001701923700002601940773025901966856008202225852000902307655001202316IND60717991420221119023608.0210112e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071799142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hpj.2020.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Changxi13aAn Ethylene-inhibited NF-YC Transcription Factor RhNF-YC9 Regulates Petal Expansion in Rose  ap. 419-427.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe speed of flower opening is closely related to their ornamental period. Ethylene functions as a negative regulator involved in the regulation of the petal expansion process. In this study, we isolated a NF-YC transcription factor gene, RhNF-YC9, from rose petals. RhNF-YC9 expression was induced at the early stages of flower opening but was inhibited by ethylene treatment. Silencing RhNF-YC9 decreased the speed of petal expansion from stage 2 to stage 5. The expressions of 11 cell expansion-related genes involved in cell wall loosening, cell turgor modulation, and cytoskeleton remodeling were significantly down-regulated in RhNF-YC9-silenced petals. We also found that silencing RhNF-YC9 decreased the expression of gibberellin acid (GA) biosynthetic gene RhGA20ox while significantly increasing the transcripts of GA catabolic gene RhGA2ox, reducing the accumulation of GA₄ and GA₇. The influence of ethylene treatment on the expression of RhGA20ox and RhGA2ox showed the same trend. These results together suggested that RhNF-YC9 positively regulated the speed of petal expansion and mediated the crosstalk between ethylene and GA. Our findings revealed a new insight into the function of NF-YC transcription factors involved in ethylene-regulated petal expansion.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosynthesis 3acell walls 3acytoskeleton 3aethylene 3agenes 3ahorticultural crops 3atranscription factors 3aturgor 0aRosa hybrida 0aPetal expansion 0aRhNF-YC9 0aTranscriptional regulation 0aGAs1 aHussain, Nisar1 aWang, Yaru1 aLi, Mingtong1 aLiu, Lin1 aQin, Meizhu1 aMa, Nan1 aGao, Junping1 aSun, Xiaoming,d1955-0 tHorticultural plant journal.g2020 Nov., v. 6, no. 6 p.419-427dElsevier B.V.aChinese Society for Horticultural Science (CSHS) and Institute of Vegetables and Flowers (IVF), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS)wJournal:23309x2468-01417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hpj.2020.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03433naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002400149245013400173300001600307520214600323592002802469650001502497650001202512650002102524650001602545650001302561650001602574650001202590650002002602650002202622650001102644650002002655650002302675650001702698650001702715650001202732700002202744700002102766700001902787773009902806856008502905852000902990655001202999IND4469003720221117030638.0141111e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446900372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2011.10.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLipasek, Rebecca A.10aEffects of anticaking agents and storage conditions on the moisture sorption, caking, and flowability of deliquescent ingredients  ap. 369-380.  aDeliquescent highly soluble crystalline ingredients are prone to caking and dissolution when they are stored above a certain relative humidity (RH) but exhibit minimal moisture adsorption below this RH. Anticaking agents are added to improve the flowability of powders and to prevent or reduce caking. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of anticaking agents on the moisture sorption behavior, flowability, and caking characteristics of deliquescent ingredients and blends thereof. Single deliquescent food ingredients (sodium chloride, sucrose, fructose, and citric acid) and binary systems (sodium chloride blended with sucrose, fructose, or citric acid) were used as the host powders, and silicon dioxide, calcium silicate, and calcium stearate were the three anticaking agents studied. Moisture sorption isotherms were generated to investigate the water–solid interactions of the anticaking and host powders. Following controlled RH storage treatments, caking was assessed by the sieve test and flowability by avalanche power and avalanche angle measurements. Formulation had variable effects on deliquescence behavior and moisture sorption, while formulation, storage RH, length of storage, and RH cycling all significantly affected the physical stability of the powder blends. Calcium stearate was the most effective anticaking agent at reducing moisture sorption and delaying the onset of deliquescence, as well as maintaining the flowability properties of all powders tested. In particular, calcium stearate was able to substantially alter the moisture sorption behavior of blends of deliquescent ingredients, which are inherently more susceptible to the deleterious effects of moisture due to deliquescence lowering. The results are of great significance because they show that the effectiveness of an anticaking agent in preventing moisture-induced caking depends on the complexity of the host powders as well as on the interaction with environmental moisture. Thus, the type of anticaking agent added to a deliquescent ingredient must be tailored to the host powder to enhance product quality and stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acalcium 3acalcium silicate 3acitric acid 3afructose 3aingredients 3apowders 3aproduct quality 3arelative humidity 3asilica 3asodium chloride 3asorption isotherms 3astearic acid 3astorage time 3asucrose1 aOrtiz, Julieta C.1 aTaylor, Lynne S.1 aMauer, Lisa J.0 tFood research international.g2012 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.369-380dElsevier Ltdx0963-99697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2011.10.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03501naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009900163300001800262500001900280520204700299592002802346650002102374650003402395650003202429650001502461650001702476650002202493650001902515650001102534650001102545650001702556650002102573650001602594650002202610650002602632650001802658650001302676700001502689700001502704700001602719700001602735700001702751700001302768773013602781856008102917852000902998655001203007IND60714610020221119212627.0201024e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071461002DNAL7 a10.1134/S10214437200601632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, X.-Q.10aCharacterization of Transcriptome Expression: The Response of Isatis indigotica to Salt Stress  ap. 1135-1143.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIsatis indigotica Fort. is extremely widely planted and used for the source of the traditional Chinese medicine Radix Isatidis (Ban-Lan-Gen), which had pharmacological activities such as anti-endotoxic, antibacterial, antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic. In the cultivation, salt stress could affect the yields of Radix Isatidis, and activate the secondary metabolism, eg. the contents of epigoitrin in root and indigo in leaf increased after a period of salt stress, which was possibly regulated by related genes. But in early salt stress, the molecular response of I. indigotica and expression of related genes are also worthy of our attention, which it helps us to more fully understand the molecular response mechanism of I. indigotica, so that we can make better use of “salt stress” to stimulate its secondary metabolism. To determine the molecular changes of I. indigotica in salt stress, the RNA-seq was carried out for the expression profile with NGS QC Toolkit (v2.3.2) software, the Illumina HiSeqTM 2000 in Biomarker Technologies Co., Ltd and ESTScan program. The de novo assembly resulted in 33109 unigenes from more than 18.71 Gb data. Of these, 28868 unigenes were annotated using KOG, KEGG, Nr, Nt, Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL databases. Then, 11829 simple sequence repeats were found in unigenes and 7725 primers were designed. After detecting the expression value, the edgeR package found 135 DEG, of those 48 were up-regulated and 87 were down-regulated. The expression pattern of genes that was validated by qPCR indicated that mitochondrial transcription termination factor, non-LTR retroelement reverse transcriptase and CYP79F1 which involved in the first step in biosynthesis of core short-chain aliphatic glucosinolates might play a vital role in coping with salt stress. Although one assembly of I. indigotica unigenes were obtained before, this study would provide more molecular data for further analysis, and facilitate studies on the functions of genes involved in the salt related signal pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIsatis tinctoria 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3abiomarkers 3abiosynthesis 3acomputer software 3aglucosinolates 3aindigo 3aleaves 3amitochondria 3aplant physiology 3asalt stress 3asequence analysis 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 3aunigenes1 aTan, H.-W.1 aShi, S.-L.1 aWang, L.-L.1 aWang, F.-Q.1 aWang, K.

Time resolved SAXS study of the BCP bulk samples during thermal annealing indicated that the BCPs phase separate into 10nm scale periodical structures. The solvent vapor annealing induced self-organizations of the BCP into different phases depending on ϕMH and the weight fraction of THF/H2O. BCPs with relatively higher ØMH, MH-b-PMMA3k (ϕMH=0.27) and MH-b-PMMA5k (ϕMH=0.16) self-organized into lamellar phases while the BCP sample with relatively lower ϕMH, MH-b-PMMA9k (ϕMH=0.10), self-organized into cylindrical phase by using THF/H2O=1/4 (w/w). On the other hand, the solvent vapor annealing with larger fraction of THF, i.e. THF/H2O=2/3 (w/w), induced cylindrical phases for MH-b-PMMA3k and MH-b-PMMA5k.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acomposite polymers 3apolymethylmethacrylate 0aPoly-/oligosaccharide-based block copolymers 0aRod-coil block copolymers 0aSelf-assembly 0aSolvent vapor annealing1 aOtsuka, I.1 aBouilhac, C.1 aRochas, C.1 aBarreto, P.L.M.1 aBorsali, R.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 170 p.15-22dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.04.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01308naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245010900165300001800274520034400292592002800636650002300664650001100687650001300698650001900711650001400730700002800744700001800772773013300790856007400923852000900997655001201006IND60639165420221117024833.0190501e20170706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063916542DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc03060f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSidhureddy, Boopathi10aFrom graphite to interconnected reduced graphene oxide: one-pot synthesis and supercapacitor application  ap. 7828-7831.  aAn innovative one-pot approach for the scalable production of novel interconnected reduced graphene oxide (IC-RGO) is demonstrated, and we name it the streamlined Hummers method (SHM).

Imperfect detection of larvae is common, because larval fish are small and unevenly distributed in space and time, and coastal tributaries are often large and heterogeneous. We estimated detection probabilities of larval fish from several taxa in the Maumee and Detroit rivers, the two largest tributaries of Lake Erie. We then demonstrated how accounting for imperfect detection influenced (1) the probability of observing taxa as present relative to sampling effort and (2) abundance indices for larval fish of two Detroit River species. We found that detection probabilities ranged from 0.09 to 0.91 but were always less than 1.0, indicating that imperfect detection is common among taxa and between systems. In general, taxa with high fecundities, small larval length at hatching, and no nesting behaviors had the highest detection probabilities. Also, detection probabilities were higher in the Maumee River than in the Detroit River. Accounting for imperfect detection produced up to fourfold increases in abundance indices for Lake Whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis and Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum . The effect of accounting for imperfect detection in abundance indices was greatest during periods of low abundance for both species. Detection information can be used to determine the appropriate level of sampling effort for larval fishes and may improve management and conservation decisions based on larval fish data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoregonus clupeaformis 3aDorosoma cepedianum 3afish 3ahabitats 3ahatching 3alarvae 3anesting 3aprobability 3arivers 3aspace and time 3aspawning 3aLake Erie1 aDuFour, Mark R.1 aMayer, Christine M.1 aRoseman, Edward F.1 aDeBruyne, Robin L.0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2014 July 4, v. 143, no. 4 p.1011-1027dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19703x1548-86597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2014.9112043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01941naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245015700176300001800333520063100351592002800982650002001010650001501030650002301045650002301068650001701091650001001108650001901118653002701137653003101164653001301195653001601208653001601224700002101240700002201261700002201283700002101305773011201326856008401438852000901522655001201531IND60604029320221119233939.0180716e20150722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060402932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2015.05.1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolakowski, Robert V.10aSynthesis of a C2-aryl-pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine monomer enabling the convergent construction of symmetrical and non-symmetrical dimeric analogs  ap. 4512-4515.  aWe disclose the synthesis of a versatile C2-aryl-pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD) monomer that enables the late-stage diversification and synthesis of PBD dimers.

T7 ssDNA binding protein (gp2.5) can rapidly facilitate this hybridization, but the mechanism and kinetic process remain unknown. As determined by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and rapid kinetic analysis methods, gp2.5 binding coiling ssDNA to form gp2.5-ssDNA complex is the rate-limiting step for the entire DNA hybridization process. Afterward, the hybridization initiates from either the terminus or the internal part of ssDNA at a nucleation rate of 0.45 s⁻¹. The remaining DNA strands are hybridized in a zippering mode at a rate of 0.07 s⁻¹, limited by the dissociation of gp2.5 from ssDNA. The gp2.5-faciliated hybridization rate constant (74 μM⁻¹s⁻¹) is much higher than the spontaneous hybridization rate (1.7 μM⁻¹s⁻¹) in the absence of gp2.5. These hybridization mechanism and kinetic process are different from those by other ssDNA binding proteins, such as T4 gp32, Escherichia coli SSB protein and recA protein. Compare with E. coli SSB, the relatively slower association of gp2.5 to ssDNA and faster dissociation of gp2.5 from ssDNA are probably the major reasons to facilitate the rapid hybridization. This study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanism of the recombination and repair processes and proposes a basis for improvement in their associated biotechnologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abinding proteins 3abiophysics 3abiotechnology 3adissociation 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3akinetics 3amolecular biology 3anucleic acid hybridization 3asingle-stranded DNA 0aT7 ssDNA binding protein gp2.5 0aZipper hybridization 0aHybridization of complementary ssDNA 0aFRET 0aRapid quench 0aThe abbreviations used are: 2-AP 0aCy3 0aCy5 0adsDNA 0aFRET 0aGp2.5 0aGp32 0assDNA1 aWu, Siying1 aXiong, Jingyuan1 aLi, Huangyuan1 aJiang, Yiguo1 aZhang, Huidong0 tBiochimie.g2018 Apr., v. 147 p.1-12dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6254x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2017.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03297naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245021000181300001400391520151100405592002801916596004201944596018901986650001502175650001502190650001502205650001602220650001402236650001702250650002402267650001602291650002002307650001302327650001202340651001002352653001302362653001002375653001602385653002402401653001602425653002002441653001602461653001702477653000902494653001202503700002802515700002302543773010702566856008502673852000902758655001202767IND60631213620221120132852.0190219e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063121362DNAL7 a10.1080/00305316.2018.14397812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSureshan, Pavittu Meethal10aRecord of six Pteromalid parasitoids from the soybean stem fly Melanagromyza sojae Zehntner with the description of a new species of Sphegigaster Spinola (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea) from Maharashtra, India  ap. 19-33.  aField surveys were carried out in Pune area of Maharashtra state in India during June–September of 2014 and 2015 to determine the parasitoid species associated with stem fly Melanagromyza sojae Zehntner infesting soybean. Ten species of parasitoid wasps emerged from the collected materials and included six species of Pteromlaidae, and one species each from the families Eurytomidae, Figitidae (= Eucoilidae), Braconidae and Eulophidae. Six pteromalid parasitoids recorded were: Chlorocytus amaravathicus, Colotrechnus melghaticus, Halticoptera propinqua, Syntomopus carinatus, Syntomopus nigrus and Sphegigaster punensis sp. nov. Sureshan, Fand & Nikhil. Among pteromalids, S. punensis was dominant parasitoid during the mid-season, whereas C. amaravathicus, C. melghaticus, H. propinqua, S. carinatus and S. nigrus were present in low number towards the end of the season. Whilst S. carinatus constitute an already reported parasitoid species from M. sojae, this study reports for the first time M. sojae as a new host for the parasitoid species viz., C. amaravathicus, C. melghaticus and S. nigrus. For H. propinqua, this is the first record of the genus and species from M. sojae whereas, Sphegigaster punensis sp. nov. Sureshan, Fand & Nikhil is described for the first time as a new pteromalid species. Keys to the pteromlaid parastioids of M. sojae in general and species of Sphegigaster in particular are provided. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:A9C5E4C0-1251-458D-82CD-2741C4F43A93  aPublisher supplied data  aSB/YS/LS-06/2013cGovernment of India  aFast Track Scheme for Young Scientists” programcScience and Engineering Research Board, Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India 3aBraconidae 3aEucoilidae 3aEulophidae 3aEurytomidae 3aFigitidae 3aHalticoptera 3aMelanagromyza sojae 3anew species 3aparasitic wasps 3asoybeans 3asurveys 3aIndia 0aBaramati 0aIndia 0aMaharashtra 0aMelanagromyza sojae 0anew species 0anew host record 0aparasitoids 0aPteromalidae 0aPune 0asoybean1 aFand, Babasaheb Bhaskar1 aNikhil, Kizhakayil0 tOriental insects.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 53, no. 1 p.19-33dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19694x2157-87457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00305316.2018.14397813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245014000174300001800314500001500332520182200347592002802169650000902197650001602206650001602222650001602238650001502254650001702269650002202286650002002308650001502328650001202343650000902355650000902364650001602373650002502389650001902414650001002433650001802443650002302461650001302484650001202497651001902509653001702528653003702545700002402582700002202606700001902628773014202647856008402789852000902873655001202882IND60123504520221118041242.0171112e20140704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012350452DNAL7 a10.1080/00028487.2014.9112052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurawski, Steven A.10aPrevalence of External Skin Lesions and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Concentrations in Gulf of Mexico Fishes, Post-Deepwater Horizon  ap. 1084-1097.  a2019-12-04  aWe surveyed offshore fish populations in the Gulf of Mexico in 2011 and 2012, following persistent reports of abnormal skin lesions and other pathologies in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The incidence of skin lesions in 2011 sampling was most frequent in some bottom-dwelling species along the continental shelf edge north of the Deepwater Horizon site. Longline surveys revealed that by 2012 the overall frequency of lesions in northern Gulf of Mexico (NGM) fishes in the vicinity of the Deepwater Horizon had declined 53%, with severity also declining. Relatively high concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites (up to 470,000 ng naphthalene equivalents/g bile wet weight), indicative of oil-related pollution, were found in fish bile in 2011; concentrations of summed PAHs measured in fish liver and muscle were relatively low (<35 ng/g) due to the efficient metabolism of these compounds by teleost fish. Significant declines in bile concentrations of naphthalene and phenanthrene metabolites in Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus between 2011 and 2012 indicate an episodic exposure to elevated levels of hydrocarbons of petrogenic origin. The composition of PAH parent compounds and alkylated homologs in Red Snapper liver samples was highly correlated with oil collected at the Deepwater Horizon wellhead but was less coherent with other PAH sources in the NGM. The elevated 2011 prevalence of skin lesions in some NGM species was unrelated to surface salinity or temperature anomalies and was not the result of an epizootic observable in our histopathology samples but was positively correlated with PAH concentration. Thus, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that elevated skin lesion frequency is unrelated to PAH exposure from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  aPublisher supplied data 3afish 3anaphthalene 3ametabolites 3acorrelation 3aoil spills 3askin lesions 3acontinental shelf 3awater pollution 3ametabolism 3amuscles 3aoils 3abile 3atemperature 3aLutjanus campechanus 3ahistopathology 3aliver 3aphenanthrenes 3aepizootic diseases 3asalinity 3asurveys 3aGulf of Mexico 0aphenanthrene 0apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons1 aHogarth, William T.1 aPeebles, Ernst B.1 aBarbeiri, Luiz0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2014 July 4, v. 143, no. 4 p.1084-1097dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19703x1548-86597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2014.9112053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245016500198300001800363500002000381520148800401592002801889596006401917596003401981596004802015650001502063650001602078650002102094650002002115650002602135650001302161700006102174773013502235856007402370852000902444655001202453IND60673150020221116183038.0191018e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067315002DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.248792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMistry, Devesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0012-678110aMechanical deformations of a liquid crystal elastomer at director angles between 0° and 90°: Deducing an empirical model encompassing anisotropic nonlinearity  ap. 1367-1377.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDespite the wealth of studies reporting mechanical properties of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs), no theory can currently describe their complete mechanical anisotropy and nonlinearity. Here, we present the first comprehensive study of mechanical anisotropy in an all‐acrylate LCE via tensile tests that simultaneously track liquid crystal (LC) director rotation. We then use an empirical approach to gain a deeper insight into the LCE's mechanical responses at values of strain, up to 1.5, for initial director orientations between 0° and 90°. Using a method analogous to time–temperature superposition, we create master curves for the LCE's mechanical response and use these to deduce a model that accurately predicts the load curve of the LCE for stresses applied at angles between 15° and 70° relative to the initial LC director. This LCE has been shown to exhibit auxetic behavior for deformations perpendicular to the director. Interestingly, our empirical model predicts that the LCE will further demonstrate auxetic behavior when stressed at angles between 54° and 90° to the director. Our approach could be extended to any LCE; so it represents a significant step forward toward models that would aid the further development of LCE theory and the design and modeling of LCE‐based technologies. © 2019 The Authors.

LST data retrieved from thermal infrared (TIR) band imagery, however, tend to have a coarser spatial resolution (e.g., 100 m for Landsat 8) than surface reflectance (SR) data collected from shortwave bands on the same instrument (e.g., 30 m for Landsat). Spatial sharpening of LST data using the higher resolution multi-band SR data provides an important path for improved agricultural monitoring at sub-field scales. A previously developed Data Mining Sharpener (DMS) approach has shown great potential in the sharpening of Landsat LST using Landsat SR data co-collected over various landscapes. This work evaluates DMS performance for sharpening ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) LST (~70 m native resolution) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) LST (375 m) data using Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) SR data, providing the basis for generating 30-m LST data at a higher temporal frequency than afforded by Landsat alone. To account for the misalignment between ECOSTRESS/VIIRS and Landsat/HLS caused by errors in registration and orthorectification, we propose a modified version of the DMS approach that employs a relaxed box size for energy conservation (EC). Sharpening experiments were conducted over three study sites in California, and results were evaluated visually and quantitatively against LST data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) flights and from Landsat 8. Over the three sites, the modified DMS technique showed improved sharpening accuracy over the standard DMS for both ECOSTRESS and VIIRS, suggesting the effectiveness of relaxing EC box in relieving misalignment-induced errors. To achieve reasonable accuracy while minimizing loss of spatial detail due to the EC box size increase, an optimal EC box size of 180–270 m was identified for ECOSTRESS and about 780 m for VIIRS data based on experiments from the three sites. Results from this work will facilitate the development of a prototype system that generates high spatiotemporal resolution LST products for improved agricultural water use monitoring by synthesizing multi-source remote sensing data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural landscapes 3aplant stress 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asurface temperature 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3awater utilization 3aCalifornia 0aThermal sharpening 0aLand surface temperature 0aData Mining Sharpener 0aEvapotranspiration1 aAnderson, Martha C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0748-55251 aGao, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1865-28461 aHain, Christopher1 aSun, Liang1 aYang, Yun1 aKnipper, Kyle R.1 aKustas, William P.1 aTorres-Rua, Alfonso1 aSchull, Mitch0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 251 p.112055-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1120553Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/71067273Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245010500160300001600265520078000281592002801061650001301089650000801102650001401110650001201124650001001136650001101146650000901157650001201166650001201178650001201190650001601202650001101218650001301229650001401242650001001256650001401266650001101280650001901291650001801310650004301328650001101371650000901382650001101391650001201402650001201414650001101426650001501437650000901452650000901461650000801470650001601478650001101494650001901505650001801524650001201542650001001554700001701564700001601581700001801597700001601615700001701631773012201648856008101770852000901851655001201860IND60438173020221119041619.0151023e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043817302DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-015-2459-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Min12aA novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification method for detection of the carrot materials in foods  ap. 295-302.  aCarrot is an important elicitor of food allergy.

In a first step, the carbohydrate polymers were oxidised by sodium periodate to yield aldehyde functionalised carbohydrate polymers. The presence of aldehyde groups was exploited to attach catechin by an acid catalysed nucleophilic reaction. The degree of catechin functionalisation could be easily tuned by varying the acid concentration in the reaction mixture, achieving catechin functionalisation levels of up to 48% for dextran aldehyde catechin, 35% for chitosan-aldehyde-catechin and 22% for sodium alginate aldehyde catechin. 1H, 1H-13C HSQC and DOSY NMR were performed to elucidate the structural differences between the three aldehyde functionalised polysaccharides and how this affects their reactivity and conjugation behaviour. All three carbohydrate polymer-catechin conjugates showed superior free-radical scavenging activity compared with the non-functionalised polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3acatechin 3achitosan 3adextran 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3asodium alginate 0aCatechin 0aDextran 0aChitosan 0aSodium alginate 0aSodium periodate 0aNMR1 aJofri, Aziidah1 aThomas, Donald S.1 aVittorio, Orazio1 aKavallaris, Maria1 aBoyer, Cyrille0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2017 Aug. 01, v. 169 p.480-494dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.04.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03766naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245012100160500001900281520187800300592002802178650001502206650001102221650001602232650001902248650001502267650001202282650002402294650001502318650001602333650002502349650001402374650003102388650001902419650001602438650001502454650001502469650002302484653003302507653003402540653001002574653001802584653004102602653002902643653001702672653001202689653001702701653003002718700001902748700002102767700002102788700002202809700002102831700001602852700002702868773012902895856008203024961001303106852000903119655001203128IND60710672920221117110842.0201125e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071067292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1120622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xing10aSynergistic use of SMAP and OCO-2 data in assessing the responses of ecosystem productivity to the 2018 U.S. drought  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSoil moisture and gross primary productivity (GPP) estimates from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) provide new opportunities for understanding the relationship between soil moisture and terrestrial photosynthesis over large regions. Here we explored the potential of the synergistic use of SMAP and OCO-2 based data for monitoring the responses of ecosystem productivity to drought. We used complementary observational information on root-zone soil moisture and GPP (9 km) from SMAP and fine-resolution SIF (0.05°; GOSIF) derived from OCO-2 SIF soundings. We compared the spatial pattern and temporal evolution of anomalies of these variables over the conterminous U.S. during the 2018 drought, and examined to what extent they could characterize the drought-induced variations of flux tower GPP and crop yield data. Our results showed that SMAP GPP and GOSIF, both freely available online, could well capture the spatial extent and dynamics of the impacts of drought indicated by the U.S. Drought Monitor maps and the SMAP root-zone soil moisture deficit. Over the U.S. Southwest, monthly anomalies of soil moisture showed significant positive correlations with those of SMAP GPP (R² = 0.44, p < 0.001) and GOSIF (R² = 0.76, p < 0.001), demonstrating strong water availability constraints on plant productivity across dryland ecosystems. We further found that SMAP GPP and GOSIF captured the impact of drought on tower GPP and crop yield. Our results suggest that synergistic use of SMAP and OCO-2 data products can reveal the drought evolution and its impact on ecosystem productivity and carbon uptake at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and demonstrate the value of SMAP and OCO-2 for studying ecosystem function, carbon cycling, and climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3acarbon 3achlorophyll 3aclimate change 3acrop yield 3adrought 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental impact 3aevolution 3agross primary productivity 3aphotosynthesis 3arhizosphere 3asatellites 3asoil water 3asoil water deficit 0aSoil Moisture Active Passive 0aOrbiting Carbon Observatory-2 0aGOSIF 0aSoil moisture 0aSun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence 0aGross primary production 0aWater stress 0aDryland 0aCarbon cycle 0aEnhanced vegetation index1 aXiao, Jingfeng1 aKimball, John S.1 aReichle, Rolf H.1 aScott, Russell L.1 aLitvak, Marcy E.1 aBohrer, Gil1 aFrankenberg, Christian0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 251 p.112062-dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1120623Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245012300168300001600291500001500307520111900322592002801441650002501469650004001494650002601534650002601560650001701586650002901603650001401632650001101646650001101657650001701668650002701685650001101712650001801723650002901741650002001770650001701790650002601807650001301833653002701846700002401873700002201897700002301919773010701942856004802049852000902097655001202106IND4471603620221116204808.0120923e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447160362DNAL7 a10.1007/s11130-012-0303-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aČesonienė, Laima10aDetermination of the Total Phenolic and Anthocyanin Contents and Antimicrobial Activity of Viburnum Opulus Fruit Juice  ap. 256-261.  a2019-12-06  aViburnum opulus is a plant with fruits that are rich in biologically active substances, making it valuable to the food and pharmaceutical industries. Here, we present our study of the total phenolic and anthocyanin contents and antimicrobial activity in the fruit juice of six V. opulus L. accessions. The cultivar ‘Krasnaya Grozd’ was notable for its exceptionally large amount of total phenolics, 1168 mg/100 g, with anthocyanins comprising 3–5 % of the total phenolic content. The evaluation of the antimicrobial properties confirmed that the juice of V. opulus fruits strongly inhibited the growth of a wide range of human pathogenic bacteria, both Gram-negative (Salmonella typhimurium and S. agona) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Lysteria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis) organisms. Conversely, the yeasts Debaryomyces hansenii and Torulaspora delbrueckii showed complete resistance to the fruit juice, whereas a low sensitivity was demonstrated by Trichosporon cutaneum, Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, S. cerevisiae 12R, and Candida parapsilosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida parapsilosis 3aKluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aanthocyanins 3aantimicrobial properties 3acultivars 3afruits 3ahumans 3aTrichosporon 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3ayeasts 3afood industry 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aViburnum opulus 3afruit juices 3aDebaryomyces hansenii 3abacteria 0aSalmonella typhimurium1 aDaubaras, Remigijus1 aViškelis, Pranas1 aŠarkinas, Antanas0 tPlant foods for human nutrition.g2012 Sept., v. 67, no. 3 p.256-261dSpringer-Verlagx0921-96687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11130-012-0303-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03622naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003900117040001800156100002700174245008500201300001600286520138300302536019101685592002801876596010301904650002002007650001502027650002502042650001202067650002302079650001202102650002002114650003302134650002402167650001802191650001602209650001502225650001002240650002502250650002602275650002402301650001302325650002302338650001502361650001202376650001202388650002302400650002502423650001902448653001102467653002002478653001902498653001602517653002302533700003002556700002702586773014102613856008602754856011402840961000902954852000902963655001202972IND60672305420221116214320.0200513e20191102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067230542DNAL7 a10113/67230542hdl7 a10.1080/14620316.2019.16144862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNikagolla, N.

Soluble silicon (Si) acts as a disease control agent for many plants. Climacteric pattern of ripening and postharvest diseases limit the shelf life of banana during transportation to local and overseas destinations. The ability of banana fruit to absorb Si upon postharvest dip treatment and if so, the absorption of Si confers any effects on disease reduction and keeping quality, were investigated. Banana dipped in 1500 µg mL⁻¹ silicon for 20 minutes showed longer shelf life among different Si concentration × dipping time treatment combinations. Si treatment resulted significantly lower rates of ethylene production, respiration and delayed time taken for fungal rot development compared to non Si-treated (control) fruit. Total soluble silicon content in peel tissues was significantly higher [0.54% dry weight (dw)] in Si-treated versus control fruit (0.13% dw). Si treatment had no effect on total Si content, total soluble solids (TSS) content, titratable acidity (TA) or antioxidant activity in banana fruit pulp. This indicates that dip-treatment allowed Si to penetrate and remain in peel without reaching fruit pulp while extending the shelf life without altering the organoleptic properties of banana fruit pulp.  aWe thank the National Science Foundation of Sri Lanka (Grant No- NSF/RG/2016/AG/03) for funding this work and the National Institute of Fundamental Studies for facilitating gas analysis.  aPublisher supplied data  aNSF/RG/2016/AG/03cNational Science Foundation of Sri Lankadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100008982 3aGRAS substances 3aabsorption 3aantioxidant activity 3abananas 3aclimacteric fruits 3adipping 3adisease control 3aenvironmental sustainability 3aethylene production 3afood industry 3afood safety 3afruit pulp 3afungi 3apostharvest diseases 3apostharvest treatment 3apotassium silicates 3aripening 3asensory properties 3ashelf life 3asilicon 3atissues 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3atransportation 0aBanana 0akeeping quality 0aMusa acuminata 0apostharvest 0apotassium silicate1 aUdugala-Ganehenege, M.

However, proper weed management is a major limiting factor in the development of DSR. ‘Tidy field technology’ (TFT) is a new non-transgenic herbicide-resistant (HR) cropping technology, which refers to ‘herbicide-resistant crops combined with broad-spectrum herbicide’, and has been widely confirmed to effectively suppress weed populations in agriculture. However, it is rarely applied in DSR production in China. Therefore, field experiments were conducted to determine the effects of TFT on rice growth and weed control in 2019 and 2020. In this study, two rice varieties, Huanghuazhan-HHZ (Vc) and herbicide-resistant HHZ (Vr) were adopted and practiced with broad-spectrum herbicide management (Hb) and conventional herbicide management (Hc). An equal amount of water was sprayed on Vc as a control (CK). Thus, there were five treatments: VrHb, VrHc, VcHb, VcHc and CK. The grain yields of VrHb was increased by 8.4% and 160.3% in 2019, and 16.0% and 226.6% in 2020 compared with VrHc and CK, respectively. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in grain yield between VrHb and VcHc, but the total economic benefit of VrHb was significantly higher than that of VcHc. In addition, the tiller number, leaf area index (LAI), and aboveground total dry weight (TDW) of VrHb were significantly higher than VrHc, VcHc and CK. In contrast, weed species and density under VrHb were significantly lower than those under VrHc, VcHc and CK. Overall, TFT (VrHb) could replace conventional weed management for DSR due to a better weed control effect and higher economic benefit with similar or even higher grain yield. However, it is necessary to explore the effects of TFT residue on soil physical and chemical properties, microorganisms and the growth of subsequent crops in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical weed control 3adirect seeding 3afinancial economics 3agrain yield 3aherbicide resistance 3aherbicides 3aleaf area index 3amechanization 3aresearch 3arice 3asoil 3aweeds 3aChina 0aDirect-seeded rice 0aEconomic benefits 0aTidy field technology 0aHerbicide 0aWeed control1 aJiang, Min1 aNie, Lixiao1 aSun, Huijuan1 aChen, Lei1 aMan, Jianguo0 tField crops research.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 277 p.108408-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2021.1084083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03994naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003600132024001100168040001800179100002000197245012700217300001400344506017300358520158600531592002802117650002402145650002102169650001802190650002102208650002802229650002502257650001202282650001702294650001902311650001502330650001102345650002002356650001902376650002002395650003202415650001602447650001502463650001402478650001002492650001302502650001402515651001402529651001802543651001802561653002202579653002502601653003102626653000902657653000902666653002802675700002202703700001602725700003402741700002302775700001902798773013602817856008302953856011203036956010203148961001303250852000903263655001203272IND60006188020221214223516.0190410e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000618802DNAL7 a3131302aris7 a10113/618802hdl7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.04.0082doi8 ans8967  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGross, Aaron D.10aPharmacological characterization of a tyramine receptor from the southern cattle tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus  ap. 47-53.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe southern cattle tick (Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus) is a hematophagous external parasite that vectors the causative agents of bovine babesiosis or cattle tick fever, Babesia bovis and B. bigemina, and anaplasmosis, Anaplasma marginale. The southern cattle tick is a threat to the livestock industry in many locations throughout the world. Control methods include the use of chemical acaricides including amitraz, a formamidine insecticide, which is proposed to activate octopamine receptors. Previous studies have identified a putative octopamine receptor from the southern cattle tick in Australia and the Americas. Furthermore, this putative octopamine receptor could play a role in acaricide resistance to amitraz. Recently, sequence data indicated that this putative octopamine receptor is probably a type-1 tyramine receptor (TAR1). In this study, the putative TAR1 was heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells, and the expressed receptor resulted in a 39-fold higher potency for tyramine compared to octopamine. Furthermore, the expressed receptor was strongly antagonized by yohimbine and cyproheptadine, and mildly antagonized by mianserin and phentolamine. Tolazoline and naphazoline had agonistic or modulatory activity against the expressed receptor, as did the amitraz metabolite, BTS-27271; however, this was only observed in the presence of tyramine. The southern cattle tick's tyramine receptor may serve as a target for the development of anti-parasitic compounds, in addition to being a likely target of formamidine insecticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaplasma marginale 3aBabesia bigemina 3aBabesia bovis 3aChinese hamsters 3aRhipicephalus microplus 3aacaricide resistance 3aamitraz 3aanaplasmosis 3aanimal ovaries 3ababesiosis 3acattle 3acontrol methods 3acyproheptadine 3adisease vectors 3alivestock and meat industry 3ametabolites 3aoctopamine 3areceptors 3aticks 3atyramine 3ayohimbine 3aAustralia 3aNorth America 3aSouth America 0aTyramine receptor 0aSouthern cattle tick 0aG-protein-coupled receptor 0aGPCR 0aTick 0aRhipicephalus microplus1 aTemeyer, Kevin B.1 aDay, Tim A.1 aPérez de León, Adalberto A.1 aKimber, Michael J.1 aCoats, Joel R.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2015 Aug., v. 63 p.47-53dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48131x0965-17487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.04.0083Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/618803Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Log%20313130%20Temeyer.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245007400211300002000285520133700305592002801642596005601670596008701726596008701813650001101900650001301911650001801924650001901942650001501961650001501976650001501991650001402006650001302020650001102033650001302044650001402057650001702071650001702088650001702105650001502122651002002137700002202157700002302179773015502202856008302357852000902440655001202449IND60761563420221122063232.0220120e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076156342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-15250-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChernova, Ekaterina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2135-454010aOccurrence of pharmaceuticals in the Eastern Gulf of Finland (Russia)  ap. 68871-68884.  aThe presence of substances of emerging concern—pharmaceuticals—in marine environments has been studied to a lesser extent compared to fresh and wastewaters. This is the first study of pharmaceutical distribution in the Russian part of the Baltic Sea. Among 18 pharmaceuticals previously detected in influent waters of Saint-Petersburg WWTPs, 7 compounds (caffeine [81% of samples], carbamazepine [81%], ketoprofen [60%], diclofenac [23 %], ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, and clarithromycin) were recorded in seawater samples in a range of measured concentrations from 0.1 to 4452 ng L⁻¹. Antibiotics were presented in trace concentrations. In sediment samples, 6 pharmaceuticals (0.1–66.2 ng g⁻¹) were detected. The most common was carbamazepine (80%). The remaining compounds were located in decreasing frequency as follows: ketoprofen, trimethoprim, drotaverine, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin. Some specific features of the Gulf of Finland affecting the distribution of pharmaceutical concentrations were highlighted—among the most important, the megapolis of St. Petersburg with its population over 5 million and freshwater input by the Neva River (high urbanization of the territory with a potent dilution factor). We discussed the suitable set of anthropogenic markers for the Russian part of the Gulf of Finland.  aPublisher supplied data  aER90 HAZLESScEstonian Russian Project ER90 HAZLESS  acontract № AAAA-А19-119020190099-1cFederal Agency for Scientific Organizations  acontract № AAAA-А19-119020690091-0cFederal Agency for Scientific Organizations 3aRussia 3acaffeine 3aciprofloxacin 3aclarithromycin 3adiclofenac 3afreshwater 3aketoprofen 3apollution 3aresearch 3arivers 3aseawater 3asediments 3atetracycline 3atrimethoprim 3aurbanization 3awastewater 3aGulf of Finland1 aZhakovskaya, Zoya1 aBerezina, Nadezhda0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Dec., v. 28, no. 48 p.68871-68884dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15250-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245009400210300002000304506007600324520127800400592002801678506003701706650003001743650002801773650001801801650001701819650001801836650001201854650001601866653001601882653001801898653000901916700002301925700001901948700001901967773019401986856007902180852000902259655001202268IND60178817020221207103306.0150604e20141216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017881702DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14072261112doi7 aPMC42733882pmcid7 a254224702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScheffler, Kathleen10aOscillatory AAA⁺ ATPase Knk1 constitutes a novel morphogenetic pathway in fission yeast  ap. 17899-17904.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCellular morphogenesis relies partly on cell polarization by the cytoskeleton. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe , it is well established that microtubules (MTs) deliver the spatial cue Tea1, a kelch repeat protein, to the tip regions to direct the growth machinery at the cell tips driving the linear extension of the rod-shaped organism to maintain a straight long axis. Here, we report the characterization of Knk1 (kink), a previously unidentified member of the superfamily of ATPases associated with various cellular activities (AAA ⁺), whose deletion causes a unique morphological defect characterized by the formation of kinks close to cell tips. Through genetic analysis, we place Knk1 into a novel pathway controlling cell shape independently of MTs and Tea1. Knk1 localizes at cell tips. Its localization is mediated by the Knk1 N terminus and is enhanced upon ATP binding to the C-terminal ATPase domain. Furthermore, Knk1 tip recruitment is regulated by SRC-like adaptor 2 (Sla2) and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42) independently of Sla2’s role in endocytosis. Finally, we discovered that Knk1 shows an anticorrelated oscillatory behavior between the two cell tips at a periodicity that is different from the reported oscillatory Cdc42 dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3acell division 3adissociation 3amorphogenesis 3amutants 3aperiodicity 0aoscillation 0amorphogenesis 0akink1 aRecouvreux, Pierre1 aPaoletti, Anne1 aTran, Phong T.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Dec. 16, v. 111, no. 50 p.17899-17904dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14072261113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245014200159300001800301500002000319520150300339592002801842596006001870596010401930650004402034650002202078650001602100650002602116650002602142650002402168650001402192650001302206650001702219650001102236650002102247650001302268650001902281700005702300700001702357700001402374700001202388700001602400700001602416700001502432773012402447856007902571852000902650655001202659IND60791924720221118234133.0220902e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079192472DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2022000862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Shili10aPreparation of a zeolite imidazole skeleton–silica hybrid monolithic column for amino acid analysis via capillary electrochromatography  ap. 1710-1723.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe developed a novel, convenient and low‐cost one‐pot strategy for preparing a zeolitic imidazolate framework‐8 (ZIF‐8)–silica hybrid monolithic column by adding ZIF‐8 directly to a polymer solution of the silica matrix. The simulated stationary phase and monolithic column prepared under optimal conditions were characterized using X‐ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis nitrogen physisorption and zeta potential. The results obtained confirmed the successful introduction of ZIF‐8 into the silica monolithic column, and the prepared monolithic column exhibited good permeability and physicochemical stability. A capillary electrochromatography method was developed based on a ZIF‐8–silica hybrid monolithic column through which 15 mixed amino acids, 4 neutral compounds, 4 nipagin esters and 2 chlorinated fungicides were separated in 14, 5, 7 and 6 min, respectively, under optimal conditions. The relative standard deviations retention times and column efficiencies in run‐to‐run, day‐to‐day and column‐to‐column varied in the ranges of 1.90%–2.21%, 2.13%–2.51% and 3.08%–6.65%, respectively, which demonstrated that ZIF‐8–silica hybrid monolithic column exhibited satisfactory reproducibility and stability. The incorporation of ZIF‐8 into a silica monolithic column is a promising method for preparing novel monolithic columns composed of a metal–organic framework.  aPublisher supplied data  a135509304cHeilongjiang Provincial Education Department  a202110232093cthe student innovation and entrepreneurship training program of Heilongjiang Province 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aamino acids 3acoordination polymers 3aelectrochromatography 3aelectron microscopy 3aimidazole 3anitrogen 3apermeability 3asilica 3athermogravimetry 3azeolites 3azeta potential1 aCui, Hongshou1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5569-11771 aChu, Hongtao1 aGao, Lidi1 aLi, Xue1 aTang, Yimin1 aYou, Xingyu1 aDong, Qing0 tElectrophoresis.g2022 Sept., v. 43, no. 16-17 p.1710-1723dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938548x0173-08357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2022000863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003700146245012900183300001800312520130100330592002801631650001501659650000901674650001701683650001301700650002301713650001901736650001401755650001201769650001301781650002201794700002201816700002601838700002401864700002301888773012701911856008202038852000902120655001202129IND60566161320221120134615.0170403e20160414xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056616132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b001432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBallestas-Barrientos, Alfonso R.10aSynthesis and Linear and Nonlinear Photophysical Characterization of Two Symmetrical Pyrene-Terminated Squaraine Derivatives  ap. 7829-7838.  aTwo indole-based squaraine dyes, bearing two pyrenyl groups through vinyl or ethynyl linkers, were synthesized with the aim of enhancing the intramolecular charge transfer interaction in addition to improving their optical properties. The absorption and emission properties of these derivatives were determined to gain insight into the intensity of this type of interaction, their aggregation behavior, and for comparison with results obtained through quantum chemical calculations. Both compounds exhibited high photochemical stability, high molar absorptivity, large fluorescence quantum yields, and relatively low tendency of forming excimers in several solvents. Nonlinear spectroscopic studies revealed two-photon absorption (2PA) cross section maxima greater than 10 000 GM (1 GM = 1 × 10–⁵⁰ cm⁴ s/photon), which are higher values relative to the indole-based squaraine core. Experimental results were compared with time-dependent DFT calculations. These observations contribute to the study of intramolecular charge transfer interaction, and its tailoring for the improvement of linear and nonlinear optical properties as well as suggests a paradigm in the construct of highly absorbing organic molecules containing pyrenyl groups for the development of new photonics materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adyes 3afluorescence 3amoieties 3aoptical properties 3aphotochemistry 3aphotonics 3aphotons 3asolvents 3aspectral analysis1 aWoodward, Adam W.1 aMoreshead, William V.1 aBondar, Mykhailo V.1 aBelfield, Kevin D.0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Apr. 14, v. 120, no. 14 p.7829-7838dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b001433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245013100161300001800292520165500310592002801965650001601993650004302009650002502052650002202077650001302099650001502112650000902127650001102136650001402147650001902161650002502180650001402205650001302219651001802232651001802250651003102268700002502299700001902324700002702343700002202370700002202392700002302414700002302437773012002460856007302580852000902653655001202662IND60340893720221122145835.0150809e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034089372DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.125572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJahner, Joshua P.10aRegional population differentiation in the morphologically diverse, elevationally widespread Nearctic skipper Polites sabuleti  ap. 1787-1799.  aAIM: To evaluate three phylogeographical models associated with the presence of mountains (montane vicariance, sky island and parapatry) as drivers of intraspecific diversification in the sandhill skipper, Polites sabuleti (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae), a morphologically variable species found in a variety of habitats from sea level to the alpine zone. LOCATION: Western North America. METHODS: The mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit II region was sequenced in 189 P. sabuleti individuals. Mitochondrial sequences were used in a spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA) to evaluate geographical population structure. AFLP markers were also generated for 347 individuals in order to estimate admixture proportions and examine population differentiation based on the nuclear genome. RESULTS: Twenty‐five mitochondrial haplotypes and 42 anonymous AFLP loci were found across 36 collection localities. Mitochondrial variation suggests a degree of regional population structure, although at least one of the inferred population groups extends over nearly the entire geographical range of the species. Analyses of nuclear data (AFLPs) identified five genetic clusters, including one restricted to high elevations in the Sierra Nevada. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of genetic variation within Polites sabuleti, a species with a broad elevational range, does not strictly support either mountain‐associated vicariance or ‘sky island’ isolation as the dominant process. Instead, we find complex population structure, including evidence for divergence between high‐ and low‐elevation populations in the Sierra Nevada mountains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHesperiidae 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3ahaplotypes 3aloci 3amodels 3amountains 3anuclear genome 3apopulation structure 3asea level 3avariance 3aArctic region 3aNorth America 3aSierra Nevada (California)1 aForister, Matthew L.1 aNice, Chris C.1 aFordyce, James Andrew,1 aWilson, Joseph S.1 aMurphy, Dennis D.1 aMarion, Zachary H.1 aShapiro, Arthur M.0 tJournal of biogeography.g2015 Sept., v. 42, no. 9 p.1787-1799dBlackwell Scientific Publications.x0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.125573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02173naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010200166300001400268520084400282592002801126650001001154650002601164650001601190650001101206650002601217650001701243653001101260653002501271653003301296653002601329653003201355700002101387700002101408700002101429700001701450700001201467773019201479856008301671852000901754655001201763IND60544231120221123034236.0190416e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054423112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eaef.2013.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Longsheng10aDistinguishing overripe berries of Japanese blue honeysuckle using hyperspectral imaging analysis  ap. 22-27.  aOverripe berries cannot be classified from ripe berries of Japanese blue honeysuckle using RGB color imaging analysis since they have the same color appearances. Hyperspectal imaging analysis was thus employed. First, a pixel discrimination function was generated based upon forward stepwise selection to select significant wavebands (751 nm and 420 nm) and linear discriminant analysis, and it was applied to all pixels of segmented berries. Then a majority rule was applied to each berry independently for fruit object classification, and the classification was improved by eroding the fruit edge area. The classification success rates of pixel discrimination and fruit object discrimination tests were 69.7% and 73.9%, respectively. This study showed the potential of identifying overripe berries using hyperspectral imaging analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3adiscriminant analysis 3aengineering 3afruits 3ahyperspectral imagery 3asmall fruits 0aHaskap 0aHyperspectral camera 0aLinear discriminant analysis 0aSignificant wavebands 0aStepwise variable selection1 aOkamoto, Hiroshi1 aShibata, Youichi1 aKataoka, Takashi1 aCui, Yongjie1 aLi, Rui0 tEngineering in agriculture, environment and food.g2014 Feb., v. 7, no. 1 p.22-27dElsevier B.V.aAsian Agricultural and Biological Engineering AssociationwJournal:21476x1881-83667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eaef.2013.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245015300163300002000316500001900336520102300355592002801378650002101406650001101427650002501438650001101463650002101474653002401495653003801519653002701557653001101584653003401595700002201629700006001651700001601711700003101727700006501758700002001823700006101843773014201904856007802046852000902124655001202133IND60741613120210617000000.0210616e20210602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074161312DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c043972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErvasti, Henri10aInkjet-Deposited Single-Wall Carbon Nanotube Micropatterns on Stretchable PDMS-Ag Substrate–Electrode Structures for Piezoresistive Strain Sensing  ap. 27284-27294.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPrinted piezoresistive strain sensors based on stretchable roll-to-roll screen-printed silver electrodes on polydimethylsiloxane substrates and inkjet-deposited single-wall carbon nanotube micropatterns are demonstrated in this work. With the optimization of surface wetting and inkjet printing parameters, well-defined microscopic line patterns of the nanotubes with a sheet resistance of <100 Ω/□ could be deposited between stretchable Ag electrodes on the plasma-treated substrate. The developed stretchable devices are highly sensitive to tensile strain with a gauge factor of up to 400 and a pressure sensitivity of ∼0.09 Pa–¹, respond to bending down to a radius of 1.5 mm, and are suitable for mounting on the skin to monitor and resolve various movements of the human body such as cardiac cycle, breathing, and finger flexing. This study indicates that inkjet deposition of nanomaterials can complement well other printing technologies to produce flexible and stretchable devices in a versatile manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3ahumans 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3asilver 3atensile strength 0aprinted electronics 0astretchable materials and devices 0apiezoresistive sensing 0astrain 0apressure, and bending sensors1 aJärvinen, Topias1 aPitkänen, Olli,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2870-32291 aBozó, Éva1 aHiitola-Keinänen, Johanna1 aHuttunen, Olli-Heikki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3457-91831 aHiltunen, Jussi1 aKordas, Krisztian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7331-12780 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 June 02, v. 13, no. 23 p.27284-27294dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c043973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03327naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006800151245011200219300001400331520180600345592002802151650001102179650001502190650001302205650001402218650001402232650002302246650001602269650001802285650001802303650001502321650001702336650001002353650002402363650002302387650001902410650001702429653001302446653001802459653002002477653001502497653003302512700002102545700002302566773014902589856008602738852000902824655001202833IND60672306220221116214536.0191231e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067230622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2019.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandeira-Dabarca, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8878-822310aMayflies avoid sweets: fish skin mucus amino sugars stimulate predator avoidance behaviour of Baetis larvae  ap. 35-45.  aNonconsumptive effects of predators can have knock-on effects on prey fitness, life history and population dynamics. However, the origin of cues stimulating predator avoidance behaviour and the mechanisms underlying prey responses need further investigation. Previous studies revealed that nonconsumptive effects of predatory fish on Baetis mayfly larvae are mediated by water-borne chemical cues released from fish mucus. However, there are conflicting results regarding the nature of these cues and the specific role of the activity of fish mucus-dwelling bacteria in stimulating predator avoidance by prey. To address those conflicting results, we investigated whether bacteria dwelling in fish mucus and/or chemical components present in fish mucus are responsible for the predator avoidance response by Baetis mayflies to salmonids. Results of five bioassays conducted in microcosms revealed that to stimulate Baetis predator avoidance behaviour: (1) bacteria do not need to be present in salmonid mucus; (2) the saccharide fraction of the fish mucus glycosaminoglycan component, but neither the protein fraction nor the whole molecule, functions as a kairomone; (3) specific active components of the saccharide fraction are primarily amino sugars in the form of hexosamines; and (4) there is a minimum dose of mucus and specifically of hexosamine needed. Our study provides the first experimental evidence that mayfly larvae recognize fish predators via the amino sugars naturally present in fish skin mucus. These sugars are released into the water by microbially mediated breakdown of glycosaminoglycans. Further research on the responses of different invertebrate prey species to similar predator cues are needed to understand the evolutionary history of this kairomone recognition behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBaetis 3aSalmonidae 3abacteria 3abioassays 3afish skin 3aglycosaminoglycans 3ahexosamines 3ainsect larvae 3ainvertebrates 3akairomones 3alife history 3amucus 3apopulation dynamics 3apredator avoidance 3apredatory fish 3aprey species 0aBaetidae 0achemical cues 0afish skin mucus 0ahexosamine 0apredator avoidance behaviour1 aÁlvarez, Maruxa1 aPeckarsky, Barbara0 tAnimal behaviour.g2019 Dec., v. 158 p.35-45dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2019.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245016000157520163900317592002801956650001401984650002801998650001702026650001002043650001302053650002202066650001102088650001902099650001802118650001202136650002102148650003002169650002402199650002602223650001402249650001202263700002502275700002302300700002402323700002002347700002402367700002002391700002702411773012102438856007402559852000902633655001202642IND60704146820221118083202.0200722e20200407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070414682DNAL7 a10.3390/v120404082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Yusheng 10aAmino Acid Substitutions in Positions 385 and 393 of the Hydrophobic Region of VP4 May Be Associated with Rotavirus Attenuation and Cell Culture Adaptation  aRotaviruses (RVs) are the leading cause of the acute viral gastroenteritis in young children and livestock animals worldwide. Although live attenuated vaccines have been applied to control RV infection for many years, the underlying mechanisms of RV attenuation following cell culture adaption are unknown. To study these mechanisms at the genomic level, we have sequenced and conducted a comparative analysis of two virulent human (Wa, G1P[8] and M, G3P[8]) and two virulent porcine (Gottfried, G4P[6] and OSU, G5P[7]) RV strains maintained in gnotobiotic piglets for 22, 11, 12 and 9 serial passages, respectively, with their attenuated counterparts serially passaged in MA-104 cell cultures for 25, 43, 54 and 43 passages, respectively. We showed that most of the mutations were clustered in the VP4 gene, with a relatively high nonsynonymous substitution rate (81.2%). Moreover, two amino acid substitutions observed in the VP4 gene were conserved between two or more strain pairs. D385N substitution was found in M, Wa and Gottfried strains, and another one, S471H/L was present in Wa and Gottfried strains. Importantly, D385 was reported previously in another study and may be involved in regulation of virus entry. Of interest, although no 385 substitution was found in OSU strains, the attenuated OSU strain contained a unique D393H substitution within the same VP4 hydrophobic domain. Collectively, our data suggest that the VP4 hydrophobic region may play an important role in RV attenuation and aa385 and aa393 may represent potential targets for RV vaccine development using reverse genetics and site-specific mutagenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRotavirus 3aamino acid substitution 3acell culture 3agenes 3agenomics 3agerm-free animals 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3alive vaccines 3apiglets 3areverse genetics 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3avaccine development 3aviral gastroenteritis 3avirulence 3aviruses1 aWentworth, David  E.1 aStucker, Karla  M.1 aHalpin, Rebecca  A.1 aLam, Ham  Ching1 aMarthaler, Douglas 1 aSaif, Linda J.,1 aVlasova, Anastasia N.,0 tViruses.g2020 Apr. 07, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v120404083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245015900170300001600329520158600345592002801931650001801959650001801977650001901995650001202014650002602026650001702052650001902069650002602088650001702114650002402131650002302155650001102178650000902189650001602198650001802214700002602232700002002258700002102278700002102299773009102320856008102411852000902492655001202501IND60520105620221121103046.0161030e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052010562DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-015-1338-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Micco, Veronica10aAre wood fibres as sensitive to environmental conditions as vessels in tree rings with intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs) in Mediterranean species?  ap. 971-983.  aKEY MESSAGE : Wood fibres are as sensitive to environmental conditions as vessels in tree rings with intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs) in Mediterranean species. Forecasted environmental changes are likely to increase the frequency of intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs) in Mediterranean tree rings. The interpretation of intra-annual anatomical variability of tree rings with IADFs can be useful to understand plant-growth response to environmental changes with seasonal resolution. We analysed the intra-annual variability of quantitative traits of both vessels and fibres in the woods of Arbutus unedo L. and Erica arborea L. to compare the sensitivity of different cell types to environmental variations. We applied digital image analysis on microphotographs of semi-thin sections of tree rings formed at sites with different soil water availability. Wood of both species showed good adaptability that allows anatomical traits of vessels and fibres to be harmonised by changing the water transport capacity and wood strength, promoting the efficiency or safety of water transport according to water availability during wood formation. The size of fibres showed trends of variation similar to vessels. Not all parameters of vessels were accurate indicators of the IADF presence. In conclusion, parameters of fibres, which offer advantages during automatic measurement, showed the same sensitivity to environmental fluctuations as vessels. Thus, they could be good indicators of summer drought to describe and interpret the ecological meaning of IADFs in tree rings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArbutus unedo 3aErica arborea 3adigital images 3adrought 3aenvironmental factors 3agrowth rings 3aimage analysis 3aplant available water 3aplant growth 3aquantitative traits 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3awood 3awood fibers 3awood strength1 aBattipaglia, Giovanna1 aBalzano, Angela1 aCherubini, Paolo1 aAronne, Giovanna0 tTrees.g2016 June, v. 30, no. 3 p.971-983dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-015-1338-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03432naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245007400162300001300236520205700249592002802306650001802334650001902352650002102371650001602392650001802408650001402426650001002440650001602450650001002466650001202476650001302488650001002501650001102511650001902522650001302541650001602554650001202570650001102582650000902593650001102602650001202613650001302625650001102638651001602649700001902665700001802684700001702702773011602719856004602835852000902881655001202890IND50072108320221120073721.0140121e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007210832DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.121742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRehnus, Maik10aMountain hares Lepus timidus and tourism: stress events and reactions  ap. 6-12.  aWinter tourism in the European Alps has developed rapidly over the past few decades, leading to the expansion of ski resorts, growing numbers of visitors and a massive increase in snow sport activities such as free‐ride skiing and snowboarding, backcountry skiing and snowshoeing. Wildlife is often disturbed by these largely unpredictable activities, and animals may have limited opportunities to adapt. Mountain hares Lepus timidus are affected by this increase in alpine tourism, but their physiological and behavioural reactions to tourist activity are still unknown. We measured the levels of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (GCM) in wild mountain hares living in areas that had no, medium or high levels of tourist activity during winter in 2011. Furthermore, we compared the changes in GCM excretion, behaviour and food intake of six captive mountain hares following predator challenge experiments from early to mid‐winter. Our field results showed that GCM excretion is positively correlated with increased tourism intensity. In the predator challenge experiments, hares spent less time resting and grooming (including re‐ingesting faecal pellets) during and after the stress treatments. These stress events lead to higher energy demands due to flushing, increased GCM levels, and disrupted the energy intake that hares derive from faeces. We conclude that mountain hares living in areas with frequent human winter recreational activities show changes in physiology and behaviour that demand additional energy in winter, when access to food resources is limited by snow. Synthesis and applications. To bring down the frequency of stress threats for mountain hares, we recommend that managers keep forests inhabited by mountain hares free of tourism infrastructure and retain undisturbed forest patches within skiing areas. Other species such as black grouse Tetrao tetrix and/or capercaillie Tetrao urogallus are also likely to benefit from such management activities because they share similar habitat requirements with mountain hares.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepus timidus 3aLyrurus tetrix 3aTetrao urogallus 3acorrelation 3aenergy intake 3aexcretion 3afeces 3afood intake 3afoods 3aforests 3ahabitats 3ahares 3ahumans 3ainfrastructure 3amanagers 3ametabolites 3apellets 3askiing 3asnow 3asports 3atourism 3awildlife 3awinter 3aAlps region1 aWehrle, Martin1 aPalme, Rupert1 aLukacs, Paul0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2014 Feb., v. 51, no. 1 p.6-12dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12174  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245011300209300001800322520188400340592002802224650002202252650000802274650001102282650001902293650002302312650000902335650001302344650001802357650001902375650001702394650001102411650001002422650001802432650001602450700001302466700001802479700005702497700001802554773011902572856008702691852000902778655001202787IND60598788620221117222416.0180702e20171120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059878862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b031112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Tianxu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2646-556510aChemical Looping Gasification of Coal in a 5 kWth Interconnected Fluidized Bed with a Two-Stage Fuel Reactor  ap. 4291-4299.  aChemical looping gasification (CLG) is a novel technology using lattice oxygen in a solid oxygen carrier (OC) for syngas production. The present work investigated the CLG performance of coal in a 5 kWₜₕ interconnected fluidized bed, in which the fuel reactor was designed as a two-stage-based circulating bed. The fresh OC from the air reactor entered into the upper stage of the fuel reactor, in which it was reduced by syngas. Then, the partial reduction of the OC was circulated to the bottom stage of the fuel reactor to be reduced further to low-valence metal oxide and catalyze the process of coal gasification. Afterward, the reduced OC was transported to the air reactor for regeneration. The influences of the coal feeding rate, gasification temperature, and gasification agent on the performance of CLG were evaluated in detail. The syngas yield and gasification efficiency were remarkably influenced by the coal feeding rate, with an optimal value of 487.5 g/h in the current unit. The high temperature promoted the coal gasification process with the maximum gasification efficiency and syngas yield corresponding to 75.2% and 0.97 Nm³ kg–¹ of coal, respectively, at a gasification temperature of 915 °C. Steam, CO₂, and a mixture of them were used as gasifying agents separately. The experimental results demonstrated that carbon conversion, syngas yield, and gasification efficiency increased with the proportion of steam in the gasifying agent. The OC particles in the upper and bottom stages of the fuel reactor were analyzed by X-ray diffraction. The main phase of the OC particles in the bottom stage was FeO, which has a high catalytic activity on coal gasification and tar cracking. Serious particle agglomeration was observed under the low fluidization flow of 20 L/min and high temperature of 950 °C at which the system cannot be stably operated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aair 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalytic activity 3acoal 3acracking 3aferrous oxide 3afluidized beds 3agasification 3aoxygen 3asteam 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature1 aWu, Jian1 aShen, Laihong1 aYan, Jingchun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5364-84391 aJiang, Shouxi0 tEnergy & fuels.g2017 Nov. 20, v. 32, no. 4 p.4291-4299dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b031113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245013500181300001700316520185800333592002802191650002602219650001802245650001102263650001302274650001202287650001902299650002302318650002002341650002202361650001102383650001802394650001502412650001002427650001102437700003502448700002602483700004002509700002702549700002502576700001902601773009202620856008102712852000902793655001202802IND60520105720221120232514.0161030e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052010572DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-015-1328-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVentre-Lespiaucq, Agustina B.10aField patterns of temporal variations in the light environment within the crowns of a Mediterranean evergreen tree (Olea europaea)  ap. 995-1009.  aKEY MESSAGE : There are specific diurnal light variation patterns and negligible seasonal variation within tree crowns. Crown-mediated regulation of temporal light regimes can be important for whole plant function in Mediterranean evergreens. The light environment within a tree crown can be characterized by specific variation patterns arising from the structural features of the crown. Within-crown light variation patterns can be important for plant productivity, but this has yet to be assessed in natural settings. The spatio-temporal variations of direct and diffuse photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), their proportions and sunfleck frequency within the crowns of isolated adult wild olive trees (Olea europaea L.) were investigated. Trees growing in contrasting Mediterranean conditions (continental vs. coastal) at the same latitude were compared. Instantaneous diffuse and total PPFD were measured with sunshine sensors in three crown layers (outer-, middle- and inner-crown) in the south-facing part of the crown, at two points of the diurnal (mid-morning and midday) and seasonal (summer and winter) cycles. Direct PPFD and the proportion of direct to total PPFD vary diurnally within the crown as a result of an increase in sunfleck frequency during midday and in self-shading during mid-morning, in both summer and winter conditions. Conversely, the lack of seasonal variation in the three light attributes is better explained by a greater average crown transmittance in winter conditions. The interplay between crown architecture heterogeneity and varying solar position renders identifiable patterns of temporal variations in the light environment within tree crowns. These patterns suggest that trees can benefit from the light heterogeneity typical of Mediterranean environments by developing conservative architectural layouts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aOlea europaea 3aadults 3alatitude 3aphotons 3aphotosynthesis 3aseasonal variation 3asolar radiation 3aspatial variation 3asummer 3atransmittance 3atree crown 3atrees 3awinter1 aEscribano-Rocafort, Adrián G.1 aDelgado, Juan Antonio1 aJiménez Martínez, María Dolores,1 ade Casas, Rafael Rubio1 aGranado-Yela, Carlos1 aBalaguer, Luis0 tTrees.g2016 June, v. 30, no. 3 p.995-1009dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-015-1328-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02198naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245010000165300001800265520104900283592002801332650002301360650002201383650003701405650002101442650001201463650000901475650001101484650001901495650002301514700002301537700001301560700001701573700001601590773012701606856008201733852000901815655001201824IND60566161920180615000000.0170403e20160414xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056616192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b004962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Weiguang10aOxygen Intercalation Induced by Photocatalysis on the Surface of Hybrid Lead Halide Perovskites  ap. 7606-7611.  aMethylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI₃) perovskite has emerged as a dazzling nova in the solar cell realm. However, the robustness or stability of the material exposed to different ambiences is a key issue. In this paper, resonance Raman spectroscopy is combined with surface and bulk crystal characterizations to interpret the oxygen intercalation phenomenon on the surface of MAPbI₃. We observe that oxygen can intercalate into the frameworks of MAPbI₃ with the assistance of laser excitation. By lowering down the pressure in the experimental chamber, the intercalated oxygen can be readily removed. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction characterizations suggest that Pb–O bonds are mainly formed on the surface of MAPbI₃ but are constrained to avoid the formation of PbO compound. The quantum chemical calculation based on density functional theory supports the above conclusions. The understanding of oxygen intercalation in MAPbI₃ shall benefit the improvement of stability of the important solar cell materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3achemical bonding 3aiodides 3alead 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotovoltaic cells1 aRahimi-Iman, Arash1 aBi, Gang1 aDai, Xusheng1 aWu, Huizhen0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Apr. 14, v. 120, no. 14 p.7606-7611dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b004963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04066naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245008500162520210800247592002802355650001802383650001202401650001502413650001902428650003502447650002002482650003002502650001502532650002602547650001602573650002202589650001602611650000902627650001502636650001302651650001402664650001402678650001702692650001402709650001502723650001902738650001702757650002302774653003102797653002302828653001602851653002502867653002702892653000802919653000802927653000902935653000902944653000902953653000802962653000902970653000702979700001902986700001603005700001403021700001403035700001903049700002003068700001503088700001503103700001403118773009403132856008503226852000903311655001203320IND60766087620221122060417.0220328e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076608762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2022.1539612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Wei10aPharmacological mechanism of Shenlingbaizhu formula against experimental colitis  aUlcerative colitis (UC) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by an overactive immune response and destruction of the colorectal epithelium with intricate pathological factors. Shenlingbaizhu (SLBZ) formula, included in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2020, has been widely utilized to treat UC. The present study was designed to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms of SLBZ formula against UC. A murine model of experimental colitis was established by orally feeding 2% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to mice for 7 days, followed by SLBA treatment for the next 15 days. Network pharmacology analysis was performed to predict the pharmacological mechanisms. High-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing integrated with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was conducted on mouse stool in order to determine alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota and metabolites. Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry were performed to examine the anti-inflammatory role of SLBZ. DSS treatment induced experimental colitis, and this induction was alleviated by SLBZ treatment, as evidenced by rescued pathological symptoms in the experimental colitis mouse groups. Network pharmacology analysis showed that SLBZ-target genes were enriched in pathogen-induced infectious and inflammatory pathways, as well as neoplastic processes. SLBZ administration also modulated the gut microbiota composition and metabolic profiles of experimental colitis mice and alleviated the progression of experimental colitis. We further showed via in-vitro experiments that SLBZ suppressed macrophage (Mφ) transition to pro-inflammatory phenotype (M1), rescued tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-induced pyroptosis of intestinal organoids (IOs), and decreased the recruitment of Mφs by epithelial cells. SLBZ formula is an effective treatment for murine colitis and showed a stronger therapeutic capacity than melasazine. The pharmacological mechanisms of SLBZ involve the re-establishment of an anti-inflammatory milieu and healthy microbiome, which favors mucosal healing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3adextran 3aepithelium 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aimmune response 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3aliquid chromatography 3amacrophages 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3amice 3amicrobiome 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3aorganoids 3apharmacology 3aphenotype 3apyroptosis 3asodium sulfate 3atherapeutics 3aulcerative colitis 0aInflammatory bowel disease 0aUlcerative colitis 0aMacrophages 0aIntestinal organoids 0aShenlingbaizhu formula 0aIBD 0aIOs 0aMφs 0aSLBZ 0aISCs 0aTCM 0aPPIs 0aUC1 aWang, Guoliang1 aLü, Chang,1 aLiu, Chen1 aJiang, Lu1 aJiang, Zizheng1 aLiang, Zhenghao1 aWang, Xiao1 aQin, Zheng1 aYan, Jing0 tPhytomedicine.g2022 Apr., v. 98 p.153961-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2022.1539613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03755naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245009700161300001600258520244800274592002802722650001402750650001202764650001002776650001002786650001902796650001502815650001502830650001902845650001702864650001802881650000902899650001202908650001302920653001802933653001502951653001502966653004702981700005303028773015203081856007903233852000903312655001203321IND60676070520221120112812.0200103e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067607052DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2019-172132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReinartz, S.10aShort communication: Lethal mutations in Vorderwald cattle through Montbéliarde incrossings  ap. 613-618.  aVorderwald cattle are a dual-purpose cattle breed with high migrant contributions from Montbéliarde bulls in the recent past. Through the wide use of Montbéliarde bulls, undesirable alleles were also disseminated into the Vorderwald population. Haplotypes on bovine chromosome 19 (MH1) and 29 (MH2), supposed to harbor lethal mutations, were identified in Montbéliarde cattle. A study in French Montbéliarde cattle identified the PFAS:g.28511199C>T (rs455876205) variant as the most likely MH1 embryonic lethal mutation. The objective of the present study was to determine whether the PFAS:g.28511199C>T variant was introduced into Vorderwald cattle through Montbéliarde bulls and disseminated in this population. The present study expands on previous work on the deleterious SLC37A2 variant (ss2019324563) of the MH2 locus. Herein, we traced the ss2019324563 variant back to the Montbéliarde bull, which was the most likely source for this deleterious mutation in Vorderwald cattle. We genotyped 354 Vorderwald cattle for the PFAS variant, resulting in 41 heterozygous individuals and a T allele frequency of 0.058. An aborted fetus homozygous mutant for SLC37A2 from our previous study on the MH2 locus in Vorderwald cattle was wild type for the PFAS variant. Both lethal mutations were segregating independently of each other, and we found no indications of joint occurrence in a larger number of animals. Neither SLC37A2 nor PFAS double heterozygous mutants were lethal. The earliest animal with a heterozygous PFAS genotype was 1 of 5 migrant Montbéliarde bulls, and this bull was the most likely origin of the deleterious PFAS allele in Vorderwald cattle. All Vorderwald cattle under study born before introgression of this Montbéliarde bull were homozygous wild type. In addition, all 41 heterozygous Vorderwald cattle had genetic contributions from this Montbéliarde bull, whereas in 74 Vorderwald cattle without genes from Montbéliarde bulls, the PFAS T allele was not observed. In a sample of actual German Fleckvieh the PFAS T allele could be found at a very low frequency. Our study demonstrated the introgression of lethal variants through Montbéliarde bulls into a traditional cattle breed highly adapted to harsh local conditions. These findings underline the need to screen bulls for lethal mutations before their wide use in breeding, particularly in breeds with a focus on preservation of their genetic uniqueness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSimmental 3aalleles 3abulls 3afetus 3agene frequency 3agenotyping 3ahaplotypes 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3aintrogression 3aloci 3amutants 3amutation 0alethal mutant 0aVorderwald 0aincrossing 0aphosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase1 aDistl, O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3516-836X0 tJournal of dairy science.g2020 Jan., v. 103, no. 1 p.613-618dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-172133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002600186245010900212300002000321506007600341520160000417592002802017506003702045650001002082650002802092650001102120650001002131650001102141650001502152650001202167650002602179653002402205653002302229653002002252653000902272700002502281773019402306856007902500852000902579655001202588IND60178817720221207103308.0150604e20141216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017881772DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14099131112doi7 aPMC42733542pmcid7 a254689722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBickley, Sorrel R.

Among tetrapods, sternum morphology is correlated with the mode of locomotion: Avians that fly have a ventral extension, or keel, on their sterna, which provides an increased area for flight muscle attachment. The sternum is fused with the ribs attaching on either side; however, unlike the ribs, the sternal precursors do not originate from the somites. Despite the crucial role of the sternum in tetrapod locomotion, little attention has been given to its acquisition, evolution, and embryological development. We demonstrate an essential role for the T-box transcription factor gene Tbx5 in sternum and forelimb formation and show that both structures share an embryological origin within the lateral plate mesoderm. Consistent with this shared origin and role of Tbx5 , sternum defects are a characteristic feature of Holt–Oram Syndrome (OMIM 142900) caused by mutations in TBX5 . We demonstrate a link between sternum size and forelimb use across avians and provide evidence that modulation of Tbx5 expression underlies the reduction in sternum and wing size in a flightless bird, the emu. We demonstrate that Tbx5 is a common node in the genetic pathways regulating forelimb and sternum development, enabling specific adaptations of these features without affecting other skeletal elements and can also explain the linked adaptation of sternum and forelimb morphology correlated with mode of locomotion.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abirds 3aevolutionary adaptation 3aflight 3agenes 3ahumans 3alocomotion 3asternum 3atranscription factors 0asternum development 0asternum adaptation 0asternum defects 0aTbx51 aLogan, Malcolm P.

The aims of this study were to (i) generate sensory profiles and (ii) gain knowledge about Australian wine consumers’ liking of Australian and international wines made from selected drought-resistant, red wine grape varieties not traditionally grown in Australia but better suited for a changing Australian climate. A Rate-All-That-Apply (RATA) sensory panel (n = 43) profiled 24 commercial red wines made from 9 purportedly drought-tolerant red grape varieties, plus a single example of an Australian Cabernet-Sauvignon, Grenache and Shiraz wine. A subset of 10 wines was subjected to preference trials with Australian red wine consumers (n = 113) and underwent basic chemical composition measures. Consumers liked all 10 wines, scoring them greater than 5.7 on a 9-point Likert scale. The Fine Wine Instrument (FWI) identified 3 consumer segments (Wine Enthusiasts (WE); Aspirants (ASP) and No Frills (NF)). WE liked the 2 Touriga Nacional and Nero d’Avola wines significantly more than the NF consumers and the Graciano significantly more than the ASP. Correlation tests determined that the WE segment liked wines with aromas of vanilla, sweet taste, jammy, confectionary, vanilla and woody flavours and a non-fruit after taste, and the attributes responsible for the ASP segment's liking of the wines were red colour, jammy and toasty/smoky aromas, jammy and savoury flavours and alcohol mouthfeel and non-fruity aftertaste. NF consumers liked wines with aromas of vanilla, confectionary, jammy and red fruit flavours; smooth mouthfeel and a fruity aftertaste, but disliked wines displaying aromas of cooked vegetables and savoury, bitter taste, flavours of cooked vegetables, forest floor, green pepper and herbaceous, and rough mouthfeel. WE liked wines reminiscent of Cabernet-Sauvignon, Grenache and Shiraz while the ASP and NF consumers had preferences leaning towards wines similar in style to a Shiraz and Grenache, respectively. These findings indicate to wine producers the potential of these new wines in the current Australian market and the possibility that increasing future cultivation of these varieties as a response to climate change might lead to a more sustainable wine industry in the future.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalcohols 3abitterness 3achemical composition 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acolor 3aconsumer acceptance 3adrought tolerance 3aforest litter 3afruits 3amarkets 3amouthfeel 3aquestionnaires 3ared wines 3asensory evaluation 3asweet peppers 3asweetness 3asweets 3ataste sensitivity 3awine grapes 3awine industry 3aAustralia 0aRate-all-That-Apply 0aBarbera 0aDurif 0aGraciano 0aMontepulciano 0aNero d’Avola1 aJohnson, Trent E.1 aGoodman, Steven1 aCollins, Cassandra1 aBastian, Sue0 tOENO One.g2021, v. 55, no. 2dInternational Viticulture and Enology SocietywJournal:27875x2494-12717nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245012500169300001600294520136500310592002801675650002201703650000801725650001501733650001901748650002201767650002301789650002201812650001301834650002901847650001001876650001301886650002101899650002001920650001101940650001401951650001101965650001901976650001601995700005402011700001302065700001402078700001702092700001602109700001602125773011702141856008702258852000902345655001202354IND60598788920221117222445.0180702e20180118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059878892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b031172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXuan, Yanni10aSelection of Desulfurizer and Control of Reaction Products on Flue-Gas Desulfurization Using Chemical-Looping Technology  ap. 889-900.  aChemical-looping technology (CLT) can achieve energy efficiency and reduce the environmental pollution and is usually conducted on a fixed-bed reactor. In this paper, the thermodynamic simulations for flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) systems with CLT are carried out using HSC Chemistry software to choose a suitable desulfurizer, control the type and quantities of reaction products, and collect sulfur-containing byproducts with high economic value. The Ellingham diagrams are developed to relate the Gibbs free energy of the relevant reactions to the temperature. The fixing-sulfur potential; the reaction degree with CO₂, H₂O, and CO; and the acceleration effect of removing NOₓ of different metal oxides in 100 to 300 °C are estimated. Compared comprehensively, Mn-based oxides have distinct advantages for flue-gas desulfurization using CLT. Based on calculation results, both low reaction temperatures (T < 400 °C) and sufficient H₂ (mH₂/mMₙSO₄ > 4) can effectively prevent the loss of sulfur element. In the regeneration of Mn₃O₄, if pure O₂ is replaced by diluent air or a low level of oxygen, the formation of trace amounts of MnSO₄ can be inhibited. This paper provides ample theoretical basis for Mn-based oxides as active components of desulfurizer and collecting pure SO₂ from flue gas through chemical-looping technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aair 3abyproducts 3acarbon dioxide 3acomputer software 3aeconomic valuation 3aenergy efficiency 3aflue gas 3aflue gas desulfurization 3afuels 3ahydrogen 3amanganese oxides 3anitrogen oxides 3aoxygen 3apollution 3asulfur 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature1 aYu, Qingbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3257-05021 aQin, Qin1 aWang, Kun1 aDuan, Wenjun1 aLiu, Kaijie1 aZhang, Peng0 tEnergy & fuels.g2018 Jan. 18, v. 32, no. 1 p.889-900dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b031173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245017000175520142100345592002801766650002301794650001701817650002801834650000901862650002101871650002101892650001101913650001401924650001201938650001401950650000901964650002001973650001701993650001302010653002702023653001202050653002902062653002302091653002702114653003002141700002302171700002302194700006202217700002002279700002202299700001802321700002902339700001602368700002602384773012402410856008302534852000902617655001202626IND60728722520221118143445.0220606e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072872252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2021.1038552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLozano-Bilbao, Enrique10aRisk assessment and study of trace/heavy metals in three species of fish of commercial interest on the island of El Hierro (Canary Islands, eastern-central Atlantic)  aThe levels of toxic heavy metals (Al, Cd, Pb), macroelements (Ca, K, Mg, Na) and microelements and trace elements (B, Ba, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Sr, V, Zn) were determined in 54 muscle samples from three species of fish for human consumption, Balistes capriscus (grey triggerfish), Canthidermis sufflamen (oceanic triggerfish) and Heteropriacanthus fulgens (rock catalufa), using spectrometry of inductively coupled plasma optical emission (ICP-OES). The aims of this study is to determine if the three species are good bioindicators of environmental pollution and to verify whether they are suitable for human consumption. Significant differences were found in the levels of Al, B, Fe, K, Mn, Mo, Na and Zn between the three species studied. The results suggest that the underwater volcano off El Hierro influences the metallic content (Al, K the most characteristic) of H. fulgens. An evaluation of the toxic risk derived from the ingestion of B. capriscus, C. sufflamen and H. fulgens was carried out, analyzing the Admissible Daily Intake (ADI) and the Safety Margin (MoS). For the nutritional study, the Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) index was used. Therefore, once the study has been carried out and under the conditions established in terms of daily / weekly fish consumption, proposed by AESAN, there would not be any type of toxic risk after ingesting B. capriscus, C. sufflamen and H. cruentatus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBalistes capriscus 3aCanthidermis 3aacceptable daily intake 3afish 3afish consumption 3afood composition 3ahumans 3aingestion 3amuscles 3apollution 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aspectroscopy 3atoxicity 0aMetals bioaccumulation 0aVolcano 0aToxicological evaluation 0aBalistes capriscus 0aCanthidermis sufflamen 0aHeteropriacanthus fulgens1 aDomínguez, David,1 aGonzalez, Jose A.,1 aLorenzo, José M.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8584-67311 aLozano, Gonzalo1 aHardisson, Arturo1 aRubio, Carmen1 aWeller, Dailos-González1 aPaz, Soraya1 aGutiérrez, Ángel J.0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2021 June, v. 99 p.103855-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2021.1038553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245007900210300002000289506007600309520115400385592002801539506003701567650001101604650001801615650001101633650002801644650001901672650001401691650001101705650001601716653001901732653002601751653001401777653003501791653002401826700001901850700002901869700002301898700001701921700002101938700001801959700002201977700002301999700002502022700002602047773019402073856007902267852000902346655001202355IND60178818020221207103825.0150604e20141216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017881802DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14101621112doi7 aPMC42733842pmcid7 a254530642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalczewska, Grazyna10aHuman infrared vision is triggered by two-photon chromophore isomerization  ap.

The human eye structure and the absorption spectra of pigments limit our visual perception of light. Our visual perception is most responsive to stimulating light in the 400- to 720-nm (visible) range. First, we demonstrate by psychophysical experiments that humans can perceive infrared laser emission as visible light. Moreover, we show that mammalian photoreceptors can be directly activated by near infrared light with a sensitivity that paradoxically increases at wavelengths above 900 nm, and display quadratic dependence on laser power, indicating a nonlinear optical process. Biochemical experiments with rhodopsin, cone visual pigments, and a chromophore model compound 11- cis- retinyl-propylamine Schiff base demonstrate the direct isomerization of visual chromophore by a two-photon chromophore isomerization. Indeed, quantum mechanics modeling indicates the feasibility of this mechanism. Together, these findings clearly show that human visual perception of near infrared light occurs by two-photon isomerization of visual pigments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahumans 3aisomerization 3amodels 3anear infrared radiation 3aphotoreceptors 3arhodopsin 3avision 3awavelengths 0avisual pigment 0atwo-photon absorption 0arhodopsin 0atransretinal electrophysiology 0amultiscale modeling1 aVinberg, Frans1 aStremplewski, Patrycjusz1 aBircher, Martin P.1 aSalom, David1 aKomar, Katarzyna1 aZhang, Jianye1 aCascella, Michele1 aWojtkowski, Maciej1 aKefalov, Vladimir J.1 aPalczewski, Krzysztof0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Dec. 16, v. 111, no. 50 p.E5445-E5454dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14101621113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04331naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245015700162300001600319520246600335592002802801650001302829650001202842650002502854650001802879650001502897650001802912650000902930650001802939650001402957650001502971650001002986650001102996650001503007650000903022650001503031650002403046650000703070650001303077650002003090650001703110650002003127650001003147650002503157653001403182653001303196653001403209700001803223700001703241700005403258700001803312700006703330700002403397700005603421773015203477856007903629852000903708655001203717IND60676070820221120112759.0200103e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067607082DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2019-172862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendowski, S.10aEffects of pretreatment with reducing sugars or an enzymatic cocktail before extrusion of fava bean on nitrogen metabolism and performance of dairy cows  ap. 396-409.  aThe aim of this study was to determine the effects of pretreatment with reducing sugars or with an enzymatic cocktail before extrusion of fava bean on intake, milk yield and composition, N partitioning, and plasma and ruminal parameters. The main hypothesis was that these pretreatment conditions would allow better N protection in the rumen compared with classic pretreatment before extrusion, thanks to an increase of sugar proportion, either exogenous or endogenous with enzymatic actions. Sixteen Holstein cows were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design experiment. Cow were fed a diet with a 56:44 forage to concentrate ratio and containing 16.2% of crude protein (CP; dry matter basis). Concentrate consisted of fava bean:linseed blends (90:10%, raw basis) distributed either raw, extruded after pretreatment without additive, extruded after pretreatment with reducing sugars, or extruded after pretreatment with an enzymatic cocktail. The experimental blends provided 53% of total CP in the diet. Intake, milk yield and composition, ruminal pH, volatile fatty acids and ammonia kinetics, apparent total-tract nutrient digestibilities and N partitioning, Maillard compounds in feed and feces, plasma AA, and ¹⁵N natural enrichment were measured. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance according to the MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Extrusion without additive during pretreatment led to higher contents of Maillard compounds in the blend, a lower enzymatic CP degradability, a numerically lower ammonia content in ruminal fluid, and a trend of higher plasma EAA concentration, all suggesting a decrease in degradability of proteins in the rumen, and a subsequent increase in metabolizable protein supply. Compared with pretreatment without additive, adding reducing sugars or an enzymatic cocktail during pretreatment led to an increase in Maillard compound contents in the extruded blends, and to an increase (+50 mg/L) in rumen ammonia content. With reducing sugars, digestibility of Nɛ-carboxymethyl-lysine was numerically lower, and plasma EAA concentration tended to decrease, suggesting an overprotection of proteins in the intestine. With the enzymatic cocktail, plasma EAA concentration was similar than without additive during pretreatment, suggesting a similar metabolizable protein supply with both treatments. Finally, no change in N partitioning between milk, urine, and feces was observed whatever the diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aammonia 3aanalysis of variance 3acrude protein 3adairy cows 3adata analysis 3adiet 3adigestibility 3aextrusion 3afaba beans 3afeces 3aforage 3aintestines 3amilk 3amilk yield 3anitrogen metabolism 3apH 3aproteins 3areducing sugars 3arumen fluids 3astable isotopes 3aurine 3avolatile fatty acids 0adairy cow 0anitrogen 0afaba bean1 aChapoutot, P.1 aChesneau, G.1 aFerlay, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0651-792X1 aEnjalbert, F.1 aCantalapiedra-Hijar, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9486-82381 aGermain,cM.q(A.),1 aNozière, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1727-89840 tJournal of dairy science.g2020 Jan., v. 103, no. 1 p.396-409dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-172863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245014300155300001600298520168000314592002801994650001302022650001502035650002302050650002502073650001102098650001502109650001402124650002302138650001202161651001502173700002402188700002102212773010502233856007302338852000902411655001202420IND60340894720221120053948.0150809e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034089472DNAL7 a10.1111/een.122062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLUDKA, JOHN10aInfiltration of a facultative ant–plant mutualism by the introduced Argentine ant: effects on mutualist diversity and mutualism benefits  ap. 437-443.  a1. Ant–plant mutualisms have been the focus of considerable empirical research, but few studies have investigated how introduced ants affect these interactions. Using 2 years of survey data, this study examines how the introduced Argentine ant [Linepithema humile (Mayr)] differs from native ants with respect to its ability to protect the extrafloral nectary‐bearing coast barrel cactus (Ferocactus viridescens) in Southern California. 2. Eighteen native ant species visited cacti in uninvaded areas, but cacti in invaded areas were primarily visited by the Argentine ant. The main herbivore of the coast barrel cactus present at the study sites is a leaf‐footed bug (Narnia wilsoni). 3. Herbivore presence (the fraction of surveys in which leaf‐footed bugs were present on individual cacti) was negatively related to ant presence (the fraction of surveys in which ants were present on individual cacti). Compared with cacti in uninvaded areas, those in invaded areas were less likely to have herbivores and when they did had them less often. 4. Seed mass was negatively related to herbivore presence, and this relationship did not differ for cacti in invaded areas versus those in uninvaded areas. 5. Although the Argentine ant might provide superior protection from herbivores, invasion‐induced reductions in ant mutualist diversity could potentially compromise plant reproduction. The cumulative number of ant species on individual cacti over time was lower in invaded areas and was associated with a shortened seasonal duration of ant protection and reduced seed mass. These results support the hypothesis that multiple partners may enhance mutualism benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoreidae 3aFerocactus 3aLinepithema humile 3acacti and succulents 3acoasts 3aherbivores 3amutualism 3aplant reproduction 3asurveys 3aCalifornia1 aLEVAN, KATHERINE E.1 aHOLWAY, DAVID A.0 tEcological entomology.g2015 Aug., v. 40, no. 4 p.437-443dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/een.122063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03096naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012200160300001800282500002000300520152000320592002801840596006901868650002101937650002101958650001801979650001101997650003002008650002202038650001202060650002202072650001302094650002702107650002802134650001102162650002602173650001102199650001302210650001002223651002802233700002502261700006302286700006102349773012202410856007302532852000902605655001202614IND60744668620221119234131.0210716e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074466862DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.174482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuchs, Sebastian10aHydraulic variability of three temperate broadleaf tree species along a water availability gradient in central Europe  ap. 1387-1400.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPlant hydraulic traits are key for understanding and predicting tree drought responses. Information about the degree of the traits’ intra‐specific variability may guide the selection of drought‐resistant genotypes and is crucial for trait‐based modelling approaches. For the three temperate minor broadleaf tree species Acer platanoides, Carpinus betulus and Tilia cordata, we measured xylem embolism resistance (P₅₀), leaf turgor loss point (PTLP), specific hydraulic conductivity (KS), Huber values (HVs), and hydraulic safety margins in adult trees across a precipitation gradient. We further quantified trait variability on different organizational levels (inter‐specific to within‐canopy variation), and analysed its relationship to climatic and soil water availability. Although we observed a certain intra‐specific trait variability (ITV) in safety‐related traits (P₅₀, PTLP) with higher within‐tree and between‐tree than between populations variability, the magnitude was small compared to inter‐specific differences, which explained 78.4% and 58.3% of the variance in P₅₀ and PTLP, respectively. In contrast, efficiency‐related traits (KS, HV) showed a high ITV both within populations and within the crowns of single trees. Surprisingly, the observed ITV of all traits was neither driven by climatic nor soil water availability.

Although cytokinin N‐glucoside pathways have been uncovered in higher plants, no regulator has been identified to date. We performed a metabolome genome‐wide association study (mGWAS), weighted gene co‐expression network analysis (WGCNA), and expression quantitative trait nucleotide (eQTN) mappings to build a core triple genetic network (mGWAS–gene expression–phenotype) for the trans‐zeatin N‐glucoside (ZNG) metabolite using data from 435 unrelated Populus tomentosa individuals. Variation of the ZNG level in poplar is attributed to the differential transcription of PtoWRKY42, a member of WRKY multigene family group IIb. Functional analysis revealed that PtoWRKY42 negatively regulated ZNG accumulation by binding directly to the W‐box of the UDP‐glycosyltransferase 76C 1‐1 (PtoUGT761‐1) promoter. Also, PtoWRKY42 was strongly induced by leaf senescence, 6‐BA, wounding, and salt stress, resulting in a reduced ZNG level. We identified PtoWRKY42, a negative regulator of cytokinin N‐glucosides, which contributes to the natural variation in ZNG level and mediates ZNG accumulation by directly modulating the key glycosyltransferase gene PtoUGT76C1‐1.  aPublisher supplied data  a31770707cThe Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China  a31872671cThe Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China  aB20050cthe 111 Project 3aPopulus tomentosa 3acytokinins 3agenome-wide association study 3aglycosylation 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3amultigene family 3aquantitative traits 3asalt stress1 aChen, Panfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6835-98001 aXuan, Anran1 aBu, Chenhao1 aLiu, Peng1 aIngvarsson, Pär K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9225-75211 aEl‐Kassaby, Yousry A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4887-89771 aZhang, Deqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8849-23660 tThe new phytologist.g2021 Aug., v. 231, no. 4 p.1462-1477dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.174693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245012300162300001800285500001100303520133600314592002801650650002301678650002301701650002401724650001101748650001501759650001701774650002301791650002601814650002201840650001301862650002101875700002101896700002101917700002001938700002201958700005801980773013202038856007902170852000902249655001202258IND60791926020221118234124.0220902e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079192602DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2021004582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKapoor, Sahil10aExtraction and characterization of microalgae‐derived phenolics for pharmaceutical applications: A systematic review  ap. 1044-1063.  aREVIEW  aMicroalgae are regarded as a rich trove of diverse secondary metabolites that exert remarkable biological activities. In particular, microalgae‐derived bioactive phenolic compounds (MBPCs) are a boon to biopharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries due to their diverse bioactivities, including antimicrobial, anticancer, antiviral, and immunomodulatory activities. The state‐of‐the‐art green technologies for extraction and purification of MBPCs, along with the modern progress in the identification and characterization of MBPCs, have accelerated the discovery of novel active pharmaceutical compounds. However, several factors regulate the production of these bioactive phenolic compounds in microalgae. Furthermore, some microalgae species produce toxic phenolic compounds that negatively impact the aquatic ecosystem, animal, and human life. Therefore, the focus of this review paper is to bring into light the current innovations in bioprospection, extraction, purification, and characterization of MBPCs. This review is also aimed at a better understanding of the physicochemical factors regulating the production of MBPCs at an industrial scale. Finally, the present review covers the recent advances in toxicological evaluation, diverse applications, and future prospects of MBPCs in biopharmaceutical industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abiopharmaceuticals 3adietary supplements 3ahumans 3amicroalgae 3amicrobiology 3aphenolic compounds 3asecondary metabolites 3asystematic review 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing1 aSingh, Meenakshi1 aSrivastava, Atul1 aChavali, Murthy1 aChandrasekhar, K.1 aVerma, Pradeep1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2266-94370 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2022 Sept., v. 62, no. 9 p.1044-1063dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39022x0233-111X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2021004583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03495naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013600163520166200299592002801961650003401989650001802023650001402041650001302055650001702068650001502085650002402100650001202124650001002136650002402146650002602170650001902196650002402215650001302239650001402252653002002266653002302286653001702309653001902326653000802345653000702353653000802360653000902368653000802377653000802385653001102393653000802404653001002412653001102422653001002433653000902443653001102452653001102463700001402474700001202488700002502500700001802525700001502543700001702558700001902575700001602594773009302610856008502703852000902788655001202797IND60766088120221122060356.0220502e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076608812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2022.1539682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Min10aPreventive effects of traditional Chinese medicine formula Huoxiangzhengqi against lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response  aHuoxiangzhengqi oral liquid (HX), a pharmaceutical product made from traditional Chinese medicine formulas, has been commonly used in household medication for gastrointestinal disorders, but the mode of action remains largely unclear. This study aims to investigate whether pretreatment with HX prevents lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced adverse effects and the potential mechanisms involved. Seven-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were orally administered low (1.3 ml/kg) and high doses (2.6 ml/kg) of HX for 7 days, and subsequently subjected to a single dose of LPS at 6 mg/kg. Dexamethasone served as the positive control. Each group had ten animals. The data demonstrated that either a low or high dose of HX significantly reduced the levels of inflammation induced by LPS in both small intestinal and cortical tissues. LPS profoundly decreased the richness and evenness of the microbiota and disrupted the composition of the intestinal microbial community, but pretreatment with HX did not successfully prevent dysbiosis. No significant improvements in HX against LPS were observed in intestinal local immunity or the secretion of partial gut-brain peptides. In addition, pretreatment with HX prevented the alterations in the expression levels of proteins related to the NF-κB pathway, including phospho-p38, p38, phospho-p44/42, p44/42, p50 and p65 induced by LPS. Herein, we demonstrated for the first time that the preventive effects of HX against LPS mainly occur through the inhibition of inflammation. These findings provide novel evidence that HX may serve as a new agent for the prevention of gastrointestinal inflammation-related disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3adexamethasone 3adysbiosis 3aimmunity 3ainflammation 3aintestines 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliquids 3amales 3amechanism of action 3amicrobial communities 3amicroorganisms 3aoral administration 3apeptides 3asecretion 0aHuoxiangzhengqi 0aLipopolysaccharide 0aInflammation 0aGut microbiota 0aLPS 0aHX 0aDEX 0asIgA 0aDAO 0aH&E 0aAB-PAS 0aTBO 0aELISA 0aRT-PCR 0aLC-MS 0aIL-6 0aTNF-α 0aIL-1β1 aZou, Zhen1 aQiu, Yu1 aSumayyah, Golamaully1 aJiang, Xuejun1 aSu, Junhao1 aDuan, Xinhao1 aChen, Chengzhi1 aQiu, Jingfu0 tPhytomedicine.g2022 May, v. 99 p.153968-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2022.1539683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005400144245010700198300001600305520189400321592002802215650001402243650001902257650001602276650001202292650001502304650001902319650001202338650001202350650002402362650001702386653002902403653001402432700005502446700001502501700005702516773015202573856007902725852000902804655001202813IND60676071120221120175242.0200103e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067607112DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2019-173942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBach, K.D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2770-257410aTechnical note: Effect of storage time and temperature on total calcium concentrations in bovine blood  ap. 922-928.  aOur objectives were to examine the stability of (1) serum and plasma total calcium (tCa) after delayed separation of bovine whole blood stored at 4°C, and (2) frozen serum and plasma tCa stored at −80°C. Whole blood was collected from 19 cows into vacutainer tubes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) containing no additives (serum) or lithium heparin (plasma). Baseline tCa concentrations (0-h tCa) were determined on serum and plasma harvested within 2 h of blood collection. To evaluate the effect of prolonged whole blood storage at 4°C, serum and plasma were harvested from samples after 6, 24, 48, 72 h, and 7 and 14 d of storage. For evaluation of the stability of frozen serum and plasma stored at −80°C, samples were stored for 7 d and 1, 3, 6, and 12 mo. The median 0-h tCa concentration for serum and plasma was 2.25 mmol/L (range: 1.58 to 2.60 mmol/L) and 2.28 mmol/L (range: 1.60 to 2.65 mmol/L), respectively. The average difference in tCa from 0-h samples ranged from −0.02 to 0.03 mmol/L for all samples stored at either 4 or −80°C. The median within-cow variability for whole blood samples stored at 4°C was 1.1 and 1.0% for serum and plasma, respectively, and for serum and plasma stored at −80°C was 1.1 and 1.3%, respectively. When whole blood was stored at 4°C, no differences in serum or plasma tCa concentrations were observed across the evaluated time points as compared with 0-h concentrations. Similarly, frozen serum and plasma stored at −80°C remained stable up to 12 mo. Therefore, our findings show that whole blood samples may be stored for at least 14 d at 4°C in vacutainer tubes containing no additives or lithium heparin without biologically important changes in tCa concentrations beyond expected analytical variation. Additionally, serum or plasma may be stored at −80°C for up to 12 mo with no effect on tCa concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3adairy cows 3afrozen storage 3aheparin 3alithium 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 0asubclinical hypocalcemia 0adairy cow1 aNeves, R.C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6595-38791 aStokol, T.1 aMcArt, J.A.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5654-91720 tJournal of dairy science.g2020 Jan., v. 103, no. 1 p.922-928dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-173943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03846naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003600139245021600175520151100391592002801902650001801930650001301948650002301961650001501984650001601999650001502015650003002030650000902060650001402069650001202083650001702095650001702112651001102129700003202140700003102172700003802203700003302241700002502274700004502299700001802344700002702362700004102389700002602430700003202456700003102488700002902519700003002548700003702578700003602615700002302651700003902674700003002713700003602743700002202779700003502801700003202836700002902868700003502897700003602932773012102968856007403089852000903163655001203172IND60704147820221118091310.0200722e20200326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070414782DNAL7 a10.3390/v120403642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbreu, Filipe  Vieira Santos de10aSurvey on Non-Human Primates and Mosquitoes Does not Provide Evidences of Spillover/Spillback between the Urban and Sylvatic Cycles of Yellow Fever and Zika Viruses Following Severe Outbreaks in Southeast Brazil  aIn the last decade, Flaviviruses such as yellow fever (YFV) and Zika (ZIKV) have expanded their transmission areas. These viruses originated in Africa, where they exhibit both sylvatic and interhuman transmission cycles. In Brazil, the risk of YFV urbanization has grown, with the sylvatic transmission approaching the most densely populated metropolis, while concern about ZIKV spillback to a sylvatic cycle has risen. To investigate these health threats, we carried out extensive collections and arbovirus screening of 144 free-living, non-human primates (NHPs) and 5219 mosquitoes before, during, and after ZIKV and YFV outbreaks (2015–2018) in southeast Brazil. ZIKV infection was not detected in any NHP collected at any time. In contrast, current and previous YFV infections were detected in NHPs sampled between 2017 and 2018, but not before the onset of the YFV outbreak. Mosquito pools screened by high-throughput PCR were positive for YFV when captured in the wild and during the YFV outbreak, but were negative for 94 other arboviruses, including ZIKV, regardless of the time of collection. In conclusion, there was no evidence of YFV transmission in coastal southeast Brazil before the current outbreak, nor the spread or establishment of an independent sylvatic cycle of ZIKV or urban Aedes aegypti transmission of YFV in the region. In view of the region’s receptivity and vulnerability to arbovirus transmission, surveillance of NHPs and mosquitoes should be strengthened and continuous.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aPrimates 3aYellow fever virus 3aZika virus 3aarboviruses 3amonitoring 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3ascreening 3asurveys 3aurbanization 3ayellow fever 3aBrazil1 aFerreira-de-Brito, Anielly 1 aAzevedo, Adriana  de Souza1 aLinhares, José  Henrique Rezende1 ade Oliveira Santos, Vanessa 1 aHime Miranda, Emily 1 aNeves, Maycon  Sebastião Alberto Santos1 aYousfi, Lena 1 aRibeiro, Ieda  Pereira1 aSantos, Alexandre  Araújo Cunha dos1 ados Santos, Edmilson 1 aSantos, Taissa  Pereira dos1 aTeixeira, Danilo  Simonini1 aGomes, Marcelo  Quintela1 aFernandes, Camilla  Bayma1 aSilva, Andrea  Marques Vieira da1 aLima, Monique  da Rocha Queiroz1 aPaupy, Christophe 1 aRomano, Alessandro  Pecego Martins1 aAno Bom, Ana  Paula Dinis1 aOliveira-Pinto, Luzia  Maria de1 aMoutailler, Sara 1 aMotta, Monique  de Albuquerque1 aCastro, Márcia  Gonçalves1 aBonaldo, Myrna  Cristina1 aMaria Barbosa de Lima, Sheila 1 aOliveira, Ricardo Lourenço de,0 tViruses.g2020 Mar. 26, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v120403643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245013600160300001600296520132900312592002801641650001101669650002001680650001401700650001901714650000901733650001801742650001401760650002201774650002401796650001501820651001001835700001201845773013001857856008101987852000902068655001202077IND60631210920221120111948.0190219e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063121092DNAL7 a10.1007/s12603-018-1122-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ming12aA Prospective Association of Nut Consumption with Cognitive Function in Chinese Adults Aged 55+ _ China Health and Nutrition Survey  ap. 211-216.  aOBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the association of nut intake with cognitive function in Chinese adults aged 55 and over. DESIGN: This was a prospective open cohort study with repeated measurements of diet and cognition scores. PARTICIPANTS/SETTINGS: 4822 adults aged 55 and over participating in the China Health Nutrition Survey during 1991–2006. MEASUREMENTS: Global cognitive function measured repeatedly in 1997, 2001, 2004, and 2006 using a subset of modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status; poor cognitive function was defined as cognition score<7. Nut consumption was collected using 3-day 24 recall method in 1991, 1993, and at surveys of cognition assessment. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Multilevel mixed effect linear regression and logistic regression analysis were conducted to assess the association with cognitive function. RESULTS: The unadjusted cognitive score decreased by 0.29 (95% CI 0.22–0.28) with one-year aging during 1997–2006. Nut intake of more than 10g/d was associated with higher cognition score by 0.63 points (95% CI 0.15–1.12) or 40% less likely to have poor cognitive function (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.43–0.84) after adjusted for demographic, lifestyle behavioural, BMI, and energy intake. CONCLUSIONS: Nut consumption was inversely associated with cognition decline.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abody mass index 3acognition 3acohort studies 3adiet 3aenergy intake 3alifestyle 3anutrition surveys 3aregression analysis 3atelephones 3aChina1 aShi, Z.0 tjournal of nutrition, health & aging.g2019 Feb., v. 23, no. 2 p.211-216dSpringer PariswJournal:jnl4279172x1279-77077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12603-018-1122-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245015300155300001800308520105900326592002801385650003401413650001401447650002301461650002001484650001801504650001201522650002601534650001401560650002101574650001101595700001201606700001401618700001501632700001801647700001601665700001301681700001801694700002101712700001701733700001701750773012501767856007401892852000901966655001201975IND60639891720221120064321.0190503e20160516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063989172DNAL7 a10.1039/c6gc00728g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Cunyao10aSingle atom dispersed Rh-biphephos&PPh₃@porous organic copolymers: highly efficient catalysts for continuous fixed-bed hydroformylation of propene  ap. 2995-3005.  aA vinyl functionalized biphephos ligand with high steric hindrance was copolymerized with tris(4-vinphenyl)phosphane and other ligands to afford efficient porous organic copolymers (POPs) through the solvothermal synthesis technique. By employing the copolymer self-supported heterogeneous Rh/CPOL-bp&P catalysts, the hydroformylation of propene to linear-butaldehyde can be performed efficiently in a continuous fixed-bed reactor with high regioselectivity (l/b > 24), activity (TOF > 1200 h⁻¹) and stability (over 1000 h) under mild conditions (70 °C, 0.5 MPa), which represents a substantial improvement in the efficiency of this important industrial process. EXAFS and HAADF-STEM showed that the Rh was a single atom dispersion, which explained well the high efficiency of the Rh/CPOL-bp&P catalysts. Compared with liquid–liquid biphasic (LLB) and ionic liquid (IL) systems, this highly efficient solvent free system has the advantages of simple operability, and almost no waste emission, which meets the demands of green industrial processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3acatalysts 3acomposite polymers 3agreen chemistry 3aionic liquids 3aligands 3aprocessing technology 3apropylene 3aregioselectivity 3awastes1 aYan, Li1 aLu, Lanlu1 aXiong, Kai1 aWang, Wenlong1 aJiang, Miao1 aLiu, Jia1 aSong, Xiangen1 aZhan, Zhuangping1 aJiang, Zheng1 aDing, Yunjie0 tGreen chemistry.g2016 May 16, v. 18, no. 10 p.2995-3005dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6gc00728g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245009100210300001800301506007600319520096500395592002801360506003701388650002101425650002201446650001701468650001301485650002201498650002201520650004401542650003601586650001101622650003401633653000701667653000701674653000901681653001001690653000701700653000801707653001401715653003601729653003701765653002601802653002201828700002601850700002301876700002301899700002801922700001701950700002201967700001701989773010002006856008102106852000902187655001202196IND60564377720221207093205.0170713e20160925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056437772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2016.07.0102doi7 aPMC52608562pmcid7 a274736022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEichmann, Cédric10aS-Nitrosylation Induces Structural and Dynamical Changes in a Rhodanese Family Protein  ap. 3737-3751.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aS-Nitrosylation is well established as an important post-translational regulator in protein function and signaling. However, relatively little is known about its structural and dynamical consequences. We have investigated the effects of S-nitrosylation on the rhodanese domain of the Escherichia coli integral membrane protein YgaP by NMR, X-ray crystallography, and mass spectrometry. The results show that the active cysteine in the rhodanese domain of YgaP is subjected to two competing modifications: S-nitrosylation and S-sulfhydration, which are naturally occurring in vivo. It has been observed that in addition to inhibition of the sulfur transfer activity, S-nitrosylation of the active site residue Cys63 causes an increase in slow motion and a displacement of helix 5 due to a weakening of the interaction between the active site and the helix dipole. These findings provide an example of how nitrosative stress can exert action at the atomic level.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactive sites 3acysteine 3amass spectrometry 3amembrane proteins 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apost-translational modification 3asulfur 3athiosulfate sulfurtransferase 0aNO 0aWT 0aSNOC 0aTROSY 0aMS 0aNOE 0arhodanese 0apost-translational modification 0anuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 0aX-ray crystallography 0amass spectrometry1 aTzitzilonis, Christos1 aNakamura, Tomohiro1 aKwiatkowski, Witek1 aMaslennikov, Innokentiy1 aChoe, Senyon1 aLipton, Stuart A.1 aRiek, Roland0 tJournal of Molecular Biology.g2016 Sept. 25, v. 428 p.3737-3751dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2016.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01213naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245011000127300001600237500001900253520030500272592002800577650001300605650001000618650001500628651001000643653001400653653001700667653001700684653001600701653001200717653001300729773013600742852000900878655001200887IND60706206220221120032144.0200807e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070620622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 a, Mahamood10aFirst Report of Two Diplogastrid Species from India and A Check List of Nematodes of Loktak Lake, Manipur  ap. 144-153.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTwo diplogastrid nematode species, Acrostichus nudicapitatus Steiner, 1914 and Butlerius micans Pillai and Taylor, 1968 are being reported for the first time from the country.

These groups have been pointed out as keys to improve the knowledge on ecosystem dynamics and effects of climate and anthropogenic changes in the marine environment. Orbital remote sensing is stated as the only means capable of analysing spatio-temporal distribution of PFTs, over regional and global scales. Many research teams have focused their efforts on the development of PFT bio-optical models, presenting a great variety of approaches. Considerable advances have been achieved in a few years of research; however, challenges are still great. Further developments rely on improvements in the knowledge of PFTs' bio-optical characteristics and the possibility of integrating different bio-optical and ecological information. This article presents a new review of the state of the art of PFTs' characterization from space, with examples of the main models and a discussion of achievements, gaps and future perspectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3amarine environment 3amodels 3aphytoplankton 3aremote sensing1 aKampel, Milton0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2012 Mar. 20, v. 33, no. 6 p.1967-1990dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2011.601343  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245006700168500001900235520184300254592002802097650001702125650001702142650002302159650001102182650001202193650001402205650002002219650002102239650001702260650001602277651001002293653002402303653001902327653001902346653002802365653001402393700001802407700001902425773013302444856008502577852000902662655001202671IND60710669720221117105839.0201118e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071066972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1100172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Chunju10aCyclostratigraphy and astrochronology: Case studies from China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA high-precision geologic time scale is the essential key for understanding the Earth’s evolutionary history and geologic processes. Astronomical tuning of orbitally forced stratigraphic records to construct high-resolution Astronomical Time Scales (ATS) has led to a progressive refinement of the geologic time scale over the past two decades. In turn, these studies provide new insights regarding the durations and rates of major Earth events, evolutionary processes, and climate changes, all of which provide a scientific basis for contextualizing and predicting future global change trends. South China hosts some of the best-exposed and well-dated Neoproterozoic through Mesozoic stratigraphic sections in the world; many of which are suitable for cyclostratigraphy and calibrating the geologic time scale. In North China, several Cenozoic oil-bearing basins have deep boreholes with continuous sampling and/or well logging that enable derivation of astronomically tuned time scales for an improved understanding of basin evolution and hydrocarbon generation. This Special Issue focuses on case studies of astrochronology and applied cyclostratigraphy research using reference sections within China. In this introductory overview, we: (1) summarize all existing astrochronology studies of the Neoproterozoic through Cenozoic sections within China that have been used to enhance the international geologic time scale, (2) examine briefly the astronomically forced paleoclimate information recorded in various depositional systems and the modern techniques employed to analyze the periodicity of these signals encoded within the sedimentary record, and (3) summarize the 20 contributions to this Special Issue of Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology on 'Cyclostratigraphy and Astrochronology: Case studies from China’.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenozoic era 3aMesozoic era 3aNeoproterozoic era 3abasins 3aclimate 3aevolution 3apalaeogeography 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3aperiodicity 3aChina 0aMilankovitch cycles 0aOrbital cycles 0aClimate change 0aAstronomical time scale 0aSequences1 aOgg, James G.1 aKemp, David B.0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 560 p.110017-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1100173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245012700206300001400333500001900347520109200366592002801458650002201486650002501508650001601533650002001549650003901569650001501608650001501623650001901638650001301657700002001670700001801690700001901708700001501727773012201742856008301864852000901947655001201956IND60714606920221120043117.0210213e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071460692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11120-020-00713-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkimoto, Seiji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8951-897810aAdaptation of light-harvesting and energy-transfer processes of a diatom Chaetoceros gracilis to different light qualities  ap. 87-93.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDiatoms are a major group of microalgae in marine and freshwater environments. To utilize the light energy in blue to green region, diatoms possess unique antenna pigment–protein complexes, fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding proteins (FCPs). Depending on light qualities and quantities, diatoms form FCPs with different energies: normal-type and red-shifted FCPs. In the present study, we examined changes in light-harvesting and energy-transfer processes of a diatom Chaetoceros gracilis cells grown using white- and single-colored light-emitting diodes (LEDs), by means of time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. The blue LED, which is harvested by FCPs, modified energy transfer involving CP47, and suppressed energy transfer to PSI. Under the red-LED conditions, which is absorbed by both FCPs and PSs, energy transfer to PSI was enhanced, and the red-shifted FCP appeared. The red-shifted FCP was also recognized under the green- and yellow-LEDs, suggesting that lack of the shorter-wavelength light induces the red-shifted FCP. Functions of the red-shifted FCPs are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aChaetoceros gracilis 3achlorophyll 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afreshwater 3amicroalgae 3aphotosynthesis 3aresearch1 aUeno, Yoshifumi1 aYokono, Makio1 aShen, Jian-Ren1 aNagao, Ryo0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2020 Dec., v. 146, no. 1-3 p.87-93dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl32702x0166-85957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-020-00713-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245014100166300001800307520155500325592002801880650001501908650001701923650001601940650002101956650001901977650002301996650002002019650001702039650002102056650001102077650002202088650001902110650001402129650002102143650001302164650002702177653005202204653002702256653003402283653005202317653002802369653003502397700001802432700001602450700001502466700001902481700001302500773011902513856008702632852000902719655001202728IND60569426820221118104642.0170528e20161007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056942682DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b005562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Siting10aCharacterization of the Translationally Controlled Tumor Protein (TCTP) Interactome Reveals Novel Binding Partners in Human Cancer Cells  ap. 3741-3751.  aTranslationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is a highly conserved housekeeping protein present in eukaryotic organisms. It is involved in regulating many fundamental processes and plays a critical role in tumor reversion and tumorigenesis. Increasing evidence suggests that TCTP plays a role in the regulation of cell fate determination and is a promising therapeutic target for cancer. To decipher the exact mechanisms by which TCTP functions and how all these functions are integrated, we analyzed the interactome of TCTP in HeLa cells by coimmunoprecipitation (IP) and mass spectrometry (MS). A total of 98 proteins were identified. We confirmed the in vitro and in vivo association of TCTP with six of the identified binding proteins using reciprocal IP and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis, respectively. Moreover, TCTP interacted with Y-box-binding protein 1 (YBX1), and their interaction was localized to the N-terminal region of TCTP and the 1–129 amino acid (aa) residues of YBX1. The YBX1 protein plays an important role in cell proliferation, RNA splicing, DNA repair, drug resistance, and stress response to extracellular signals. These data suggest that the interaction of TCTP with YBX1 might cooperate or coordinate their functions in the control of diverse regulatory pathways in cancer cells. Taken together, our results not only reveal a large number of TCTP-associated proteins that possess pleiotropic functions, but also provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of TCTP in tumorigenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA repair 3aRNA splicing 3aamino acids 3abinding proteins 3acarcinogenesis 3acell proliferation 3adrug resistance 3afluorescence 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3amass spectrometry 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aprecipitin tests 3aproteome 3atranslation (genetics) 0atranslationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) 0amass spectrometry (MS) 0acoimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) 0abimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) 0aPeroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) 0aY-box-binding protein 1 (YBX1)1 aChen, Minghai1 aXiong, Qian1 aZhang, Jia1 aCui, Zongqiang1 aGe, Feng0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2016 Oct. 07, v. 15, no. 10 p.3741-3751dAmerican Chemical Societyx1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jproteome.6b005563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009600165300001600261520190400277592002802181650001002209650003402219650001202253650001202265650002402277650001502301650001402316650001002330650000802340650002002348650001502368650001002383651001802393700001602411700001702427700001602444700001502460700001702475773013002492856008102622852000902703655001202712IND60631211120221120111858.0190219e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063121112DNAL7 a10.1007/s12603-018-1133-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGrath, Ryan14aThe Burden of Functional Disabilities for Middle-Aged and Older Adults in the United States  ap. 172-174.  aOBJECTIVES: Understanding the role of functional capacity on longevity is important as the population in the United States ages. The purpose of this study was to determine the burden of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and activities of daily living (ADL) disabilities for a nationally-representative sample of middle-aged and older adults in the United States. DESIGN: Longitudinal-Panel. SETTING: Core interviews were often performed in person or over the telephone. PARTICIPANTS: A sub-sample of 31,055 participants aged at least 50 years from the 1998–2014 waves of the Health and Retirement Study who reported having a functional disability were included. MEASUREMENTS: Ability to perform IADLs and ADLs were self-reported at each wave. The National Death Index was used to ascertain date of death. The number of years of life that were lost (YLLs) and years lived with a disability (YLDs) were summed for the calculation of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Sampling weights were used in the analyses to make the DALYs nationally-representative. The results for YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs are reported in thousands. RESULTS: Of the participants included, 14,990 had an IADL disability and 13,136 had an ADL disability. Men and women with an IADL disability had 236,037 and 233,772 DALYs, respectively; whereas, there were 178,594 DALYs for males and 253,630 DALYs for females with an ADL disability. Collectively, there were 469,809 years of healthy life lost from IADL impairments, and 432,224 years of healthy life lost from ADL limitations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings should be used to inform healthcare providers and guide interventions aiming to preserve the functional capacity of aging adults. Prioritizing health-related resources for mitigating the burden of functional disabilities may help aging adults increase their quality of life and life expectancy over time.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeath 3adisability-adjusted life year 3aelderly 3afemales 3ahealth care workers 3ainterviews 3alongevity 3amales 3amen 3aquality of life 3atelephones 3awomen 3aUnited States1 aAl Snih, S.1 aMarkides, K.1 aHackney, K.1 aBailey, R.1 aPeterson, M.0 tjournal of nutrition, health & aging.g2019 Feb., v. 23, no. 2 p.172-174dSpringer PariswJournal:jnl4279172x1279-77077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12603-018-1133-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003200188245006200220300001800282506007600300520097900376592002801355506003701383650002301420650001901443650002101462650002401483650002401507650001401531653000801545653000701553653000701560653000801567653000701575653000801582653000701590653000901597653000901606653000801615653000801623653000801631653000801639653000801647653000801655653000801663653000801671653000701679653000801686653001001694653001301704653002401717653002501741653002801766653002301794700002101817700002201838773010001860856008101960852000902041655001202050IND60564378020221207082602.0170713e20160925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056437802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2016.08.0032doi7 aPMC50234992pmcid7 a275197962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZschiedrich, Christopher P.10aMolecular Mechanisms of Two-Component Signal Transduction  ap. 3752-3775.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwo-component systems (TCS) comprising sensor histidine kinases and response regulator proteins are among the most important players in bacterial and archaeal signal transduction and also occur in reduced numbers in some eukaryotic organisms. Given their importance to cellular survival, virulence, and cellular development, these systems are among the most scrutinized bacterial proteins. In the recent years, a flurry of bioinformatics, genetic, biochemical, and structural studies have provided detailed insights into many molecular mechanisms that underlie the detection of signals and the generation of the appropriate response by TCS. Importantly, it has become clear that there is significant diversity in the mechanisms employed by individual systems. This review discusses the current knowledge on common themes and divergences from the paradigm of TCS signaling. An emphasis is on the information gained by a flurry of recent structural and bioinformatics studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacterial proteins 3abioinformatics 3ahistidine kinase 3aregulatory proteins 3asignal transduction 3avirulence 0aTCS 0aHK 0aRR 0aPAS 0aSD 0aPBP 0aMD 0aHAMP 0aSTAC 0aLOV 0aDCA 0aREC 0aT/S 0aF/Y 0aGAF 0aNIT 0aDHp 0aCA 0aHTH 0aANTAR 0ac-di-GMP 0asignal transduction 0atwo-component system 0asensor histidine kinase 0aresponse regulator1 aKeidel, Victoria1 aSzurmant, Hendrik0 tJournal of Molecular Biology.g2016 Sept. 25, v. 428 p.3752-3775dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2016.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03583naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245015300211300001600364520185800380592002802238650002102266650001402287650002802301650000902329650002202338650002102360650001102381650001902392650003002411650001702441650001302458650002702471650001402498650002002512651001002532653000902542653001902551653002102570653002502591653003402616653002002650700002302670700002202693700002102715700005802736700005902794773010602853856008502959852000903044655001203053IND60592340720221119004108.0190516e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059234072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2018.01.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOziolor, Elias M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4078-105410aPolychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination in Galveston Bay, Texas: Comparing concentrations and profiles in sediments, passive samplers, and fish  ap. 609-618.  aThe industrialized portion of the Houston Ship Channel (HSC) is heavily contaminated with anthropogenic contaminants, most prominent of which are the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). This contamination has driven adaptive evolution in a keystone species for Galveston Bay, the Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis). We investigated the geographical extent of PCB impacts by sampling 12 sites, ranging from the heavily industrialized upper portion of the HSC to Galveston Island. At each site, PCB concentrations and profiles were determined in three environmental compartments: sediment, water (polyethylene passive samplers), and fish tissue (resident Gulf killifish). We observed a steep gradient of PCB contamination, ranging from 4.00 to 100,000 ng/g organic carbon in sediment, 290–110,000 ng/g lipid in fish, and 4.5–2300 ng/g polyethylene in passive samplers. The PCB congener profiles in Gulf killifish at the most heavily contaminated sites were shifted toward the higher chlorinated PCBs and were highly similar to the sediment contamination profiles. In addition, while magnitude of total PCB concentrations in sediment and total fish contamination levels were highly correlated between sites, the relative PCB congener profiles in fish and passive samplers were more alike. This strong correlation, along with a lack of dependency of biota-sediment accumulation factors with total contamination rates, confirm the likely non-migratory nature of Gulf killifish and suggest their contamination levels are a good site-specific indicator of contamination in the Galveston Bay area. The spatial gradient of PCB contamination in Galveston Bay was evident in all three matrices studied and was observed effectively using Gulf killifish contamination as an environmentally relevant bioindicator of localized contamination in this environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFundulus grandis 3aestuaries 3aevolutionary adaptation 3afish 3aindustrialization 3akeystone species 3alipids 3aorganic carbon 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolyethylene 3asamplers 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3awater pollution 3aTexas 0aPCBs 0aGulf killifish 0aFundulus grandis 0aHouston ship channel 0aPolyethylene passive samplers 0aBioavailability1 aApell, Jennifer N.1 aWinfield, Zach C.1 aBack, Jeffrey A.1 aUsenko, Sascha1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3303-29091 aMatson, Cole W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6472-93570 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 May, v. 236 p.609-618dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2018.01.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009800168520166000266592002801926650002801954650001301982650001901995650001302014650001502027650001602042650001502058653002702073653001902100653001802119653003102137653001902168700002002187700002202207700001702229700001802246773010602264856008602370852000902456655001202465IND60710670020221117111155.0220830e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071067002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2020.1131672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, Alexei10aCardiac autonomic and blood pressure responses to an acute session of battling ropes exercise  aBattling rope (BTR) exercise has become incredibly popular among not only fitness enthusiasts and athletes but in the general exercising population. Despite its popularity, research regarding the acute cardiovascular responses to BTR exercise is limited. This investigation evaluated the effects of acute BTR exercise on heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure (BP) responses in young men with elevated BP. Eleven young men with elevated BP completed either a BTR or a non-exercise control trial in randomized order. The BTR trial consisted of 10 rounds of BTR exercise. Each round included 30 s of exercise followed by 30 s of rest. HRV and BP were evaluated at baseline and 3, 10, and 30 min following each trial. There were significant elevations (p ˂0.01) in heart rate, markers of sympathetic activity (nLF), and sympathovagal balance (LnLF/LnHF, nLF/nHF) for 30 min following the BTR trial, whereas no changes from baseline were detected after control. Additionally, there were significant reductions (p ˂0.01) in markers of vagal tone (RMSSD, LnHF and nHF) and LnLF (both sympathetic and vagal modulations) for 30 min; as well as (p ˂0.01) systolic BP and diastolic BP at 10 and 30 min after the BTR, but not the control trial. Current findings revealed that BTR exercise elevates sympathovagal balance for 30 min post-intervention, which is concurrent with an impressive hypotensive effect. Further investigations are warranted to assess the potential clinical application of BTR exercise not only in cohorts needing BP control but also in populations with limited locomotion that might benefit from post-exercise hypotension.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantihypertensive effect 3abehavior 3ablood pressure 3aexercise 3aheart rate 3ahypotension 3alocomotion 0aHeart rate variability 0aBattling ropes 0aRope training 0aCardiac autonomic function 0aBlood pressure1 aBergen, Douglas1 aNordvall, Michael1 aAllnutt, Amy1 aBagheri, Reza0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 227 p.113167-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2020.1131673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009200167300001800259520162300277592002801900650000801928650001801936650002001954650002001974650001001994650001902004650001202023650001202035650002102047650001902068650003002087700001702117700005602134700005902190773012802249856008402377852000902461655001202470IND60598615220221122043904.0180702e20180508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059861522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.7b049162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Zhixin10aApplication of DNA Machineries for the Barcode Patterned Detection of Genes or Proteins  ap. 6468-6476.  aThe study introduces an analytical platform for the detection of genes or aptamer-ligand complexes by nucleic acid barcode patterns generated by DNA machineries. The DNA machineries consist of nucleic acid scaffolds that include specific recognition sites for the different genes or aptamer-ligand analytes. The binding of the analytes to the scaffolds initiate, in the presence of the nucleotide mixture, a cyclic polymerization/nicking machinery that yields displaced strands of variable lengths. The electrophoretic separation of the resulting strands provides barcode patterns for the specific detection of the different analytes. Mixtures of DNA machineries that yield, upon sensing of different genes (or aptamer ligands), one-, two-, or three-band barcode patterns are described. The combination of nucleic acid scaffolds acting, in the presence of polymerase/nicking enzyme and nucleotide mixture, as DNA machineries, that generate multiband barcode patterns provide an analytical platform for the detection of an individual gene out of many possible genes. The diversity of genes (or other analytes) that can be analyzed by the DNA machineries and the barcode patterned imaging is given by the Pascal’s triangle. As a proof-of-concept, the detection of one of six genes, that is, TP53, Werner syndrome, Tay-Sachs normal gene, BRCA1, Tay-Sachs mutant gene, and cystic fibrosis disorder gene by six two-band barcode patterns is demonstrated. The advantages and limitations of the detection of analytes by polymerase/nicking DNA machineries that yield barcode patterns as imaging readout signals are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA barcoding 3acystic fibrosis 3aelectrophoresis 3agenes 3aimage analysis 3aligands 3amutants 3aoligonucleotides 3apolymerization 3atumor suppressor proteins1 aLuo, Guofeng1 aWulf, Verena1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0155-98291 aWillner, Itamar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9710-90770 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 May 08, v. 90, no. 11 p.6468-6476dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b049163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03501naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100003000188245010600218300001100324506007600335520166300411592002802074596011602102596009402218506003702312650001902349650001802368650002102386650001002407650002602417650003102443650001002474650004202484650001102526650001802537650001302555650002002568650002102588650002602609700002702635700002402662700002002686700002302706700006002729773010302789856008202892852000902974655001202983IND60631211320221207081458.0210119e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063121132DNAL7 a307770092pmid7 aPMC63799842pmcid7 a10.1186/s12870-019-1679-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanz-Carbonell, Alejandro10aInferring the regulatory network of the miRNA-mediated response to biotic and abiotic stress in melon  ap. 78.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: MiRNAs have emerged as key regulators of stress response in plants, suggesting their potential as candidates for knock-in/out to improve stress tolerance in agricultural crops. Although diverse assays have been performed, systematic and detailed studies of miRNA expression and function during exposure to multiple environments in crops are limited. RESULTS: Here, we present such pioneering analysis in melon plants in response to seven biotic and abiotic stress conditions. Deep-sequencing and computational approaches have identified twenty-four known miRNAs whose expression was significantly altered under at least one stress condition, observing that down-regulation was preponderant. Additionally, miRNA function was characterized by high scale degradome assays and quantitative RNA measurements over the intended target mRNAs, providing mechanistic insight. Clustering analysis provided evidence that eight miRNAs showed a broad response range under the stress conditions analyzed, whereas another eight miRNAs displayed a narrow response range. Transcription factors were predominantly targeted by stress-responsive miRNAs in melon. Furthermore, our results show that the miRNAs that are down-regulated upon stress predominantly have as targets genes that are known to participate in the stress response by the plant, whereas the miRNAs that are up-regulated control genes linked to development. CONCLUSION: Altogether, this high-resolution analysis of miRNA-target interactions, combining experimental and computational work, Illustrates the close interplay between miRNAs and the response to diverse environmental conditions, in melon.  aPublisher supplied data  aAGL2016-79825-R and BIO2014-61826-EXPcMinisterio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España  aBFU2015-66894-PcMinisterio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabiotic stress 3abiotic stress 3acluster analysis 3acrops 3aenvironmental factors 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amelons 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3atranscription factors1 aMarques, María Carmen1 aBustamante, Antonio1 aFares, Mario A.1 aRodrigo, Guillermo1 aGómez, Gustavo,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3715-77920 tBMC plant biology.g2019 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.78-78dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-019-1679-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010200173300001600275520125400291592002801545650001901573650001101592650001301603650001201616650001601628650002501644650001401669650001301683650001201696650000901708650001401717700001901731700002601750700002801776700002001804700002201824700002801846773013901874856008402013852000902097655001202106IND60123502220221118041738.0150325e20140504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012350222DNAL7 a10.1080/00028487.2014.8897492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGover, Theodore R.10aHow Much Cleaning is Needed When Processing Otoliths from Fish Larvae for Microchemical Analysis?  ap. 779-783.  aOtolith microchemistry is a widely used tool in fish ecology and fisheries management. Cleaning-protocol assessments are lacking, however, especially for larval fish otoliths, which are more fragile and difficult to manipulate than larger otoliths. Herein, we assess the value of cleaning larval fish otoliths with sonication, a commonly used technique that is time consuming and risks loss or breakage of small otoliths, as well as with a lesser-known technique using a low-power laser cleaning pulse (LPLCP). We measured trace elements in larval Walleye Sander vitreus reared in different water strontium concentrations. Strontium and Ba did not differ among any cleaning treatments, indicating that neither sonication nor a LPLCP is necessary. Likewise, Mn did not differ between sonicated and nonsonicated treatments; however, Mn was lower when a LPLCP was used. We suggest omitting the sonication step when preparing otoliths for trace element analysis of Sr, Ba, Mn, and other trace elements found in high abundances. The addition of a LPLCP is useful, although more research in this arena is warranted. Our findings should greatly reduce otolith processing time and the risk of losing and breaking larval otoliths during the cleaning process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSander vitreus 3abarium 3acleaning 3aecology 3afish larvae 3afisheries management 3amanganese 3aotoliths 3arearing 3arisk 3astrontium1 aNims, Megan K.1 aVan Tassell, Jason J.1 aCollingsworth, Paris D.1 aOlesik, John W.1 aLudsin, Stuart A.1 aMarschall, Elizabeth A.0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2014 May 4, v. 143, no. 3 p.779-783dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19703x1548-86597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2014.8897493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02067naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009000169300001800259520108000277592002801357650001201385650001901397650005001416650001401466650000901480650002501489700001801514700001601532700001301548773012001561856005101681852000901732655001201741IND50087985820221120024714.0140412e20120320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008798582DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2011.6033782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hongshuo10aRice heading date retrieval based on multi-temporal MODIS data and polynomial fitting  ap. 1905-1916.  aThe objective of the study is to identify the rice heading date and analyse its spatial characteristics on a regional scale using multi-temporal Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) data and a new approach: quadratic polynomial fitting. The cloud-contaminated NDVI value was identified by reliability data and linearly interpolated with values before and after the cloudy one. The discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) and quadratic polynomial fitting were implemented to generate new time series curves. Rice heading date was retrieved by calculating the day for maximum NDVI. Comparing with DFT, the proposed quadratic polynomial fitting significantly improves the computation efficiency, while providing approximate precision of estimation. In regional analysis, the rice heading date retrieved from polynomial fitting is more consistent than that from DFT. The study also suggests that multi-temporal MODIS NDVI data combined with different methods can retrieve crop phenology information on a large scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheading 3aimage analysis 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aphenology 3arice 3atime series analysis1 aChen, Jinsong1 aWu, Zhifeng1 aLin, Hui0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2012 Mar. 20, v. 33, no. 6 p.1905-1916dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2011.603378  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014300168300001600311500001900327520191400346592002802260650001902288650001102307650002802318650002802346650002402374650001202398650002002410650002102430650002102451650002102472650001202493650002102505700002002526700002602546700007102572773014002643856008202783852000902865655001202874IND60714607620221122161530.0210302e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071460762DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623604200500822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarelkina, T.

Hämet-Ahti). It was previously established that this type of xylogenesis is accompanied by significant changes in activity of sucrose-metabolizing enzymes, sucrose synthase and invertase, in the birch trunk’s tissues. The results of molecular genetic analysis indicate that the activity of these enzymes is regulated mainly at the level of transcription of the genes encoding them (SUS and CWInv). The genes encoding sucrose synthase and cell-wall invertase in the silver birch genome were identified. In silico analysis of the regulatory cis-elements present in the 2-kb promoter region of these genes revealed a number of motifs involved in the regulation of their expression. The largest (in terms of both the number of individual elements and their occurrence) was the group of elements associated with the influence of abiotic factors, mainly light and drought. A number of tissue-specific motifs, the function of which is associated with gene expression in conducting tissues, were identified. Analysis of hormone-dependent elements showed that the formation of figured wood of Karelian birch, which occurs against the background of high apoplastic invertase activity, is obviously not associated with the activation of CWInv genes by a high level of auxin. In the studied promoter sequences, various elements indicating the direct effect of sugar signaling were found. Two most likely candidates for involvement in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in the birch trunk tissues—transcription factors (TF) DOF5.6 (HCA2) and DOF5.8—were identified. The identification and functional characteristics of the DOF family TFs of silver birch are of interest from the point of view of the regulation of alternative scenarios of xylogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula pendula 3aauxins 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acomputer simulation 3adrought 3agene expression 3agenetic analysis 3agrain and figure 3apromoter regions 3asucrose 3asucrose synthase1 aGalibina, N.

In this study, we identified a new ι-carrageenase, encoded by cgiF, in psychrophilic bacterium Flavobacterium sp. YS-80-122. The deduced ι-carrageenase, CgiF, belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 82 and shows less than 40% amino acid identity with characterized ι-carrageenases. The activity of recombinant CgiF peaked at 30°C (1,207.8U/mg). Notably, CgiF is a cold-adapted ι-carrageenase, which showed 36.5% and 57% of the maximum activity at 10°C and 15°C, respectively. In addition, it is a thermo-tolerant enzyme that recovered 58.2% of its initial activity after heat shock. Furthermore, although the activity of CgiF was enhanced by NaCl, the enzyme is active in absence of NaCl. This study also shows that CgiF is an endo-type ι-carrageenase that hydrolyzes β-1,4-linkages of ι-carrageenan, yielding neo-ι-carratetraose as the main product. Its cold-adaptation, thermo-tolerance, NaCl independence and high neo-ι-carratetraose yield make CgiF an excellent candidate for industrial applications in production of ι-carrageen oligosaccharides from seaweed polysaccharides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFlavobacterium 3aamino acids 3aantioxidants 3aglycosides 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3ahydrolysates 3aindustrial applications 3aiota-carrageenan 3amacroalgae 3aoligosaccharides 3apsychrophilic bacteria 3asodium chloride 0aι-Carrageenase 0aCold-adapted 0aThermo-tolerant1 aHao, Jianhua1 aSun, Mi0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017 Sept., v. 102 p.1059-1065dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.04.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03319naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245017300176520144800349592002801797650002401825650002201849650002501871650001001896650002301906650002101929650001101950650000901961650003001970650002002000650001502020650002302035650003002058650001202088650001302100653002102113653001702134653002702151653002402178653002602202653001402228653000802242653000802250653000802258653000802266653001302274653001302287653001402300653001402314653000902328653000702337653000802344700002302352700002302375700002502398700002402423700002702447773009802474856008802572852000902660655001202669IND60710670420221117110705.0220314e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071067042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.1125122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToporkova, Yana Y.14aThe CYP74B and CYP74D divinyl ether synthases possess a side hydroperoxide lyase and epoxyalcohol synthase activities that are enhanced by the site-directed mutagenesis  aThe CYP74 family of cytochromes P450 includes four enzymes of fatty acid hydroperoxide metabolism: allene oxide synthase (AOS), hydroperoxide lyase (HPL), divinyl ether synthase (DES), and epoxyalcohol synthase (EAS). The present work is concerned with catalytic specificities of three recombinant DESs, namely, the 9-DES (LeDES, CYP74D1) of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), 9-DES (NtDES, CYP74D3) of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), and 13-DES (LuDES, CYP74B16) of flax (Linum usitatissimum), as well as their alterations upon the site-directed mutagenesis. Both LeDES and NtDES converted 9-hydroperoxides of linoleic and α−linolenic acids to divinyl ethers colneleic and colnelenic acids (respectively) with only minorities of HPL and EAS products. In contrast, LeDES and NtDES showed low efficiency towards the linoleate 13-hydroperoxide, affording only the low yield of epoxyalcohols. LuDES exhibited mainly the DES activity towards α−linolenate 13-hydroperoxide (preferred substrate), and HPL activity towards linoleate 13-hydroperoxide, respectively. In contrast, LuDES converted 9-hydroperoxides primarily to the epoxyalcohols. The F291V and A287G mutations within the I-helix groove region (SRS-4) of LuDES resulted in the loss of DES activity and the acquirement of the epoxyalcohol synthase activity. Thus, the studied enzymes exhibited the versatility of catalysis and its qualitative alterations upon the site-directed mutagenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLinum usitatissimum 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aacids 3acatalytic activity 3acytochrome P-450 3aethers 3aflax 3ahydroperoxide dehydratase 3alipid peroxides 3ametabolism 3aplant biochemistry 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3atobacco 3atomatoes 0aCytochromes P450 0aCYP74 family 0aDivinyl ether synthase 0aHydroperoxide lyase 0aEpoxyalcohol synthase 0aOxylipins 0aDES 0aHPL 0aEAS 0aAOS 0a9-H(P)OD 0a9-H(P)OT 0a13-H(P)OD 0a13-H(P)OT 0aIMAC 0aMe 0aTMS1 aSmirnova, Elena O.1 aIljina, Tatiana M.1 aMukhtarova, Lucia S.1 aGorina, Svetlana S.1 aGrechkin, Alexander N.0 tPhytochemistry.g2020 Nov., v. 179 p.112512-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.1125123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03119naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010600170300001600276500001900292520142900311592002801740650002101768650001601789650001101805650001201816650001601828650001101844650001001855650001301865650001601878650003501894650003701929650001301966650001301979650001401992650001402006650002002020650001602040651001002056651001102066653004202077653002102119653004002140700005802180700007002238700005902308773013102367856008202498852000902580655001202589IND60731189620221118061801.0210318e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073118962DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-07-20-0268-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDowling, Madeline10aCharacterization of High Fludioxonil Resistance in Botrytis cinerea Isolates from Calibrachoa Flowers  ap. 478-484.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe fungicide fludioxonil is one of the most effective single-site fungicides available for managing flower blight caused by Botrytis cinerea on fruit and ornamental crops. Although low and moderate levels of resistance to fludioxonil have been reported in the pathogen across the United States and Europe, high resistance has been reported only from greenhouses in China. In this study, two B. cinerea isolates with high resistance (half maximal effective concentration >100 µg/ml) to fludioxonil were detected on ornamental calibrachoa flowers grown in a greenhouse. These isolates exhibited stable resistance for >20 generations, produced symptoms on calibrachoa flowers sprayed with label rates of fludioxonil, and displayed in vitro fitness penalties with decreased mycelial growth (P < 0.0001) and sporulation (P < 0.0001) compared with sensitive isolates. Highly resistant isolates were identified as MDR1h, containing the ΔL/V497 deletion in mrr1. However, resistance levels and in vitro fitness parameter characteristics were not consistent with this phenotype. One isolate contained the mutation L267V between HAMP domains 1 and 2 of the Bos-1 gene, and both isolates exhibited high osmotic sensitivity and reduced glycerol accumulation in the presence of fludioxonil, indicating that high resistance of these isolates may be associated with the high-osmolarity glycerol mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aCalibrachoa 3ablight 3aflowers 3afludioxonil 3afruits 3agenes 3aglycerol 3agreenhouses 3amedian effective concentration 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amutation 3amycelium 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3aplant pathology 3asporulation 3aChina 3aEurope 0aantimicrobial or fungicide resistance 0achemical control 0adisease control and pest management1 aGelain, Jhulia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8707-24501 aMay De Mio, Louise Larissa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4202-44281 aSchnabel, Guido1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9642-19200 tPhytopathology.g2021 Mar., v. 111, no. 3 p.478-484dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-07-20-0268-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009400169300001600263520153300279592002801812650002901840650001201869650001401881650001301895650001501908650002301923650002401946650001301970650001701983650002302000650001302023650002202036651001902058700002502077773013902102856008402241852000902325655001202334IND60123502520221118041742.0150325e20140504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012350252DNAL7 a10.1080/00028487.2014.8925352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNims, Megan K.10aContingents of Southern Flounder from Subtropical Estuaries Revealed by Otolith Chemistry  ap. 721-731.  aThe identification of contingents within populations that exhibit distinct migratory behaviors and patterns of habitat use can lead to the understanding of the fitness consequences of individual variability in a population and an increased understanding of population dynamics. This study examines the variation in migratory behavior and habitat use patterns in Southern Flounder Paralichthys lethostigma in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, whose populations have declined rapidly over the last 25–30 years. The putative life history for this species includes short postsettlement movements into low-salinity habitats, followed by estuarine and marine residency for the remainder of life. However, using otolith Ba:Ca in wild-captured fish, two primary contingents were observed: (1) 54% of fish showed marine–estuarine residency for their entire lifetimes, and (2) 46% showed residence in oligohaline habitats for some portion of their lifetimes. For the second group, oligohaline residence varied widely with life history profiles, having between < 5% up to > 95% of values above the oligohaline threshold. Relationships between the proportion of life spent in oligohaline waters and proxies of growth performance were not significant, indicating no apparent difference in the relative advantage of specific residency patterns. Residence in oligohaline habitats thus appears to be facultative for this population, which may be a local adaptation to interannual drought cycles and variable freshwater inputs in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParalichthys lethostigma 3adrought 3aestuaries 3aflounder 3afreshwater 3agrowth performance 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3alife history 3amigratory behavior 3aotoliths 3apopulation growth 3aGulf of Mexico1 aWalther, Benjamin D.0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2014 May 4, v. 143, no. 3 p.721-731dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19703x1548-86597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2014.8925353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03531naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245010900208300001600317520176400333592002802097650001102125650002302136650002002159650001402179650002002193650001502213650000902228650001402237650001502251650002502266650002602291650001702317650001302334650001902347650002602366650001402392651001002406653001702416653002902433653001002462653002902472653001702501653001802518700005702536700002402593700001902617700006002636700002702696773016002723856008502883852000902968655001202977IND60717989420221120152528.0210226e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071798942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.10.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPearcy, Joshua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6115-698X10aWard-based nutrition care practices and a snapshot of patient care: Results from nutritionDay in the ICU  ap. 340-345.  aPoor adherence to intensive care unit (ICU) guidelines is common, leading to suboptimal nutritional care. This study determined current ward-based nutrition care practices in the Indian ICU setting, comparing them to international best-practice guidelines and provided patient demographic, clinical and nutritional information to serve as baseline data for future benchmarking.This multi-site cross-sectional retrospective study analysed data collected from nutritionDay worldwide audits (2012–2016) across ICUs from a chain of urban private hospitals in India. Additional guideline-specific data were collected through questionnaires and phone interviews with the Head of Dietetics Departments in the participating hospitals.Overall, 10 ICUs and 457 participants were included. It was common practice to use modified versions of the Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF) and Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) for nutrition screening and assessment. Nearly half the participants (n = 222, 49%) received nutrition orally. A majority of the remaining participants received enteral nutrition (n = 163, 36%) or no nutrition (n = 60, 13%) at the time of data collection. The calories prescribed for most participants were between 1500 and 1999 kilocalories per day (n = 207, 45%), with no nutrition planned for 115 (25%) participants. Three-quarters (n = 129, 74%) of participants on EN received the planned calories, while 24% (n = 42) were given less than planned.Overall, most participants received the calories planned for enteral nutrition. The use of modified screening and assessment tools and suboptimal delivery of EN remains a global problem for critical care, possibly requiring a more pragmatic approach to nutritional therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaudits 3aclinical nutrition 3adata collection 3adietetics 3aenteral feeding 3aguidelines 3ahead 3ahospitals 3ainterviews 3anutrition assessment 3anutrition information 3apatient care 3apatients 3aquestionnaires 3aretrospective studies 3ascreening 3aIndia 0anutritionDay 0aBest-practice guidelines 0aIndia 0aNutrition care practices 0aMalnutrition 0aCritical care1 aAgarwal, Ekta1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5687-95421 aIsenring, Elizabeth1 aSomani, Ananya1 aWright, Charlene1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2918-60321 aShankar, Bhuvaneshwari0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2021 Feb., v. 41 p.340-345dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01537naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012800166300001800294520029600312592002800608650001200636650002300648650002300671650002300694650001200717650001400729650003000743650002200773653002900795653001900824653002800843700001400871700001600885700001800901700001500919773011200934856008401046852000901130655001201139IND60604027520221119220807.0180716e20150715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060402752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2015.05.0982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Meihua10aRegio- and stereoselective synthesis of (E)-β-halo alkenyl ketones/sulfones via haloallylation of alkynyl ketones/sulfones  ap. 4388-4391.  aAn atom-economic protocol to the regio- and stereoselective formation of tetrasubstituted alkenyl ketones/sulfones is realized via the Pd-catalyzed haloallylation of alkynyl ketones/sulfones, which provides an efficient and straightforward pathway to synthesis highly functionalized alkenes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkenes 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aketones 3aprotocols 3astereoselective synthesis 3astereoselectivity 0aAlkynyl ketones/sulfones 0aHaloallylation 0aPolysubstituted alkenes1 aWang, Jun1 aFang, Kuang1 aWang, Shengke1 aYan, Liqin0 tTetrahedron letters.g2015 July 15, v. 56, no. 29 p.4388-4391dElsevier LtdwJournal:11745x0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2015.05.0983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03544naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011700170300001600287520188400303592002802187650002102215650001702236650001802253650002202271650001502293650002402308650002702332650002702359650002202386650002702408650002402435650001302459650000902472650002002481650001902501650001202520650001102532650002202543650001102565650001502576650002402591650002402615650001302639650000802652650001002660650001902670650000902689700002502698700002202723700002302745773010802768856008102876852000902957655001202966IND60477810220221117043011.0160527e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047781022DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-015-4739-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdams, Temitope F.10a“Singing in the Tube”—audiovisual assay of plant oil repellent activity against mosquitoes (Culex pipiens)  ap. 225-239.  aPlant essential oils have been suggested as a promising alternative to the established mosquito repellent DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide). Searching for an assay with generally available equipment, we designed a new audiovisual assay of repellent activity against mosquitoes “Singing in the Tube,” testing single mosquitoes in Drosophila cultivation tubes. Statistics with regression analysis should compensate for limitations of simple hardware. The assay was established with female Culex pipiens mosquitoes in 60 experiments, 120-h audio recording, and 2580 estimations of the distance between mosquito sitting position and the chemical. Correlations between parameters of sitting position, flight activity pattern, and flight tone spectrum were analyzed. Regression analysis of psycho-acoustic data of audio files (dB[A]) used a squared and modified sinus function determining wing beat frequency WBF ± SD (357 ± 47 Hz). Application of logistic regression defined the repelling velocity constant. The repelling velocity constant showed a decreasing order of efficiency of plant essential oils: rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus), lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), citronella (Cymbopogon nardus), tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia), clove (Syzygium aromaticum), lemon (Citrus limon), patchouli (Pogostemon cablin), DEET, cedar wood (Cedrus atlantica). In conclusion, we suggest (1) disease vector control (e.g., impregnation of bed nets) by eight plant essential oils with repelling velocity superior to DEET, (2) simple mosquito repellency testing in Drosophila cultivation tubes, (3) automated approaches and room surveillance by generally available audio equipment (dB[A]: ISO standard 226), and (4) quantification of repellent activity by parameters of the audiovisual assay defined by correlation and regression analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCedrus atlantica 3aCitrus limon 3aCulex pipiens 3aCymbopogon nardus 3aDrosophila 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aLavandula angustifolia 3aMelaleuca alternifolia 3aPogostemon cablin 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3aSyzygium aromaticum 3abed nets 3adeet 3adisease vectors 3aessential oils 3afemales 3aflight 3ainsect repellents 3alemons 3amonitoring 3aplant fats and oils 3aregression analysis 3arosemary 3atea 3atrees 3avector control 3awood1 aWongchai, Chatchawal1 aChaidee, Anchalee1 aPfeiffer, Wolfgang0 tParasitology research.g2016 Jan., v. 115, no. 1 p.225-239dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-015-4739-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245009500162300001800257520157000275592002801845650002601873650002501899650002301924650001501947650001201962650000701974700005101981700002102032700001802053700005502071773012802126856008402254852000902338655001202347IND60598615820221122044153.0180702e20180313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059861582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.7b049292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Hui10aMixing Assisted “Hot Spots” Occupying SERS Strategy for Highly Sensitive In Situ Study  ap. 4535-4543.  aTo solve the problem that analyte molecules cannot easily enter “hot spots” on a conventional solid SERS substrate, we developed a mixing-assisted “hot spots” occupying (MAHSO) SERS strategy to improve utilization of “hot spots”. Compared with the conventional substrate, the MAHSO substrate enhances the sensitivity of SERS measurement by thousands of times. The MAHSO substrate possesses excellent properties of high enhancement, high uniformity, and long-term stability because the MAHSO substrate is integrated inside an ultrafast microfluidic mixer. The mixer makes analytes and metal colloid homogeneously mixed, and analytes are naturally located in “hot spots”, the gaps between adjacent NPs, during the process that NPs deposit on the channel wall. As a multi-inlet device, the MAHSO chip offers a convenient in situ method to study environmental effects on analytes or molecular interactions by flexibly regulating fluid in microchannels and monitoring responses of analytes by SERS spectra. Because all experiments are conducted in aqueous environments, which is similar to the physiological conditions, the MAHSO chip is especially suitable to be applied to study biomolecules. Using this strategy, different conformational changes of the wild type and mutant G150D of protein PMP22-TM4 depending on environmental pH have been observed in situ and analyzed. As a lab-on-a-chip (LoC) device, the MAHSO SERS chip will benefit the field of molecular dynamics, as well as molecule–molecule or molecule–surface interactions in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical compounds 3aenvironmental impact 3amolecular dynamics 3amonitoring 3amutants 3apH1 aZhu, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6695-38621 aZhang, Chuanlong1 aChen, Kexiang1 aCui, Yiping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4648-25060 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Mar. 13, v. 90, no. 7 p.4535-4543dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b049293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245012700205300001800332520110100350592002801451650002101479650001501500650001001515650002001525650002301545650001601568650001101584700005301595700006101648700005201709700005701761773013601818856008001954852000902034655001202043IND60687146620221118061634.0200326e20200302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068714662DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c006252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBishop, Camille1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2889-175210aMolecular Orientation for Vapor-Deposited Organic Glasses Follows Rate-Temperature Superposition: The Case of Posaconazole  ap. 2505-2513.  aThe anisotropic properties of organic glasses produced by physical vapor deposition (PVD) depend upon substrate temperature and deposition rate. In recent work, it was shown for a liquid crystalline system that the anisotropic structure of the glass was controlled by a single combined variable as indicated by the observation of deposition rate-substrate temperature superposition (RTS). Here we test the utility of RTS for posaconazole, a molecule that does not form liquid crystals. We prepare glasses of posaconazole utilizing a range of deposition rates covering 2 orders of magnitude and an 18 K range in substrate temperature. We characterize the glasses using ellipsometry and X-ray scattering. Consistent with RTS, we find that decreasing the deposition rate has the same effect upon molecular orientation as increasing the substrate temperature during deposition. Thus, RTS can be used to predict and control the structure of glasses prepared at a wide range of deposition conditions. We use RTS to infer a characteristic time for molecular reorientation at the surface of posaconazole.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray scattering 3aanisotropy 3aglass 3aliquid crystals 3aphysical chemistry 3atemperature 3avapors1 aLi, Yuhui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2043-43381 aToney, Michael F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7513-11661 aYu, Lian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4253-56581 aEdiger, M.

Forest ecosystems and landscapes have been particularly affected in mountainous regions due to limited management and stewardship, especially in remote areas. Therefore, there is a need to set up new strategies to enhance ecosystem services in forested areas which, in turn, will benefit local communities and economies. In this study, we implemented a new approach—Multiscale Mapping of Ecosystem Services (MIMOSE)—to assess ecosystem services in Mediterranean forests located in a mountainous region of Italy. We spatially assessed timber provision and carbon sequestration according to three forest management strategies: business-as-usual, maximizing economic values, and prioritizing conservation. Sustainable strategies for forest planning were identified at the landscape scale. We found that (i) timber provision is a conflicting service, especially when adaptation strategies are promoted; (ii) the most balanced set of forest ecosystem services is achieved through prioritizing conservation; and (iii) the ecosystem services availability is enhanced by optimizing the spatial allocation of different management strategies. Our approach is suitable to support landscape planning for balancing forest ecosystem potentialities while respecting local community needs and promoting sustainable development goals in the Mediterranean area.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3aeconomic valuation 3aecosystem services 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest management 3aforests 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amountains 3aplanning 3asustainable forestry 3aItaly 3aMediterranean region1 aSallustio, Lorenzo1 aTravaglini, Davide1 aBottalico, Francesca1 aChirici, Gherardo1 aGarfì, Vittorio1 aLafortezza, Raffaele1 aLa Mela Veca, Donato Salvatore1 aLombardi, Fabio1 aMaetzke, Federico1 aMarchetti, Marco0 tSustainability.g2017 Feb. 21, v. 9, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90203163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245014300174300001400317520109000331592002801421650002201449650001801471650001601489650001701505650001401522650001201536650002501548650001901573650001801592650001401610650002101624650002801645650001301673650001101686653000801697653001001705653000801715653002501723653002101748653002001769653001901789700001901808700002401827700002001851700002001871700002901891700002401920773009201944856008502036852000902121655001202130IND60529733420221117191743.0161216e20161010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052973342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavkov-Keller, Tea10aStructures of almond hydroxynitrile lyase isoenzyme 5 provide a rationale for the lack of oxidoreductase activity in flavin dependent HNLs  ap. 24-31.  aHydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) catalyze the asymmetric addition of HCN to aldehydes producing enantiomerically pure cyanohydrins. These enzymes can be heterologously expressed in large quantities making them interesting candidates for industrial applications. The HNLs from Rosaceae evolved from flavin dependent dehydrogenase/oxidase structures. Here we report the high resolution X-ray structure of the highly glycosylated Prunus amygdalus HNL isoenzyme5 (PaHNL5 V317A) expressed in Aspergillus niger and its complex with benzyl alcohol. A comparison with the structure of isoenzyme PaHNL1 indicates a higher accessibility to the active site and a larger cavity for PaHNL5. Additionally, the PaHNL5 complex structure with benzyl alcohol was compared with the structurally related aryl-alcohol oxidase (AAO). Even though both enzymes contain an FAD-cofactor and histidine residues at crucial positions in the active site, PaHNL5 lacks the oxidoreductase activity. The structures indicate that in PaHNLs benzyl alcohol is bound too far away from the FAD cofactor in order to be oxidized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aPrunus dulcis 3aX-radiation 3aactive sites 3aaldehydes 3aalmonds 3aaryl-alcohol oxidase 3abenzyl alcohol 3aglycosylation 3ahistidine 3ahydrogen cyanide 3aindustrial applications 3aisozymes 3alyases 0aHNL 0aPaHNL 0aAAO 0aHydroxynitrile lyase 0aPrunus amygdalus 0aX-ray structure 0aBenzyl alcohol1 aBakhuis, Janny1 aSteinkellner, Georg1 aJolink, Fenneke1 aKeijmel, Esther1 aBirner-Gruenberger, Ruth1 aGruber, K.q(Karl),0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2016 Oct. 10, v. 235 p.24-31dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01840naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245011900167300001600286520065900302592002800961650002500989650002001014650002401034650001201058650002401070650001801094650002401112653002201136653002501158653001101183653001401194653002401208700001801232773012801250856007901378852000901457655001201466IND60480756920221119071809.0160706e20100101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048075692DNAL7 a10.3138/jvme.37.2.1782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoucet, Michèle Y.10aUse of Alumni and Employer Surveys for Internal Quality Assurance of the DVM Program at the University of Montreal  ap. 178-189.  aAnnual alumni and employer surveys, initially designed as outcomes assessment tools, were integrated into a new internal quality assurance strategy to improve the doctor of veterinary medicine program at the University of Montreal's Faculté de Médecine Vétérinaire.

Cultivars: Lanjingling and Wulan  ap. 1145-1147.  aBlue honeysuckle (Lonicera caerulea L.), a member of Caprifoliaceae family, is a deciduous shrub that is also known as “Haskap” or “honeyberry.” Because of its extra-early ripening, high content of bioactive metabolites in fruit, and outstanding frost resistance of buds and flowers, blue honeysuckle has become a novel cash crop in continental climate regions (Plekhanova 2000). In the 21st century, its cultivation has undergone rapid expansion, not only in eastern Europe and northern America, but also in Northeast Asia, especially in Hokkaido, Japan, and the northeastern part of China. In the past 20 years, there were no cultivars of blue honeysuckle reported in China, and most of its production relied heavily on wild collection and transplantation of local wild blue honeysuckle (L. caerulea var. edulis). However, wild blue honeysuckle has the weaknesses of easy fruit abscission, low yield, obvious bitterness, severely tart taste, and low fruit firmness (Huo et al., 2005). ‘Lanjingling’ [China National Plant Variety Protection (CNPVP) 20200389] and ‘Wulan’ (CNPVP 20200390) are the first two nationally registered blue honeysuckle cultivars developed by the Northeast Agricultural University (NEAU). ‘Lanjingling’ is characterized by relatively high fruit firmness, large fruit size, and negligible bitterness; thus, it is suitable for the fresh-fruit market. ‘Wulan’ is characterized by high yield, excellent flavor, and strong aroma, with great commercial value in the food, medical, and cosmetic fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aLonicera caerulea 3aagricultural colleges 3abitterness 3acash crops 3acontinental climates 3acultivars 3afrost resistance 3afruit drop 3afruit quality 3afruit size 3afruits 3amarkets 3ametabolites 3aodors 3aplant variety protection 3ashrubs 3ataste 3aChina 3aEastern European region 0abreeding 0aHaskap 0ahoneyberry 0asmall-berry varieties 0apomology1 aZhang, Lijun1 aGao, Yunli1 aQin, Dong1 aHuo, Junwei0 tHortScience.g2022 Sept., v. 57, no. 9 p.1145-1147dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:28404x2327-98347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI16674-223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245013100161300001400292520156500306592002801871650000901899650001201908650001401920650002001934650000901954650001901963650001201982650001601994650001702010650002702027650001502054650001202069650001502081650002202096650001002118651001002128653000902138653002002147653001902167653002602186653002302212773013902235856007802374852000902452655001202461IND60681681620221119171748.0200226e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068168162DNAL7 a10.3920/JIFF2014.00042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPayne, C.L.R.10aWild harvesting declines as pesticides and imports rise: the collection and consumption of insects in contemporary rural Japan  ap. 57-65.  aEntomophagy is a traditional element of the Japanese diet.

However, in Westernised countries in a similar economic position to contemporary Japan, cultural prejudices against traditional entomophagy remain strong. This article offers an overview of the current situation regarding entomophagy in rural Japan, a country with a high gross domestic product per capita that has undergone a degree of Westernisation in recent decades. Data collected during 12 months of fieldwork in rural central Japan shows that traditional entomophagy is still present, but the diversity of species consumed has seen a marked decrease when compared to studies undertaken in the 1980s. Grasshoppers (Oxya spp.) and wasp larvae (Vespula spp.) are the main insects consumed in Japan today. Insects hold some negative connotations, especially among younger Japanese. Elderly people are more likely to have consumed edible insects, and contend that the availability of wild insects, particularly grasshoppers, has declined considerably since their childhood. Sellers of edible insects also report a decrease in availability within Japan, and now turn to imported insects to meet domestic demand, which is increasing. Both sellers and consumers attribute this trend to the use of pesticides in the final quarter of the twentieth century. Further research is required to evaluate the potential of domestic insects to meet the rising demand for edible insects in contemporary Japan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOxya 3aVespula 3achildhood 3adata collection 3adiet 3aedible insects 3aelderly 3aentomophagy 3agrasshoppers 3agross domestic product 3aharvesting 3aimports 3apesticides 3aspecies diversity 3awasps 3aJapan 0aAsia 0acultural change 0awesternisation 0aconsumer demographics 0aconsumer attitudes0 tJournal of insects as food and feed.g2015 Jan. 1, v. 1, no. 1 p.57-65dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:27298x2352-45887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/JIFF2014.00043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03630naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245015700189300001600346500001500362520132800377592002801705650001301733650001601746650003001762650002501792650001701817650001601834650001401850650001201864650001401876650002201890650001601912650001201928650001401940650001301954650003601967650001902003650006402022650003802086650005602124650003602180650001602216650005602232650004402288650003602332650003702368650003402405653002502439653002302464653001002487653003902497653001502536653002502551653001702576700001702593700001702610700002502627700001702652700003302669773013602702856008502838852000902923655001202932IND50069522620221120054747.0190318e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006952262DNAL7 a240349332pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2013.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaddadi, Siamak10aInduction of Toll-like receptor 4 signaling in avian macrophages inhibits infectious laryngotracheitis virus replication in a nitric oxide dependent way  ap. 270-275.  a2019-12-06  aLPS is one of the pathogen associated molecular patterns that activates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway eliciting antiviral host responses in mammals although information on such responses in avian species is scarce. Our objectives were to characterize the LPS induced innate responses particularly the expression of LPS receptors (TLR4, CD14) in avian macrophages and observe whether TLR4 mediated induction of NO can elicit antiviral response against infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) replication. We found that LPS was capable of inducing the expression of TLR4, CD14 and NO production but not the type 1 interferons in an avian macrophage cell line, MQ-NCSU. We also showed that TLR4 mediated NO production can lead to antiviral response against ILTV replication when MQ-NCSU cells were treated with LPS and the resultant supernatant was then transferred to ILTV replicating cells to assess antiviral activity. Antiviral activity of NO was blocked by a selective inhibitor, S-methylisothiourea sulfhate that inhibits inducible NO synthase. This observation confirms that the antiviral activity is positively correlated with NO production. The data show that LPS can be a potential innate immune stimulant that can be used against ILTV infection in chickens that require further evaluation in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3achickens 3acorrelation 3aGallid alphaherpesvirus 1 3aantiviral properties 3anitric oxide 3amacrophages 3apathogens 3amammals 3areceptors 3avirus replication 3ainterferons 2aAnimals 2aCell Line 2aChickens 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aFlow Cytometry 2aHerpesviridae Infectionsximmunologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aHerpesvirus 1, Gallidximmunology 2aIsothiuroniumxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aLipopolysaccharidesximmunology 2aMacrophages 2aNitric Oxidexantagonists & inhibitorsximmunology. 2aPoultry Diseasesximmunologyxvirology. 2aSignal Transductionximmunology 2aToll-Like Receptor 4ximmunology 2aVirus Replicationximmunology 0aToll-like receptor 4 0aLipopolysaccharide 0aAvian 0aInfectious laryngotracheitis virus 0aMacrophage 0aGallid herpesvirus 1 0aNitric oxide1 aKim, Dae-Sun1 aJasmine, Hui1 aVan der Meer, Frank,1 aCzub, Markus1 aAbdul-Careem, Mohamed Faizal0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2013 Oct. 01, v. 155, no. 4 p.270-275dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2013.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03640naa a2200877 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011400167300002100281520106600302592002801368650001801396650002101414650001501435650001501450650001401465650001701479650001701496650001001513653003401523653003101557653001801588653003601606653002701642653002401669653001301693653002501706653001301731653002301744700001601767700002001783700001601803700002101819700002401840700002201864700001701886700001601903700002501919700001701944700001901961700002101980700002102001700001802022700003802040700003102078700002202109700001802131700002302149700001202172700002402184700002002208700002402228700002102252700002102273700001802294700001902312700002002331700002602351700001202377700002002389700001602409700001702425700002202442700002002464700001902484700002202503700002102525773011002546856008502656852000902741655001202750IND60699788620221123001812.0201025e20200618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069978862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2020.04.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShu, Shaokun10aSynthetic Lethal and Resistance Interactions with BET Bromodomain Inhibitors in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer  ap. 1096-1113.e8.  aBET bromodomain inhibitors (BBDIs) are candidate therapeutic agents for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and other cancer types, but inherent and acquired resistance to BBDIs limits their potential clinical use. Using CRISPR and small-molecule inhibitor screens combined with comprehensive molecular profiling of BBDI response and resistance, we identified synthetic lethal interactions with BBDIs and genes that, when deleted, confer resistance. We observed synergy with regulators of cell cycle progression, YAP, AXL, and SRC signaling, and chemotherapeutic agents. We also uncovered functional similarities and differences among BRD2, BRD4, and BRD7. Although deletion of BRD2 enhances sensitivity to BBDIs, BRD7 loss leads to gain of TEAD-YAP chromatin binding and luminal features associated with BBDI resistance. Single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and cellular barcoding analysis of BBDI responses in sensitive and resistant cell lines highlight significant heterogeneity among samples and demonstrate that BBDI resistance can be pre-existing or acquired.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3abreast neoplasms 3acell cycle 3acell lines 3achromatin 3adrug therapy 3agene editing 3agenes 0atriple-negative breast cancer 0aBET bromodomain inhibitors 0aCRISPR screen 0asmall molecule inhibitor screen 0atherapeutic resistance 0asingle cell RNA-seq 0aATAC-seq 0asingle cell ATAC-seq 0aChIP-seq 0acellular barcoding1 aWu, Hua-Jun1 aGe, Jennifer Y.1 aZeid, Rhamy1 aHarris, Isaac S.1 aJovanović, Bojana,1 aMurphy, Katherine1 aWang, Binbin1 aQiu, Xintao1 aEndress, Jennifer E.1 aReyes, Jaime1 aLim, Klothilda1 aFont-Tello, Alba1 aSyamala, Sudeepa1 aXiao, Tengfei1 aReddy Chilamakuri, Chandra Sekhar1 aPapachristou, Evangelia K.1 aD’Santos, Clive1 aAnand, Jayati1 aHinohara, Kunihiko1 aLi, Wei1 aMcDonald, Thomas O.1 aLuoma, Adrienne1 aModiste, Rebecca J.1 aNguyen, Quang-De1 aMichel, Brittany1 aCejas, Paloma1 aKadoch, Cigall1 aJaffe, Jacob D.1 aWucherpfennig, Kai W.1 aQi, Jun1 aLiu, X.

In India, a number of multifolded initiatives have been taken that take into account the potential and volume of waste generation. This paper studies the factors which might influence the sustainability of co-processing of waste in cement kilns as a business model, considering the issues and challenges in the supply chain framework in India in view of the four canonical pillars of sustainability. A pilot study on co-processing was carried out in one of the cement plant in India to evaluate the environmental performance, economical performance, operational performance and social performance. The findings will help India and other developing countries to introduce effective supply chain management for co-processing while addressing the issues and challenges during co-processing of different waste streams in the cement kilns.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acement 3adeveloping countries 3aenergy 3aenvironmental performance 3aenvironmental technology 3akilns 3amodels 3anatural resources 3asupply chain 3awastes 3aIndia 0aCo-processing 0acement kiln 0asustainability 0awaste management 0aIndia1 aGhosh, Sadhan Kumar1 aParlikar, Ulhas V.0 tEnvironmental technology.g2017 July 18, v. 38, no. 13-14 p.1650-1659dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2017.12937383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03852naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002200169245014800191300001800339520182600357592002802183650004402211650002202255650001102277650002102288650001202309650001702321650001902338650001102357650001702368650004402385650002602429650001202455650003702467650002802504650002002532650001502552650002402567650003602591650003902627650001802666650001202684650004502696650002202741700001902763700001702782700002002799700002002819700001602839700001902855700002502874700002402899700002402923700002302947700002502970773009102995856008403086990002303170852000903193655001203202IND60087421120221118014623.0141102e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008742112DNAL7 a229222502pmid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2012.08.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayakawa, Satoshi10aHeterogeneous structure and in vitro degradation behavior of wet-chemically derived nanocrystalline silicon-containing hydroxyapatite particles  ap. 4856-4867.  aNanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (HAp) and silicon-containing hydroxyapatite (SiHAp) particles were synthesized by a wet-chemical procedure and their heterogeneous structures involving a disordered phase were analyzed in detail by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and solid-state magic-angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The effects of heterogeneous structure on in vitro biodegradability and the biologically active Ca(II)- and Si(IV)-releasing property of SiHAp particles were discussed. The ²⁹Si NMR analysis revealed that the Si(IV) was incorporated in the HAp lattice in the form of Q⁰(SiO₄ ⁴⁻orHSiO₄ ³⁻) species, accompanied by the formation of condensed silicate units outside the HAp lattice structure, where the fraction and amount of Q⁰ species in the HAp lattice depends on the Si content. The ³¹P and ¹H NMR results agreed well with the XRD, TEM and FTIR results. NMR quantitative analysis results were explained by using a core–shell model assuming a simplified hexagonal shape of HAp covered with a disordered layer, where Si(IV) in Q⁰ was incorporated in the HAp lattice and a disordered phase consisted of hydrated calcium phosphates involving polymeric silicate species and carbonate anions. With the increase in the Si content in the HAp lattice, the in vitro degradation rate of the SiHAps increased, while their crystallite size stayed nearly unchanged. The biologically active Ca(II)- and Si(IV)-releasing ability of the SiHAps was remarkably enhanced at the initial stage of reactions by an increase in the amount of Si(IV) incorporated in the HAp lattice but also by an increase of the amount of polymeric silicate species incorporated in the disordered phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanions 3abiodegradability 3acalcium 3acrystallites 3ahydroxyapatite 3amodels 3ananocrystals 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aquantitative analysis 3asilicon 3atransmission electron microscopy 2aBiocompatible Materials 2aCrystallization 2aDurapatite 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aNanoparticles 2aSilicon 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aX-Ray Diffraction1 aKanaya, Tomoko1 aTsuru, Kanji1 aShirosaki, Yuki1 aOsaka, Akiyoshi1 aFujii, Eiji1 aKawabata, Koji1 aGasqueres, Georgiana1 aBonhomme, Christian1 aBabonneau, Florence1 aJäger, Christian,1 aKleebe, Hans-Joachim0 tActa biomaterialia.g2013 Jan., v. 9, no. 1 p.4856-4867dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2012.08.0243Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245010700187300001600294520167800310592002801988650001602016650001902032650000902051650001502060650002102075650001402096650001102110650000902121650001402130650002302144650002602167650001402193650001802207650002402225650001002249650000902259651001402268653002402282653001102306700002402317700001802341700002002359700002002379700001902399773012702418856008102545852000902626655001202635IND60651473320221119152426.0190711e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065147332DNAL7 a274854662pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800160020192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLivock, Michelle10aMaternal micronutrient consumption periconceptionally and during pregnancy: a prospective cohort study  ap. 294-304.  aTo examine overall micronutrient intake periconceptionally and throughout pregnancy in a population-based cohort of Australian women. In a prospective cohort study, micronutrient dosages were extracted from self-reported maternal supplement use, recorded pre-conception, and for each trimester of pregnancy. A food frequency scale (DQESv2) captured usual maternal diet for gestational weeks 14–26. The influence of sociodemographic and lifestyle factors associated with supplement use was examined using logistic regression, and changes in micronutrient intakes prior to and throughout pregnancy were assessed using repeated-measures ANOVA analyses. Metropolitan hospital sites in Melbourne, Australia. Women with a viable singleton pregnancy were recruited at less than 19 weeks’ gestation (n 2146). Compared with non-users, women using supplements during pregnancy were more likely to have planned their pregnancy, be >25 years old, primiparous, Caucasian, non-smokers, have a tertiary education and be consuming a folate-rich diet. Intakes of folate, Fe and Zn were significantly lower in the periconceptional period, compared with other periods (P<0·001). Intakes below Recommended Daily Intake levels were common both periconceptionally and throughout pregnancy, with 19–46 % of women not meeting the Recommended Daily Intake for folate, 68–82 % for Fe and 17–36 % for Zn. Conversely, 15–19 % of women consumed beyond the recommended Upper Limit for folate and 11–24 % for Fe. The study highlights the need for improved public health education on nutritional needs during pregnancy, especially among women with lower educational achievements and income.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAustralians 3acohort studies 3adiet 3afolic acid 3ahealth education 3ahospitals 3aincome 3airon 3alifestyle 3amaternal nutrition 3anutrient requirements 3apregnancy 3apublic health 3aregression analysis 3awomen 3azinc 3aAustralia 0aDietary supplements 0aFolate1 aAnderson, Peter J.,1 aLewis, Sharon1 aBowden, Stephen1 aMuggli, Evelyne1 aHalliday, Jane0 tPublic health nutrition.g2017 Feb., v. 20, no. 2 p.294-304dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800160020193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01762naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012700161300002000288520065700308592002800965650003700993650001101030650001201041650001301053650001401066650002101080650001401101650001801115650001401133650001401147700001401161700001801175773012401193856007401317852000901391655001201400IND60666856420221116180845.0190919e20150306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066685642DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra09176k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Moneim, A.

The alloy surface was analyzed by XPS. The corrosion rates of the ternary Mn–Zr–Cr alloys are lower than those of the binary alloys containing the same amount of manganese and decrease on increasing the chromium content. The effect of alloying Cr and Zr with Mn is based on the synergistic interaction between their cations in the oxy-hydroxide passive films formed under open circuit conditions. The passivity enhancement is due to chromium enrichment in the surface film and the underlying alloy surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalloys 3acations 3achromium 3acorrosion 3aelectrochemistry 3amanganese 3asulfuric acid 3asynergism 3azirconium1 aEzzat, M.1 aBadawy, W.

Farm-health planning, also known as herd health or flock health planning, is a holistic, proactive management approach to animal health and welfare. This resource was used in a teaching seminar held for two groups of fourth-year veterinary students over a two-year period. Students answered a questionnaire before and after the teaching seminar that revealed that most participants believed the new resource had increased their knowledge of and ability to undertake farm-health planning. Students also completed one of four species-specific case examples that were evaluated by the first author. Most students (90.7%) included at least half of the essential farm-health planning factors in their case example submission. Twenty-six of these essential health planning factors were included by at least 80% of study participants. Six essential health planning factors received less than 20% of the student response rate. The traditional veterinary skills, which involve the management of individual animals, such as an assessment of the severity of lesions, were well represented in all of the case examples. However, the monitoring step of farm-health planning, such as the use of intervention levels, was the least well answered by the student population. In conclusion, the research study found that the STEPS seminar was successful in introducing many of the main principles of farm-health planning to two groups of fourth-year veterinary students.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aflocks 3aherd health 3amonitoring 3aplanning 3aquestionnaires 3astudents 0afood-animal welfare 0astudent programs 0aveterinary education 0afarm-health planning1 aMain, David C.J.0 tJournal of veterinary medical education.g2010 Jan. 1, v. 37, no. 2 p.136-144dUniversity of Toronto Pressx0748-321X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3138%2Fjvme.37.2.1363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245011700165300001800282520156500300592002801865650002301893650001301916650001901929650001401948650001601962650003001978650002002008650001102028650001102039650001102050651001302061653001702074653001002091653002602101653001602127653001102143700001502154700002602169700001502195700002202210773013102232856008102363852000902444655001202453IND60792788320221122042136.0220909e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079278832DNAL7 a10.21273/HORTSCI16759-222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerkomah, John10aCilantro and Coriander Yield as Affected by Cultivars and Row Spacings in Fall and Spring Production in Virginia  ap. 1156-1158.  aThis student-led project studied the production of cilantro (greens stage) and coriander (seed stage) of Coriandrum sativum L. with the objective of developing this crop as an alternate specialty crop in Virginia. Results indicated that both fall-planted for spring harvest and spring-planted for summer harvest are possible in Virginia. Rows spaced 37.5 cm apart resulted in the superior yield of both cilantro and coriander over rows 75 cm apart. Mean cilantro fresh yields from fall-planted experiments (three cultivars during 2015 and five cultivars during 2016) varied from 3301 to 5775 kg⋅ha⁻¹, whereas those from spring-planted experiments varied from 4971 to 11811 kg⋅ha⁻¹. Corresponding values for dry cilantro yields varied from 274 to 1129 kg⋅ha⁻¹ and 862 to 2280 kg⋅ha⁻¹, respectively. Mean coriander seed yields from three fall-planted cultivars varied from 818 to 1554 kg⋅ha⁻¹, and those from three spring-planted cultivars varied from 869 to 1277 kg⋅ha⁻¹. The total phenolic content in cilantro was significantly greater than that in coriander seed (4.95 and 1.15 g of gallic acid equivalent per 100 g of material, respectively). The total mesophiles, yeast and mold, and coliforms from three grocery store-bought cilantro were considerably higher than those of greenhouse-grown cilantro. Even though both spring and fall plantings are possible for supplying cilantro in Virginia, fall planting for spring harvest might be more profitable for producers because of the earlier availability of locally grown cilantro.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoriandrum sativum 3acilantro 3acoriander seed 3acultivars 3agallic acid 3amesophilic microorganisms 3aspecialty crops 3aspring 3asummer 3ayeasts 3aVirginia 0aantioxidants 0aherbs 0amicrobial populations 0arow spacing 0aspices1 aLi, Haiwen1 aṢiddīqī, Rafʻat,1 aKim, Chyer1 aBhardwaj, Harbans0 tHortScience.g2022 Sept., v. 57, no. 9 p.1156-1158dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:28404x2327-98347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI16759-223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03461naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245011300162300001600275520178000291592002802071650001902099650002202118650002502140650001502165650001302180650001602193650001802209650001802227650002002245650002702265650001002292650002002302650001502322650003202337650001002369650001102379650001102390650002002401650001502421650002002436650001602456650001502472650001302487650001002500650002302510650002502533650001402558650001202572653001202584700002102596700002602617773014102643856007802784852000902862655001202871IND60681681820221119171744.0200226e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068168182DNAL7 a10.3920/JIFF2014.00072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJonas-Levi, A.10aDoes a parasite infestation change the nutritional value of an insect? Varroa mites on honey bees as a model  ap. 141-147.  aThe impact of parasites on the nutritional value of their hosts may be an important issue that has to be studied in considering insects as future food and feed for humans and animals. The ectoparasite Varroa mite (Varroa destructor) was chosen as an experimental model: it affects bee colonies and largely endangers the honey production. Honey bee (Apis mellifera) brood is largely used as human food in tropical regions and has a great potential to become a future source of proteins and other nutritional and health components, in particular because beekeeping is based on deep knowledge and well developed technologies in great parts of the world. The impact of infestation of Varroa on the nutritive qualities of honey bee brood is barely known. We compared the main components of infested and parasite free pupae, harvested from the same colonies. We found that Varroa mites decreased the mean fresh weight from 124±6.9 to 118±4.1 mg (mean ± standard deviation), elevated the intensity of one protein band (50.2 KDa) among nine and enhanced the superoxide dismutase activity from 9.5±0.3 to 14.6±0.2% but not catalase and peroxidase activity. The parasite did not change the dry weight percentage (19.5±1.9%), total lipid titration (16.9±2.3%), crude protein (57.2±6.1%) and cholesterol levels (6.7±1.3 mg/100 g fresh weight). The fatty acid composition and their proportions were not altered either, among them three very important unsaturated fatty acids (FAs): omega-3, omega-6 and oleic acid/omega-9. Long chained FAs were detected in small quantities, less than 1%. The total antioxidant activity remained the same as of not-infested pupae. In conclusion, the impact of Varroa mites on the nutritional value of honey bee pupae could be considered as minor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aVarroa destructor 3aantioxidant activity 3aapiculture 3acatalase 3acholesterol 3acrude protein 3aectoparasites 3aenzyme activity 3afatty acid composition 3ahoney 3ahoney bee brood 3ahoney bees 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ahosts 3ahumans 3amodels 3anutritive value 3aoleic acid 3aparasitic mites 3aparasitoses 3aperoxidase 3aproteins 3apupae 3astandard deviation 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atitration 3atropics 0aomega-31 aBenjamin, Oscar,1 aMartinez, J.J.

The results demonstrate that high quality ultra-thin Al₂O₃ films with a uniform in-depth stoichiometry are achieved on the copper substrate and the films can efficiently decrease the corrosion of copper. A thicker Al₂O₃ film can provide better corrosion resistance because of its lower porosity. When the film thickness is 7.8 nm or above, the copper surface can be well protected, which is embodied by the fact that the AFM and SEM images of the surface do not show a great difference before and after corrosion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aatomic force microscopy 3acopper 3acorrosion 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium chloride 3astoichiometry 3atemperature1 aLiu, Yuhong1 aLi, Jing1 aLü, Xinchun,1 aHe, Dannong0 tRSC advances.g2014 Oct. 10, v. 4, no. 92 p.50503-50509dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra09179e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245014700165300001400312520124400326592002801570650001801598650002901616650001701645650002501662650001901687650002101706650001401727650001101741650002601752650001101778650001501789650001901804650002801823651001201851653002201863653002401885653003101909700002301940773014801963856007902111852000902190655001202199IND60520918120221120165456.0160526e20141230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052091812DNAL7 a10.2478/vjbsd-2014-00162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerezina, Olena10aMethodical Approach to Determine the Influence of Economic Activity in the Region on the State of the Territorial Environment of the Territory  ap. 82-86.  aThe goal of this research work is the formation of methodological approach of ecological factor assessment impact on the development level of territorial economic systems. This article presents the quality indicators of the development of socio-economic areas, which reflect total level and the extent of human impact on the natural environment characterizing the level of economy influence (economic activities) on the environment. This article suggests the approach to the calculation of Eco-intensity indicator and general air pollution dynamics in Ukraine, regarding regions, type of economic activities/industries. The research studies the comparative evaluation and the characteristics of the ecological status of the territories. It was determined that for the period from 2005 till 2012 the emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere from stationary and mobile pollution sources are being gradually reduced due to the decreasing level of production enterprises, which were the main polluters of the atmosphere. According to the types of economic activity, the measurements of Eco-intensity emissions of pollutants and carbon dioxide indicated that the biggest indices were in energy distribution, mining and processing industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aanthropogenic activities 3abioeconomics 3abusiness enterprises 3acarbon dioxide 3aeconomic systems 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3amining 3apollutants 3asocioeconomics 3asustainable development 3aUkraine 0aecological factor 0anatural environment 0asocio-economic development1 aPetrovskiy, Maksim0 tVisegrad journal on bioeconomy and sustainable development.g2014 Dec. 30, v. 3, no. 2 p.82-86dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:21371x1339-33677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/vjbsd-2014-00163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245012300163300001800286500001500304520173100319592002802050650001802078650003702096650002002133650001802153650001202171650002902183650002502212650001902237650002102256650002302277650001702300650001402317650001402331651001802345653001802363700001902381700002002400700002502420700001902445700001902464773016902483856007902652852000902731655001202740IND60114836220221122033459.0141124e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011483622DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.113.0715892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoret, Samuel10aClimate change mitigation and health effects of varied dietary patterns in real-life settings throughout North America  ap. 490S-495S.  a2019-12-04  aBackground: Greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) are a major consequence of our dietary choices. Assessments of plant-based compared with meat-based diets are emerging at the intersection of public health, environment, and nutrition.Objectives: The objective was to compare the GHGEs associated with dietary patterns consumed in a large population across North America and to independently assess mortality according to dietary patterns in the same population.Design: Data from the Adventist Health Study 2 (AHS-2) were used to characterize the differential environmental and health impacts of the following 3 dietary patterns, which varied in the quantity of animal and plant foods: vegetarian, semivegetarian, and nonvegetarian. The GHGE intensities of 210 foods were calculated through life-cycle assessments and by using published data. The all-cause mortality rates and all-cause mortality HRs for the AHS-2 subjects were adjusted for a range of lifestyle and sociodemographic factors and estimated according to dietary pattern.Results: With the use of the nonvegetarian diet as a reference, the mean reductions in GHGEs for semivegetarian and vegetarian diets were 22% and 29%, respectively. The mortality rates for nonvegetarians, semivegetarians, and vegetarians were 6.66, 5.53, and 5.56 deaths per 1000 person-years, respectively. The differences were significant. Compared with nonvegetarians, mortality HRs were lower for semivegetarians (0.86) and vegetarians (0.91).Conclusions: Moderate differences in the caloric intake of meat products provided nontrivial reductions in GHGEs and improved health outcomes, as shown through the mortality analyses. However, this does not mean that diets lower in GHGEs are healthy.  aPublisher supplied data 3ameat products 3asociodemographic characteristics 3avegetarian diet 3aenergy intake 3aanimals 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aenvironmental health 3aclimate change 3ameat consumption 3aclinical nutrition 3afood choices 3alifestyle 3amortality 3aNorth America 0aeating habits1 aMejia, Alfredo1 aBatech, Michael1 aJaceldo-Siegl, Karen1 aHarwatt, Helen1 aSabaté, Joan,0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2014 July, v. 100, no.

We tested the potential effect of long non-coding RNA 00312 (“Lnc00312”) on human HCC cell behavior in vitro and in vivo. Forced-expression of Lnc00312 by a lentiviral vector induced proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in HepG2 cells and primary human HCC cells. Lnc00312 downregulated cyclin B1 and induced G2-M cell cycle arrest in HCC cells. Restoring cyclin B1 expression by a cyclin B1 cDNA construct inhibited Lnc00312-induced cytotoxicity against HCC cells. Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Lnc00312 increased cyclin B1 expression and promoted HepG2 cell proliferation. In vivo, the growth of HepG2 xenograft tumors in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice was largely inhibited after expression of Lnc00312. Significantly, Lnc00312 is downregulated in human HCC tissues, which is negatively correlated with the tumor grade. Overall, Lnc00312 inhibits human HCC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Cyclin B1 could be a key target protein of Lnc00312 in human HCC cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell proliferation 3acomplementary DNA 3acorrelation 3acyclins 3acytotoxicity 3ahepatoma 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3anon-coding RNA 3asevere combined immunodeficiency 3atissues 0aHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 0aLong non-coding RNA 00312 (Lnc00312) 0aCyclin B1 0aCell proliferation1 aZhou, Xiaoxin1 aFan, Yilei1 aCheng, Xiangwei1 aLü, Bin,1 aChen, Zhe0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Feb. 26, v. 497, no. 1 p.173-180dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04831naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245011200165300001800277520269600295592002802991650002303019650001303042650001303055650001803068650001603086650001803102650001703120650000903137650002803146650001403174650001403188650001603202650001703218650002303235650001603258650001103274650002003285650002103305650002603326650002703352650004303379650000703422650001403429650001903443650001703462650001803479650001403497650001403511650002103525650002003546650001403566650000903580650001803589650001903607650001403626651001203640653002603652653004303678653004603721653002803767700003503795700001903830700002703849773013103876856008104007852000904088655001204097IND60792788420221122042225.0220909e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079278842DNAL7 a10.21273/HORTSCI16672-222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMullin, Andrew10aConservation Horticulture: In Vitro Micropropagation and Acclimatization of Selected Florida Native Orchids  ap. 1159-1166.  aFlorida is home to 106 native orchid species, of which 77 are listed as endangered or threatened by the State of Florida. The Institute for Regional Conservation (IRC) has classified 62 of these species as either critically imperiled, imperiled, or rare in South Florida. Because of lack of endosperm, orchid germination rates are very low in nature, as they depend on an obligate relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. Most orchid seeds can be germinated in vitro without the need for specific mycorrhizal fungi. This study aims are to establish a fast and efficient protocol for in vitro seed germination using different nutrient media and plant growth regulator (PGR) combinations, and to optimize seedling acclimatization protocols using different greenhouse media. To determine germination preferences, three different in vitro seed germination media were tested supplemented with PGRs, including 1) Murashige & Skoog (MS) (control), 2) MS supplemented with 1.5 mg/L 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), and 3) MS supplemented with 1 mg/L BAP and 0.5 mg/L 1-Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) on Cyrtopodium punctatum, a state-listed endangered, IRC critically imperiled epiphytic orchid. There was no significant difference amongst the treatments after 2 and 6 weeks of seed sowing culture. To understand post-culture survivorship, two epiphytic and one terrestrial native species (Trichocentrum undulatum, Encyclia tampensis, and Oncidium ensatum) were chosen for the acclimatization study with two commercially available potting substrates (coir, sphagnum). To measure seedling growth rates, phenotypic measurements [leaf number, leaf length, root length, plantlet height, light intensity, pH, and electrical conductivity (EC)] and Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values were recorded monthly for five months. All media/PGR combinations resulted in an initial high percentage of stage I growth but inhibited Protocorm-like bodies (PLBs) development, suggesting more research is necessary to determine later improvements or detriments to MS basal media with BAP and NAA. Comparing acclimatization media with the three species of orchid chosen for this experiment, neither O. ensatum nor E. tampensis showed a marked preference for sphagnum moss or coir. However, T. undulatum did perform better with coir compared with sphagnum. This research will help botanical gardens and commercial plant tissue culture laboratories to have a better understanding on selection of PGR combinations for in vitro cell culture and acclimatization media on increasing the viability and plant health and decreasing the mortality of endangered plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEncyclia tampensis 3aOncidium 3aSphagnum 3aTrichocentrum 3aacclimation 3abenzyladenine 3acell culture 3acoir 3aelectrical conductivity 3aendosperm 3aepiphytes 3agreenhouses 3ahorticulture 3aindigenous species 3aleaf length 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3amicropropagation 3amosses and liverworts 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apH 3aphenotype 3aplant analysis 3aplant health 3aplant tissues 3aplantlets 3aprotocols 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3asoil 3asurvival rate 3atissue culture 3aviability 3aFlorida 0aCyrtopodium punctatum 0aEncyclia tampensis, endangered orchids 0aOncidium ensatum, plant growth regulators 0aTrichocentrum undulatum1 aCosta, Bárbara Nogueira Souza1 aDowning, Jason1 aKhoddamzadeh, Amir Ali0 tHortScience.g2022 Sept., v. 57, no. 9 p.1159-1166dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:28404x2327-98347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI16672-223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04216naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245019200187300001800379520200300397592002802400650000802428650001002436650002502446650001602471650001202487650002302499650001702522650001402539650001302553650003902566650001802605650000902623650001102632650001102643650001402654650001902668650001602687650001602703650005202719650003302771650001102804650001802815650001802833650002302851650002502874650001302899650001602912650000902928650001102937650003802948650002502986650003503011650001903046650002603065650002603091650005203117650002003169700001803189700001603207700001203223700001403235700001403249773009103263856008403354990002303438852000903461655001203470IND60087421320221118014650.0141102e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008742132DNAL7 a230728292pmid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2012.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeinemann, S.10aCalcium phosphate phases integrated in silica/collagen nanocomposite xerogels enhance the bioactivity and ultimately manipulate the osteoblast/osteoclast ratio in a human co-culture model  ap. 4878-4888.  aA human co-culture model of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, derived from bone marrow stromal cells and monocytes respectively, was used to characterize the influence of biomaterial modification on the bioactivity and ultimately the ratio of bone-forming to bone-resorbing cells cultivated directly on the surface. Nanocomposites of silica and collagen have been shown to function as skeletal structures in nature and were reproduced in vitro by using a sol–gel approach. The resulting xerogels exhibit a number of features that make it a valuable system for the development of innovative materials for bone substitution applications. In the present study, the incorporation of different calcium phosphate phases in silica/collagen-based gels was demonstrated to enhance the bioactivity of these samples. This ability of the biomaterial to precipitate calcium phosphate on the surface when incubated in simulated body fluids or cell culture medium is generally considered to an advantageous property for bone substitution materials. By co-cultivating human osteoblasts and osteoclasts up to 42days on the xerogels, we demonstrate that the long-term ratio of these cell types depends on the level of bioactivity of the substrate samples. Biphasic silica/collagen xerogels exhibited comparably low bioactivity but encouraged proliferation of osteoblasts in comparison to osteoclast formation. A balanced ratio of both cell types was detected for moderately bioactive triphasic xerogels with 5% calcium phosphate. However, enhancing the bioactivity of the xerogel samples by increasing the calcium phosphate phase percentage to 20% resulted in a diminished number of osteoblasts in favor of osteoclast formation. Quantitative evaluation was carried out by biochemical methods (calcium, DNA, ALP, TRAP 5b) as well as RT-PCR (ALP, BSP II, OC, RANKL, TRAP, CALCR, VTNR, CTSK), and was supported by confocal laser scanning microscopy (cell nuclei, actin, CD68, TRAP) as well as scanning electron microscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aactin 3abioactive properties 3abone marrow 3acalcium 3acalcium phosphates 3acell nucleus 3acoculture 3acollagen 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aculture media 3agels 3ahumans 3amodels 3amonocytes 3ananocomposites 3aosteoblasts 3aosteoclasts 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3astromal cells 2aBase Sequence 2aCalcium Phosphates 2aCoculture Techniques 2aCollagen 2aDNA Primers 2aGels 2aHumans 2aMesenchymal Stem Cellsxcytology. 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aNanocomposites 2aOsteoblastsxcytology 2aOsteoclastsxcytology 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSilicon Dioxide1 aHeinemann, C.1 aWenisch, S.1 aAlt, V.1 aWorch, H.1 aHanke, T.0 tActa biomaterialia.g2013 Jan., v. 9, no. 1 p.4878-4888dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2012.10.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03628naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009700168300001600265520189600281592002802177650002302205650001602228650002102244650001702265650002002282650001202302650001702314650001902331650002102350650002002371650001602391650001802407650001502425650001202440650000902452650002502461650001602486650001302502650001702515650001702532650002402549650001302573651001302586653002202599653001302621653001602634653001802650700001902668700001702687700002202704700002202726700002202748700002202770700001702792773010202809856008202911852000902993655001203002IND60616306220221119024753.0201118e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061630622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gfs.2018.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasler, Barbara,10aIntegrated food safety and nutrition assessments in the dairy cattle value chain in Tanzania  ap. 102-113.  aThe consumption of even small amounts of animal-source foods has the potential to improve nutrition, especially in vulnerable households. However, scaling up their production bears food safety risks that are often overlooked due to a disconnect between human nutrition and animal sciences. The aim of this scoping study in Tanzania was to identify opportunities for nutritional and food safety benefits from cow milk.Questionnaires were administered to 156 producers and 157 consumers in 10 villages in Lushoto and Mvomero districts. Farmers reported that veterinary medicines such as oxytetracyclines, penicillin and streptomycin were frequently given to cattle, and a majority did not discard milk during or after treatment. Less than half of the producers boiled milk, although sale of fermented milk, made by spontaneous fermentation of raw milk, was common. Cattle management was characterised by low levels of biosecurity, hygienic practices and disease control. A majority of consumers reported not to have enough food to meet their family needs. The Food Consumption Score was acceptable for all households, but significantly higher for households with dairy cattle. When making purchasing decisions, the appearance of milk and trust in the supplier were more important considerations than hygiene practices observed. A total of 26% of consumers reported to consume raw milk “usually” or “sometimes” and 54% of consumers reported to drink fermented milk “usually” or “sometimes”. Consumers had a positive attitude towards milk and concern for quality but most thought there was no risk of illness from milk consumption.The findings promote understanding of the complexity surrounding the local food environment and practices related to the production and consumption of dairy products and allow shaping recommendations for nutrition-sensitive livestock interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal-based foods 3abiosecurity 3acattle husbandry 3adairy cattle 3adisease control 3afarmers 3afermentation 3afermented milk 3afood consumption 3afood purchasing 3afood safety 3afood security 3ahouseholds 3ahygiene 3amilk 3anutrition assessment 3apenicillins 3araw milk 3astreptomycin 3asupply chain 3aveterinary medicine 3avillages 3aTanzania 0aDairy value chain 0aTanzania 0aFood safety 0aFood security1 aMsalya, George1 aGarza, Maria1 aFornace, Kimberly1 aEltholth, Mahmoud1 aKurwijila, Lusato1 aRushton, Jonathan1 aGrace, Delia0 tGlobal food security.g2018 Sept., v. 18 p.102-113dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21608x2211-91247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2018.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245004800166300001800214520170500232592002801937650001901965650002301984650001502007650001102022650001102033650001702044650001102061650000902072650001202081650001502093651001202108773016902120856007902289852000902368655001202377IND60114836320221122043642.0141124e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011483632DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.113.0713652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeitzmann, Claus10aVegetarian nutrition: past, present, future  ap. 496S-502S.  aEarly human food cultures were plant-based. Major religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism have recommended a vegetarian way of life since their conception. The recorded history of vegetarian nutrition started in the sixth century bc by followers of the Orphic mysteries. The Greek philosopher Pythagoras is considered the father of ethical vegetarianism. The Pythagorean way of life was followed by a number of important personalities and influenced vegetarian nutrition until the 19th century. In Europe, vegetarian nutrition more or less disappeared during the Middle Ages. In the Renaissance era and in the Age of Enlightenment, various personalities practiced vegetarianism. The first vegetarian society was started in England in 1847. The International Vegetarian Society was founded in 1908 and the first vegan society began in 1944. Prominent vegetarians during this time included Sylvester Graham, John Harvey Kellogg, and Maximilian Bircher-Benner. A paradigm shift occurred at the turn of the 21st century. The former prejudices that vegetarianism leads to malnutrition were replaced by scientific evidence showing that vegetarian nutrition reduces the risk of most contemporary diseases. Today, vegetarian nutrition has a growing international following and is increasingly accepted. The main reasons for this trend are health concerns and ethical, ecologic, and social issues. The future of vegetarian nutrition is promising because sustainable nutrition is crucial for the well-being of humankind. An increasing number of people do not want animals to suffer nor do they want climate change; they want to avoid preventable diseases and to secure a livable future for generations to come.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aclinical nutrition 3aconception 3aethics 3ahumans 3amalnutrition 3apeople 3arisk 3asociety 3avegan diet 3aEngland0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2014 July, v. 100, no.

Pre‐release Bd detection can be confounded by imperfect animal sampling and the absence of animals. In Study 1, we used historical Bd‐positive sites, to concurrently evaluate water filtrates and mouth bar (tadpoles) or skin swab (caudates) samples for Bd using molecular beacon realtime PCR. In Study 2, during a natural outbreak, we used PCR to detect Bd from zoospore‐attracting keratin baits (three avian, three snake species). In Study 1, no captured animals (n = 116) exhibited clinical signs, although 10.6% were positive, representing three of seven species sampled. In contrast, 5.4% of water filters (n = 56) were Bd‐positive. In Study 2, after short incubation times, a single duck down feather tested Bd‐positive. In conclusion, Bd was detected in asymptomatic amphibians and water filtrate at two sites, and from water only, at two other sites. With continued refinement, semi‐quantitative Bd water filtrate screening could better define zoospore‐specific disease risk, allowing better characterization of the free‐living phase of the organism's life cycle. Finally, these results suggest wild aquatic birds (e.g., waterfowl) should be systematically explored as a means of Bd spread. Since large numbers of aquatic birds migrate, even low Bd transfer rates could be a significant means for disease dissemination.

Throughout the last twenty years there has been extensive research on the interactions between the materials and on performance of the geosynthetics including aspects of durability. This research has resulted in significant advances in the design and specification of landfill lining systems. However, to date there has been limited research carried out on in situ landfill lining system behaviour. Measured behaviour from field scale trials and of in service operation can provide valuable information on landfill lining system performance and allow a better understanding of composite material behaviour. Although many numerical modelling programs are applied to evaluate lining system stability and integrity, data to validate these models is currently limited. This paper highlights the data required to validate numerical models and instrumentation techniques that may be used to acquire this information. The paper focuses on geotechnical instrumentation deployed on the side slope lining system at the Milegate Extension Landfill, UK. The instrumented lining system comprises 1.0 m of compacted clay, a 2 mm double textured high density polyethylene geomembrane, a nonwoven geotextile and a sand cover soil layer. Instrument selection and problems associated with acquiring consistent, reliable and valuable data in a field environment are discussed, as are the challenges and problems that occur when preparing a full scale experiment. Sources of uncertainties within readings are highlighted. Additionally, initial results collected during sand veneer layer placement on the slope are presented. These demonstrate acceptable instrument performance over a 2 year period. Measured behaviour highlights the significance of geomembrane strains driven by temperature changes, generation of post peak strengths at interfaces during fill placement on the side slope due to relative displacement at interfaces between components, and mechanisms of stress redistribution in the geomembrane that result in time dependent changes in strain under constant load and temperature conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3acomposite materials 3adurability 3ageotextiles 3ainstrumentation 3alandfills 3amathematical models 3amonitoring 3amunicipal solid waste 3apolyethylene 3asand 3asoil 3atemperature 3aUnited Kingdom1 aDixon, Neil1 aJones, D.

Degradation of the traditional food system over the past several decades has resulted in a shift in dietary patterns that have contributed to increased rates of chronic diseases and food insecurity among Alaska Native People. Interventions are needed to address this. Our objectives were to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of a school-based intervention—Neqa Elicarvigmun or the Fish-to-School Program—on diet quality, fish intake, and attitudes and beliefs around traditional foods (specifically fish) using a pre–post comparison group design with data collection occurring at three time points. Study participants were 76 middle and high school students in two remote Alaska Native communities (population <900) in southwestern Alaska. We used a participatory approach to design the school-based, multilevel intervention that included activities in the cafeteria, classroom, and community. Multilevel analyses showed that students in the experimental community showed significant improvements in diet quality compared to the comparison community (Beta = 4.57; p < .05). Fish intake, measured using the stable nitrogen isotope ratio of hair, a validated biomarker, also increased significantly in the experimental community (Beta = 0.16; p < .05). Leveraging the cultural and physical resources of the traditional food system for the Neqa Elicarvigmun program represents a strength-based approach that improves diet quality, increases adolescents’ connection to their traditional culture, and by promoting the local food system supports food security. Embedding the program into the local culture may result in faster adoption and greater sustainability of the program.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  cNational Institute of General Medicine Sciences  cNIH0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlaska Natives 3abiomarkers 3acafeterias 3adata collection 3afish 3afish consumption 3afood quality 3afood security 3aisotopes 3alocal food systems 3amedicine 3anitrogen 3atraditional foods 3aAlaska1 aIzumi, Betty T1 aNu, Jennifer1 aO’brien, Diane M1 aPaschall, Mallie0 tTranslational Behavioral Medicine.g2019 Oct. v. 9, no. 5 p. 952-961dOxford University Press (OUP)x1869-67167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibz0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245018500164300001600349520139500365592002801760650002301788650001901811650002201830650002601852650001001878650001901888650002401907650002501931650001401956650001401970650004201984650003202026650001302058650002402071650001402095650001802109650000902127650001802136650001402154653002402168653001502192653002402207653002802231653003002259700001502289700001502304700001302319700001902332700001702351700001702368773011202385856008202497852000902579655001202588IND60584884120221122232722.0190411e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058488412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2017.10.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZha, Shanjie10aLaboratory simulation reveals significant impacts of ocean acidification on microbial community composition and host-pathogen interactions between the blood clam and Vibrio harveyi  ap. 393-398.  aIt has been suggested that climate change may promote the outbreaks of diseases in the sea through altering the host susceptibility, the pathogen virulence, and the host-pathogen interaction. However, the impacts of ocean acidification (OA) on the pathogen components of bacterial community and the host-pathogen interaction of marine bivalves are still poorly understood. Therefore, 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing and host-pathogen interaction analysis between blood clam (Tegillarca granosa) and Vibrio harveyi were conducted in the present study to gain a better understanding of the ecological impacts of ocean acidification. The results obtained revealed a significant impact of ocean acidification on the composition of microbial community at laboratory scale. Notably, the abundance of Vibrio, a major group of pathogens to many marine organisms, was significantly increased under ocean acidification condition. In addition, the survival rate and haemolytic activity of V. harveyi were significantly higher in the presence of haemolymph of OA treated T. granosa, indicating a compromised immunity of the clam and enhanced virulence of V. harveyi under future ocean acidification scenarios. Conclusively, the results obtained in this study suggest that future ocean acidification may increase the risk of Vibrio pathogen infection for marine bivalve species, such as blood clams.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTegillarca granosa 3aVibrio harveyi 3aaquatic organisms 3abacterial communities 3aclams 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental impact 3ahemolymph 3ahemolysis 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aimmunity 3aocean acidification 3apathogens 3aribosomal RNA 3arisk 3asurvival rate 3avirulence 0aOcean acidification 0aBlood clam 0aMicrobial community 0a16S rRNA pyrosequencing 0aHost-pathogen interaction1 aLiu, Saixi1 aSu, Wenhao1 aShi, Wei1 aXiao, Guoqiang1 aYan, Maocang1 aLiu, Guangxu0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2017 Dec., v. 71 p.393-398dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2017.10.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03163naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013700155300001800292520159000310592002801900650001701928650001301945650002201958650001401980650002001994650001302014650001602027650001402043650004302057650001902100650001802119650001302137650001502150650001702165650001802182650002002200650002702220650001302247650000902260650001302269650002902282650002102311650001602332700001902348700001202367700001302379700001702392773012902409856007402538852000902612655001202621IND60704931720221120185345.0200728e20200723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070493172DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ay00811g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chen10aAccurate, sensitive and rapid determination of perchlorate in tea by hydrophilic interaction chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 3592-3599.  aPerchlorate is an environmental contaminant interrupting thyroid hormone production, and perchlorate in tea has raised wide concern recently. In this study, an accurate method was developed for the determination of perchlorate in tea using hydrophilic interaction chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and a simplified QuEChERS procedure. The method utilized a zwitterion HILIC column for separation, and the optimal gradient eluents consisted of acetonitrile and aqueous solution with 0.1% formic acid and 20 mmol L⁻¹ ammonium formate. Calibration curves were fitted by the quadratic model with 1/x weight instead of the linear model. As perchlorate was only partially extractable when using acetonitrile or methanol as the extraction solvent, acetonitrile/water (1 : 1, v/v) was chosen to extract perchlorate from tea samples. Graphitized carbon black was used as the dispersive solid phase extraction sorbent to clean up tea extracts. The method exhibited satisfactory accuracy with recoveries of 81.4–100.9% and relative standard deviations of 1.3–14.5% for green and black teas. The limit of quantitation was 0.005 mg kg⁻¹, while the limits of detection were 0.0011 mg kg⁻¹ for green tea and 0.0013 mg kg⁻¹ for black tea, indicating an excellent sensitivity of this method. A 100% positive rate of perchlorate was found in 100 real tea samples, and the concentrations ranged from 0.0030 mg kg⁻¹ to 0.78 mg kg⁻¹. This accurate, sensitive and rapid method would be suitable for monitoring, risk assessment and source identification of perchlorate in tea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aammonium 3aaqueous solutions 3ablack tea 3adetection limit 3aformates 3aformic acid 3agreen tea 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3ahydrophilicity 3alinear models 3amethanol 3amonitoring 3aperchlorates 3arapid methods 3arisk assessment 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3asoot 3asorbents 3atandem mass spectrometry 3athyroid hormones 3azwitterions1 aChen, Hongping1 aZhu, Li1 aLiu, Xin1 aLu, Chengyin0 tAnalytical methods.g2020 July 23, v. 12, no. 28 p.3592-3599dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ay00811g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01788naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013800159300001800297520043800315592002800753650001700781650002300798650002100821650001800842650001100860650001800871650001100889650001100900650002900911650001300940650001400953650001100967650001100978700001700989700001901006700001801025700001801043700001701061700001901078700001601097773013401113856007401247852000901321655001201330IND60660863320221118223034.0190827e20150219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066086332DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc10394g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yingying10aFree radical reaction promoted by ionic liquid: a route for metal-free oxidation depolymerization of lignin model compound and lignin  ap. 4028-4031.  aIonic liquid 1-benzyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([BnMIm][NTf₂]) can promote the generation of the ˙OOH free radical and thereby efficiently transformed the β-O-4 lignin model compound 2-phenoxyacetophenone into benzoic acid and phenol using O₂ as the oxidant.

In this study we demonstrate a scaffold design utilizing carbon nanotubes, deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) and a specific DNA binding transcription factor that allows for directed immobilization of a single enzyme.Functionalized carbon nanotubes were covalently bonded to a diazonium salt modified gold surface through carbodiimide chemistry creating a brush-type nanotube alignment. The aligned nanotubes created a highly ordered structure with high surface area that allowed for the attachment of a protein assembly through a designed DNA scaffold. The enzyme immobilization was controlled by a zinc finger (ZNF) protein domain that binds to a specific dsDNA sequence. ZNF 268 was genetically fused to the small laccase (SLAC) from Streptomyces coelicolor, an enzyme belonging to the family of multi-copper oxidases, and used to demonstrate the applicability of the developed approach. Analytical techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and enzymatic activity analysis, allowed characterization at each stage of development of the bio-nano architecture.

In South Africa, the Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries, Natural Resources Management Programmes, previously The Working for Water Programme (WfW) is tasked with controlling IAPs in a way that protects the environment, as well as producing maximum return to society through poverty alleviation. Biological control is one of the management tools used to control IAPs in South Africa. Four aquatic weeds, Pista stratiotes, Salvinia molesta, Azolla filiculoides and Myriophyllum aquaticum, are under complete biological control in South Africa. However, in the absence of biological agents, the WfW programme would have used herbicides to control these weeds. This paper presents a retrospective analysis of the relative herbicide cost-saving associated with the use of biological control instead of chemical control. The study used cost benefit analysis (CBA) framework with an 8% discount rate. The estimated cost of the biological control on all four aquatic weeds was about R7.8 million, while the estimated cost of chemical control to achieve the same level of control varied between R150 million and R1 billion, depending on the method of application and number of follow up operations. Benefit to cost ratios varied between 90:1 and 631:1, again depending on method of application and number of follow up sprays. The results remained robust under a 5% and 10% sensitivity test and show that biological control is the most cost-effective management option for aquatic weeds in South Africa.  aThis work was supported by Department of Environmental Affairs, Natural Resource Management Programme; National Research Foundation of South Africa; The South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology.  aPublisher supplied data  cDepartment of Environmental Affairs, Natural Resource Management Programmedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007646  cNational Research Foundation of South Africadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001321  cThe South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology 3aAzolla filiculoides 3aMyriophyllum aquaticum 3aSalvinia molesta 3abiodiversity 3abiological control 3achemical control 3acost benefit analysis 3acost effectiveness 3acost estimates 3adiscount rate 3aeconomic evaluation 3aforestry 3aherbicides 3ainvasive species 3apoverty 3aretrospective studies 3asociety 3atechnology 3aSouth Africa 0aInvasive alien plants 0acost-effectiveness 0aherbicide cost-saving 0aworking for water1 aFraser, G.q(Gavin),1 aHill, Martin P.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2021 Sept. 02, v. 31, no. 9 p.896-911dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl55514x1360-04787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09583157.2021.19007833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01368naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013300155300001800288520041300306592002800719650002200747650001100769650003000780700001100810700001800821700002200839773013400861856007400995852000901069655001201078IND60661318520221120150414.0190829e20110222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066131852DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cs00037j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Li-Wen14aThe recent synthesis and application of silicon-stereogenic silanes: A renewed and significant challenge in asymmetric synthesis  ap. 1777-1790.  aThe synthesis of silicon-stereogenic silanes is undoubtedly one of the most intriguing and challenging aspects in organic chemistry and organosilicon chemistry and is neglected by chemists to some extent.

Here, we present a novel methodology using NH₄F as fluorine source and a high-temperature ionic diffusion that facilitate surface fluorination of TiO₂ without changes of phase structure. Using this method, we prepared fluorinated TiO₂ nanostructures of different phases (brookite, anatase and rutile) and investigated their structural and photocatalytic redox properties. Photocatalytic selective oxidation of MO and selective reduction of water in producing hydrogen under UV-light irradiation are employed as probe reactions to test the redox properties of the fluorinated TiO₂ of different phases. The results show that the photocatalytic redox properties of TiO₂ are highly dependent on phase structure and surface fluorination. Among all the phases, the oxidation activity of fluorinated TiO₂ can be ranked as brookite > anatase > rutile. Strikingly, the photocatalytic reduction activity for these fluorinated TiO₂ followed the same sequence. The variations of photocatalytic redox activity are most likely due to the synergism of phase composition control and surface fluorination. This could effectively delay electron–hole recombination, and generate more free ˙OH radicals but less free electrons. The methodology reported here is simple and general, which might be used to design and control the structures and properties of anionic-modified nanostructures for a variety of applications in environmental cleaning and energy conversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acleaning 3aelectrons 3aenergy conversion 3afluorine 3afree radicals 3ahydrogen 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airradiation 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3asynergism 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation1 aLi, Liping1 aHuang, Xinsong1 aLi, Qi1 aLi, Guangshe0 tRSC advances.g2015 Apr. 13, v. 5, no. 43 p.34302-34313dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra17076h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012900170300001600299520175100315592002802066650001702094650001702111650001102128650001802139650001402157650001202171650001202183650001302195650001802208650001302226650001202239650001702251651001102268700002202279773012602301856008102427852000902508655001202517IND60585559520221118181804.0171110e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058555952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10806-017-9691-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMestres, S. Gómez10aRecovering Food Commons in Post Industrial Europe: Cooperation Networks in Organic Food Provisioning in Catalonia and Norway  ap. 625-643.  aThis paper explores food commoning through an ethnographic case study in Catalonia as our primary site while the Norwegian case is juxtaposed as a comparison, two agriculturally and economically different European countries. The ethnography analyses cooperation networks between organic food producers’ and consumers’ involving different nodes of community gardening initiatives, self-employed growers, local farmers and all of them under a unique cooperative integrating a community economy. The result it is a myriad of exchange practices ranging from reciprocity and barter to market exchange without intermediaries through on-line platforms. Along these exchanges different options of currency intervene giving rise to novel social and cooperative relations. Similar initiatives in Norway show less variation and are less experimental regarding forms of payment but share similarities in relation to material articulations, concerns and forms of alternative practice. Although these novel forms do not represent a complete break from the more standardized supply chains, and hence from the oppositions/contradictions of production and consumption, the participants see themselves as contributing to a more general process of de-commodification of food. We explore the extent to which the meaning and moral values are mutually constituted in relation to socioeconomic exchanges and environmental caring that each person experiences based on different forms of cooperation and reciprocity. Food, we suggest, is more than a commodity on the market that we may influence through our role as consumers. It is a significant focal point connecting our lives to those of others that articulates one’s relations to society in a political manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropology 3acase studies 3aethics 3afood industry 3agardening 3agrowers 3amarkets 3amorality 3aorganic foods 3apolitics 3asociety 3asupply chain 3aNorway1 aLien, Marianne E.0 tJournal of agricultural & environmental ethics.g2017 Oct., v. 30, no. 5 p.625-643dSpringer Netherlandsx1187-78637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10806-017-9691-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245013100166300001600297520124300313592002801556650002301584650001701607650001101624650000901635650001801644650001401662650001001676650002201686650002801708650001401736650001201750700001801762700001601780700001701796700002401813700002001837700001901857700002001876700002501896773009701921856007902018852000902097655001202106IND60440035220221119081536.0151024e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044003522DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10257724095392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadford, Alan D.10aHigh Genetic Diversity of the Immunodominant Region of the Feline Calicivirus Capsid Gene in Endemically Infected Cat Colonies  ap. 145-155.  aFeline calicivirus (FCV) is an important pathogen of domestic cats. In this study, we have determined the genetic diversity of FCV within four geographically separate colonies of endemically infected cats by sequencing the immunodominant and variable region E of the capsid gene. Comparison of isolates between colonies and between unrelated published sequences gave nucleotide distance values of 26–35% and 22–40%, respectively and suggested each colony was infected with a distinct virus strain. Comparison of isolates within individual endemically infected colonies showed nucleotide distance variability of 0–16%. This was greater than distances previously reported for epidemiologically related isolates from cases of acute disease (0–5%) and was consistent with the evolution of FCV from a single distinct ancestor sequence in each colony. The pattern of nucleotide substitutions generating the observed intra-colony diversity was associated with strong evidence for positive selection acting on immunodominant regions of the FCV capsid protein. We suggest that endemically infected colonies of cats may be important generators of genetic diversity for FCV and that this may ultimately lead to the generation of new strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFeline calicivirus 3aacute course 3acapsid 3acats 3acoat proteins 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3aimmunodominant epitopes 3apathogens 3aviruses1 aDawson, Susan1 aRyvar, Ruth1 aCoyne, Karen1 aJohnson, Deborah R.1 aCox, Michael B.1 aAcke, Els F.J.1 aAddie, Diane D.1 aGaskell, Rosalind M.0 tVirus genes.g2003 Oct., v. 27, no. 2 p.145-155dKluwer Academic Publishersx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10257724095393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03760naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024003400125040001800159100002400177245015600201300001600357506007600373506003100449520172300480592002802203596000802231596007802239506003702317650001102354650001302365650002102378650001602399650001202415650001802427650001402445650002102459650001602480650002002496650001202516650001202528650001602540650001202556650002302568650001102591650001002602650000902612650001802621650000902639650003102648650001602679650001502695650001502710700001902725700002302744700001702767700002002784700001802804700002402822700002202846700002002868773011102888856007802999852000903077655001203086IND60739311920230103142032.0220901e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073931192DNAL7 a10.1093/toxsci/kfx2382doi7 a10.1093/toxsci/kfx2382chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrumm, Elizabeth A.10aOrganophosphate Flame-Retardants Alter Adult Mouse Homeostasis and Gene Expression in a Sex-Dependent Manner Potentially Through Interactions With ERα  ap. 212-224.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aFlame retardants (FRs) such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers and organophosphate FR (OPFR) persist in the environment and interact with multiple nuclear receptors involved in homeostasis, including estrogen receptors (ERs). However, little is known about the effects of FR, especially OPFR, on mammalian neuroendocrine functions. Therefore, we investigated if exposure to FR alters hypothalamic gene expression and whole-animal physiology in adult wild-type (WT) and ERα KO mice. Intact WT and KO males and ovariectomized WT and KO females were orally dosed daily with vehicle (oil), 17α-ethynylestradiol (2.5 μg/kg), 2,2’, 4,4-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47, 1 or 10 mg/kg), or an OPFR mixture {1 or 10 mg/kg of tris(1, 3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate, triphenyl phosphate, and tricresyl phosphate each} for 28 days. Body weight, food intake, body composition, glucose and insulin tolerance, plasma hormone levels, and hypothalamic and liver gene expression were measured. Expression of neuropeptides, receptors, and cation channels was differentially altered between WT males and females. OPFR suppressed body weight and energy intake in males. FR increased fasting glucose levels in males, and BDE-47 augmented glucose clearance in females. Liver gene expression indicated FXR activation by BDE-47 and PXR and CAR activation by OPFR. In males, OPFR increased ghrelin but decreased leptin and insulin independent of body weight. The loss of ERα reduced the effects of both FR on hypothalamic and liver gene expression and plasma hormone levels. The physiological implications are that males are more sensitive than ovariectomized females to OPFR exposure and that these effects are mediated, in part, by ERα.  aPublisher supplied data  cNIH  cU.S. Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3abiphenyl 3abody composition 3abody weight 3acations 3aenergy intake 3aestrogens 3aflame retardants 3afood intake 3agene expression 3aghrelin 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3aleptin 3aliver 3amice 3aneuropeptides 3aoils 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3aovariectomy 3aphosphates 3atoxicology1 aPatel, Vipa J.1 aTillery, Taylor S.1 aYasrebi, Ali1 aShen, Jianliang1 aGuo, Grace L.1 aMarco, Stephanie M.1 aBuckley, Brian T.1 aRoepke, Troy A.0 tToxicological Sciences.g2018 Mar. v. 162 no. 1 p. 212-224dOxford University Press (OUP)x1096-60807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfx2383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02096naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002900142245016100171300001400332506002800346520088000374592002801254506003701282650001901319650000901338650001001347650002201357650001201379653001901391653000901410653004001419773021301459856007701672852000901749655001201758IND60784834020221207065946.0200113e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078483402DNAL7 a10.32718/ujvas2-2.052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDamrongdej, Piyabongkarn10aComparison between new design interlocking nail with plate fixation and intramedullary pin with external skeletal fixation in long bone fracture in the dogs  ap. 22-26.  aResource is Open Access  aNew design interlocking nail and plate fixation was used in comminuted femur fracture in an old dog that the results showed primary bone healing and she had been quickly weight baring in fifteenth day after surgery, and could be walk in twenty day after operation.

One of the first step in monosex culturing, particularly in Nile tilapia, is the production of all-male fry; hormones are widely used in this respect. It is known that exogenous treatment with hormones disrupts various systems in the body including the immune and endocrine systems. There has been a growing interest in how hormones shape the biology of the fish. Many researchers all over the world explored how androgen can interact with many of the body systems; however, rarely any of them tried to improve the hormonal method or to find an alternative. The gate is open for research in this field. This review focusses on the potential effects of hormones, particularly androgens on fish immunity, and the up to date solutions (however, they are rare).  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aandrogens 3aaquaculture 3afish 3aimmunity 3aindustry 3aresearch 3aresearchers 0a17 α-methyltestosterone 0aAndrogen 0aEndocrine disruptor 0aImmunity 0aMonosex fish 0a11-KT 0aE2 0aEE2 0aDHT 0aifn 0aIgG 0aIgM 0ail1β 0ail8 0aMT 0atnfα 0avtg0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2018 Jan., v. 72 p.23-30dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2017.10.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03525naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245009100170300001800261500001900279500002000298520188700318592002802205596008902233596007502322650001602397650002402413650001402437650001302451650001702464650001502481650002402496650001202520650000902532700006702541700003302608700007302641700006502714700007602779773015302855856007403008852000903082655001203091IND60726225320221119132407.0210202e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072622532DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.107462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalín‐Sánchez, Ángel12aA new combined sensory‐instrumental tool for pomegranate seed hardness determination  ap. 1355-1363.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Scanning electron microscopy was assayed and linked with previous data with respect to obtaining a new combined sensory‐instrumental tool for pomegranate seed hardness determination. The present study aimed to develop an effective tool for the prediction of sensory properties via instrumental determinations. RESULTS: Simple regression analysis determined a high correlation within descriptive seed hardness and thickness of the wall, as well as descriptive wood perception and thickness of the wall, with values of 0.71 in both cases. Multiple regression analysis improved correlations when (i) descriptive seed hardness correlated with instrumental seed hardness and wood index (0.94); (ii) descriptive wood perception correlated with instrumental seed hardness and wood index (0.79); (iii) descriptive seed hardness correlated with instrumental seed hardness and thickness of the seed wall (0.96); and (iv) descriptive wood perception correlated with instrumental seed hardness and thickness of the seed wall (0.82). The same trend was found when (i) seed hardness satisfaction degree correlated with instrumental seed hardness and wood index (0.92); (ii) wood perception satisfaction degree correlated with instrumental seed hardness and wood index (0.82); (iii) seed hardness satisfaction degree correlated with instrumental seed hardness and thickness of the wall (0.99); and (iv) wood perception satisfaction degree correlated with instrumental seed hardness and thickness of the wall (0.99). CONCLUSION: Regarding mechanical properties, the results of the present study confirm that texture analysis and scanning electron microscopy are an effective tool for obtaining reliable information.

Recently, copper has been observed to drive tertiary contact in PrPC, inducing a neuroprotective cis interaction that structurally links the protein's two domains. The location of this interaction on the C terminus overlaps with the sites of human pathogenic mutations and toxic antibody docking. Combined with recent evidence that the N terminus is a toxic effector regulated by the C terminus, there is an emerging consensus that this cis interaction serves a protective role, and that the disruption of this interaction by misfolded PrP oligomers may be a cause of toxicity in prion disease. We demonstrate here that two highly conserved histidines in the C-terminal domain of PrPC are essential for the protein's cis interaction, which helps to protect against neurotoxicity carried out by its N terminus. We show that simultaneous mutation of these histidines drastically weakens the cis interaction and enhances spontaneous cationic currents in cultured cells, the first C-terminal mutant to do so. Whereas previous studies suggested that Cu²⁺ coordination was localized solely to the protein's N-terminal domain, we find that both domains contribute equatorially coordinated histidine residue side-chains, resulting in a novel bridging interaction. We also find that extra N-terminal histidines in pathological familial mutations involving octarepeat expansions inhibit this interaction by sequestering copper from the C terminus. Our findings further establish a structural basis for PrPC's C-terminal regulation of its otherwise toxic N terminus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3aantibodies 3acopper 3acultured cells 3ahistidine 3ahumans 3amutants 3amutation 3aneurotoxicity 3aprion diseases 3aprions 3aprotective effect 0aPrP 0aPrPC 0aAβ42 0aNMR 0aEPR 0aPrP 0aOR 0aHSQC 0aEPR 0aPRE 0aCW 0aENDOR 0aHYSCORE 0aPB1 aTao, Lizhi1 aWu, Bei1 aKiblen, Joseph T.M.1 aUbilla-Rodriguez, Natalia C.1 aPushie, M.

Each segment possessed the genus-specific termini with conserved nucleotide sequences of (+) 5′-AAGUUUUU ...... CAGCUNNNGUC-3′ and a perfect or imperfect inverted repeat of seven to eleven nucleotides immediately adjacent to the terminal conserved sequence. While the coding strand of most RBSDV-Hbm segments contained one open reading frame (ORF), there were two non-overlapping ORFs in S7 and S9, and one small overlapping ORF downstream of the major ORF in S5. Homology comparisons suggest that S1 encodes a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), with 63.5% and 32.6% identity to the putative RdRp encoded by Fiji disease virus (FDV) and Nilaparvata lugens reovirus (NLRV), respectively. The proteins encoded by S2, S3, and S4 showed various degrees of similarity to those encoded by the corresponding segments of FDV or NLRV. In S5 and S6, low identities were found to those of FDV only, but not to NLRV. Sequence analyses showed that RBSDV-Hbm had the most similarities in the genome organizations and the coding assignments with a RBSDV isolated from rice in China, in which each pair of the corresponding segments shared sequence identities of 93.8–98.9% and 93.5–100% at nucleotide or amino acid levels, respectively. In addition, phylogenetic analyses suggested that RBSDV-Hbm had the closest evolutionary relationship to RBSDV in Fijivirus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFiji disease virus 3aNilaparvata lugens reovirus 3aOryza sativa 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aRice black streaked dwarf virus 3aZea mays 3aamino acids 3acorn 3agenome 3anucleotides 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3aproteins 3arice 3asequence analysis 3aChina1 aFang, Shou-Guo1 aXu, Jia-Ling1 aSun, Li-Ying1 aLi, Da-Wei1 aYu, Jia-Lin0 tVirus genes.g2003 Oct., v. 27, no. 2 p.163-168dKluwer Academic Publishersx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10257765272863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024003400125040001800159100001300177245015900190300001500349520167500364592002802039596004702067650002102114650002502135650001602160650001902176650000902195650001102204650002102215650001302236650001502249700002102264700001902285700001802304773011102322856007802433852000902511655001202520IND60739312120230103123847.0220901e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073931212DNAL7 a10.1093/toxsci/kfy0672doi7 a10.1093/toxsci/kfy0672chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Miao10aProbabilistic Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Model for Penicillin G in Milk From Dairy Cows Following Intramammary or Intramuscular Administrations  ap. 85-100.  aPenicillin remains one of the most frequently identified violative drug residues in food-producing animals. The predominant violations of penicillin were found in cull dairy cows. In the United States, procaine penicillin G is approved to be used in dairy cows through intramuscular (IM) and intramammary (IMM) administrations. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are useful tools to predict withdrawal intervals and tissue residues of drugs in food animals to ensure food safety, especially for extralabel drug use due to the scarcity of experimental data after extralabel administrations. Currently, no PBPK model is available to predict penicillin concentrations in milk. A population PBPK model with a physiologically based compartment for the mammary gland was established for penicillin G in dairy cows. The model predicted the tissue and milk residues well based on comparison with data from previous pharmacokinetic studies. The predicted milk discard interval of procaine penicillin G administered at 10 times the label dose for 3 repeated IM administrations was 182 h, and 122 h at 4 times the label dose after 3 repeated IMM infusions. Predicted results showed that even 4 times label dose did not lead to violative tissue residues in healthy dairy cows with IMM infusions. The predominant violations found in cull dairy cows may be caused by altered pharmacokinetics due to mastitis, other diseases, and/or interactions with other drugs, which have impacts on penicillin distribution and elimination. The current PBPK model can help predict milk discard interval for penicillin following extralabel use through IM and IMM administrations.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3abenzylpenicillin 3aextra-label drug use 3afood safety 3amammary glands 3amilk 3amodels 3apharmacokinetics 3aprocaine 3atoxicology1 aGehring, Ronette1 aRiviere, Jim E1 aLin, Zhoumeng0 tToxicological Sciences.g2018 Jul. v. 164, no. 1 p. 85-100dOxford University Press (OUP)x1096-60807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfy0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03766naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005600140245008500196300001800281500001900299500002000318520183000338592002802168596005902196596007002255596009502325596010502420596008402525650001602609650001802625650001602643650001502659650002502674650003802699650001302737650001502750650001102765650001302776650003902789650001302828700001702841700001702858700001902875700001702894700001402911700001702925700005802942773015303000856007403153852000903227655001203236IND60726225420221119132340.0210202e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072622542DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.107522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Jinqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1215-340210aAntigenic activity and epitope analysis of β‐conglycinin hydrolyzed by pepsin  ap. 1396-1402.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Soybean is among the ‘big eight’ allergenic foods, and β‐conglycinin, the main antigenic protein of soybean, has high levels of antigenic activity. Why the antigenic activity of soybean β‐conglycinin is not eliminated by enzymatic hydrolysis is not clear. In this study, changes in the molecular composition and antigenicity of β‐conglycinin hydrolyzed by pepsin were analyzed and it was determined whether complete sequential epitopes exist in the resulting hydrolysates. The nature and antigenic activity of protein subunits obtained after β‐conglycinin hydrolysis were also assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate‐polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and competitive enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. RESULTS: The residual antigenic activity of β‐conglycinin was 52%, α′‐ and α‐subunits completely disappeared, the 49 kDa fraction partially disappeared, and peptides measuring 27 and 23 kDa were newly formed after 60 min of enzymatic hydrolysis. Prolonged enzymatic hydrolysis did not result in remarkable changes in these peptides; thus, the peptides show some resistance to enzymatic hydrolysis. The amino acid sequences of the peptide chains were analyzed by matrix‐assisted laser desorption / ionization‐time of flight mass spectrometry and aligned with the related sequences in the corresponding protein and antigen databases. Ten complete sequential epitopes were identified in the residual 49 kDa fraction, of these epitopes, two were from α‐subunits and eight were from β‐subunits. CONCLUSION: The presence of complete sequential epitopes in hydrolysates obtained from the enzymatic hydrolysis of soybean is an important reason for the incomplete disappearance of the antigenic activity of β‐conglycinin. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a31671782cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a182300410096cNatural Science Foundation of Henan Province, China  a2013QNGG02cProgram for Young Key Teacher of Zhengzhou University of Light Industry, China  a14A180025cScientific and Technological Key Project of Education Department of Henan Province, China  a182102310069cScientific and Technological Key Project of Henan Province, China 3aagriculture 3aallergenicity 3aamino acids 3adesorption 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepitopes 3ahydrolysis 3apepsin 3apeptides 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asoybeans1 aYuan, Luyang1 aAn, Guangjie1 aZhang, Junsong1 aZhao, Xuewei1 aLiu, Yang1 aShan, Jinjin1 aWang, Zhangcun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8742-94450 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 101, no. 4 p.1396-1402dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.107523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02298naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007600168300001800244520134800262592002801610650001901638650001101657650001301668650002001681650001601701700001701717700002001734700001701754773012201771856008201893852000901975655001201984IND60627484020220818000000.0220818e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062748402DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-011-5494-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStinville, J. C.10aSwelling of 316L austenitic stainless steel induced by plasma nitriding  ap. 5503-5511.  aSwelling of 316L austenitic stainless steel plasma nitrided at 400°C under floating potential has been investigated using electron back scattered diffraction and white-light interferometry. Swelling of individual grains strongly depends on their crystallographic orientation, similarly to the thickness of the nitrided layer. After 1 h of treatment, swelling is maximum for the 〈001〉 oriented grains and minimum for the 〈111〉 oriented grains. After 8 and 33 h of nitriding, the maximum of swelling is observed in the grains having their normal direction at about 15° from the 〈001〉 orientation. These results are discussed on the basis of plastic strain after comparison with calculated swellings of the 〈001〉 and 〈111〉 oriented grains, using the thickness of the nitrided layer deduced from the trapping–detrapping diffusion model and a rough estimation of the plastic strain. The satisfactory agreement between experimental and calculated swellings supports the idea that swelling results from the lattice expansion due to the incorporation of nitrogen plus an elastic strain and a plastic strain. For individual grains of the 316L matrix, nitriding leads to a tensile-like elongation of high magnitude (around 20%) and it might be the origin of the lattice rotations which were previously observed after nitriding.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainterferometry 3amodels 3anitrogen 3astainless steel 3awhite light1 aTemplier, C.1 aVillechaise, P.1 aPichon, Liz,0 tJournal of materials science.g2011 Aug., v. 46, no. 16 p.5503-5511dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-011-5494-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01476naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245006800154300001800222520053000240592002800770650002300798650001900821650001400840650001400854700001800868700001700886700002200903700002100925773013200946856007501078852000901153655001201162IND60538807320221120154737.0160815e20130403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053880732DNAL7 a10.1021/ja402477w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Yun12aA Cyclic Germadicarbene (“Germylone”) from Germyliumylidene  ap. 5004-5007.  aBy employing the chelate dicarbene 1, the new chlorogermyliumylidene complex 2 could be synthesized and isolated in 95% yield.

A chromatographic strip based on europium chelate-loaded fluorescent microspheres was assembled with a goat anti-mouse antibody (C line) and penicillin coating (T line). The penicillin coating competes with free β-lactam antibiotics to bind PBP-labeled fluorescent microspheres. The strip can theoretically detect all kinds of β-lactams, including amoxicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, ceftazidime, lenampicillin, cefoperazone, sultamicillin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, sulbenicillin, piperacillin, cephalothin, flucloxacillin, and mezlocillin, in samples within 10 min. The europium chelate-labeled lateral flow assay does not cross-react with other antibiotics, including chloramphenicol, tetracycline, sulfamethazine, enrofloxacin, gentamicin or lincomycin. In short, we developed a very useful method for preliminary screening of β-lactams.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamoxicillin 3aantibodies 3acefoperazone 3aceftazidime 3aceftriaxone 3acephalothin 3achloramphenicol 3achromatography 3acoatings 3aenrofloxacin 3aeuropium 3afluorescence 3agentamicin 3agoats 3alincomycin 3amicroparticles 3aoxacillin 3apiperacillin 3arapid methods 3ascreening 3asulfamethazine 3atetracycline1 aPan, Zhifeng1 aLi, Manyu1 aJia, Xinmiao1 aZhang, Suhan1 aLin, Hang1 aLiu, Juntao1 aMa, Liangkun0 tAnalytical methods.g2020 July 23, v. 12, no. 28 p.3645-3653dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ay01140a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03428naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011000169520202100279592002802300650001902328650001702347650001902364650001902383650001302402650001302415650001302428650000802441650001802449653001002467653001602477653002202493653002102515653001802536653003502554700001502589700001802604700001802622700002002640700001302660700001102673700001502684700001602699700001702715773010602732856008702838852000902925655001202934IND60749069320221119093940.0211129e20211120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074906932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1274202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTucker, I.M.10aSelf-assembly in saponin mixtures: Escin/tea, tea/glycyrrhizic acid, and escin/glycyrrhizic acid mixtures  aSaponins are plant based biosurfactants that are obtained from a wide variety of plant species. They are surface active glycosides with a hydrophobic group, which is commonly a triterpenoid or steroidal group, and saccharide hydrophilic units. Their structures are markedly different from conventional synthetic surfactants, and present interesting challenges in understanding their optimal packing in self-assembled structures such as micelles. Furthermore the wide variety of molecular structures available provide interesting opportunities to optimise the packing in mixed systems. In the current literature there is limited information available on saponin self-assembly, and especially in saponin mixtures. The general view is that globular to more elongated micelle structures form at relatively low concentrations. Here small angle neutron scattering, SANS, is used to investigate and quantify the structure of escin, tea and glycyrrhizic acid micelles and particularly of escin/tea, tea/glycyrrhizic acid and escin/glycyrrhizic acid mixtures at relatively low concentrations. The focus is principally on how the different saccharide headgroup structures affect the self-assembly. Tea saponins form relatively small globular micelles, whereas escin and glycyrrhizic acid form larger more elongated globular micelle structures. The micelle structure and changes observed reflect the packing constraints associated with the aglycone triterpenoid hydrophobic section and the differences in the saccharide headgroups. In the escin/tea and glycyrrhizic acid/tea mixtures the greater intrinsic curvature associated with the tea saponin dominates the micelle structure over much of the composition range explored. For the escin/glycyrrhizic acid mixture the micelle size and aggregation number go through a minimum at an approximately equimolar composition, and this implies an intrinsic difficulty in efficient packing of the two different saponin structures, which results in an increase in the preferred curvature  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosurfactants 3aglycyrrhizin 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amicelles 3aneutrons 3asaponins 3atea 3atriterpenoids 0aEscin 0aTea saponin 0aGlycyrrhizic acid 0aSaponin mixtures 0aSelf-assembly 0aSmall angle neutron scattering1 aBurley, A.1 aPetkova, R.E.1 aHosking, S.L.1 aWebster, J.R.P.1 aLi, P.X.1 aMa, K.1 aDoutch, J.1 aPenfold, J.1 aThomas, R.K.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Nov. 20, v. 629 p.127420-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1274203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009900157300001800256520139500274592002801669650002201697650001101719650002801730650002101758650002001779650002801799650001001827650001301837650001301850650001401863650001101877650001201888650002901900650003301929650001301962700002301975700002001998700002102018700001802039700001702057700001602074700002002090700001802110773013202128856007502260852000902335655001202344IND60538807520221120154848.0160815e20130410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053880752DNAL7 a10.1021/ja308723w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Eun-sun,10aFabrication of CaFe2O4/TaON Heterojunction Photoanode for Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation  ap. 5375-5383.  aTantalum oxynitride photoanode is fabricated and modified with calcium ferrite to form a heterojunction anode for a photoelectrochemical water splitting cell. The synthesized powders are loaded sequentially to the transparent conducting glass by electrophoretic deposition, which is advantageous to form a uniform layer and a junction structure. X-ray diffraction, UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and impedance spectroscopy analysis are conducted to investigate the structural, morphological, and electrochemical characteristics of the anode. The introduction of CaFe₂O₄ overlayer onto TaON electrode increases the photocurrent density about five times at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode without any co-catalyst. Impedance spectroscopy analysis indicates that the junction formation increased photocurrent density by reducing the resistance to the transport of charge carriers and thereby enhancing the electron–hole separation. This photocurrent generation is a result of the overall water splitting as confirmed by evolution of hydrogen and oxygen in a stoichiometric ratio. From the study of different junction configurations, it is established that the intimate contact between TaON and CaFe₂O₄ is critical for enhanced performance of the heterojunction anode for photoelectrochemical water oxidation under simulated sun light.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanodes 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrophoresis 3aferrimagnetic materials 3aglass 3ahydrogen 3alighting 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apowders 3areflectance spectroscopy 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atantalum1 aNishimura, Naoyuki1 aMagesh, Ganesan1 aKim, Chae-yŏng,1 aJang, Ji-Wook1 aJun, Hwichan1 aKubota, Jun1 aDomen, Kazunari1 aLee, Jae Sung0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Apr. 10, v. 135, no. 14 p.5375-5383dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja308723w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245009500173300001600268520134800284592002801632650001701660650002701677650001601704650001201720650001401732650000901746651001001755700001601765700001301781700001901794773009301813856008701906990002301993852000902016655001202025IND60099368220221119073304.0141105e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009936822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geotexmem.2012.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Guangqing10aGeogrid-reinforced lime-treated cohesive soil retaining wall: Case study and implications  ap. 112-118.  aLime-treated cohesive soils are used extensively as the construction materials of road embankments. In some cases, vertical embankment is needed, rendering the necessity to employ retaining walls backfilled with lime-treated cohesive soil. In China, geogrid-reinforced lime-treated cohesive soil retaining walls are increasingly used for this purpose. With the objective to reveal the behavior of this type of structure under working-stress condition and to shed light on its future application, a 6.0 m reinforced soil retaining wall was monitored for two years during and post construction. The results showed that the lime-treated soil carried the majority of the gravity load but the geogrid reinforcements also contributed to the integrity of the embankment. Under gravity loading, the backfill deformation was mainly elastic. Backfill compaction during construction was the critical factor influencing the reinforcement deformation and lateral earth pressure at the back of the facing, the latter of which decreased with time after the end of construction due to the increases of both backfill strength and facing displacement. Based on these results, it is inferred that under working stress condition, lime-treated backfill plays a major role in the stability of the retaining wall, while geogrid reinforcements play a secondary role.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aconstruction materials 3adeformation 3agravity 3arendering 3asoil 3aChina1 aLiu, Huabei1 aLv, Peng1 aZhang, Baojian0 tGeotextiles and Geomembranes.g2012 Dec., v. 35 p.112-118dElsevier Ltdx0266-11447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geotexmem.2012.09.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245020900174300001600383520160400399592002802003650002202031650000802053650001702061650001002078650002402088650001802112650001502130650001302145650003302158650002302191650001402214650001802228650001902246651001902265653001202284653003502296653001502331653001802346653002402364653001302388700003002401700002202431773012402453856008402577852000902661655001202670IND60584885020221122232710.0190411e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058488502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2017.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKretschmann, Juliane10aMolecular phylogenetics of dinophytes harboring diatoms as endosymbionts (Kryptoperidiniaceae, Peridiniales), with evolutionary interpretations and a focus on the identity of Durinskia oculata from Prague  ap. 392-402.  aPeridinialean dinophytes include a unique evolutionary group of algae harboring a diatom as an endosymbiont (Kryptoperidiniaceae), whose phylogenetic origin and internal relationships are not fully resolved at present. Several interpretations of the thecal plate pattern present in Durinskia oculata currently compete and lead to considerable taxonomic confusion. Moreover, it is unclear at present whether the species is restricted to freshwater habitats, or occurs in the marine environment as well. We collected material at the type locality of D. oculata in the Czech Republic and established monoclonal strains. Dinophyte cells were studied using light and electron microscopy, and we also determined DNA sequences of several rRNA regions (including the Internal Transcribed Spacers) for molecular characterization and phylogenetics. The morphology of strain GeoM∗662 indicated a plate formula of Po, X, 4′, 2a, 6″, 5c, 5s, 5‴, 2⁗, which was sustained also in form of a microscopic slide serving as an epitype. In the molecular DNA tree based on a matrix composed of concatenated rRNA sequences, strain GeoM∗662 showed a close relationship to other species of Durinskia, and the freshwater species clearly differs from the marine members. Two independent colonization events from the marine into the freshwater environment can be inferred within the Kryptoperidiniaceae. We provide a summarizing cladogram of dinophytes harboring a diatom as endosymbiont with evolutionary novelties indicated as well as a morphological key to the 6 species of Durinskia that are currently accepted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aDNA 3aPeridiniales 3aalgae 3aelectron microscopy 3aendosymbionts 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amarine environment 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3ataxonomic keys 3aCzech Republic 0aEpitype 0aMolecular sequence diagnostics 0aMorphology 0aRibosomal RNA 0aSequence comparison 0aTaxonomy1 aŽerdoner Čalasan, Anže1 aGottschling, Marc0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2018 Jan., v. 118 p.392-402dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2017.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245013600166520110500302592002801407650001901435650001901454650001501473650001901488650001501507650002301522653001801545653002401563653001401587653001301601700001401614700005601628700001901684700001701703773010601720856008701826852000901913655001201922IND60749069520221119093921.0211129e20211120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074906952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1274222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Ning10aControllable preparation of separation membrane with nano-ridge structure surface through Cyclam induced interfacial polymerization  aThe intrinsic microstructure of the polyamide (PA) barrier layer in nanofiltration (NF) membranes (NFMs) has a significant influence on their separation performance. The most promising aspect of this work was that the nanoscale adjustable structure of NFMs with high separation performance and well antibacterial properties. The adjustable structure was engineered precisely via interfacial polymerization (IP) reaction using aqueous Tobramycin (Tob), 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane (Cyclam), and trimesoyl chloride (TMC) in organic solution. The structure and performance of membranes can be conveniently optimized by varying the content of Cyclam. The rejection of Na₂SO₄ (98%) of the optimal membranes increased approximately 1.6-fold compared to the membranes without Cyclam, while the water flux continued to retain a high level (170 L m⁻² h⁻¹ MPa⁻¹). Meanwhile, the pure water flux was about 2.2 folds than that of commercial NF1 with comparable solutes rejection. The prepared membrane exhibited good separation performance, antibacterial properties, and long-term stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3amicrostructure 3ananofiltration 3apolyamides 3apolymerization 3atobramycin 3atrimesoyl chloride 0aAntibacterial 0aNanoscale structure 0aPolyamide 0aMembrane1 aWang, Yan1 aPang, Jinhui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7802-44111 aJiang, Zhenhua1 aZhang, Haibo0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Nov. 20, v. 629 p.127422-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1274223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01767naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245007200162300001400234506002800248520072600276592002801002506003701030650002401067650002201091650001401113653001301127653001201140653001201152700002501164700002201189773013301211856007601344852000901420655001201429IND60784835120221207103015.0090701e199808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078483512DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha2813222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGABOREANU, Ioana10aMorpho-anatomical aspects of the epiderm in two species of Lathyrus  ap. 11-16.  aResource is Open Access  aThe paper deals with the microscopic study of the leaves epiderm in Lathyrus latifolius L. and Lathyrus odoratus L.

In the present work, we studied the genetic and the antigenic variability of ECHO virus types 11 (E11) and 30 (E30), which are the most isolated echoviruses serotypes in clinical and environmental samples. We established on the 3′ end of the VP1 gene, consensus sequences of E11 and E30 by alignment of 67 E11 and 247 E30 published sequences in GenBank. Our results of sequences comparison showed that the majority of the mutational sites are situated on the third nucleotide of the codon. These mutations were without consequence on the antigenic sequences of the VP1 protein. Thus, E11 and E30 have a high genetic variability (1/3 of the nucleotides are variable), but a relative antigenic conservation. The analysis of the intertypic antigenic variability between E11 and E30 was obtained by the alignment of the corresponding amino acids sequences relative to the N-terminal part of the VP1 protein. Two discriminating parts were highlighted, probably representing antigenic sites for neutralisation antibodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aEnterovirus 3aRNA 3aamino acid sequences 3aantibodies 3aantigenic variation 3agenes 3amutation 3aneutralization 3anucleotide sequences 3anucleotides 3asequence analysis 3aserotypes 3aviral antigens 3aviruses1 aGharbi, Jawhar1 aAouni, Mahjoub0 tVirus genes.g2006 Oct., v. 33, no. 2 p.205-212dSpringer USwJournal:jnl53274x0920-85697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-005-0057-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01958naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245010400199300001600303500002000319520074900339592002801088596004401116650000901160650001601169650001201185651002201197651001001219651002401229700001901253700006001272700006001332773013301392856007401525852000901599655001201608IND60793348420221118001414.0220914e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079334842DNAL7 a10.1111/jai.142822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLombarte, Antoni1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5215-458710aFirst record of the rendezvous fish, Polymetme corythaeola (Alcock, 1898), in the Mediterranean Sea  ap. 551-556.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe occurrence of the rendezvous fish, Polymetme corythaeola (Alcock, 1898) in Mediterranean Sea is here reported for the first time. A single individual of this benthopelagic fish was caught in February 2020 during a scientific trawl survey. The specimen was collected at a depth of 369 m (upper slope) in the Gulf of Roses (Catalonia, north‐western Mediterranean). This circumglobal species could have naturally expanded its distribution through the Strait of Gibraltar, but we cannot totally exclude that its Mediterranean occurrence has been overlooked thus far. This finding highlights the importance of continuous monitoring of Mediterranean deep‐sea habitats for a better understanding of their diversity and ongoing transformation.  aPublisher supplied data  aARP/1256/2018cICATMAR‐PESCAT project 3afish 3aichthyology 3asurveys 3aMediterranean Sea 3aSpain 3aStrait of Gibraltar1 aBalcells, Marc1 aBarría, Claudio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6769-45781 aAzzurro, Ernesto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9805-31640 tJournal of applied ichthyology.g2022 Sept., v. 38, no. 5 p.551-556dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3869522x0175-86597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.142823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02422naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005600149245014300205300001600348520123200364592002801596650001401624650001101638650001201649650002601661650001401687650001901701653001901720653001801739653001201757653001101769653001601780653001601796700001901812773012401831856008401955852000902039655001202048IND60584885320221122232617.0190411e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058488532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2017.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3784-313510aPhylogeny and systematics of the brake fern genus Pteris (Pteridaceae) based on molecular (plastid and nuclear) and morphological evidence  ap. 265-285.  aThe brake fern genus Pteris belongs to Pteridaceae subfamily Pteridoideae. It is one of the largest fern genera and has been estimated to contain 200–250 species distributed on all continents except Antarctica. Previous studies were either based on plastid data only or based on both plastid and nuclear data but the sampling was small. In addition, an infrageneric classification of Pteris based on morphological and molecular evidence has not been available yet. In the present study, based on molecular data of eight plastid markers and one nuclear marker (gapCp) of 256 accessions representing ca. 178 species of Pteris, we reconstruct a global phylogeny of Pteris. The 15 major clades identified earlier are recovered here and we further identified a new major clade. Our nuclear phylogeny recovered 11 of these 16 major clades, seven of which are strongly supported. The inclusion of Schizostege in Pteris is confirmed for the first time. Based on the newly reconstructed phylogeny and evidence from morphology, distribution and/or ecology, we classify Pteris into three subgenera: P. subg. Pteris, P. subg. Campteria, and P. subg. Platyzoma. The former two are further divided into three and 12 sections, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlatyzoma 3aPteris 3aecology 3aferns and fern allies 3aphylogeny 3aplant taxonomy 0aFern phylogeny 0aNuclear gapCp 0aPlastid 0aPteris 0aSchizostege 0aSystematics1 aZhang, Li-Bing0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2018 Jan., v. 118 p.265-285dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2017.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03163naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245016000169520150800329592002801837650002701865650002801892650001401920650001501934650002301949650001201972650002901984650001102013650001702024650001502041650002202056650001202078650001702090650001502107650003102122650002802153700003702181700002402218700002402242700002402266700002202290700002302312700001902335700002602354700002502380700003402405773011902439856007802558852000902636655001202645IND60766862720221119184112.0220211e20220119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076686272DNAL7 a10.3390/foods110302682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaiyasut, Chaiyavat 10aProbiotics Supplementation Improves Intestinal Permeability, Obesity Index and Metabolic Biomarkers in Elderly Thai Subjects: A Randomized Controlled Trial  aIntestinal integrity prevents the diffusion of allergens, toxins, and pathogens from the gastrointestinal lumen into the tissue and the circulatory system. Damage in intestinal integrity may cause mild to serious health issues, such as inflammation, gastrointestinal disorders, neurological diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, maintaining a healthy intestinal barrier function is essential to sustain health. Probiotics are known for their ability to protect and restore intestinal permeability in vitro and in vivo. The multi-strain probiotics are more efficient than that of a single strain in terms of their protective efficacy. Therefore, the present study was planned and implemented to study the supplementation of probiotic mix (Lactobacillus paracasei HII01, Bifidobacteriumbreve, and Bifidobacterium longum) on intestinal permeability, lipid profile, obesity index and metabolic biomarkers in elderly Thai subjects. The results revealed that the supplementation of studied probiotics improved the intestinal barrier function (up to 48%), significantly increasing the high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. Moreover, the intervention improved obesity-related anthropometric biomarkers and short-chain fatty acid levels in human subjects. The current study strongly recommends further extended research to confirm the beneficial effect of probiotics, which may pave the way to formulate probiotic-based health supplements to adjuvant the treatment of several metabolic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium longum 3aLactobacillus paracasei 3aadjuvants 3abiomarkers 3acirculatory system 3aelderly 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3aintestines 3alipid composition 3aobesity 3apermeability 3aprobiotics 3arandomized clinical trials 3ashort chain fatty acids1 aSivamaruthi, Bhagavathi Sundaram1 aLailerd, Narissara 1 aSirilun, Sasithorn 1 aKhongtan, Suchanat 1 aFukngoen, Pranom 1 aPeerajan, Sartjin 1 aSaelee, Manee 1 aChaiyasut, Khontaros 1 aKesika, Periyanaina 1 aSittiprapaporn, Phakkharawat 0 tFoods.g2022 Jan. 19, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods110302683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012400163500001900287520123900306592002801545650001301573650001601586650001401602650001401616650001201630650002201642650000901664650001501673650001501688650001701703650001601720650001201736650001401748653002301762653001901785653003001804653002401834653000801858653000701866653000801873653000801881653000701889653000701896653000701903653000601910653000701916653000701923653000801930653000701938653000801945653000901953700001401962700001701976700001301993700001802006773012202024856008102146852000902227655001202236IND60696872020221119073539.0200804e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069687202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1096102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Cuiping14aThe texture of fresh rice noodles as affected by the physicochemical properties and starch fine structure of aged paddy  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe physicochemical properties and starch fine structure change during paddy storage, which may be beneficial for the qualities of rice-based products such as fresh rice noodles (FRN). In this study, the textural properties of FRN prepared from polished rice of six indica paddy cultivars after different storage period at 36 ± 2 °C and 85% ± 5% relative humidity were investigated. The pasting properties, solubility (S), swelling power (SP) of rice flour and morphology of the starch granules, chain length distribution of amylopectin were analyzed to determine factors that impact the texture of FRN. The chewiness and springiness of FRN increased, and the adhesiveness decreased with increase in storage duration. The setback (SB) and pasting temperature (PT) increased while the S and SP decreased with extension of storage duration (0–90 days). Chain length distributions of amylopectin also changed. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that cool paste viscosity (CPV) of indica rice flour, short chain (DP 6–12) and long chain (DP 37–60) of amylopectin were the most correlated parameters with adhesiveness of FRN. Our results may provide insights for selecting raw materials for production of high-quality FRN.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aamylopectin 3achewiness 3acultivars 3apaddies 3arelative humidity 3arice 3arice flour 3asolubility 3astorage time 3atemperature 3atexture 3aviscosity 0aPasting properties 0aSwelling power 0aChain length distribution 0aTextural properties 0aFRN 0aPV 0aHPV 0aCPV 0aBD 0aSB 0aPT 0aS 0aSP 0aAC 0aSEM 0aDP 0aSSs 0aDBEs1 aZhu, Hong1 aBao, Jinsong1 aQuan, Ke1 aYang, Ronghua0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Aug., v. 130 p.109610-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1096103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002600142245005300168300001400221520158200235592002801817650001901845650001401864650001101878650001201889650002401901650003201925650001501957650001501972650000901987650001901996650002002015653001902035653001402054653001402068653001502082653001502097773012602112856007802238852000902316655001202325IND60480755120221119070353.0160706e20100101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048075512DNAL7 a10.3138/jvme.37.1.742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColeman, Grahame John10aEducating the Public: Information or Persuasion?  ap. 74-82.  aBeliefs form a major component of public attitudes, and attitudes have a role in determining how people behave as consumers and as citizens. Their behavior in turn affects the commercial viability and even the sustainability of animal industries. Beliefs are subjective facts, that is, matters that individuals consider to be true. The process of informing the community necessarily involves changing beliefs and, to this extent, persuasion. Education strategies relating to welfare issues depend on the target group and the desired outcome. Target groups include farmers, post-farm gatekeepers including transport drivers and abattoir workers, carers of companion animals, legislators and regulators, retailers, and the general community. These target groups may not be homogeneous, but each nevertheless has identifiable needs for knowledge and skills relevant to welfare. The approach that is likely to be most effective is to provide appropriately targeted dispassionate and factual information to the community. In this way, when debates about animal welfare occur, all the stakeholders—including animal-rights groups, retailers, farmers, legislators, and regulators—who are involved in the debate are more likely to produce good outcomes if discussion is based on a shared understanding of what current practices are and what science can reveal about welfare. Given that the mass media are the preferred source of information, the use of science-based media coverage and informed ethical debate is likely to have the best effect, albeit over a fairly long time frame.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3aeducation 3aethics 3afarmers 3ainformation sources 3alivestock and meat industry 3amass media 3apersuasion 3apets 3apublic opinion 3aslaughterhouses 0aanimal welfare 0aattitudes 0aeducation 0apersuasion 0amass media0 tJournal of veterinary medical education.g2010 Jan. 1, v. 37, no. 1 p.74-82dUniversity of Toronto Pressx0748-321X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3138%2Fjvme.37.1.743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03309naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245009400178300001200272520166300284592002801947650002101975650002101996650001902017650002302036650001802059650001602077650001902093650002402112650001202136650001402148650000702162650002002169650002202189650002502211650001402236650001602250653005202266653003102318653002602349653003402375653002002409653002402429700002002453700001802473700001902491700002202510700002002532700001902552773009002571856008502661852000902746655001202755IND60529732020221117191651.0161020e20160610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052973202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.03.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaisermayer, Christian10aBiphasic cultivation strategy to avoid Epo-Fc aggregation and optimize protein expression  ap. 3-9.  aIn biphasic cultivations, the culture conditions are initially kept at an optimum for rapid cell growth and biomass accumulation. In the second phase, the culture is shifted to conditions ensuring maximum specific protein production and the protein quality required. The influence of specific culture parameters is cell line dependent and their impact on product quality needs to be investigated. In this study, a biphasic cultivation strategy for a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line expressing an erythropoietin fusion protein (Epo-Fc) was developed. Cultures were run in batch mode and after an initial growth phase, cultivation temperature and pH were shifted. Applying a DoE (Design of Experiments) approach, a fractional factorial design was used to systematically evaluate the influence of cultivation temperature and pH as well as their synergistic effect on cell growth as well as on recombinant protein production and aggregation. All three responses were influenced by the cultivation temperature. Additionally, an interaction between pH and temperature was found to be related to protein aggregation. Compared with the initial standard conditions of 37°C and pH 7.05, a parameter shift to low temperature and acidic pH resulted in a decrease in the aggregate fraction from 75% to less than 1%. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of temperature and pH substantially lowered the cell-specific rates of glucose and glutamine consumption as well as lactate and ammonium production. The optimized culture conditions also led to an increase of the cell-specific rates of recombinant Epo-Fc production, thus resulting in a more economic bioprocess.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese hamsters 3aammonium lactate 3aanimal ovaries 3abiomass production 3abioprocessing 3acell growth 3aerythropoietin 3aexperimental design 3aglucose 3aglutamine 3apH 3aproduct quality 3aprotein synthesis 3arecombinant proteins 3asynergism 3atemperature 0aBiphasic cultivation for bioprocess development 0aChinese hamster ovary cell 0aDesign of experiments 0aRecombinant Epo-Fc production 0aParameter shift 0aProtein aggregation1 aReinhart, David1 aGili, Andreas1 aChang, Martina1 aAberg, Per-Mikael1 aCastan, Andreas1 aKunert, Renate0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2016 June 10, v. 227 p.3-9dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.03.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009300170300001100263520204600274592002802320650001802348650001702366650001402383650001202397650001002409650001402419650000902433700002902442773011802471856008102589852000902670655001202679IND60572437420221120055617.0170718e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057243742DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-017-2314-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVega-Trejo, Regina10aTesting female preferences under more natural conditions: a case study on a fiddler crab  ap. 81.  aMate choice is often affected by multiple factors, and there are often trade-offs associated with choosing a mate. Additionally, experiments that test for mate preferences usually rely on simple two-choice tests. These tests are, however, often less complex than the scenarios that individuals face in natural populations. Here, we test female choice in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi. We looked at female preference for wave rates and proximity to males in simple two-choice tests. We then mimicked a more natural choice scenario, where females faced a cluster of six courting males that differed in their distance from the female as well as in their wave rate. In addition, we tested whether female preferences under these more complex conditions were affected by the risk of predation. We found a preference for faster wave rates and closer males in two-choice tests. The preference for closer males was, however, only evident when the difference in distance was large (15 cm), not when it was small (3 cm). When females chose between six males, they preferred the males that waved faster, even if they were further away. We did not, however, find any difference in female choice when a simulated predator was present or absent. By examining a more realistic set of options that females face, we can paint a better picture of how females’ trade-off costs and benefits during mate choice. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Mate choice experiments often rely on two-choice tests. Mate choice, however, is often more complex under totally natural conditions. Using a two-choice experiment, we show that female fiddler crabs U. mjoebergi show a preference for faster wave rates and closer males. Under a more natural choice scenario, when choosing between six males, females preferred to travel longer to reach faster waving males. We found that female responses did not differ when a predator was present or absent. Designing choice experiments to more accurately mimic natural conditions will allow assessing trade-offs that occur in mate choice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUca mjoebergi 3acase studies 3acourtship 3afemales 3amales 3apredation 3arisk1 aBackwell, Patricia R.

Recent studies suggest that garcinia has potential anticancer activity. Increasing evidences indicate that the main active monomer gambogic acid isolated from garcinia can inhibit the growth of various cancer cells. Neogambogic acid is an isolated compound with a similar chemical structure as gambogic acid. Preliminary studies show that the neogambogic acid can selectively inhibit the growth of various cancer cells, and has a broader antitumor activity and lower toxicity than gambogic acid. In this review, we summarize the advances made in the investigation of the anti-tumor effect of neogambogic acid in recent years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGarcinia hanburyi 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aanthelmintics 3aantineoplastic activity 3achemical structure 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3atoxicity 0aChinese medicine 0aNeogambogic acid 0aAnticancer 0aMechanism1 aZHANG, Hong-Ming1 aChen, Baoan,0 tChinese journal of natural medicines.g2018 Sept., v. 16, no. 9 p.641-643dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6169x1875-53647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1875-5364(18)30103-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245014300174300001600317520163800333592002801971650001601999650001102015650002402026650001102050650000902061650002302070650002202093651001102115653001902126653001602145653002202161700002202183700002102205773010702226856008702333852000902420655001202429IND60526112420221118234750.0190402e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052611242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2016.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLauer, J. Wesley10aMorphodynamics and sediment tracers in 1-D (MAST-1D): 1-D sediment transport that includes exchange with an off-channel sediment reservoir  ap. 135-149.  aBed material transported in geomorphically active gravel bed rivers often has a local source at nearby eroding banks and ends up sequestered in bars not far downstream. However, most 1-D numerical models for gravel transport assume that gravel originates from and deposits on the channel bed. In this paper, we present a 1-D framework for simulating morphodynamic evolution of bed elevation and size distribution in a gravel-bed river that actively exchanges sediment with its floodplain, which is represented as an off-channel sediment reservoir. The model is based on the idea that sediment enters the channel at eroding banks whose elevation depends on total floodplain sediment storage and on the average elevation of the floodplain relative to the channel bed. Lateral erosion of these banks occurs at a specified rate that can represent either net channel migration or channel widening. Transfer of material out of the channel depends on a typical bar thickness and a specified lateral exchange rate due either to net channel migration or narrowing. The model is implemented using an object oriented framework that allows users to explore relationships between bank supply, bed structure, and lateral change rates. It is applied to a ∼50-km reach of the Ain River, France, that experienced significant reduction in sediment supply due to dam construction during the 20th century. Results are strongly sensitive to lateral exchange rates, showing that in this reach, the supply of sand and gravel at eroding banks and the sequestration of gravel in point bars can have strong influence on overall reach-scale sediment budgets.  aPublisher supplied data 3afloodplains 3agravel 3amathematical models 3arivers 3asand 3asediment transport 3atracer techniques 3aFrance 0aMorphodynamics 0aFloodplains 0aChannel evolution1 aViparelli, Enrica1 aPiégay, Hervé,0 tAdvances in water resources.g2016 July, v. 93 p.135-149dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2016.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245008100167300001600248520143600264592002801700650001601728650002501744650001101769650002501780650001301805650001301818650002401831650002701855650001701882650001001899650001501909650001001924650001301934650001501947650001901962650001601981650003201997650002302029650003702052700001702089700001702106700002002123700002002143700001602163700001802179700001602197700001802213773011002231856008502341852000902426655001202435IND60090574520221118231330.0141102e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009057452DNAL7 a10.3967/0895-3988.2011.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLI, WanFang10aStudy of the Toxicity of 1-Bromo-3-Chloro-5,5-Dimethylhydantoin to Zebrafish  ap. 383-390.  aOBJECTIVE: 1-Bromo-3-chloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (BCDMH) is a solid oxidizing biocide for water disinfection. The objective of this study was to investigate the toxic effect of BCDMH on zebrafish. METHODS: The developmental toxicity of BCDMH on zebrafish embryos and the dose-effect relationship was determined. The effect of BCDMH exposure on histopathology and tissue antioxidant activity of adult zebrafish were observed over time. RESULTS: Exposure to 4 mg/L BCDMH post-fertilization was sufficient to induce a number of developmental malformations, such as edema, axial malformations, and reductions in heart rate and hatching rate. The no observable effects concentration of BCDMH on zebrafish embryo was 0.5 mg/L. After 96 h exposure, the 50% lethal concentration (95% confidence interval (CI)) of BCDMH on zebrafish embryo was 8.10 mg/L (6.15-11.16 mg/L). The 50% inhibitory concentration (95% CI) of BCDMH on hatching rate was 7.37 mg/L (6.33-8.35 mg/L). Histopathology showed two types of responses induced by BCDMH, defensive and compensatory. The extreme responses were marked hyperplasia of the gill epithelium with lamellar fusion and epidermal peeling. The histopathologic changes in the gills after 10 days exposure were accompanied by significantly higher catalase activity and lipid peroxidation. CONCLUSION: These results have important implications for studies on the toxicity and use of BCDMH and its analogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aabnormal development 3aadults 3aantioxidant activity 3abiocides 3acatalase 3aconfidence interval 3adevelopmental toxicity 3adisinfection 3aedema 3aepithelium 3agills 3ahatching 3aheart rate 3ahistopathology 3ahyperplasia 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3alipid peroxidation 3ano observed adverse effect level1 aWEI, JinFeng1 aJIN, HongTao1 aHUANG, MingFang1 aZHANG, JingXuan1 aLI, ChengHe1 aCHEN, ChaoJie1 aLiu, Chang,1 aWang, Aiping,0 tBiomedical and environmental sciences.g2011 Aug., v. 24, no. 4 p.383-390dElsevier B.V.x0895-39887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3967/0895-3988.2011.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007700166300001600243520109700259592002801356650001501384650001601399650001701415650002301432650001601455650001101471650002001482650002201502650001301524653002201537653001801559653001701577653002101594653002301615653001501638653001001653653000701663653000701670653001001677653000901687653000801696700001801704700002201722773014601744856008301890852000901973655001201982IND60590420520221119085341.0200419e20180304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059042052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Qianjiang10aMicrofluidics for secretome analysis under enhanced endogenous signaling  ap. 480-484.  aCell secretome, the complex set of proteins that are secreted by the cells, is a fundamental mechanism of cell-cell communication both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo, the analysis of proteins secreted into body fluids can bring to the identification of biomarkers for important physiopathological conditions. However, due to the complexity of the protein content of body fluids, a better understanding of the secreted proteins by different cell types is highly desirable and can be performed in vitro for dissection. To this aim, microfluidic culture systems could be particularly relevant because of the accumulation of extrinsic endogenous signals at microliter scale, which better preserves the self-regulation occurring in the small interstitial spaces in vivo. In this work, we perform a quantitative study to compare the secretome in microfluidics and in a standard well plate. Human foreskin fibroblasts are used as a case study. This work also represents an important technological advance in terms of feasibility of high-throughput quantitative protein analyses in microfluidics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abody fluids 3acase studies 3acell communication 3afibroblasts 3ahumans 3aprotein content 3aprotein secretion 3aproteins 0aMass spectrometry 0aIsotope label 0aMicrofluidic 0aSecreted protein 0aConditioned medium 0aFibroblast 0aSILAC 0aLC 0aMS 0aGO-CC 0aKEGG 0aECM1 aLuni, Camilla1 aElvassore, Nicola0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Mar. 04, v. 497, no. 2 p.480-484dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03554naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002900176245014600205300001500351520193900366592002802305650000802333650001502341650000802356650001102364650001702375650002402392650001702416650001002433650001302443650001502456650002102471650001202492650002502504650001602529650003002545650002102575650001402596650001802610700001502628700002402643700001402667773015202681856007002833856010102903990002303004852000903027655001203036IND60608542020221119102149.0190510e20170408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060854202DNAL7 a10.3791/555862doi7 aPMC55644882pmcid7 a284480342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamlee, Muhammad Khairul10aUsing a fluorescent pcr-capillary gel electrophoresis technique to genotype crispr/cas9-mediated knockout mutants in a high-throughput format  ap. e55586.  aThe development of programmable genome-editing tools has facilitated the use of reverse genetics to understand the roles specific genomic sequences play in the functioning of cells and whole organisms. This cause has been tremendously aided by the recent introduction of the CRISPR/Cas9 system-a versatile tool that allows researchers to manipulate the genome and transcriptome in order to, among other things, knock out, knock down, or knock in genes in a targeted manner. For the purpose of knocking out a gene, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated double-strand breaks recruit the non-homologous end-joining DNA repair pathway to introduce the frameshift-causing insertion or deletion of nucleotides at the break site. However, an individual guide RNA may cause undesirable off-target effects, and to rule these out, the use of multiple guide RNAs is necessary. This multiplicity of targets also means that a high-volume screening of clones is required, which in turn begs the use of an efficient high-throughput technique to genotype the knockout clones. Current genotyping techniques either suffer from inherent limitations or incur high cost, hence rendering them unsuitable for high-throughput purposes. Here, we detail the protocol for using fluorescent PCR, which uses genomic DNA from crude cell lysate as a template, and then resolving the PCR fragments via capillary gel electrophoresis. This technique is accurate enough to differentiate one base-pair difference between fragments and hence is adequate in indicating the presence or absence of a frameshift in the coding sequence of the targeted gene. This precise knowledge effectively precludes the need for a confirmatory sequencing step and allows users to save time and cost in the process. Moreover, this technique has proven to be versatile in genotyping various mammalian cells of various tissue origins targeted by guide RNAs against numerous genes, as shown here and elsewhere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3aRNA 3aclones 3afluorescence 3agel electrophoresis 3agene editing 3agenes 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3aknockout mutants 3amammals 3anucleotide sequences 3anucleotides 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areverse genetics 3ascreening 3atranscriptome1 aWang, Jing1 aCheung, Alice M.

Cross-sectional descriptive study. Community-based food pantries in California, Ohio and Texas, USA, from March 2012 through March 2014. Convenience sample of adults with diabetes queuing at pantries (n 1237; 83 % response). Sampled adults were stratified as food secure, low food secure or very low food secure. We used point-of-care glycated Hb (HbA₁c) testing to determine glycaemic control and captured diabetes self-management using validated survey items. The sample was 70 % female, 55 % Latino/Hispanic, 25 % white and 10 % black/African American, with a mean age of 56 years. Eighty-four per cent were food insecure, one-half of whom had very low food security. Mean HbA₁c was 8·1 % and did not vary significantly by food security status. In adjusted models, very-low-food-secure participants, compared with both low-food-secure and food-secure participants, had poorer diabetes self-efficacy, greater diabetes distress, greater medication non-adherence, higher prevalence of severe hypoglycaemic episodes, higher prevalence of depressive symptoms, more medication affordability challenges, and more food and medicine or health supply trade-offs. Few studies of the health impact of food security have been able to examine very low food security. In a food pantry sample with high rates of food insecurity, we found that diabetes self-management becomes increasingly difficult as food security worsens. The efficacy of interventions to improve diabetes self-management may increase if food security is simultaneously addressed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLatinos 3aadults 3aaffordability 3adescriptive studies 3adiabetes 3adistress 3adrug therapy 3afemales 3afood pantries 3afood security 3aglycemic control 3amedicine 3amental depression 3amodels 3apoint-of-care systems 3asampling 3aself-efficacy 3asurveys 3aCalifornia 3aOhio 3aTexas 0aDiabetes self-management1 aLyles, Courtney R1 aPrendergast, Kimberly1 aMarshall, Michelle Berger1 aWaxman, Elaine1 aSeligman, Hilary Kessler0 tPublic health nutrition.g2017 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.183-189dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800160017863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04289naa a2200889 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245013100168300001400299520183500313592002802148650002402176650002902200650002702229650002302256650002402279650000802303650001802311650001602329650002302345650001602368650001102384650001102395650001302406650002202419650000902441650001202450650001002462650001002472650001302482650001702495650001602512650001102528650001102539650002202550650001202572650001002584650001702594650002102611650001202632650001602644650002402660650001402684650002102698650001402719650004302733650000902776650005202785650001102837650001102848650001002859650001102869650001002880650001202890650001602902651001402918653001402932653002402946653001202970653002202982653000903004653002103013700002603034700002203060700003103082700002603113700002103139700001703160773011803177856008303295852000903378655001203387IND60534517520221119092719.0190318e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053451752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2014.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtaya, Farid S.10aGenomics, phylogeny and in silico analysis of mitochondrial glutathione S-transferase-kappa from the camel Camelus dromedarius  ap. 46-54.  aThe domesticated one-humped camel, Camelus dromedarius, is one of the most important animals in the Arabian Peninsula. For most of its life, this species is exposed to both intrinsic and extrinsic genotoxic factors that cause gross DNA alterations in many organisms. GST enzymes constitute an important supergene family involved in protection against the deleterious effects of oxidative stress and xenobiotics. Cloning the camel mitochondrial GST kappa (GSTK) gene and comparing its structural similarities with different species may aid in understanding its evolutionary relics. We cloned the camel GSTK using RT-PCR. This yielded an open reading frame of 678 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 226 amino acid residues. In a comparative analysis, the cloned GSTK was used to screen orthologues from different organisms. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the camel GSTK apparently evolved from an ancestral GSTK gene that predated the appearance of vertebrates, and it grouped with pig, cattle, dog, horse, human and monkey GSTKs. The calculated molecular weight of the translated ORF was 25.52 kDa and the isoelectric point was 8.4. The deduced cGSTK sequence exhibited high identity with many mammals, such as Bactrian camel (99.55%), pig, cattle and human (>74%), and lower identity with other unrelated organisms, such as frog (Xenopus tropicalis, 61%), chicken (Gallus gallus, 57%), salmon (Salmo salar, 49%), sponge (Amphimedon queenslandica, 46%), tick (Amblyomma maculatum, 45%) and roundworm (Caenorhabditis elegans, 33%). A 3D structure was built based on the crystal structure of the human and rat enzymes. The levels of cGSTK expression in five camel tissues were examined via real-time PCR. The highest level of cGSTK transcripts was found in the camel liver, followed by the testis, spleen, kidney and lung.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmblyomma maculatum 3aAmphimedon queenslandica 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aCamelus bactrianus 3aCamelus dromedarius 3aDNA 3aGallus gallus 3aSalmo salar 3aXenopus tropicalis 3aamino acids 3acamels 3acattle 3achickens 3acrystal structure 3adogs 3aenzymes 3afrogs 3agenes 3agenomics 3agenotoxicity 3aglutathione 3ahorses 3ahumans 3aisoelectric point 3akidneys 3aliver 3amitochondria 3amolecular weight 3amonkeys 3anucleotides 3aopen reading frames 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aphylogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asalmon 3aspleen 3aswine 3atestes 3aticks 3atissues 3axenobiotics 3aWest Asia 0aGST-kappa 0aStructure modelling 0aCloning 0aPhylogenetic tree 0aqPCR 0aOne-humped camel1 aAl-Jafari, Abdul Aziz1 aDaoud, Mohamed S.1 aAl-Hazzani, Amal Abdulaziz1 aShehata, Afaf Ibrahim1 aSaeed, Hesham M.1 aFouad, Dalia0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2014 Aug., v. 97, no. 1 p.46-54dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2014.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011600165300001400281520084900295592002801144650001201172650002101184650001701205650001501222650001601237650001101253650001701264653001201281653001901293653002101312653001501333653001701348653002201365653001001387653001001397653001901407653001001426653000801436653000801444653000901452653000901461653000901470653000901479653000801488653000801496700002101504700005801525773014401583856008301727852000901810655001201819IND60590420620221119085308.0201125e20180226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059042062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshida, Ryo10aBiosynthetic machinery for C25,C25-diether archaeal lipids from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Aeropyrum pernix  ap. 87-92.  aArchaea that thrive in harsh environments usually produce membrane lipids with specific structures such as bipolar tetraether lipids. Only a few genera of archaea, which are hyperthermophiles or halophiles, are known to utilize diether lipids with extended, C₂₅ isoprenoid hydrocarbon chains. In the present study, we identify two prenyltransferases and a prenyl reductase responsible for the biosynthesis of C₂₅,C₂₅-diether lipids in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Aeropyrum pernix. These enzymes are more specific to C₂₅ isoprenoid chains than to C₂₀ chains, which are used for the biosynthesis of ordinary C₂₀,C₂₀-diether archaeal lipids. The recombinant expression of these enzymes with two known archaeal enzymes allows the production of C₂₅,C₂₅-diether archaeal lipids in the cells of Escherichia coli.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aEscherichia coli 3abiosynthesis 3ahalophiles 3aisoprenoids 3alipids 3atransferases 0aArchaea 0aArchaeal lipid 0aHyperthermophile 0aIsoprenoid 0aPhospholipid 0aPrenyltransferase 0aDGFGP 0aDGGGP 0aDGFGP-glycerol 0aDMAPP 0aEIC 0aG1P 0aGFGP 0aGGGP 0aGFPP 0aGGPP 0aGGR 0aIPP1 aYoshimura, Tohru1 aHemmi, Hisashi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9538-809X0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Feb. 26, v. 497, no. 1 p.87-92dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245005300163300001800216520137700234592002801611650002501639650001001664650001901674650002301693650001401716650002801730650001301758650002401771650001101795650001701806650001701823650002301840650003101863650001401894650000901908650001201917650002501929650001901954650001701973650002701990700002602017773015102043856007902194961001302273852000902286655001202295IND60114834120221123021228.0141124e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011483412DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.113.0715062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPribis, Peter10aCognition: the new frontier for nuts and berries  ap. 347S-352S.  aThe inclusion of nuts in the diet is associated with a decreased risk of coronary artery disease, hypertension, gallstones, diabetes, cancer, metabolic syndrome, and visceral obesity. Frequent consumption of berries seems to be associated with improved cardiovascular and cancer outcomes, improved immune function, and decreased recurrence of urinary tract infections; the consumption of nuts and berries is associated with reduction in oxidative damage, inflammation, vascular reactivity, and platelet aggregation, and improvement in immune functions. However, only recently have the effects of nut and berry consumption on the brain, different neural systems, and cognition been studied. There is growing evidence that the synergy and interaction of all of the nutrients and other bioactive components in nuts and berries can have a beneficial effect on the brain and cognition. Regular nut consumption, berry consumption, or both could possibly be used as an adjunctive therapeutic strategy in the treatment and prevention of several neurodegenerative diseases and age-related brain dysfunction. A number of animal and a growing number of human studies show that moderate-duration dietary supplementation with nuts, berry fruit, or both is capable of altering cognitive performance in humans, perhaps forestalling or reversing the effects of neurodegeneration in aging.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3abrain 3acholelithiasis 3aclinical nutrition 3acognition 3acoronary artery disease 3adiabetes 3adietary supplements 3ahumans 3ahypertension 3ainflammation 3ametabolic syndrome 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3anutrients 3anuts 3aobesity 3aplatelet aggregation 3arisk reduction 3asmall fruits 3aurinary tract diseases1 aShukitt-Hale, Barbara0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2014 July, v. 100, no.

This case–control study aimed to evaluate the association between FCRL3 polymorphisms and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), asthma, and childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a Mexican population. We performed PCR-based genotyping to identify four FCRL3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (FCRL3_3 to FCRL3_6) in patients with JRA (n=202), asthma (n=239), or childhood-onset SLE (n=377), and healthy controls (n=400). The case–control analysis showed a male-gender dependent association between the FCRL3_3C, FCRL3_5C, and FCRL3_6A alleles and either JRA (OR=0.57, p=0.003; OR=0.55, p=0.002; OR=0.53, p=0.0007, respectively) or asthma (OR=0.72, p=0.04; OR=0.74, p=0.05; OR=0.70, p=0.02, respectively). As expected, minor alleles of these SNPs with the CGCA haplotype were also significantly associated with JRA (OR=0.35, p=0.00005) and asthma (OR=0.61, p=0.007). We found no association between FCRL3 SNPs or haplotypes and childhood-onset SLE. These results supported the notion that FCRL3 is involved in the etiology of several immune diseases. Our results also suggested that SNPs located in the FCRL3 gene were protective against JRA and asthma in male Mexican patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMexicans 3aalleles 3aasthma 3acase-control studies 3aetiology 3agenotyping 3ahaplotypes 3alupus erythematosus 3amales 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arheumatoid arthritis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aFCRL3 SNPs 0aJuvenile rheumatoid arthritis 0aAsthma 0aSystemic lupus erythematosus 0aAssociation study1 aJiménez-Morales, S.1 aEspinosa-Rosales, F.1 aGómez-Vera, J.1 aGutiérrez, A.1 aVelázquez Cruz, R.1 aBaca, V.1 aOrozco, L.0 tMolecular Immunology.g2013 Apr., v. 53 p.374-378dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2012.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245013200201300001800333500002000351520150400371592002801875650001701903650001801920650001301938650001601951650001501967650000901982650000901991650001702000651001002017700006102027700002102088700001902109700001702128700001802145700002302163773011502186856007502301852000902376655001202385IND60786753820221119023735.0220805e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078675382DNAL7 a10.1002/csc2.205822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamichaney, Amrit1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0345-586310aIntact funiculus in mature harvested seeds of field pea (Pisum sativum L.): preliminary investigation and possible implications  ap. 2863-2871.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA seed remains attached to mother plant through funiculus which is the only means of communication between seed and mother plant. In general, the funiculus is detached from seeds at maturity while harvesting and threshing. However, out of about 950 accessions of fieldpea (Pisum sativum) screened at ICAR‐Indian Institute of Pulses Research, Kanpur, India, eight accessions were identified to have intact funiculus in matured and harvested seed. The role of intact funiculus after maturity and harvesting is not yet known. This article summarizes the results of a preliminary investigation on the effect of presence of funiculus on mature harvested seeds of fieldpea on water uptake, as the region underneath the funiculus (hilum–micropylar region) is known to be actively involved in water imbibition by seed. We also propose the possible implications (positive and negative) of incorporation of such trait in high yielding cultivars. The preliminary investigation suggested that the presence of funiculus in harvested seeds has a significant but negative role in rate of water uptake, as the seeds of all eight accessions imbibed more water when funiculus was removed. Such an effect on water uptake, which triggers many physiological metabolisms of dry seed, could have an effect on rate and final germination, dormancy, seed shattering, and cooking time. Also, such genotypes are expected to perform better under high initial moisture and/or flood situation like rice (Oryza sativa) fallows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aPisum sativum 3adormancy 3agermination 3aimbibition 3apeas 3arice 3awater uptake 3aIndia1 aParihar, Ashok K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4239-82081 aDixit, Girish P.1 aSingh, Anil K.1 aKumar, Nitin1 aRevanasidda, 1 aSingh, Narendra P.0 tCrop science.g2021 Sept., v. 61, no. 5 p.2863-2871dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csc2.205823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001600190245005700206300001800263520141600281592002801697650002901725650001401754650001001768650001401778650002101792650001501813650001601828650001501844650002201859650001101881650001901892650001101911700002101922700002901943700002701972700002201999700001702021773010502038856008302143990002302226852000902249655001202258IND60098166920221117062029.0141104e20120701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009816692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.03.0192doi7 aPMC33968452pmcid7 a224808672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRing, Julia14aThe metabolism beyond programmed cell death in yeast  ap. 1193-1200.  aA cell's reaction to any change in the endogenous or exogenous conditions often involves a complex response that eventually either leads to cell adaptation and survival or to the initiation and execution of (programmed) cell death. The molecular decision whether to live or die, while depending on a cell's genome, is fundamentally influenced by its actual metabolic status. Thus, the collection of all metabolites present in a biological system at a certain time point (the so-called metabolome) defines its physiological, developmental and pathological state and determines its fate during changing and stressful conditions. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a unicellular organism that allows to easily modify and monitor conditions affecting the cell's metabolome, for instance through a simple change of the nutrition source. Such changes can be used to mimic and study (patho)physiological scenarios, including caloric restriction and longevity, the Warburg effect in cancer cells or changes in mitochondrial mass affecting cell death. In addition, disruption of single genes or generation of respiratory deficiency (via abrogation of mitochondrial DNA) assists in revealing connections between metabolism and apoptosis. In this minireview, we discuss recent studies using the potential of the yeast model to provide new insights into the processes of stress defense, cell death and longevity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aapoptosis 3agenes 3alongevity 3alow calorie diet 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3amitochondrial DNA 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3ayeasts1 aSommer, Cornelia1 aCarmona-Gutierrez, Didac1 aRuckenstuhl, Christoph1 aEisenberg, Tobias1 aMadeo, Frank0 tExperimental cell research.g2012 July 1, v. 318, no. 11 p.1193-1200dElsevier Inc.x0014-48277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.03.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02103naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012600165300001800291520091100309592002801220650001901248650002901267650001001296650002201306650001801328650001601346650001701362653001201379653002101391653002601412653002501438653001801463700001501481700001801496773010901514856008501623852000901708655001201717IND60573674420221121021048.0170724e20170718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057367442DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2016.12375552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValix, M.10aChemical torrefaction as an alternative to established thermal technology for stabilisation of sugar cane bagasse as fuel  ap. 1638-1643.  aDry and chemical torrefaction of sugar cane bagasse was examined in this study with the aim of stabilising and upgrading the fuel properties of bagasse. Dry torrefaction was conducted at temperatures from 160°C to 300°C under inert conditions, whilst chemical torrefaction incorporated a H ₂SO ₄ pre-treatment of bagasse. Chemical torrefaction imparted superior chemical and physical properties inducing morphological transformation and textural development with the potential to address issues in handling, feeding and processing bagasse. It increased the energy density of the chars with maximum HHV ₘₐₛₛ 21.5 MJ/kg and maximum HHV ᵥₒₗᵤₘₑ of 7.4 GJ/m ³. Chemically torrefied bagasse demonstrated resistance against microbiological attack for 18 months.

The objective was to determine the forage accumulation (FA) and nutritive value of alfalfa grown as a monoculture (ALF) and in mixtures with tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbyish] (ATF) or bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers] (ABG) subjected to four harvest intervals (clipped every 21, 28, 35, and 42 d). The study was conducted in Crossville, TN, and Charleston, OH, during the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons, and in Salisbury, NC, during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons. Harvest intervals of 35 d or greater showed optimal FA, with greatest productivity in spring. In summer, the plot productivity of ATF was not different from ABG. The ATF mixture was superior to ABG in FA for the entire season. Although tall fescue can be very competitive with alfalfa in mixtures, it results in greater FA while reducing weed competition. Botanical composition indicated greater weed infestation in ALF than in mixtures. Growing alfalfa–grass mixtures can increase sward crude protein compared with grass monocultures (average of 128 g kg–¹ for ATF and 161 g kg–¹ for ABG). We conclude that harvest intervals of 35 d or longer should be adopted to provide greater FA, and the ALF and ATF treatments resulted in superior FA compared with ABG in the southern United States.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynodon dactylon 3aFestuca arundinacea subsp. arundinacea 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3abotanical composition 3acrop-weed competition 3acrude protein 3adefoliation 3agrasses 3anutritive value 3aspring 3asummer 3asward 3aweeds1 aNave, Renata L.

METHODS: Mice were infected with increasing virus titers. Viral load in the lungs and trachea was determined by EID50 assay. Pulmonary histopathology was assessed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Anti-HI antibody titers and T-cell responses to viral HA were determined by ELISPOT and confirmed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Mice presented a mild syndrome after intranasal infection with A/Guangzhou/333/99 (H9N2) influenza virus. Virus was detected in the trachea and lungs of mice harvested on days 3, 6, and 9 post-infection. A T-cell response to viral HA was detected on day 6 and H9 HA-specific CD⁴⁺ T-cells predominated. Seroconversion was detected after 14 days and antibody persisted for at least 28 weeks. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that H9N2 (A/Guangzhou/333/99) can replicate in the murine respiratory tract without prior adaptation, and both humoral and cell-mediated immunity play an important role in the immune response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aT-lymphocytes 3aanimal models 3aantibodies 3abirds 3acell-mediated immunity 3afemales 3aflow cytometry 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3alungs 3amice 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aseroconversion 3aviral load 3aviruses1 aZi, Li1 aZhou, Jianfang,1 aZhu, Yun,1 aDONG, Jie1 aZhao, Xiang,1 aGuo, Junfeng,1 aSHU, YueLong0 tBiomedical and environmental sciences.g2011 Oct., v. 24, no. 5 p.530-536dElsevier B.V.x0895-39887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3967/0895-3988.2011.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245008700177300001800264520130500282592002801587650002901615650001701644650001401661650002501675650001701700650002201717650000901739650001001748650002901758650001701787650001701804650002401821650002501845650001601870650001701886650001301903650000901916650001401925650001501939650001301954650001301967650001001980653002901990653001402019653001302033653002602046653002702072653002202099653002502121700002002146700002702166700002402193700002502217773010902242856008502351852000902436655001202445IND60573674520221121042041.0170724e20170718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057367452DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2016.12375562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakraborty, Debkumar10aAgrowaste to vanillin conversion by a natural Pediococcus acidilactici strain BD16  ap. 1823-1834.  aOwing to its flavoring, antimicrobial, antioxidant and anticarcinogenic nature, vanillin is widely used in foods, beverages, perfumes and pharmaceutical products. Ferulic acid (FA) is an important precursor of vanillin which is abundant in cereals like maize, rice and wheat and sugar beet. A major drawback of microbial vanillin production from FA is the degradation and biotransformation of toxic vanillin to other phenolic derivatives. The present study is undertaken to explore microbial vanillin production from FA precursor rice bran by employing vanillin-resistant Pediococcus acidilactici BD16, a natural lactic acid bacteria isolate. Extracellular, intracellular and cellular vanillin dehydrogenase activity was found least, which was minimized vanillin degradation, and the strain resists more than 5 g L ⁻¹ vanillin in the medium. A metabolomics approach was followed for the detection of FA, vanillin and other metabolites generated during fermentation of rice bran medium. A metabolic pathway was also predicted for vanillin biosynthesis. Approximately 1.06 g L ⁻¹ of crude vanillin was recovered from rice-bran-containing medium and this further offers scope for the industrial utilization of the organism and its genetic manipulation to enhance production of biovanillin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPediococcus acidilactici 3aantioxidants 3abeverages 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3abiotransformation 3acorn 3adrugs 3aenvironmental technology 3afermentation 3aferulic acid 3agenetic engineering 3alactic acid bacteria 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aperfumes 3arice 3arice bran 3asugar beet 3atoxicity 3avanillin 3awheat 0aPediococcus acidilactici 0arice bran 0avanillin 0aferulic acid esterase 0avanillin dehydrogenase 0ametabolic pathway 0aphenolic metabolites1 aKaur, Baljinder1 aObulisamy, Karthikeyan1 aSelvam, Ammaiyappan1 aWong, Jonathan W.

Using a Modified Nutrient Profiling Index (MNPI), we assessed chain-restaurant items from the MenuStat database with a process involving three steps: (i) testing ‘extreme’ scores; (ii) crowdsourcing to analyse fruit, nut and vegetable (FNV) amounts; and (iii) analysis of the ambiguous items by a registered dietitian. In applying the approach to assess 22 422 foods, only 3566 could not be scored automatically based on MenuStat data and required further evaluation to determine healthiness. Items for which there was low agreement between trusted crowd workers, or where the FNV amount was estimated to be >40 %, were sent to a registered dietitian. Crowdsourcing was able to evaluate 3199, leaving only 367 to be reviewed by the registered dietitian. Overall, 7 % of items were categorized as healthy. The healthiest category was soups (26 % healthy), while desserts were the least healthy (2 % healthy). An algorithm incorporating crowdsourcing and a dietitian can quickly and efficiently analyse restaurant menus, allowing public health researchers to analyse the healthiness of menu items.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adatabases 3adesserts 3adietitians 3afruits 3amenu planning 3anutritive value 3apublic health 3arestaurants 3asoups 3avegetables 0aMethods 0aNutritional analysis 0aComputer science 0aRestaurant food1 aWu, Leslie1 aMatthiessen, Timothy B1 aLuft, Harold S.,0 tPublic health nutrition.g2017 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.18-24dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800160018043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04676naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245017800165300001600343520230500359592002802664650002002692650002802712650003002740650003402770650002102804650003402825650001402859650001202873650001802885650002202903650003002925650001402955650004102969650002003010650001203030650001003042650004303052650002203095650001203117650001803129650001103147650002003158650001703178650002303195650002203218650004303240650005203283650001303335650002403348650001503372653003903387653001903426653002803445653002803473653003003501653001503531653001503546700001203561700001503573700002003588700001903608700001803627700001903645700001703664700001803681773012403699856008603823852000903909655001203918IND60616304720221119024612.0181029e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061630472DNAL7 a10.1016/S1875-5364(18)30107-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZENG, Dan10aPolysaccharide extracts of Astragalus membranaceus and Atractylodes macrocephala promote intestinal epithelial cell migration by activating the polyamine-mediated K+ channel  ap. 674-682.  aAstragalus membranaceus (Radix Astragali, RA) and Atractylodes macrocephala (Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae, RAM) are often used to treat gastrointestinal diseases. In the present study, we determined the effects of polysaccharides extracts from these two herbs on IEC-6 cell migration and explored the potential underlying mechanisms. A migration model with IEC-6 cells was induced using a single-edged razor blade along the diameter of cell layers in six-well polystyrene plates. The cells were grown in control media or media containing spermidine (5 μmol·L⁻¹, SPD), alpha-difluoromethylornithine (2.5 mmol·L⁻¹, DFMO), 4-Aminopyridine (40 μmol·L⁻¹, 4-AP), the polysaccharide extracts of RA or RAM (50, 100, or 200 mg·L⁻¹), DFMO plus SPD, or DFMO plus polysaccharide extracts of RA or RAM for 12 or 24 h. Next, cytosolic free Ca²⁺ ([Ca²⁺]cyt) was measured using laser confocal microscopy, and cellular polyamine content was quantified with HPLC. Kv1.1 mRNA expression was assessed using RT-qPCR and Kv1.1 and RhoA protein expressions were measured with Western blotting analysis. A cell migration assay was carried out using Image-Pro Plus software. In addition, GC-MS was introduced to analyze the monosaccharide composition of both polysaccharide extracts. The resutls showed that treatment with polysaccharide extracts of RA or RAM significantly increased cellular polyamine content, elevated [Ca²⁺]cyt and accelerated migration of IEC-6 cells, compared with the controls (P < 0.01). Polysaccharide extracts not only reversed the inhibitory effects of DFMO on cellular polyamine content and [Ca²⁺]cyt, but also restored IEC-6 cell migration to control level (P < 0.01 or < 0.05). Kv1.1 mRNA and protein expressions were increased (P < 0.05) after polysaccharide extract treatment in polyamine-deficient IEC-6 cells and RhoA protein expression was increased. Molar ratios of D-ribose, D-arabinose, L-rhamnose, D-mannose, D-glucose, and D-galactose was 1.0 : 14.1 : 0.3 : 19.9 : 181.3 : 6.3 in RA and 1.0 : 4.3 : 0.1 : 5.7 : 2.8 : 2.2 in RAM. In conclusion, treatment with RA and RAM polysaccharide extracts stimulated migration of intestinal epithelial cells via a polyamine-Kv1.1 channel activated signaling pathway, which facilitated intestinal injury healing.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4-aminopyridine 3aAstragalus membranaceus 3aAtractylodes macrocephala 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aWestern blotting 3aalpha-difluoromethylornithine 3aarabinose 3acalcium 3acell movement 3acomputer software 3adigestive system diseases 3agalactose 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agene expression 3aglucose 3aherbs 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aintestinal mucosa 3amannose 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3apolysaccharides 3apolystyrenes 3apotassium channels 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arhamnose 3asignal transduction 3aspermidine 0aIntestinal epithelial cell (IEC-6) 0aCell migration 0aPolysaccharide extracts 0aAstragalus membranaceus 0aAtractylodes macrocephala 0aPolyamines 0aK+ channel1 aHU, Can1 aLI, Ru-Liu1 aLIN, Chuan-Quan1 aCAI, Jia-Zhong1 aWu, Dingding,1 aSUI, Jing-Jing1 aLU, Wen-Biao1 aCHEN, Wei-Wen0 tChinese journal of natural medicines.g2018 Sept., v. 16, no. 9 p.674-682dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6169x1875-53647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1875-5364(18)30107-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010100162300001600263500001500279520125200294592002801546650002701574650002501601650002501626650001601651650001801667650004301685650001201728650001901740650001601759650002201775650001901797650001601816650001301832653001001845700001801855700001901873700001701892700001301909700001501922700001301937773009101950856008102041852000902122655001202131IND60572437920221120050603.0170717e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057243792DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-017-1205-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Jiguo10aBiodegradation of Picolinic Acid by a Newly Isolated Bacterium Alcaligenes faecalis Strain JQ135  ap. 508-514.  a2019-12-06  aWe isolated a bacterial strain JQ135 from municipal wastewater, which was capable of efficiently degrading picolinic acid (PA). Based on the physico-biochemical characteristics and 16S rDNA analysis, strain JQ135 was identified as Alcaligenes faecalis. In addition, strain JQ135 produced an orange pigment when cultured in the Luria-Bertani medium, which is different from the previously reported strains of A. faecalis. During the degradation of PA by the resting strain JQ135 cells, only one intermediate, 6-hydroxypicolinic acid (6HPA), was detected by ultraviolet spectrophotometry, high-pressure liquid chromatography, and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. A random transposon mutagenesis library of strain JQ135 was constructed. One mutant, Mut-G31, could convert PA into 6HPA without further degradation. The disrupted gene (orf2) was amplified from Mut-G31, and its product showed 32% identity to the 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid kinase (KdkA) from Haemophilus influenzae. Results from complementation analysis confirmed that GTG was the initiation codon of the kdkA-like orf2, and that it was essential for PA biodegradation by strain JQ135. This study provides the first genetic evidence for the bacterial degradation of PA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemophilus influenzae 3aAlcaligenes faecalis 3amunicipal wastewater 3amutagenesis 3aribosomal DNA 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amutants 3abiodegradation 3astart codon 3amass spectrometry 3apicolinic acid 3atransposons 3abacteria 0agenes1 aZhang, Junjie1 aZhang, Yanting1 aWang, Yuhong1 aTong, Lu1 aHong, Qing1 aHe, Jian0 tCurrent microbiology.g2017 Apr., v. 74, no. 4 p.508-514dSpringer USx0343-86517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-017-1205-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245011600175300001400291520081400305592002801119650000901147650001601156650002001172650002001192650001601212650001801228650001601246650001901262650002101281650002701302653000801329653002101337653001301358653000801371653002601379700002301405700002401428700002101452700002101473700001701494700002201511773011801533856008301651852000901734655001201743IND60534517920221119092549.0190318e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053451792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2014.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujiwara-Igarashi, Aki10aInhibition of p16 tumor suppressor gene expression via promoter hypermethylation in canine lymphoid tumor cells  ap. 60-63.  aTo investigate the epigenetic regulation of the p16 gene in canine lymphoid tumor cells, its methylation status was examined in four canine lymphoid tumor cell lines. In three canine lymphoid tumor cell lines (CLBL-1, GL-1, and UL-1) with low-level p16 mRNA expression, 20 CpG sites in the promoter region of p16 gene were consistently methylated although all of the CpG sites were not methylated in another cell line (CL-1) and normal lymph node cells. The expression level of p16 mRNA in these three cell lines was restored after cultivation in the presence of a methylation inhibitor, 5-Aza-2′-deoxycitidine, indicating inactivation of p16 gene via hypermethylation.

In this work, we highlight the limits of standard SGR for posterior inference of high-dimensional categorical fields with realistically complex likelihood landscapes and benchmark a parallel tempering implementation (PT-SGR). Our proposed PT-SGR approach is demonstrated using synthetic (error corrupted) data from steady-state flow and transport experiments in categorical 7575- and 10,000-dimensional 2D conductivity fields. In both case studies, every SGR trial gets trapped in a local optima while PT-SGR maintains an higher diversity in the sampled model states. The advantage of PT-SGR is most apparent in an inverse transport problem where the posterior distribution is made bimodal by construction. PT-SGR then converges towards the appropriate data misfit much faster than SGR and partly recovers the two modes. In contrast, for the same computational resources SGR does not fit the data to the appropriate error level and hardly produces a locally optimal solution that looks visually similar to one of the two reference modes. Although PT-SGR clearly surpasses SGR in performance, our results also indicate that using a small number (16–24) of temperatures (and thus parallel cores) may not permit complete sampling of the posterior distribution by PT-SGR within a reasonable computational time (less than 1–2 weeks).  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3ageostatistics 3alandscapes 3amodels 3atemperature 3atempering 3awater resources 0aParallel tempering 0aSequential geostatistical resampling 0aTraining image 0aMCMC 0aMultiple-point statistics1 aLinde, Niklas1 aJacques, Diederik1 aMariethoz, Gregoire,0 tAdvances in water resources.g2016 Apr., v. 90 p.57-69dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2016.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01532naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245008600152300001800238520062900256592002800885650001800913650001400931650001500945650001300960700001800973700001300991700002201004773012101026856007401147852000901221655001201230IND60666854820221116180927.0190919e20141210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066685482DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra09156f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Min10aSize-selected boron nitride nanosheets as oxygen-atom corrosion resistant fillers  ap. 2983-2987.  aSize-selected boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) were explored to enhance the polymer's oxygen-atom corrosion resistance. BNNSs with three kinds of average lateral size were prepared by a size selection route. All these BNNSs could enhance the polymer's oxygen-atom corrosion resistance, but we found much greater enhancement by using larger BNNSs, i.e. adding ∼1.0 wt% large BNNSs (∼21.4 μm²) can achieve 87% decrease in the polymer's mass loss. BNNSs' barrier and bonding effects are responsible for the enhanced resistance.

Agricultural production is getting more and more specialized. Consequently, bonds between farmers within the same village weaken, while farmers get to socialize more with those with the same specialization, no matter the distance. As a result, social life in some of the villages declines. Simultaneously, small- and medium-scale farmers, who cannot compete with large farms, have been looking for additional, off-farm sources of income. One of the ways to revive feeling of a common goal and cooperation and at the same time to get additional income is creating a thematic village, whose development is focused on a certain topic (local food, craft, history, or some other ideas). It seems that this idea gives a chance for strengthening the social activeness and self-confidence of the villagers, and in some cases also for getting additional income.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioeconomics 3afarmers 3aincome 3alarge farms 3arural areas 3asustainable development 3avillages 3aPoland 0avillages 0aPoland 0athematic villages operating0 tVisegrad journal on bioeconomy and sustainable development.g2013 Dec. 31, v. 2, no. 2 p.60-63dVersitawJournal:21371x1338-83397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/vjbsd-2013-00123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024003900130040001800169100002000187245010700207300001600314520136100330592002801691650001201719650002401731650002001755650001701775650002401792650001601816650001301832653002401845653001301869653002901882653001601911653001401927700001801941700002801959700001801987700002002005700002202025700002002047700002102067773011302088856008302201852000902284655001202293IND60534518020221119092402.0190318e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053451802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2014.04.0092doi7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2014.04.0092chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvarez, Julio,10aBovine tuberculosis: Within-herd transmission models to support and direct the decision-making process  ap. S61-S68.  aUse of mathematical models to study the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases is becoming increasingly common in veterinary sciences. However, modeling chronic infectious diseases such as bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is particularly challenging due to the substantial uncertainty associated with the epidemiology of the disease. Here, the methodological approaches used to model bTB and published in the peer-reviewed literature in the last decades were reviewed with a focus on the impact that the models’ assumptions may have had on their results, such as the assumption of density vs. frequency-dependent transmission, the existence of non-infectious and non-detectable stages, and the effect of extrinsic sources of infection (usually associated with wildlife reservoirs). Although all studies suggested a relatively low rate of within-herd transmission of bTB when test-and-cull programs are in place, differences in the estimated length of the infection stages, sensitivity and specificity of the tests used and probable type of transmission (density or frequency dependent) were observed. Additional improvements, such as exploring the usefulness of contact-networks instead of assuming homogeneous mixing of animals, may help to build better models that can help to design, evaluate and monitor control and eradication strategies against bTB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abovine tuberculosis 3adecision making 3aepidemiology 3amathematical models 3auncertainty 3awildlife 0aBovine tuberculosis 0aModeling 0aWithin-herd transmission 0aEradication 0aDiagnosis1 aBezos, Javier1 ade la Cruz, Maria Luisa1 aCasal, Carmen1 aRomero, Beatriz1 aDomínguez, Lucas1 ade Juan, Lucía1 aPérez, Andrés,0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2014 Oct., v. 97 p.S61-S68dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2014.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245018300172300001500355520143400370592002801804650002601832650002301858650002401881650001101905650001001916650001501926650002101941650001201962650002001974650002601994653002602020653002402046653001702070653002102087653001302108700002602121700002002147700002102167773009302188856008502281852000902366655001202375IND60529732520221117191408.0161020e20160610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052973252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArikawa, Hisashi12aA study on the relation between poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) depolymerases or oligomer hydrolases and molecular weight of polyhydroxyalkanoates accumulating in Cupriavidus necator H16  ap. 94-102.  aCupriavidus necator H16 has nine genes of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) depolymerases or oligomer hydrolases (intracellular PHB mobilization enzymes). In this study, we evaluated the relation between these genes and the accumulation, consumption, and molecular weight of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) accumulating in strain H16 and in a recombinant C. necator strain, KNK-005, which harbors an NSDG mutant of the PHA synthase gene (phaCAc) from Aeromonas caviae. PhaZ6 had a significant influence on the molecular weight of PHA when palm kernel oil was used as a carbon source. The 005dZ6 strain (ΔphaZ6 mutant of KNK-005) could produce ultra-high-molecular-weight poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx) with weight-average molecular weight (Mw) >3.0×106 (approximately double that of KNK-005). Under PHA consumption conditions, deletion of phaZ1 and phaZ2 had a significant and slight attenuating effect, respectively, on the reduction in PHA content of KNK-005 cells. Regardless of the PHA consumption, its Mw did not decrease. Thus, 005dZ126 (the ΔphaZ1ΔphaZ2ΔphaZ6 triple mutant of KNK-005) is a promising strain capable of producing PHBHHx of ultra-high-molecular-weight and barely degrades PHBHHx enzymatically intracellularly. This is the first report examining the relation between intracellular PHB mobilization enzymes and molecular weight of PHAs accumulating in C. necator H16 and the derivatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aAeromonas punctata 3aCupriavidus necator 3acarbon 3agenes 3ahydrolases 3amolecular weight 3amutants 3apalm kernel oil 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 0aPolyhydroxyalkanoates 0aCupriavidus necator 0aDepolymerase 0aMolecular weight 0aPalm oil1 aSato, S.q(Shunsuke),1 aFujiki, Tetsuya1 aMatsumoto, Keiji0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2016 June 10, v. 227 p.94-102dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245016600205300001800371506007600389520166500465592002802130506003702158650002302195650002502218650000902243650000902252650000802261650001202269650002402281650000902305650002202314650001502336650001002351700002002361700002302381700002402404700002302428700001902451773016902470856007902639852000902718655001202727IND60114834620221207090823.0141124e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011483462DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.113.0712662doi7 aPMC41441092pmcid7 a248982352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKey, Timothy J10aCancer in British vegetarians: updated analyses of 4998 incident cancers in a cohort of 32,491 meat eaters, 8612 fish eaters, 18,298 vegetarians, and 2246 vegans  ap. 378S-385S.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Vegetarian diets might affect the risk of cancer.Objective: The objective was to describe cancer incidence in vegetarians and nonvegetarians in a large sample in the United Kingdom.Design: This was a pooled analysis of 2 prospective studies including 61,647 British men and women comprising 32,491 meat eaters, 8612 fish eaters, and 20,544 vegetarians (including 2246 vegans). Cancer incidence was followed through nationwide cancer registries. Cancer risk by vegetarian status was estimated by using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.Results: After an average follow-up of 14.9 y, there were 4998 incident cancers: 3275 in meat eaters (10.1%), 520 in fish eaters (6.0%), and 1203 in vegetarians (5.9%). There was significant heterogeneity between dietary groups in risks of the following cancers: stomach cancer [RRs (95% CIs) compared with meat eaters: 0.62 (0.27, 1.43) in fish eaters and 0.37 (0.19, 0.69) in vegetarians; P-heterogeneity = 0.006], colorectal cancer [RRs (95% CIs): 0.66 (0.48, 0.92) in fish eaters and 1.03 (0.84, 1.26) in vegetarians; P-heterogeneity = 0.033], cancers of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue [RRs (95% CIs): 0.96 (0.70, 1.32) in fish eaters and 0.64 (0.49, 0.84) in vegetarians; P-heterogeneity = 0.005], multiple myeloma [RRs (95% CIs): 0.77 (0.34, 1.76) in fish eaters and 0.23 (0.09, 0.59) in vegetarians; P-heterogeneity = 0.010], and all sites combined [RRs (95% CIs): 0.88 (0.80, 0.97) in fish eaters and 0.88 (0.82, 0.95) in vegetarians; P-heterogeneity = 0.0007].Conclusion: In this British population, the risk of some cancers is lower in fish eaters and vegetarians than in meat eaters.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclinical nutrition 3acolorectal neoplasms 3afish 3ameat 3amen 3amyeloma 3aprospective studies 3arisk 3astomach neoplasms 3avegan diet 3awomen1 aAppleby, Paul N1 aCrowe, Francesca L1 aBradbury, Kathryn E1 aSchmidt, Julie A.,1 aTravis, Ruth C0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2014 July, v. 100, no.

In in vitro experiments, the Nannochloropsis and Spirulina extracts inhibited fungal biomass by 34 and 25%, respectively, compared with the untreated control. This effect was confirmed by a reduction in ergosterol production (-80% for Nannochloropsis and -75% for Spirulina) and in DON content (-97% for Nannochloropsis and -62% for Spirulina). In field experiments, application of the fungicide prothioconazole and prothioconazole + tebuconazole resulted in control of Fusarium head blight (FHB) and foliar disease, leading to a significant increase in grain yield (+13%) and a reduction in DON content (-46%) compared to the untreated control. The application of MPE at wheat flowering reduced the severity of FHB compared with the control (-35% for Spirulina and -39% for Nannochloropsis). However, the MPE did not significantly control foliar diseases (Septoria tritici blotch) and therefore did not enhance the grain yield. Moreover, no effect in reducing the DON content in comparison to the control was observed in the field. In view of that, the use of MPE in wheat fields as real alternatives to conventional fungicides requires the discovery of solutions to empower their persistence and efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium graminearum 3aFusarium head blight 3aMycosphaerella graminicola 3aNannochloropsis 3aSpirulina 3aTriticum 3adeoxynivalenol 3adisease control 3aergosterol 3afield experimentation 3afoliar diseases 3afood contamination 3afungal biomass 3agrain yield 3ain vitro studies 3amicroalgae 3atebuconazole 3awheat 0aGibberella 0amycotoxins 0aNannochloropsis sp. 0aSpirulina sp. 0abiological control1 aScarpino, V.1 aMarinaccio, F.1 aVanara, F.1 aFurlong, E.

This method allowed simultaneous heating and UV irradiation of a sample under variable atmosphere, and in-situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) detection of the atmosphere change in a specially designed sealable cell. This method was applied to the evaluation of aging status of thermal oxidized nitrile rubber (NBR). In-situ FTIR signals of the atmosphere during heating of NBR samples were analyzed and the decrease of absorbances of characteristic bands with aging times were observed. The absorbances of the selected characteristic band (-NCS band) were correlated to the mechanical properties including recovery from bending (RFB), Young's modulus and elongation at break of the samples. Perfect linear relations between the absorbances of the characteristic band and mechanical properties were obtained. The method was extremely sensitive and had high sensitivity. Stability information or aging status of NBR could be obtained within several hours, and sample changes in very early stage (0–36 h) could be distinguished. The flexible and variable testing conditions provided the new method with great potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aheat 3amechanical properties 3amodulus of elasticity 3aoxidation 3arubber 3aultraviolet radiation 0aIn-situ aging evaluation 0aFTIR 0aThermal aging 0aNitrile rubber 0aAging status1 aZhao, Jiaohong1 aYang, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4035-41911 aIervolino, Rossana1 aBarbera, Stellario0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2016 June, v. 128 p.99-106dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2016.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02085naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245007200165300001400237520070100251592002800952650002000980650001801000650001901018650002301037650002801060650001101088650001301099650002401112650001801136650002101154650001201175650001301187650001801200650002501218650002401243651001001267651001801277653001301295653001901308653001801327700002401345700002101369773012601390856007801516852000901594655001201603IND60480755920221119070157.0160706e20100101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048075592DNAL7 a10.3138/jvme.37.1.692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTadich, Néstor A.10aTeaching Animal Welfare in Some Veterinary Schools in Latin America  ap. 69-73.  aAnimal welfare is an emerging topic in Latin America because of its impact on animal health, international trade, industry economic viability, and consumer perceptions. To enable veterinarians to be primary promoters of animal welfare, their training must include competencies in ethics, ethology, research, and public policy. During the past 10 years, animal welfare has gradually been incorporated into the curricula of several schools of veterinary medicine in Chile and other Latin American countries. Inclusion in these curricula is limited by a shortage of knowledgeable instructors. Research sustains inclusion of animal welfare in the curricula, but funding for research is often lacking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal behavior 3aanimal health 3aanimal welfare 3aconsumer attitudes 3aeconomic sustainability 3aethics 3aindustry 3ainternational trade 3apublic policy 3aresearch support 3aschools 3ateachers 3aveterinarians 3aveterinary education 3aveterinary medicine 3aChile 3aLatin America 0ateaching 0aanimal welfare 0aLatin America1 aMolento, Carla F.M.1 aGallo, Carmen B.0 tJournal of veterinary medical education.g2010 Jan. 1, v. 37, no. 1 p.69-73dUniversity of Toronto Pressx0748-321X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3138%2Fjvme.37.1.693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03600naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012500162300001800287500002000305520195200325592002802277650002802305650001802333650001402351650002102365650001902386650001102405650001802416650001302434650001102447650003302458650001202491650002102503650001702524650001602541650001102557650001502568700005802583700006802641700005902709700002402768700005502792700006002847773011502907856007503022852000903097655001203106IND60786754320221119072406.0220805e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078675432DNAL7 a10.1002/csc2.204452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoseley, David O.10aCharacterizing the growth and winter survival of commercially available and experimental genotypes of St. Augustinegrass  ap. 3097-3109.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSt. Augustinegrass [Stenotaphrum secundatum (Walter) Kuntze] is a commonly used warm‐season turfgrass for lawns in warm‐humid to tropical climates. Efforts to breed improved cultivars with enhanced abiotic and biotic stress tolerance are ongoing, but additional data on their growth and adaptation are needed. Twenty‐one commercially available St. Augustinegrass cultivars and eight experimental genotypes were planted in the field in Fayetteville, AR, in both 2009 and 2010 to study their stolon, leaf, and establishment characteristics, as well as winter survival. ‘Floratam’, ‘Floralawn’, ‘FX‐10’, ‘FA‐40’ (Mercedes™), ‘B12’ (Sapphire®), and WS had the highest stolon growth rate (>8.9 mm d⁻¹), whereas ‘TR 6‐10’ (Amerishade®), ‘6‐72‐99’ (Delmar™), ‘6‐72‐182’ (Jade™), ‘6‐72‐130’ (Sunclipse™), 106G3, 106T3, and SV27 had the lowest stolon growth rate (<5.1 mm d⁻¹). Cultivars ‘Floraverde’, Floralawn, Floratam, B12 (Sapphire), and ‘Texas Common’ were the quickest to establish. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified that cultivars with similar ploidy levels had similar growth characteristics as increasing ploidy resulted in wider and longer leaves, as well as larger stolon diameter and internode length. Cultivars considered dwarf types with short stolons or narrow‐short leaves grouped separately from cultivars with long stolons or wide‐long leaves. Genotypes VNS (Classic™), GF, VNS (Majestic™), ‘SS‐100’ (Palmetto®), ‘Raleigh’, TAES 5714, and Texas Common showed the highest winter survival and associated coverage after winter in both years. Results from this study are intended to help turfgrass breeders, turf producers, practitioners, and homeowners make informed cultivar selection decisions. Planting well‐adapted cultivars will reduce reestablishment costs from winter‐kill and ultimately increase sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStenotaphrum secundatum 3abiotic stress 3acultivars 3ainternode length 3alawns and turf 3aleaves 3aoverwintering 3aplanting 3aploidy 3aprincipal component analysis 3astolons 3astress tolerance 3aturf grasses 3awarm season 3awinter 3awinterkill1 aTrappe, Jon M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8730-25321 aMilla‐Lewis, Susana R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8524-50391 aChandra, Ambika1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4996-43831 aKenworthy, Kevin E.1 aLiu, Wenwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3473-741X1 aPatton, Aaron J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3870-77090 tCrop science.g2021 Sept., v. 61, no. 5 p.3097-3109dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csc2.204453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245020800167300001500375520139100390592002801781650002101809650001201830650002001842650001001862650001301872650001301885650001401898650002201912650002901934651002001963653001801983653001002001653002302011653002602034653004202060700002002102700001802122700002702140700002102167700002002188700002402208700002702232700002002259773014502279856008302424852000902507655001202516IND60590421020221119085535.0201125e20180226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059042102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhorbel, Rania10aFirst report of an unusual novel double mutation affecting the transcription repression domain of MeCP2 and causing a severe phenotype of Rett syndrome: Molecular analyses and computational investigation  ap. 93-101.  aRett syndrome is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder that develops a profound intellectual and motor disability and affects 1 from 10 000 to 15 000 live female births. This disease is characterized by a period of apparently normal development until 6–18 months of age when motor and communication abilities regress which is caused by mutations occurred in the X-linked MECP2 gene, encoding the methyl-CpG binding protein 2.This research study reports a molecular analysis via an exhaustive gene sequencing which reveals an unusual novel double mutation (c.695 G > T; c.880C > T) located in a highly conserved region in MECP2 gene affecting the transcription repression domain (TRD) of MeCP2 protein and leading for the first time to a severe phenotype of Rett syndrome.Moreover, a computational investigation of MECP2 mutations demonstrates that the novel mutation c.695 G > T is highly deleterious which affects the MeCP2 protein showing also an adverse impact on MECP2 gene expression and resulting in an affected folding and decreased stability of MECP2 structures. Thus, the altered TRD domain engenders a disrupted process of MECP2 functions.Therefore, this is the first study which highlights a novel double mutation among the transcription repression domain (TRD) of MeCP2 protein in Rett patient with a severe clinical phenotype in North Africa region.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding proteins 3afemales 3agene expression 3agenes 3amutation 3apatients 3aphenotype 3asequence analysis 3atranscription (genetics) 3aNorthern Africa 0aRett syndrome 0aMECP2 0a(c.695G>T;p.G232V) 0a(c.880 C>T;p.R294X) 0aTRD (transcription repression domain)1 aGhorbel, Raouia1 aRouissi, Aida1 aFendri-Kriaa, Nourhene1 aBen Salah, Ghada1 aBelguith, Neila1 aAmmar-Keskes, Leila1 aGouider-Khouja, Neziha1 aFakhfakh, Faiza0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Feb. 26, v. 497, no. 1 p.93-101dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001700186245002800203300001800231506007600249520116400325592002801489506003701517650001201554650002301566650001901589650002501608650002201633650001401655650002401669650002101693650001801714650000901732650003701741650001901778650002401797650000901821650003001830700002001860700001801880773015101898856007902049852000902128655001202137IND60114834720221207085703.0141124e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011483472DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.113.0715972doi7 aPMC41441102pmcid7 a248478552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbid, Zaynah10aMeat, dairy, and cancer  ap. 386S-393S.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn 2007 the World Cancer Research Fund and American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) report judged that the evidence for an association between red and processed meat consumption and colorectal cancer was convincing. In addition, the effect of other animal products on cancer risk has been studied, and the WCRF/AICR report concluded that milk probably decreases the risk of colorectal cancer but diets high in calcium probably increase the risk of prostate cancer, whereas there was limited evidence for an association between milk and bladder cancer and insufficient evidence for other cancers. There are several potential mechanisms relating meat to cancer, including heterocyclic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, N-nitroso compounds, and heme iron. Although the evidence in favor of a link between red and processed meat and colorectal cancer is convincing, the relations with other cancers are unclear. In this review, we summarize cohort studies conducted by the National Cancer Institute on meat and dairy intake in relation to cancer since the 2007 WCRF/AICR report. We also report the findings of meta-analyses published since 2007.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acalcium 3aclinical nutrition 3acohort studies 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adairy consumption 3aheme iron 3aheterocyclic amines 3ameat consumption 3ameta-analysis 3amilk 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aprocessed meat 3aprostatic neoplasms 3arisk 3aurinary bladder neoplasms1 aCross, Amanda J1 aSinha, Rashmi0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2014 July, v. 100, no.

Specifically, the density and the location of immune cells in the TME have important diagnostic and prognostic values. Multiomic profiling of the TME has exponentially increased our understanding of the numerous cellular and molecular networks regulating tumor initiation and progression. However, these techniques do not provide information about the spatial organization of cells or cell-cell interactions. Affordable, accessible, and easy to execute multiplexing techniques that allow spatial resolution of immune cells in tissue sections are needed to complement single cell-based high-throughput technologies. Here, we describe a strategy that integrates serial imaging, sequential labeling, and image alignment to generate virtual multiparameter slides of whole tissue sections. Virtual slides are subsequently analyzed in an automated fashion using user-defined protocols that enable identification, quantification, and mapping of cell populations of interest. The image analysis is done, in this case using the analysis modules Tissuealign, Author, and HISTOmap. We present an example where we applied this strategy successfully to one clinical specimen, maximizing the information that can be obtained from limited tissue samples and providing an unbiased view of the TME in the entire tissue section.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3aimage analysis 3aimmunity 3aneoplasm progression 3aneoplasms 3atherapeutics1 aFabre, Thomas1 aCleret-Buhot, Aurélie1 aSoucy, Geneviève1 aMeunier, Liliane1 aAbdelnabi, Mohamed N.1 aBelforte, Nicolas1 aTurcotte, Simon1 aShoukry, Naglaa H.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2020 Mar. 25, , no. 157 p.e60740-e60740dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/607403Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/60740/visualization-quantification-mapping-immune-cell-populations-tumor  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02087naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245006600171300001600237520087200253592002801125650001501153650001501168650001901183650001901202650001401221650001501235650002801250650001501278650001101293650001001304650001601314650001501330650001301345653000801358653001601366653001901382700002101401700001901422773012001441856008301561852000901644655001201653IND60534518220221119092757.0190318e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053451822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2014.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusk, Gabrielle C.10aDoppler blood pressure measurement in pigs during anaesthesia  ap. 129-131.  aTo determine the accuracy of Doppler blood pressure measurement in anaesthetised pigs eight large white pigs (Sus scrofa) were anaesthetised with zolazepam and tiletamine as Zoletil 100 (4 mg/kg) and xylazine (2 mg/kg) by intramuscular injection followed by isoflurane in 100% oxygen. Blood pressure measurements were recorded using a Doppler probe on the radial artery and a catheter in the femoral artery connected to a transducer. The sample mean of the Doppler measurements were compared with the sample mean of the invasive systolic arterial blood pressure while accounting for the heart rate, end-tidal CO2 and temperature. The predicted error of the Doppler was greatest when pigs were hypotensive and normothermic: 11 mmHg (CI: 6–15). Doppler measurements should be interpreted with caution in anaesthetised pigs that are hypotensive and normothermic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSus scrofa 3aanesthesia 3ablood pressure 3acarbon dioxide 3acatheters 3aheart rate 3aintramuscular injection 3aisoflurane 3aoxygen 3aswine 3atemperature 3atiletamine 3axylazine 0aPig 0aAnaesthesia 0aBlood pressure1 aCosta, Renata S.1 aTuke, Jonathan0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2014 Aug., v. 97, no. 1 p.129-131dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2014.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245010900201300001800310500002000328520156700348592002801915650002301943650001601966650002501982650001402007650002402021650001602045650001502061650001702076651001402093700002002107700006202127700002002189773011502209856007502324852000902399655001202408IND60786754520221119072349.0220805e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078675452DNAL7 a10.1002/csc2.205472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuzman, Manuel A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6261-463610aGenetic gain in lint yield and its components of upland cotton released during 1963 to 2010 in Venezuela  ap. 3436-3444.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTo respond to the high demand for cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) fiber, constant enhancements by breeding or management are required. The study of the genetic progress shows the changes in traits over the years, providing information about the real contribution and benefits of breeding and management efforts. In order to estimate the genetic progress of nine upland cotton cultivars for the lowlands agroecology of Venezuela released from 1963 to 2010, evaluations were performed in three locations in Venezuela during 2012 and 2013. Lint yield (LY), boll weight (BW), number of seeds per boll (SB), seed index (SI), lint content or percent (LP), plant height (PH), and stem diameter (SD) were measured. Combined analysis of variance showed differences (P ≤ .01) among the cultivars, environments, and their interaction for all traits, except for SB and SI. All variables have increased for the period evaluated, except for PH that showed a gradual decrease of 0.12% yr–¹. LY increased by 10.06 kg ha–¹ yr–¹ or 0.29% yr–¹, which is a total of 503 kg ha–¹ in 50 years. A reduction of PH (0.19 cm yr–¹) was observed, meanwhile BW (0.0022 g yr–¹), SB (0.0029 yr–¹), SI (0.0038 g yr–¹), SD (0.0013 cm yr–¹), and LP (0.0071% yr–¹) increased 0.04, 0.01, 0.04, 0.08 and 0.02% yr–¹, respectively, in the same period. These results indicate that the introduction of genotypes with divergent backgrounds and development to specific agroecologies have contributed to constant genetic progress in cotton cultivated in Venezuela.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aagroecology 3aanalysis of variance 3acultivars 3agenetic improvement 3alint cotton 3alint yield 3aplant height 3aVenezuela1 aVilain, Luis A.1 aRondon, Tatiana M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5578-32901 aSánchez, Juan,0 tCrop science.g2021 Sept., v. 61, no. 5 p.3436-3444dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csc2.205473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013500168300001400303520137800317592002801695650002401723650002701747650002101774650002801795650001201823650002201835650001201857650001401869650002001883650001301903650002201916653004201938653008401980653004002064653002902104653003102133653003002164653002402194653002702218653002902245653001902274653002202293653002002315700001902335700002902354700002502383773009202408856008502500852000902585655001202594IND60529732720221117191748.0161020e20160610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052973272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSafary, Azam12aA strategy for soluble overexpression and biochemical characterization of halo-thermotolerant Bacillus laccase in modified E. coli  ap. 56-63.  aAn efficient method was introduced for soluble expression of recombinant laccase (rpCotA(SL-1)) from a newly isolated halo-thermotolerant Bacillus sp. SL-1 in modified Escherichia coli, trxB2/gor2 mutant (Origami™ B (DE3)). The yield of purified soluble laccase in Origami strain under micro-aerobic condition was ∼20mg/L of bacterial culture, showing significant improvement over the laccase produced in E.coli BL21 strain under aerobic condition. The specific activity of 13U/mg for purified laccase produced in micro-aerobic condition was higher than that of 1.07U/mg observed for the purified enzyme obtained in aerobic condition in Origami. The kinetic Km and kcat parameters for laccase-induced oxidation reactions were 46μM and 23s−1 for ABTS (2,2′-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid), and 19.6μM and 24s−1 for SGZ (syringaldazine) substrates, respectively. The rpCotA(SL-1) displayed thermostability at 70°C and tolerance to specified concentrations of NaCl, NaN3, EDTA and SDS as inhibitors. The enzyme was relatively stable in the presence of different concentration of organic solvents, however the residual activity was adversely affected as the dipole moment of the solvents increase. Here we successfully report the production of soluble and functional laccase in Origami at the expression level suitable for industrial application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aEscherichia coli 3aindustrial applications 3alaccase 3amicrobial culture 3amutants 3aoxidation 3asodium chloride 3asolvents 3athermal stability 0aSyringaldazine (PubChem CID: 5379425) 0a2,2′-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (PubChem CID: 5464076) 0aSodium Chloride (PubChem CID: 5234) 0aEDTA (PubChem CID: 6049) 0aSDS (PubChem CID: 3423265) 0aNaN3 (PubChem CID: 33557) 0aMulticopper oxidase 0aCytoplasmic expression 0aMicro-aerobic expression 0aInclusion body 0aBacillus sp.

The highest abundance has been hypothesized to be in the geographical centre or the niche centre, although mixed patterns from empirical studies have triggered a recent debate. Here, we propose a conceptual framework based on environmental suitability and dispersal to interpret the mixed evidence. LOCATION: Global. TIME PERIOD: Present. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: Virtual species. METHODS: We conducted a series of simulations to demonstrate how the abundance pattern would be affected by environmental suitability and dispersal ability. We simulated different combinations of environmental suitabilities and dispersal abilities in landscapes with varied heterogeneities. We also investigated how frequently the location of the niche centre overlapped with the geographical centre. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the highest abundance could occur in the geographical centre, in the niche centre or somewhere in between the two centres, depending on the environmental set‐up and dispersal ability. We found that geographical and niche centres rarely overlapped, suggesting that a counteracting effect between the two factors, rather than reinforcement, is the norm in determining abundance patterns. Therefore, we would expect the highest abundance in the real world to occur between the two centres, in the niche centre, or in the geographical centre, in descending frequency. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed framework can be used to interpret the mixed patterns from empirical studies when testing the abundant‐centre and abundant niche‐centre hypotheses. Understanding the role of dispersal allows us to make predictions of the location with the highest abundance, as well as its location relative to the geographical centre and the niche centre. The varied locations of highest abundance mirror the mixed evidence in the literature, suggesting that the abundant‐centre and abundant niche‐centre hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. This highlights the importance of considering the underlying mechanisms for a better understanding of biogeographical patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3ageographical distribution 3aspecies abundance1 aQiao, Huijie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5345-62340 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2022 Feb., v. 31, no. 2 p.200-214dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3920180x1466-822X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.134123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003000153245008700183500002200270520170300292592002801995650002802023650001702051650002402068650002702092650001502119650001002134650001002144650001802154650002202172650002202194650001402216650001302230650002302243650002102266650001302287650001302300653001902313653001002332653001502342653002102357653002002378700002002398700002502418700002502443700002602468700002302494700005702517773007802574856008702652852000902739655001202748IND60569054420221120111927.0170610s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056905442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.05.1492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmeida, Angela Maria da,10aEcotoxicity of the antihistaminic drug cetirizine to Ruditapes philippinarum clams  aPre-press version  aCetirizine (CTZ) is an antihistaminic drug present in the aquatic environment although limited information is available on its toxicity to organisms. This study intended to evaluate the effects of CTZ on oxidative stress and energy metabolism biomarkers in the edible clam Ruditapes philippinarum after a 28days exposure to environmentally relevant CTZ concentrations (0.0, 0.3, 3.0, 6.0 and 12.0μg/L). The results obtained showed that CTZ was accumulated by clams reaching maximum concentrations (up to ~22ng/g FW) at the highest CTZ exposure concentrations (6.0 and 12.0μg/L). The bioconcentration factor (average maximum values of ~5) decreased at 12.0μg/L reflecting a reduction in clams uptake or increase of excretion capacity at this condition. The present study revealed that in general, clams decreased the metabolic potential after exposure to CTZ (decrease in electron transport system activity), a response that led to the maintenance of glycogen content in organisms exposed to CTZ in comparison to control values. Our findings also showed that in general, CTZ did not exert significant levels of oxidative injury to clams. However, comparing the control with the highest exposure concentrations (6.0 and 12.0μg/L) a significant increase of antioxidant enzyme superoxide activity (~53 and ~44%) was observed in clams exposed to CTZ. Moreover, a tendency to increase lipid peroxidation (~14 and ~9%) and carbonyl groups on proteins (~11 and ~3%) was observed in clams exposed to CTZ (6.0 and 12.0μg/L) compared to control condition. Overall the present study suggests that toxic impacts may be induced in R. philippinarum if exposed for longer periods or higher CTZ concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRuditapes philippinarum 3aantioxidants 3aaquatic environment 3abioaccumulation factor 3abiomarkers 3aclams 3adrugs 3aecotoxicology 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy metabolism 3aexcretion 3aglycogen 3alipid peroxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aproteins 3atoxicity 0aAntihistamines 0aClams 0aBiomarkers 0aOxidative stress 0aPharmaceuticals1 aCalisto, Vânia1 aEsteves, Valdemar I.1 aSchneider, Rudolf J.1 aSoares, Amadeu M.V.M.1 aFigueira, Etelvina1 aFreitas, Rosa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4900-38970 tScience of the total environment.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.05.1493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245011300174520184000287592002802127650001902155650002202174650001302196650003302209650002502242650001502267650001402282650001002296650001302306650001302319650001502332650001402347650002302361650001102384651001002395653001302405653001202418653001202430653001802442653002202460700001702482700001802499700005502517700001602572773009102588856009002679852000902769655001202778IND60780490820221121031050.0220809e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078049082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1354122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Bangjing10aFeammox is more important than anammox in anaerobic ammonium loss in farmland soils around Lake Taihu, China  aAmmonium (NH₄⁺) oxidation is a key step in nitrogen transformation in ecosystems. Prior to the recent discovery of Feammox (anaerobic NH₄⁺ oxidation coupled with iron reduction), anammox (anaerobic NH₄⁺ oxidation coupled with nitrite reduction) was thought of as the only pathway by which anaerobic NH₄⁺ loss (NH₄⁺ directly to N₂) occurs in soils. Experimental evidence has confirmed that both anammox and Feammox contribute to anaerobic NH₄⁺ loss; however, their relative contributions to this process in farmland soils are largely unknown. Therefore, in this study, we examined the seasonal activities of anammox and Feammox in conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) soils around Lake Taihu, China. Isotopic tracing experiments showed higher anammox and Feammox rates in summer than in other seasons, and the contribution of Feammox to anaerobic NH₄⁺ loss from the farmland soils (54.6%–69.3%) was higher than that of anammox. Further, the Feammox rates corresponding to the two soil tillage practices were significantly different, whereas their corresponding anammox rates showed no significant differences. Furthermore, molecular analysis showed that the abundance of Geobacteraceae differed significantly with season and tillage practice, whereas the abundance of anammox bacteria showed no significant differences between CT and NT practices. Structural equation modeling also revealed that the anammox rate was directly or indirectly driven by N availability and season, whereas the Feammox rate was driven by soil moisture content, Fe(III) concentration, Fe(III) reduction rates, tillage practice, and season. Overall, this study enhances understanding regarding anaerobic NH₄⁺ oxidation in farmland soils and highlight the importance of Feammox in NH₄⁺ loss in such an ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeobacteraceae 3aagricultural land 3aammonium 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3aconventional tillage 3aecosystems 3aequations 3alakes 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3ano-tillage 3aoxidation 3asoil water content 3asummer 3aChina 0aFarmland 0aAnammox 0aFeammox 0aAmmonium loss 0aTillage practices1 aLi, Zhengkui1 aCai, Miaomiao1 aLu, Mingzhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1601-67071 aLiu, Wenzhi0 tChemosphere.g2022 Oct., v. 305 p.135412-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1354123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005300147245013500200300001800335520129300353592002801646650001501674650002601689650002401715650001401739650001101753650002301764650002001787650002001807650004101827650001301868650001801881650001801899650002001917650003301937650001801970650001301988650002102001650001102022700001702033700001702050700001802067773016302085856008202248852000902330655001202339IND60646368520221121233355.0190816e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064636852DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-018-1878-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirza, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3287-987910aOptimization of lipid production potential of oleaginous yeast by response surface methodology cultivated in agro-industrial waste  ap. 3221-3230.  aThe study was designed to isolate oleaginous yeasts with remarkable lipid production potential from diverse local soil samples using glycerol enrichment technique. The select eight isolates were grown in nitrogen-limited media and screened for lipid production potential by the Sudan Black B staining. Potato starch is major waste of agriculture industry. To explore the optimized potential of a select C2 native oleaginous yeast isolate for microbial lipid production from potato starch as carbon source, 3-factorial central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology (RSM) was applied in batch experiments. Optimized results of CCD, RSM revealed lipid yield and cellular lipid contents up to 0.441 g/g total reducing sugar and 7.86 g/L, respectively. The predominant accumulated lipids were lauric acid (C12:0) and myristic acid (C14:0) as identified by GC–MS. These results demonstrated that lipids may produced using wastes/low cost substrates of agriculture industry, ultimately lead to reduction of biodiesel production cost. Furthermore, it is explored in this study that enough lipid yielding microbes from unconventional and economical substrates can support this budding route of cost effective biofuel production with additional incentive of waste management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSudan dyes 3aagricultural industry 3aagricultural wastes 3abiodiesel 3acarbon 3acost effectiveness 3adodecanoic acid 3afuel production 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aglycerol 3amyristic acid 3apotato starch 3areducing sugars 3aresponse surface methodology 3asoil sampling 3astaining 3awaste management 3ayeasts1 aSiddique, S.1 aQamer, H.

A total of 95, including five recurrent, cases were included in this study. No statistically significant differences in gender distribution were found. Mean patient’s age was 64.5 ± 15.9. The most common documented risk factors for the development of LA were underlying biliary tract abnormalities (37.9% of cases), and diabetes mellitus (12.7%), while in 21.1% of cases, LA were defined as cryptogenic. Most patients presented with fever (70.5%); right upper abdominal pain was reported in 61.1%, while vomiting and / or nausea — in 25.3% of cases. The most common isolates identified from LA were Klebsiella pneumonia (40.3% of cases), mainly in monomicrobial LA, and Escherichia coli (22.6% of cases), predominantly in polymicrobial LA. Ceftriaxone and metronidazole intravenous formulations were used in 35.5% cases as the principal antimicrobial combination at hospital. Median overall expected duration of antimicrobial treatment was 15 days. LA drainage was performed in 87.4% of cases for the median duration of seven days.

This paper reports the results of a study from February 2001 to June 2002 of a rocky sublittoral sponge community influenced by seasonal sand deposition. The largest impacts on the assemblages were a reduction in diversity, losses and substitution of species, and a shift from a relatively mature and stable community to a more unstable, less diverse community dominated by encrusting species more adapted to the local environmental conditions. These observations are consistent with studies that show that morphological diversity of sponge communities decreases when perturbation increases. Encrusting sponges such as Microciona sp. and Spirastrella decumbens were the most abundant and persistent throughout the study, followed by boring sponges of the genus Cliona. Massive species such as Haliclona caerulea, massive branching species such as Mycalesp., and cushion-shaped species such as Callyspongia californica were present only before deposition events. The general fluctuation in the patterns was consistent with the environmental conditions in this bay; the results suggest that the changes in the sponge assemblages may be due partly to great fluctuations in sediment deposition produced by a change in the direction of the dominant winds (from north to south) during the transition from the drought to the rainy season. This change provoked an increase in sedimentation/resuspension (up to 13 kg··m⁻⁻²··d⁻⁻¹ in May 2001) and water movement in the zone, which were key factors influencing the structure and composition of sponge assemblages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaliclona 3abranching 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3asand 3asediment deposition 3awet season 3awind 0aassemblages 0aééponges 0adééposition de séédiments 0aperturbations naturelles 0astructure 0astabilitéé 0aassemblages 0anatural disturbance 0asediment deposition 0asponges 0astability 0astructure0 tÉcoscience.g2006 Mar., v. 13, no. 1 p.119-130dÉÉCOSCIENCEx1195-68607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2980%2F1195-6860%282006%2913%5B119%3AEONSOT%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01409naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245020000158300002000358520030400378592002800682650002300710650002100733650001500754650001100769650004400780650001400824700002400838700002600862773012400888856007401012852000901086655001201095IND60664881720221121062927.0190912e20140422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066488172DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra00225c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, Sabari14aThe new threading system 2-benzyl-5,6-dimethyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazolium – dibenzo-24-crown-8: a model for Monte Carlo calculations incorporating an anion for the first time in threaded structures  ap. 18835-18841.  aA new [2]pseudorotaxane containing a benzimidazolium hydrogen-bonding station for a dibenzo-24-crown-8 (DB24C8) macrocycle is described.

The development of cutting-edge technology for simple but best practices is essential for the reliable production of safe reclamation water from wastewater. This study prepared a novel high strength sulfonated polyvinylidene fluoride (HSPVDF) ultrafiltration membrane and investigated to produce ATW, and performances were compared to sulfonated PVDF (SPVDF) (which was prepared without thermal treatment) and bare PVDF. To compare the properties of HSPVDF to hydrocarbon polymer, the polyetherimide (PEI) and Sulfonated PEI (SPEI) membrane were prepared. HSPVDF showed excellent membrane morphology, porosity, MWCO, and hydrophilicity, resulting in higher pure water flux (712 ± 6 L m⁻² h⁻¹) antifouling properties (Rᵢᵣ 1.3% and FRR 98.6%) compared to PVDF. It is an interesting fact that the tensile strength of the HSPVDF (3.4 ± 0.2 MPa) tremendously increased (3 folders) when compere to PVDF (1.3 ± 0.1 MPa). The HSPVDF membrane showed good removal efficiency up to 96 ± 05% and 97 ± 09% rejection for bovine serum albumin (BSA) and humic acid (HA), respectively. The membrane application studies for wastewater treatment showed that the tertiary HSPVDF UF membrane filtration following the nutrient removal activated sludge (NRAS) process can produce reliable and economic performance (125 ± 2 L m⁻² h⁻¹, 0.25 ± 0.05 NTU, no pathogens), suggesting that it can be a best practice technique that can replace the complicated multi-staged tertiary processes to produce reclamation water.  aPublisher supplied data 3abovine serum albumin 3aeconomic performance 3aheat treatment 3ahumic acids 3ahydrophilicity 3amicrofiltration 3aporosity 3atensile strength 3athermoplastics 3aultrafiltration 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aAdvanced treated water 0aEffluent standard 0aHigh strength sulfonated PVDF 0aReclamation water 0aTertiary treatment1 aAhn, Young-Ho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8301-58860 tChemosphere.g2022 Oct., v. 305 p.135416-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1354163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011000163300001800273520161900291592002801910650001401938650001501952650002101967650000901988650001501997650001102012650002202023650000902045650001002054650002502064650001102089650002002100700001602120700001902136700001202155773016302167856008202330852000902412655001202421IND60646368720221121195018.0190816e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064636872DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-018-1778-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevi, M. M.10aTransformation of waste tin-plated steel to iron nanosheets and their application in generation of oxygen  ap. 3669-3678.  aThe rising popularity of tin-plated steel for packaging food owing to its excellent anti-corrosion properties and good strength to withstand the shipment, storage and handling leads to an environmental pollution (mainly soil and water pollution) because of their resultant disposal as waste containers. In the present study, we have designed a new process for conversion of metallic waste to iron nanosheets and utilized this material to generate oxygen, an important component of environment for sustainable life. This transformation of waste tin-plated steel to iron nanosheet (20–25 nm thick) will provide a solution to environmental pollution as well as a robust electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction. Here, a single-step hydrometallurgy approach has been utilized for the transformation of waste tin-plated steel containers to iron nanosheet, and its efficiency toward the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline condition was investigated. The results show that the nanostructured iron sheet exhibits better properties as a electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction in terms of the onset overpotential of O₂ evolution (~ 329 mV) in comparison with the bulk iron (~ 500 mV) as well as iron-based alloy (Fe₃₃Co₆₇, ~ 400 mV). Thus, in the present investigation, the transformation of an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction, which is a value-added product from waste scrap, has been achieved at low cost. The above process is quite economical and can be easily extended for large-scale productions of the robust electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acontainers 3aelectrochemistry 3airon 3ananosheets 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3asoil 3asteel 3avalue-added products 3awastes 3awater pollution1 aOjha, K.

Thus, every country has to implement effective measures to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions at global level by including impacts abroad due to international trade and avoiding the outsourcing of emissions (“carbon leakage”). The sources and origins of emissions should be known to elaborate appropriate emission reduction strategies, requiring a detailed investigation of products in consumption. This article aims at investigating whether an accounting of emissions due to national consumption of products is considered as important and feasible with current methods, what future research gaps are, and how they can be solved by presenting new methodical approaches in the form of life cycle-based physical supply chains. The results have shown that existing methods are based mainly on monetary data at sectoral level, so that a detailed analysis of the national consumption of products is still missing and global effects as “carbon leakage” cannot be identified. Nevertheless, the demand for calculating consumption-based greenhouse gas emissions at product level was confirmed in various studies, but is currently seen as too complex and time-consuming. Finally, proposed methodical solutions to address existing research gaps were elaborated and applied exemplarily for the mineral sector in Austria and shall further serve as a kind of guidance how an accounting of emissions due to national consumption of products can be put in practice.  aPublisher supplied data  aACRPcKlima- und Energiefonds 3aclimate change 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ainternational trade 3asupply chain 3atemperature 3aAustria1 aWindsperger, A.1 aBird, D.

Temporal variations of hydrological masses induce time-varying gravitational potential and temporal mass loading that deforms the Earth’s surface. These phenomena cause temporal variations of geoid/quasigeoid and ellipsoidal heights that result in temporal variations of orthometric/normal heights ΔH/ΔH*. The aim of this research is to assess ΔH/ΔH* induced by hydrological masses over large river basins using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission data. The results obtained reveal that for the river basin of a strong hydrological signal, ΔH/ΔH* reach 8 cm. These ΔH/ΔH* would be needed to reliably determine accurate orthometric/normal heights. The ΔH/ΔH* do not exceed ±1 cm in the case of the river basin of the weak hydrological signal. The relation between hydrological mass changes and ΔH/ΔH* was investigated. Correlations between ΔH/ΔH* and temporal variations of equivalent water thickness were observed in 87% of river basins subareas out of which 45% exhibit strong correlations. The ΔH/ΔH* determined over two river basins that characterize with the strongest and weakest temporal variations were analysed using the Principal Component Analysis method. The results obtained reveal that ΔH/ΔH* in subareas of the same river basin can significantly differ (e.g., ±2 cm in the Amazon basin) from each other, and are strongly associated with different spatio-temporal patterns of the entire river basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclimate 3acorrelation 3agravity 3aland 3amass 3aprincipal component analysis 3aremote sensing 3aresearch 3asatellites 3atemporal variation 3athickness 3awater 3awatersheds1 aSzelachowska, Malgorzata 1 aKrynski, Jan 1 aRay, Jagat  Dwipendra0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Sept. 19, v. 12, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs121830703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012400168300001800292520150600310592002801816650001101844650001401855650001101869650002101880650001701901650001201918650001801930650001501948650001101963650002001974650001401994653001902008653000902027653001502036653002602051653002502077700001902102700001302121700001902134700001802153700001902171700001802190700002302208773013002231856008502361852000902446655001202455IND60569551520221122210203.0170606e20170605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056955152DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b001192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Qichang10aMoS2 Decorated Fe3O4/Fe1–xS@C Nanosheets as High-Performance Anode Materials for Lithium Ion and Sodium Ion Batteries  ap. 4739-4745.  aFe₃O₄/Fe₁–ₓS@C@MoS₂ nanosheets consisting of Fe₃O₄/Fe₁–ₓS nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanosheets and coated by MoS₂ were synthesized via a facile and scalable strategy with assistance of NaCl template. With Fe₃O₄/Fe₁–ₓS@C@MoS₂ nanosheets composite as an anode for LIBs and SIBs, the Fe₃O₄/Fe₁–ₓS@C@MoS₂ nanosheets composite shows outstanding electrochemical performance because of the synergistic effects of the Fe₃O₄/Fe₁–ₓS nanoparticles, carbon nanosheets and MoS₂. In this unique constructed architecture, on one hand, the carbon nanosheets can avoid the direct exposure of Fe₃O₄/Fe₁–ₓSNPs to the electrolyte; on the other hand, the carbon nanosheets can buffer the volume change of Fe₃O₄/Fe₁–ₓS NPs as well as suppress the aggregation of Fe₃O₄/Fe₁–ₓS NPs during the cycling processes. Moreover, MoS₂ can offer high interfacial contact areas between active materials/electrolyte, resulting in rapid charge transfer and higher capacity. As a consequence, Fe₃O₄/Fe₁–ₓS@C@MoS₂ nanosheets exhibit high reversible capacity of 1142 mAhg–¹ after 700 cycles at 1.0 A g–¹ and 640 mA h g–¹ at 5.0 A g–¹for LIBs, 402 mA h g–¹ after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g–¹and 355 mA h g–¹ at 2.0 A g–¹ for SIBs, respectively. This outstanding electrochemical performance indicated that the Fe₃O₄/Fe₁–ₓS@C@MoS₂ nanosheets have potential as anode for high-performance LIBs and SIBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acarbon 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3alithium 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asynergism 0aFe3O4/Fe1−xS 0aMoS2 0aNanosheets 0aLithium ion batteries 0aSodium ion batteries1 aZheng, Fenghua1 aOu, Xing1 aYang, Chenghao1 aXiong, Xunhui1 aTang, Zhenghua1 aZhao, Lingzhi1 aLiu, M.q(Meilin),0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2017 June 05, v. 5, no. 6 p.4739-4745dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b001193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02026naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245010700161300001800268500001900286520085600305592002801161650002301189650001801212650001801230650001201248653002301260653002501283653002201308653002301330653002101353700002001374700001901394700001701413773013801430856007501568852000901643655001201652IND60691693920221119105304.0200502e19970101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069169392DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.61.11182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurata, Takeomi10aGalactosyl Transfer onto p-Nitrophenyl β-d-Glucoside Using β-d-Galactosidase from Bacillus civculans  ap. 1118-1120.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aβ-d-Gal-(1→4)-β-d-Glc-OC₆H₄NO₂-p and its isomers (β-d-Gal-(l→3)-β-d-GIc-OC₆H₄NO₂-p and β-d-Gal-(1→6)-β-d-Glc-OC₆H₄NO₂-p) were synthesized from lactose and β-d-Glc-OC₆H₄NO₂-p, using transglycosylation by the β-d-galactosidase from Bacillus circulans.

Pycnogenol® is known for its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, the possible protective effects of pycnogenol on kidney, bone marrow, and red blood cells in rats treated with cisplatin were investigated. The rats were divided into four groups. Group 1 was the control and groups 2, 3, and 4 were orally treated with pycnogenol (200 mg/kg bw, o.p) for 5 days, treated with cisplatin (7 mg/kg bw, i.p.) on the fifth day and treated with cisplatin plus pycnogenol, respectively. Antioxidative parameters in kidney and red blood cells were measured. Chromosome anomalies in bone marrow and renal histopathology were also investigated. Activities of pro-oxidant enzymes (myeloperoxidase and xanthine oxidase), malondialdehyde, and nitric oxide levels significantly increased but antioxidant enzymes activities decreased in the kidneys and red blood cells after cisplatin treatment. Pycnogenol treatment prior to the administration of cisplatin significantly decreased cisplatin-induced injury, as evidenced by its normalizing these parameters. Chromosomal aberrations decreased and mitotic index frequencies increased in bone marrow treated with cisplatin plus pycnogenol. These findings suggest that pycnogenol may be a useful protective agent against the toxicity associated with cisplatin therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3abone marrow 3achromosome aberrations 3achromosomes 3acisplatin 3aerythrocytes 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3akidneys 3amalondialdehyde 3amyeloperoxidase 3anitric oxide 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3aprotective effect 3arats 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 3axanthine oxidase 2aAnimals 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxadverse effects 2aAntioxidantsxtherapeutic use 2aBone Marrowxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aChromosome Aberrationsxchemically induced 2aCisplatinxadverse effects 2aErythrocytesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aFlavonoidsxtherapeutic use 2aKidneyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMalondialdehydexmetabolism 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism1 aUnsal, Meftun1 aSekeroglu, Zulal A.1 aGülbahar, Yavuz0 tBiological trace element research.g2011 Sept., v. 142, no. 3 p.638-650dSpringer-Verlagx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-010-8781-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245011600175300001600291520101300307592002801320650003401348650001101382650001701393650002501410650002501435650001801460650001301478650002101491650000901512650001701521650001701538650002301555650002001578650002201598650002001620650001501640650001301655650001501668650001601683650002301699650002501722650002301747650002501770650001601795653002701811653002401838653002201862653001501884653002301899700002301922700002201945700002101967700002501988773011902013856008902132852000902221655001202230IND60636248920221119042422.0190405e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063624892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2018.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aʻAlī, Sājid,10aPre-storage methionine treatment inhibits postharvest enzymatic browning of cold stored ‘Gola’ litchi fruit  ap. 100-106.  aAntibrowning effect of methionine was investigated on litchi fruit. Fruit were treated with 0.25% methionine and kept under cold-storage at 5 ± 1 °C for 28 d. Methionine treatment reduced weight loss, and inhibited fruit decay. Methionine application to litchi fruit significantly reduced pericarp browning, malondialdehyde content, hydrogen peroxide, electrolyte leakage and peroxidase, and polyphenol oxidase activities with conserved pericarp anthocyanins. The treated fruit also had higher ascorbic acid contents, total phenolics, 2, 2–diphenyl–1–picrylhydrazyl–radical (DPPH) scavenging activity, and activities of ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase enzymes. Methionine treated fruit also showed higher soluble solid contents, titratable acidity, and sensory attributes with reduced sugar: acid ratio. In conclusion, postharvest methionine application to litchi fruit showed significantly reduced browning, higher antioxidative activities, and maintained quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aLitchi 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aascorbic acid 3acatalase 3acatechol oxidase 3acold 3acold storage 3aelectrolytes 3aenzymatic browning 3aenzyme activity 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amalondialdehyde 3amethionine 3apericarp 3aperoxidase 3apolyphenols 3asensory properties 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3aweight loss 0aAntibrowning treatment 0aElectrolyte leakage 0aPericarp browning 0aPeroxidase 0aPolyphenol oxidase1 aKhan, Ahmad Sattar1 aMalik, Aman Ullah1 aShaheen, Tayyaba1 aShāhid, Muḥammad,0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2018 June, v. 140 p.100-106dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2018.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245007400167520159000241592002801831650000801859650001301867650001001880650003801890650003401928650001701962650001101979650002001990650002202010650002202032650001702054700001802071700002102089700001902110700002402129773011902153856007802272852000902350655001202359IND60780926020221119032726.0220623e20220610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078092602DNAL7 a10.3390/genes130610452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuggett, Spencer B.10aOpioid Use Disorder and Alternative mRNA Splicing in Reward Circuitry  aOpiate/opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic relapsing brain disorder that has increased in prevalence in the last two decades in the United States. Understanding the molecular correlates of OUD may provide key insights into the pathophysiology of this syndrome. Using publicly available RNA-sequencing data, our study investigated the possible role of alternative mRNA splicing in human brain tissue (dorsal–lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and midbrain) of 90 individuals with OUD or matched controls. We found a total of 788 differentially spliced genes across brain regions. Alternative mRNA splicing demonstrated mostly tissue-specific effects, but a functionally characterized splicing change in the clathrin and AP-2-binding (CLAP) domain of the Bridging Integrator 1 (BIN1) gene was significantly linked to OUD across all brain regions. We investigated two hypotheses that may underlie differential splicing in OUD. First, we tested whether spliceosome genes were disrupted in the brains of individuals with OUD. Pathway enrichment analyses indicated spliceosome perturbations in OUD across brain regions. Second, we tested whether alternative mRNA splicing regions were linked to genetic predisposition. Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of OUD, we found no evidence that DNA variants within or surrounding differentially spliced genes were implicated in the heritability of OUD. Altogether, our study contributes to the understanding of OUD pathophysiology by providing evidence of a possible role of alternative mRNA splicing in OUD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aclathrin 3agenes 3agenetic predisposition to disease 3agenome-wide association study 3aheritability 3ahumans 3apathophysiology 3aprefrontal cortex 3asequence analysis 3aspliceosomes1 aIkeda, Ami S.1 aMcGeary, John E.1 aKaun, Karla R.1 aPalmer, Rohan H.

A total of 378 Shaver White layers were allotted to 7 treatments with 6 replicates (9 birds each) from 30 to 42 weeks of age. A basal diet (19 mg iron/kg) served as control, while the other six diets were supplemented with either FS or FG to provide 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg of added iron. Dietary FG and FS treatments improved (P < 0.05) laying rate, egg weight, and egg quality of layers, relative to the control, albeit eggshell strength and eggshell calcium also deteriorated with the highest level of FS (P < 0.05). The iron treatment groups exhibited a lower serum and egg yolk levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol that accompanied by higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and greater activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) as compared with the control (P < 0.05). The contents of malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl were conversely related to the activities SOD and GPx (P < 0.05). The serum and egg fractions (yolk, albumen, and shell) displayed gradually increases in iron contents as the level of iron increased in the diet (P < 0.05), while FG was superior to FS at all tested levels (P < 0.05). To summary, FS can be replaced by FG, with more favorable impacts on egg quality and iron enrichment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3adiet 3aegg shell 3aegg weight 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3aferrous sulfate 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3airon 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amalondialdehyde 3aresearch 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aTabeidian, Sayed Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7318-36351 aToghyani, Majid1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0470-856X1 aShahraki, Amir Davar Foroozandeh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1844-967X1 aGoli, Mohammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6933-635X1 aHabibian, Mahmood1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3455-81440 tBiological trace element research.g2021 May, v. 199, no. 5 p.1986-1999dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-020-02284-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01717naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245005400168300001600222520088700238592002801125650001101153650001201164650001101176650002201187650001501209700002101224773008801245856008501333852000901418655001201427IND60645395120221120164046.0190628e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064539512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2019.05.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain, Rishabh10aQuantifying a scientist's intellectual leadership  ap. 485-488.  aWe propose a new metric, the Intellectual Leadership Quotient (ILQ) to quantify the intellectual leadership demonstrated by a researcher. The ILQ provides a simple, accurate and quantifiable measure of a scientist's intellectual leadership. In our view, both the ILQ as well as the Hirsch (h) index should be considered concurrently when judging the scholarly work of a scientist. We propose that to be considered a leader who is shaping the field, ILQ values in excess of 80 in conjunction with a high h index would be necessary. In addition to facilitating better judgements related to faculty hiring, promotion/tenure cases, and society awards, the use of the ILQ will enable funding agencies to make better, more well-informed decisions. Other benefits of the ILQ include curbing unethical h index inflation and discouraging the frivolous addition of co-authors to a manuscript.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3afunding 3ahiring 3ahonors and awards 3aleadership1 aKoratkar, Nikhil0 tCarbon.g2019 Sept., v. 150 p.485-488dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.05.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03390naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245017900163500001400342520211600356592002802472650000902500650001102509650001602520650002102536650001502557650001102572650001502583650002402598650001602622650001902638650001502657650002102672650001602693651001802709700002202727700001802749773013002767856007402897852000902971655001202980IND60711854820221120131816.0200928e20200919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071185482DNAL7 a10.3390/rs121830732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKennedy, Blair  E.10aComparison of Empirical and Physical Modelling for Estimation of Biochemical and Biophysical Vegetation Properties: Field Scale Analysis across an Arctic Bioclimatic Gradient  aNAL-light  aTo evaluate the potential of multi-angle hyperspectral sensors for monitoring vegetation variables in Arctic environments, empirical and physical modelling using field data was implemented for the retrieval of leaf and canopy chlorophyll content (LCC, CCC) and plant area index (PAI) measured at four sites situated across a bioclimatic gradient in the Western Canadian Arctic. Field reflectance data were acquired with an ASD FieldSpec (305–1075 nm) and used to simulate CHRIS Mode1 spectra (411–997 nm). Multi-angle measurements were taken corresponding to CHRIS view zenith angles (VZA) (-55°, -36°, 0°, +36°, +55°). Empirical modelling compared parametric regression based on vegetation indices (VIs) to non-parametric Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR). In physical modelling, PROSAIL was inverted using numerical optimization and look-up table (LUT) approaches. Cross-validation of the empirical models ranked GPR as best, followed by simple ratio (SR) with optimally selected NIR and red wavelengths, and then ROSAVI using its published wavelengths (mean r²cᵥ = 0.62, 0.58, and 0.54, respectively across all sites, variables, and VZAs). However, the best predictive performance was achieved by SR followed by GPR and ROSAVI (NRMSEcᵥ = 0.12, 0.16, 0.16, respectively). PROSAIL simulated the multi-angle top-of-canopy reflectance well with numerical optimization (r² = ~0.99, RMSE = 0.004 ± 0.002), but best performing LUT models of LCC, CCC and PAI were poorer than the empirical approaches (mean r² = 0.48, mean NRMSE = 0.22). PROSAIL performed best at the high Arctic sparsely vegetated site (r² = 0.57–0.86 for all parameters). Overall, the best performing VZA was -55° for empirical modelling and 0° and ±55° for physical modelling; however, these were not significantly better than the other VZAs. Overall, this study demonstrates that, for Arctic vegetation, nadir narrowband reflectance data used to derive simple empirical VIs with optimally selected bands is a more efficient approach for modelling chlorophyll and PAI than more complex empirical and physical approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarea 3acanopy 3achlorophyll 3aempirical models 3aestimation 3aleaves 3amonitoring 3anormal distribution 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3avegetation 3avegetation index 3awavelengths 3aArctic region1 aKing, Douglas J.,1 aDuffe, Jason 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Sept. 19, v. 12, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs121830733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245015500129300001800284520211600302592002802418650000802446650002302454650002502477650001602502650001502518650001602533650002502549650002502574650003002599650001402629650001802643650002202661650001602683651002102699700002202720700002102742773017902763852000902942655001202951IND4490773620221121010028.0120501e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449077362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, Gwang Il10aNitratireductor aquimarinus sp. nov., isolated from a culture of the diatom Skeletonema costatum, and emended description of the genus Nitratireductor  ap. 2676-2681.  aTwo Gram-negative-staining, aerobic bacterial strains, designated CL-SC21T and CL-SC22, were isolated from a culture of the diatom Skeletonema costatum (Korean Marine Microalgae Culture Center, KMMCC strain B-396) established from the East Sea, Korea. The two novel strains shared 99.9 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences showed an affiliation with the genus Nitratireductor, with the strains sharing 96.5–97.5 % similarity with the type strains of recognized species of the genus Nitratireductor and being most closely related to Nitratireductor aquibiodomus NL21T. Phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain CL-SC21T together with strain CL-SC22 belonged to the genus Nitratireductor and formed a robust clade among closely related Nitratireductor species. The polar lipids comprised phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, two unidentified aminophospholipids, an unidentified aminolipid, an unidentified phospholipid and five unidentified lipids. Ubiquinone 10 was the major quinone. The major cellular fatty acids of strains CL-SC21T and CL-SC22 were C18 : 1ω7c (70.6–72.3 %) and C19 : 0ω8c cyclo (10.9–11.8 %). The genomic DNA G+C contents of strains CL-SC21T and CL-SC22 were 56.7 and 57.1 mol%, respectively. The level of DNA–DNA relatedness between strains CL-SC21T and CL-SC22 was 86 % (reciprocal 91 %), indicating that the two isolates represented a single species. However, levels of DNA–DNA relatedness between N. aquibiodomus NL21T and strains CL-SC21T and CL-SC22 were 28 % (reciprocal 45 %) and 25 % (reciprocal 50 %), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis and the results of biochemical tests showed that strains CL-SC21T and CL-SC22 were different from all recognized species of the genus NITRATIREDUCTOR: Thus, strains CL-SC21T and CL-SC22 represent a novel species of the genus Nitratireductor, for which the name Nitratireductor aquimarinus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CL-SC21T ( = KCCM 90090T = JCM 17288T).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPhyllobacteriaceae 3aSkeletonema costatum 3afatty acids 3amicroalgae 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence homology 3aubiquinones 3aKorean Peninsula1 aHwang, Chung Yeon1 aCho, Byung Cheol0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2011 Nov., v. 61, no.

A fine etched Au wire was coated with cathodic electrophoretic paint followed by polyimide, which retracted from the tip end during curing to expose the Au nanotip. By cyclic voltammetric scanning the above tip in 0.5 M KCl, the transformation of a core-shaped apex into a geometrically well-defined Au disk nanoelectrode with different dimensions can be controllably and reproducibly achieved. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and steady-state voltammetry were used to determine the size of nanoelectrodes. The results showed that the specific etching and insulation method not only avoids the use of toxic etching solution and the uncontrollable treatment to expose the tip but also makes possible the controllable and reproducible fabrication of Au disk nanoelectrode down to 3 nm in radius. The nanoelectrodes with well-demonstrated analytical performance were further applied for amperometrically monitoring dopamine release from single rat pheochromacytoma cells with high spatial resolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3adopamine 3aelectrophoresis 3agold 3ainsulating materials 3amonitoring 3apotassium chloride 3arats 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atoxicity 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aLi, Meina1 aZhang, Fan1 aZhu, Anwei1 aShi, Guoyue0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2015 June 02, v. 87, no. 11 p.5531-5538dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac50429993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01625naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245007900158300001800237520082200255592002801077650001501105650001301120650001101133700002001144773011101164856007501275852000901350655001201359IND60529973120170412000000.0160720e20150602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052997312DNAL7 a10.1021/ac504359m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLynn, N.

We show the level of sensing enhancement of an SHM-based sensing chamber over that of an unmixed chamber has a strong dependence on the SHM geometry, the Péclet number, and the overall sensor length.

This study aimed to explore the factors influencing Se concentration in community-dwelling individuals with T2DM. A total of 176 patients with T2DM were involved, and their general information was collected through a self-designed questionnaire. Venous blood samples and hair samples were collected to detect Se concentration and biochemical parameters. Multiple linear regression and binary logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the factors influencing Se concentration in patients with T2DM. The factors influencing selenoprotein P concentration in patients with T2DM included alkaline phosphatase (β = − 1.373; 95% CI: 0.087–0.736; P = 0.012), systolic blood pressure (SBP; β = − 0.047; 95% CI: 0.930–0.978; P < 0.001), the duration of T2DM (β = − 0.074; 95% CI: 0.877–0.983; P = 0.011), and clinical complications (β = 1.237; 95% CI: 1.465–8.109; P = 0.005). The factors influencing glutathione peroxidase activity in patients with T2DM were creatinine (CREA; β = − 0.378; P < 0.001), uric acid (β = − 0.069; P = 0.009), body mass index (β = − 2.177; P = 0.002), SBP (β = − 0.275; P = 0.031), and medical payment (β = 29.160; P < 0.001). The factors influencing serum Se concentration in patients with T2DM were albumin (β = − 1.391; 95% CI: 0.065–0.959; P = 0.043) and CREA (β = − 1.482; 95% CI: 0.072–0.718; P = 0.012). The factors influencing hair Se concentration in patients with T2DM were smoking (β = − 1.151; 95% CI: 0.133–0.755; P = 0.010), drinking (β = 1.366; 95% CI: 1.191–12.909; P = 0.025), and hair dyeing (β = − 1.113; 95% CI: 0.124–0.867; P = 0.025). In conclusion, the Se concentration in patients with T2DM was mainly affected by liver and renal function. When liver and/or renal function was impaired, the Se concentration in patients with T2DM was decreased.  aPublisher supplied data  aBY2018179cIndustry University Cooperation Research Project in Jiangsu Province 3aalbumins 3aalkaline phosphatase 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3acreatinine 3adyeing 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aliver 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apathogenesis 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3arenal function 3aresearch 3aselenium 3aselenoproteins 3asystolic blood pressure 3auric acid1 aZhang, Qianqian1 aWang, Jian1 aGuo, Renmei1 aWang, Li0 tBiological trace element research.g2021 May, v. 199, no. 5 p.1657-1663dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-020-02283-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245012700170520178200297592002802079650002902107650001302136650001602149650003102165650001502196650003302211650000902244650002502253650001202278650001702290651001002307653002002317653002302337653001002360653002602370653002002396700001202416700001402428700001602442700001902458700002602477700001402503773011902517856008802636852000902724655001202733IND60752973020221118183308.0211227e20220210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075297302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1505192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zihao10aOccurrence and distribution of organophosphate flame retardants in the typical soil profiles of the Tibetan Plateau, China  aThe urbanization and development of Tibetan Plateau (TP) probably results in a significant contamination of organic pollutants, such as organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs). However, there is a lack of monitoring and evaluation of their occurrence and risks in the soil of TP. We investigated the concentrations, vertical distributions, potential sources, and ecological risks of OPFRs in soil profiles from four regions of TP, China. The total concentrations of OPFRs in all soil samples ranged from 1.35 to 126 ng/g with a median of 12.6 ng/g. Relatively high concentrations were discovered in the top soils from Lhasa, suggesting a rising contamination around cities of TP due to anthropogenic disturbance. Tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP) was the dominant OPFRs followed by tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP). Vertical distribution of ΣOPFRs was discovered, especially at site Lhasa. Source apportionment based on principle component analysis and correlation analysis suggests that OPFRs in the TP soil mainly originate from atmospheric transport, while some OPFRs in the top soil may be also influenced by nearby sources. The vertical distributions of OPFRs in soil may be influenced by both soil and chemical properties, as well as their use. The ecological risk quotients (RQs) of 6 OPFRs in the TP soil were calculated, and most of their ecological risks were relatively low or negligible. However, for the worst-case scenario calculated by the 95th percentile concentrations, TNBP and tris(2-chloro-isopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP) at site Lhasa and cresyl diphenyl phosphate (CDP) at site Nagri had moderate risks. More attentions should be paid to the Tibetan Plateau in the future due to the rising ecological risks of OPFRs, especially to the areas around cities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiphenyl 3aenvironment 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3aphosphates 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk 3aspatial distribution 3atopsoil 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aTibetan plateau 0aSoil contamination 0aOPFRs 0aVertical distribution 0aEcological risk1 aXu, Yue1 aWang, Yan1 aLi, Zhiyuan1 aYang, Chenmeng1 aRodgers, Timothy F.M.1 aTan, Feng0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Feb. 10, v. 807 p.150519-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1505193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245010300210300001800313520133000331592002801661650001501689650003501704650001201739650001301751650001601764650001001780650000901790650001401799650001101813650002601824650003701850650002401887650001301911650001301924651001301937700005501950700006002005700001702065700002002082700001602102773012402118856008302242852000902325655001202334IND60731924820221118071734.0210731e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073192482DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-020-02281-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhisroon, Muhammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7953-240210aScalp Hair Metal Analysis Concerning DNA Damage in Welders of Peshawar Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pakistan  ap. 1649-1656.  aWelding is used throughout the world in refineries, thermal power plants, chemical facilities, and pressurized containers, and the welders are exposed to toxic heavy metals, electromagnetic fields, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and ultraviolet radiations. In the present study, 59 welders and an equal number of control subjects were assessed for DNA damage in the lymphocytes using the comet assay. Heavy metals such as lead (Pb), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), and cadmium (Cd) levels in the scalp hair of the subjects were evaluated by using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The results of the current study showed that DNA damage in the lymphocytes of welders (121.8 ± 10.7) was significantly higher as compared with controls (56.5 ± 17.6) (P < 0.001). Besides, the levels of Pb, Fe, Ni, Cr, Mn, and Cd were remarkably higher in the scalp hair of workers as compared with the control group (P < 0.001). Regression analysis showed a prominent association between the heavy metals and total comet score (TCS) in the exposed subjects. Age and duration of occupational exposure had significant effects (P < 0.05) on TCS values. Our results concluded that occupational exposure to welding fumes may cause DNA damage and can lead to important health hazards in the workers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3achromium 3acomet assay 3ahairs 3airon 3amanganese 3anickel 3aoccupational exposure 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3atoxicity 3aPakistan1 aKhan, Ajmal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6124-74591 aShah, Ashraf Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4698-97931 aUllah, Ihsan1 aFarooqi, Javeed1 aUllah, Abid0 tBiological trace element research.g2021 May, v. 199, no. 5 p.1649-1656dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-020-02281-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03288naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001800144245012300162300001600285500001500301520161900316592002801935650001201963650001401975650002201989650002602011650002002037650002802057650002102085650002502106650001402131650002202145650001402167650002402181650002102205650001302226650001002239650002602249650001402275651001302289653002102302653002202323653002302345653001202368653003602380653002202416653001402438700001802452700002102470700002202491773011802513856008202631852000902713655001202722IND4448076120221117023512.0151126e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444807612DNAL7 a10.2111/REM-D-09-00056.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLimb, Ryan F.10aTallgrass Prairie Plant Community Dynamics Along a Canopy Cover Gradient of Eastern Redcedar (Juniperus virginiana L.)  ap. 638-644.  a2019-12-06  aNorth American grasslands make up less than 75%% of their historic pre-European settlement area, and they continue to be converted to woodlands by woody plant encroachment. Conversion of grassland to woodland alters nutrient cycling, water use, and light penetration, which drives herbaceous plant community dynamics. Because studies examining this relationship among Juniperus species are limited largely to individual trees, we designed a study to examine the relationship between stand-level canopy cover of eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana L.) and the herbaceous plant community. We documented herbaceous plant species composition, abundance, and biomass within a North American tallgrass prairie invaded by eastern redcedar in which canopy cover of eastern redcedar ranged from 0%% to 80%%. Herbaceous species richness declined as a function of increased canopy cover of eastern redcedar and subsequent loss of open space, but this decrease in species richness closely followed a species––area model. Moreover, composition of C₃ and C₄ grasses and forbs did not change with increasing canopy cover. Herbaceous biomass, which declined with increasing canopy cover, varied most within those plots with intermediate canopy cover. While we found that species richness and biomass declined as canopy cover increased, the decline followed a species––area relationship and was without abrupt change typical of ecological thresholds. We recommend additional research with removal of eastern redcedar trees over a range of canopy cover to assess restoration potential along the encroachment gradient.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrasses 3aC4 plants 3aplant communities 3abotanical composition 3alight intensity 3adry matter accumulation 3avegetation cover 3aJuniperus virginiana 3aC3 plants 3aspatial variation 3awoodlands 3aecological invasion 3ahydrologic cycle 3aprairies 3aforbs 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aoverstory 3aOklahoma 0ahierarchy theory 0aemergent property 0awoody encroachment 0ajuniper 0aspecies––area relationships 0acommunity ecology 0athreshold1 aEngle, D.

Mungbean (Vigna radiata L. Wilczek) is an important grain legume widely cultivated in Southeast Asia for its protein rich grains. Salinity affects growth and productivity of mungbean. In this paper, we report overexpression of an Arabidopsis NHX1 (AtNHX1) in transgenic mungbean plants conferred enhanced salt tolerance. Cotyledonary node explants were transformed via Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation using pCAMBIA2301 vector that harbours 35S::AtNHX1 in its T-DNA. Putative transformed plants were selected on kanamycin containing medium. Polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analysis confirmed the presence, integration and copy number of transgenes in T₁ transgenic lines. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed higher expression of AtNHX1 in transgenic plants as compared to wild type plants (WT). Under salt stress conditions, T₂ transgenic lines displayed less damage and stronger growth phenotypes with concurrent physiological changes as compared to WT. In addition, T₂ transgenic lines under salt stress accumulated higher K⁺/Na⁺ in the aerial parts and higher [Na⁺] in roots than WT. Moreover, the T₂ transgenic lines showed under NaCl treatment reduced membrane lipid peroxidation and H₂O₂ and O₂ ⁻ accumulation, higher levels of antioxidant enzyme activity and increased accumulation of proline and ascorbate than WT. These results indicated that the activity of heterologous AtNHX1 protein contributing enhanced salt tolerance in transgenic mungbean.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aArabidopsis 3aSouthern blotting 3aVigna radiata 3aaerial parts 3aantiporters 3aenzyme activity 3aexplants 3agene overexpression 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aions 3akanamycin 3alipid peroxidation 3amung beans 3aphenotype 3apotassium 3aproline 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aroots 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asuperoxide anion 3atransfer DNA 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants 3avacuoles 3aSouth East Asia1 aKumar, Sanjeev1 aMishra, Sagarika1 aKobayashi, Yasufumi1 aPanda, Sanjib Kumar1 aSahoo, Lingaraj0 tMolecular breeding.g2016 Oct., v. 36, no. 10 p.144-144dSpringer Netherlandsx1380-37437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-016-0564-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014000163300001600303520124700319592002801566650002001594650000801614650001901622650001101641650001101652700001701663773011101680856008201791852000901873655001201882IND60583725420221121055321.0201125e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058372542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2017.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Wentao10aAssessing three waveform retrackers on sea ice freeboard retrieval from Cryosat-2 using Operation IceBridge Airborne altimetry datasets  ap. 456-471.  aIn this study, three previously proposed echo waveform retracking techniques are assessed for their performances in measuring lead and sea ice elevations from Cryosat-2 (CS-2) SAR L1b data. These derived CS-2 sea ice elevations and freeboards are compared with those from seven Operation IceBridge (OIB) flights, dedicated as the CS-2 underflights during the late winter/early spring of 2011, 2012 and 2013. Results show that sea ice elevation measured by CS-2 is mostly ranged between ~−1–0m, after the mean sea surface (MSS) is subtracted. The mean absolute biases between the CS-2 and ATM elevations in different underflights are mostly ranged between ~0.02–0.71m. For multi-year ice, empirical lead and threshold floe retracker (ELTF) is the best choice for ice elevation measurement and the waveform fitting retracker (WfF) is the best choice for ice freeboard retrieval. For first year ice, the WfF is the best choice for ice elevation measurement and the threshold first maximum retracker (TFMRA) is the best choice for ice freeboard retrieval. This study also suggests, when the TFMRA retracker is used to retrieve lead elevation, a 70% threshold of the first local maxima power is better than the 50% threshold previously used.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aice 3aremote sensing 3aspring 3awinter1 aXie, Hongjie0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2018 Jan., v. 204 p.456-471dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2017.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03766naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245017100169500001900340520232700359592002802686650001502714650001202729650001702741650002102758650001802779650001202797650001202809650001402821650001502835650002402850650001402874650002802888653002202916653002102938653002302959653001802982653001403000653002603014700001803040700002303058700002303081773009803104856008503202852000903287655001203296IND60734607920221120101637.0210601e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073460792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geodrs.2021.e004002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArshad, Maryem12aA systematic evaluation of multisensor data and multivariate prediction methods for digitally mapping exchangeable cations: A case study in Australian sugarcane field  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe acidic soil conditions in Australian sugarcane fields limit soil's capability to provide exchangeable (exch.) calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg). To replenish nutrient loss, the Six-Easy-Steps nutrient management guidelines were introduced to improve soil condition. However, laboratory analysis is required, and this is onerous. To value-add to soil data, digital soil maps (DSM) were developed by using two sources of digital data in three modelling approaches of geostatistical, statistical and hybrid. The effectiveness of digital data, either individually or combined, and varying number of calibration samples (n = 10–120) was tested for obtaining moderate agreement (i.e. Lin's = 0.65–0.80). The influence of varying number of calibration samples, was determined by calculating nugget to sill ratio (NSR) and used with ordinary kriging (OK) to make predictions. Moreover, four statistical approaches including one linear (i.e., multiple linear regression [MLR] and three nonlinear (i.e., Cubist, support vector machine [SVM], and random forest [RF]) were compared. Hybrid models were generated by adding regression residuals (RR) to the statistical models. In addition, we compare the final DSM’s by calculating the mean square prediction error (MSPE) and determining whether a traditional soil map, was as accurate. Results showed that while n = 50 could compute a moderate variogram (i.e. NSR = 25–75%), n ≥ 90 were required for stable results. Considering all data (i.e. n = 120), OK predicted Ca (0.69) and Mg (0.75) with agreement comparable to that of RF (0.64) and SVM (0.79). Overall, hybrid models of regression kriging (RK) and CubistRR (Cubist after addition of RR) had had largest agreement for predicting Ca (0.76) and Mg (0.81). This was also reflected in minimum number of calibration samples whereby geostatistical and statistical models needed n ≥ 80 while hybrid models could still achieve moderate agreement with as low as n ≥ 20. The MSPE showed that irrespective of DSM approach, the traditional soil map was not as accurate for predicting either Ca (2.64) and Mg (0.26). The results show, that while the soil condition in the study fields was beyond the range of the Six-Easy-Seps nutrient management guidelines, the potential of DSM to improve soil capability was demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid soils 3acalcium 3acase studies 3adigital database 3ageostatistics 3ahybrids 3akriging 3amagnesium 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asugarcane 3asupport vector machines 0aDigital soil maps 0aOrdinary kriging 0aStatistical models 0aHybrid models 0aAgreement 0aMultiple soil classes1 aZhao, Dongxue1 aKhongnawang, Tibet1 aTriantafilis, John0 tGeoderma regional.g2021 June, v. 25 p.e00400-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23258x2352-00947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geodrs.2021.e004003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155100001800173245008300191300001600274500002000290520098500310592002801295650001201323650000901335650002201344650000901366650001101375650002501386650001701411650002001428650001201448650002501460650002001485650002401505650002801529650000901557650007201566650001101638650001801649650000901667650002401676650005601700650002501756650002601781650003001807650001901837773011601856852000901972856009001981655001202071IND4463322420221120040955.0170712e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446332242DNAL7 a128669282pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-5827.2003.tb00159.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatson, P.

This paper describes four dogs which developed EPI secondary to pancreatitis. Two of the dogs also had diabetes mellitus which developed before EPI. One diabetic dog had concurrent hyperadrenocorticism and was euthanased five months after presentation; the other diabetic dog died 48 months after diagnosis. The remaining dogs were alive 78 and 57 months after diagnosis. The number of affected dogs was comparable to the number of cases of presumed PAA seen over the same time period in the same institution. Chronic pancreatitis may be a more common cause of EPI in dogs than previously assumed and may be under‐recognised because of difficulties in diagnosis. The relative importance of chronic pancreatitis as a cause of canine diabetes mellitus remains to be ascertained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatrophy 3acats 3adiabetes mellitus 3adogs 3ahumans 3ahyperadrenocorticism 3apancreatitis 2aAmylasesxblood 2aAnimals 2aCase-Control Studies 2aChronic Disease 2aDisease Progression 2aDog Diseasesxpathology 2aDogs 2aExocrine Pancreatic Insufficiencyxetiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aLipasexblood 2aMale 2aPancreasxpathology 2aPancreatitisxcomplicationsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aRecordsxveterinary. 2aRetrospective Studies 2aSeverity of Illness Index 2aTrypsinxblood0 tjournal of small animal practice.g2003 July, v. 44, no. 7 p.306-312dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-45107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-5827.2003.tb00159.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02536naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245017200166500001400338520134500352592002801697650001301725650001701738650001101755650001901766650001601785650001501801650002301816650001601839651001401855700002501869700002001894700001801914700001701932773013001949856007402079852000902153655001202162IND60711855620221120091425.0200928e20200920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071185562DNAL7 a10.3390/rs121830792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsadchiev, Alexander 10aSpatial Structure, Short-temporal Variability, and Dynamical Features of Small River Plumes as Observed by Aerial Drones: Case Study of the Kodor and Bzyp River Plumes  aNAL-light  aQuadcopters can continuously observe ocean surface with high spatial resolution from relatively low altitude, albeit with certain limitations of their usage. Remote sensing from quadcopters provides unprecedented ability to study small river plumes formed in the coastal sea. The main goal of the current work is to describe structure and temporal variability of small river plumes on small spatial and temporal scales, which are limitedly covered by previous studies. We analyze optical imagery and video records acquired by quadcopters and accompanied by synchronous in situ measurements and satellite observations within the Kodor and Bzyp plumes, which are located in the northeastern part of the Black Sea. We describe extremely rapid response of these river plume to energetic rotating coastal eddies. We reveal several types of internal waves within these river plumes, measure their spatial and dynamical characteristics, and identify mechanisms of their generation. We suggest a new mechanism of formation of undulate fronts between small river plumes and ambient sea, which induces energetic lateral mixing across these fronts. The results reported in this study are addressed for the first time as previous related works were mainly limited by low spatial and/or temporal resolution of in situ measurements and satellite imagery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3acase studies 3amixing 3aremote sensing 3ariver plume 3asatellites 3atemporal variation 3avariability 3aBlack Sea1 aBarymova, Alexandra 1 aSedakov, Roman 1 aZhiba, Roman 1 aDbar, Roman 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Sept. 20, v. 12, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs121830793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245018500168300001800353500001900371520149700390592002801887650001101915650002401926650001601950650002201966650002301988650001202011650002202023650001202045650001302057650002402070650001202094650000902106650001502115650002002130650000902150653001102159653001302170653001102183653001602194653001402210653001102224653001002235653000802245653000802253653000702261653000702268653000702275653000702282653000902289653000802298700002302306700001802329700001702347700002102364700002202385773012102407856008102528852000902609655001202618IND60717261520221119175442.0201111e20180511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071726152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2018.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParker, Francine10aA1603P and K1617del, Mutations in β-Cardiac Myosin Heavy Chain that Cause Laing Early-Onset Distal Myopathy, Affect Secondary Structure and Filament Formation In Vitro and In Vivo  ap. 1459-1478.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOver 20 mutations in β-cardiac myosin heavy chain (β-MHC), expressed in cardiac and slow muscle fibers, cause Laing early-onset distal myopathy (MPD-1), a skeletal muscle myopathy. Most of these mutations are in the coiled-coil tail and commonly involve a mutation to a proline or a single-residue deletion, both of which are predicted to strongly affect the secondary structure of the coiled coil. To test this, we characterized the effects of two MPD-1 causing mutations: A1603P and K1617del in vitro and in cells. Both mutations affected secondary structure, decreasing the helical content of 15 heptad and light meromyosin constructs. Both mutations also severely disrupted the ability of glutathione S-transferase–light meromyosin fusion proteins to form minifilaments in vitro, as demonstrated by negative stain electron microscopy. Mutant eGFP-tagged β-MHC accumulated abnormally into the M-line of sarcomeres in cultured skeletal muscle myotubes. Incorporation of eGFP-tagged β-MHC into sarcomeres in adult rat cardiomyocytes was reduced. Molecular dynamics simulations using a composite structure of part of the coiled coil demonstrated that both mutations affected the structure, with the mutation to proline (A1603P) having a smaller effect compared to K1617del. Taken together, it seems likely that the MPD-1 mutations destabilize the coiled coil, resulting in aberrant myosin packing in thick filaments in muscle sarcomeres, providing a potential mechanism for the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aelectron microscopy 3aglutathione 3amolecular biology 3amolecular dynamics 3amuscles 3amuscular diseases 3amutants 3amutation 3amyosin heavy chains 3aproline 3arats 3asarcomeres 3askeletal muscle 3atail 0amyosin 0amyopathy 0amuscle 0acoiled coil 0amutations 0aβ-MHC 0aMPD-1 0aGST 0aLMM 0aEM 0aCD 0aWT 0aMD 0aRMSF 0aMRE1 aBatchelor, Matthew1 aWolny, Marcin1 aHughes, Ruth1 aKnight, Peter J.1 aPeckham, Michelle0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2018 May 11, v. 430, no. 10 p.1459-1478dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2018.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245015300161300001600314520133600330592002801666653001401694653002701708653003101735653002201766700001301788700001301801700001601814700001301830773011301843856008101956852000902037655001202046IND60516690420221117102821.0160326e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051669042DNAL7 a10.1017/S09502688150013752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Y.,10aHealthcare utilization and lost productivity due to infectious gastroenteritis, results from a national cross-sectional survey Australia 2008–2009  ap. 241-246.  aThe aim of this study was to estimate the healthcare usage and loss of productivity due to gastroenteritis in Australia using the National Gastroenteritis Survey II. In 2008–2009, 7578 participants across Australia were surveyed about infectious gastroenteritis by telephone interview. A gastroenteritis case was defined as a person experiencing ⩾3 loose stools and/or ⩾2 vomits in a 24-h period, excluding cases with a non-infectious cause for their symptoms, such as pregnancy or consumption of alcohol. Lost productivity was considered any lost time from full- or part-time paid work due to having gastroenteritis or caring for someone with the illness. Interference with other daily activities was also examined along with predictors of healthcare-seeking practices using multivariable regression. Results were weighted to obtain nationally representative estimates using Stata v. 13·1. Of the 341 cases, 52 visited a doctor due to gastroenteritis, 126 reported taking at least one medication for their symptoms and 79 cases reported missing ⩾1 days’ paid work due to gastroenteritis. Gastroenteritis results in a total of 13·1 million (95% confidence interval 6·7–19·5) days of missed paid work each year in Australia. The indirect costs of gastroenteritis are significant, particularly from lost productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAustralia 0ahealthcare utilization 0ainfectious gastroenteritis 0alost productivity1 aFORD, L.1 aHALL, G.1 aDOBBINS, T.1 aKIRK, M.0 tEpidemiology and Infection.g2016 Jan., v. 144, no. 2 p.241-246dCambridge University Pressx1469-44097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S09502688150013753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009700163300001600260500001900276520122700295592002801522650002201550650001401572650002001586650001001606650001701616650002001633650001101653650002001664650002001684650001101704650001201715700001701727700001701744700002401761700001701785700001501802773010901817856008101926852000902007655001202016IND60731925420221118071748.0210325e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073192542DNAL7 a10.1007/s12250-016-3918-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Huawei10aAvian influenza virus directly infects human natural killer cells and inhibits cell activity  ap. 122-129.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNatural killer (NK) cell is a key component of innate immunity and plays an important role in host defense against virus infection by directly destroying infected cells. Influenza is a respiratory disease transmitted in the early phase of virus infection. Evasion of host innate immunity including NK cells is critical for the virus to expand and establish a successful acute infection. Previously, we showed that human influenza H1N1 virus infects NK cells and induces cell apoptosis, as well as inhibits NK cell activity. In this study, we further demonstrated that avian influenza virus also directly targeted NK cells as an immunoevasion strategy. The avian virus infected human NK cells and induced cell apoptosis. In addition, avian influenza virion and HA protein inhibited NK cell cytotoxicity. This novel strategy has obvious advantages for avian influenza virus, allowing the virus sufficient time to expand and subsequent spread before the onset of the specific immune response. Our findings provide an important clue for the immunopathogenesis of avian influenza, and also suggest that direct targeting NK cells may be a common strategy used by both human and avian influenza viruses to evade NK cell immunity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aapoptosis 3aavian influenza 3abirds 3acytotoxicity 3ahuman influenza 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3avirion 3aviruses1 aLiu, Yinping1 aSia, Sin Fun1 aPeiris, J.

The nanocomposite was characterized by methods such as FE-SEM, EDS, XRD, FTIR, TGA, VSM, and BET to identify and confirm the surface morphology, elemental composition, crystalline nature, functional groups, thermal stability, magnetic behavior, and surface area respectively. Box-Behnken Design (BBD) – an optimization method, which belongs to the Response surface methodology (RSM) and a modeling tool – Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were employed to design, optimize and predict the relationship between the input parameters (pH, initial concentration of 2,4-D, time and agitation speed) versus the output parameter (adsorption efficiency of 2,4-D). Adsorption efficiency of 98.12% was obtained at optimum conditions (pH: 2.05, initial concentration: 32 ppm, contact time: 100 min, agitation speed: 130 rpm, temperature: 30 °C, and dosage: 0.2 g/L). The predictive ability of the ANN was superior (R² = 0.99) than the quadratic model, given by the RSM (R² = 0.93). The equilibrium data were best-fitted to Langmuir isotherm (R² = 0.9944) and the kinetics obeyed pseudo-second-order model (R² = 0.9993) satisfactorily. Thermodynamic studies revealed the spontaneity and exothermic nature of adsorption. The maximum adsorption capacity, qₘ was found to be 255.10 mg/g, substantially larger than the reported values for 2,4-D adsorption by other magnetic nanoadsorbents. Therefore, this nanoadsorbent may be utilized as an excellent alternative for the elimination of 2,4-D from the waterbodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aSpondias dulcis 3aadsorption 3aagitation 3aelemental composition 3aexperimental design 3aheat production 3aleaf extracts 3amagnetism 3ananocomposites 3aneural networks 3apH 3aresponse surface methodology 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3asurface water 3asystem optimization 3atemperature 3athermal stability 0aMagnetic nanocomposite 0a2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 0aArtificial neural network1 aPai, Shraddha1 aMurugesan, Gokulakrishnan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4917-34501 aVaradavenkatesan, Thivaharan1 aNarayanasamy, Selvaraju1 aSelvaraj, Raja1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3170-78990 tChemosphere.g2022 Jan., v. 286 p.131938-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1319383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245015300171520161200324592002801936650001601964650002201980650000902002650001502011650002202026650002002048650001702068650001302085650001302098650001102111650000902122650001702131653002902148653003202177653002302209653002102232653002602253653002902279653002502308653003802333700001602371700002802387700002102415773009402436856008202530852000902612655001202621IND60734608420221120173435.0210806e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073460842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2021.1070432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMangolini, Beatrice10aXRF and XRPD data sets in ternary mixtures with high level micro-absorption and/or preferred orientations problems for phase quantification analysis  aMicro-absorption (MA) and/or preferred orientations (PO) are two among the major problems affecting quantitative phase analysis (QPA) by X-ray Powder Diffraction Data (XRPD) in industrial samples such as minerals and ores, additives, cements, friction materials, coal combustion by-products. Typically XRPD data are coupled to elemental analysis by X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) to facilitate phase recognition and quantification when elements heavier than sodium are present. Graphite and urea are typical examples of large production industrial commodities showing such analytical problems. The present article provides a recipe to produce sets of data of increasing difficulty to test the performances of different approaches and/or software’s for QPA by XRPD in graphite, zinc acetate and urea containing samples. Graphite, due to its platelet morphology, can exhibit orientation and was chosen because it is possible to control its PO degree by sieving. Simplex-centroid design augmented was used for the design of the experiments to select the mixtures with the more possible homogeneous exploration of the ternary experimental domains, from pure phase to equal-weighted mixtures. The different data sets collected on the four experimental domains by XRF and XRPD are provided and stored as a repository on Mendeley Data. Using the same approach, additional data sets sets with different composition and/or experimental setup can be added by us or any other contributor with the same DoE approach to create a wide open access data set of standardized X-ray powder diffraction and X-ray fluorescence data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3acoal 3acombustion 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3afluorescence 3afriction 3agraphene 3asodium 3aurea 3azinc acetate 0aX-Ray powder diffraction 0aQuantitative phase analysis 0aX-Ray fluorescence 0aMicro-absorption 0aPreferred orientation 0aPolycristalline mixtures 0aDesign of experiment 0aSimplex-centroid design augmented1 aPalin, Luca1 aMilanesio, M.q(Marco),1 aLopresti, Mattia0 tData in Brief.g2021 June, v. 36 p.107043-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2021.1070433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245017800167300001800345520140200363592002801765650001601793650001101809650002201820650002801842650002101870650001701891650002201908650001901930650000901949650001501958650002401973650001701997653004602014653001802060653003202078653003602110653001902146700001902165700001602184700001702200700001602217700001802233773013002251856008502381852000902466655001202475IND60569552920221122224125.0170606e20170605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056955292DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b002792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Zhipeng10aFabrication of High-Performance All-Solid-State Asymmetric Supercapacitors Based on Stable α-MnO2@NiCo2O4 Core–Shell Heterostructure and 3D-Nanocage N-Doped Porous Carbon  ap. 4856-4868.  aA stable α-MnO₂ nanowire@NiCo₂O₄ nanosheet core–shell heterostructure and a 3D-nanocage N-doped porous carbon nanosheet with high electrical conductivity are synthesized by a two-solution phase reaction and a facile one-step self-template technique, respectively.

In this work, the Ag-TiO₂-FAMB photocatalyst was prepared by the sol-gel method, with Ag as the dopant and Fly Ash Magnetic Bead (FAMB) as the carrier to improve its photocatalytic performance and recovery rate. The samples prepared were characterized by XRD, SEM, EDS, VSM, UV–vis diffuse reflection. The effects of the amount of photocatalyst, initial pH value and concentration of xanthate, and the intensity of light on the degradation of xanthate were investigated. Free radical quenching test, full-spectrum ultraviolet scanning, and ion test are used to explore the potential mechanism of xanthate degradation. The test results show that the synthesized Ag-TiO₂ is scaly and uniformly supported on the surface of FAMB and its response of the photocatalyst to visible light shifts to 475 nm. When the photocatalyst concentration is 3.0 mg/L, the initial pH value is 5.0, the initial concentration of xanthate is 10.0 mg/L and the light intensity is 250 W, the degradation rate of xanthate reaches 98.5% after 30 h of light. The photocatalyst recovered by the external magnetic field was reused 5 times, and the degradation rate of xanthate remained above 83.8%. Superoxide radical (·O₂⁻) is the main active species for photocatalytic degradation of xanthate, and xanthate peroxide (ROCSSO⁻) is an intermediate product, which is finally degraded into CO₂, SO₄²⁻, H₂O.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3afly ash 3afree radicals 3aintermediate product 3alight intensity 3amagnetic fields 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asol-gel processing 3asuperoxide anion 3atitanium dioxide 3awastewater 0aAg-TiO2 0aFly ash magnetic bead 0aSol-gel method 0aPhotocatalytic1 aTeng, Qing1 aSun, Beilei1 aYang, Zhichao1 aLiu, Shengyu1 aZhu, Xuan0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Sept. 05, v. 624 p.126795-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1267953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03943naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006800151245020100219300001500420520173900435592002802174650003302202650002702235650001602262650001902278650003102297650002402328650001702352650001802369650001102387650003802398650002002436650001902456650002602475650001602501650001402517650001702531650001802548650003002566650001402596650001102610650001102621653001402632653003302646653001902679653002902698653001402727653002302741700002402764700002402788700002902812700002202841700002302863700002402886700002902910700003202939700002602971700002502997700002903022700002203051773008903073856008603162852000903248655001203257IND60788802320221121012249.0220906e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078880232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2022.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValentim-Silva, João R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9346-538910aAntileishmanial activity, cytotoxicity and cellular response of amphotericin B in combination with crotamine derived from Crotalus durissus terrificus venom using in vitro and in silico approaches  ap. 96-106.  aTo investigate the in vitro activity, synergism, cytotoxicity and cellular immunological response, as well as the molecular affinity between amphotericin B (AmB) and crotamine (CTA), derived from Crotalus durissus terrificus venom against Leishmania amazonensis. This study performed the inhibition of promastigotes and amastigotes’ growth under different concentrations of the drug and pharmacological combinations (AmB + CTA) based on the Berimbaum method (synergism study). The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) quantification method was used to determine the cytotoxicity of the drug and combinations employing four cell lines (J774, HepG2, VERO, and C2C12). Following, the levels of Tumour Necrose Factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Interleukin-12 (IL-12) cytokines, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and nitrites, as an indirect measure of Nitric Oxide (NO), using the Griess reaction were assessed in the supernatants of infected macrophages. In silico approach (molecular docking and dynamics) and binding affinity (surface plasmon resonance) between the drug and toxin were also investigated. CTA enhanced AmB effect against promastigote and amastigote forms of L. amazonensis, decreased the drug toxicity in different cell lines and induced the production of important Th1-like cytokines and NO by infected macrophages. The pharmacological combination also displayed consistent molecular interactions with low energy of coupling and a concentration-dependent profile. Our data suggest that this pharmacological approach is a promising alternative treatment against L. amazonensis infection due to the improved activity (synergistic effect) achieved against the parasites’ forms and to the decreased cytotoxic effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrotalus durissus terrificus 3aLeishmania amazonensis 3aamastigotes 3aamphotericin B 3aantileishmanial properties 3acomputer simulation 3acytotoxicity 3adrug toxicity 3aenergy 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-12 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amacrophages 3aneoplasms 3anitric oxide 3apromastigotes 3asurface plasmon resonance 3asynergism 3atoxins 3avenoms 0aCrotamine 0aCrotalus durissus terrificus 0aAmphotericin B 0aAntileishmanial activity 0aSynergism 0aIn silico approach1 ade Barros, Neuza B.1 aMacedo, Sharon R.A.1 aFerreira, Amália dos S.1 aSilva, Rodrigo S.1 aDill, Leandro S.M.1 aZanchi, Fernando B.1 ado Nascimento, Johnny R.1 ado Nascimento, Flávia R.F.1 aLourenzoni, Marcos R.1 aSoares, Andreimar M.1 aCalderon, Leonardo de A.1 aNicolete, Roberto0 tToxicon.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 217 p.96-106dElsevier LtdwJournal:6279x0041-01017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2022.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009300167300001800260500000900278520189800287592002802185650002002213650002202233650001602255650000902271650001902280650001402299650002002313650001002333650001702343650001102360650001402371650001602385650001602401650001802417650001002435650001102445650001802456700001702474700001802491773012302509856008502632852000902717655001202726IND60665851220221118004113.0191228e200107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066585122DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2001.4141006x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahfoozi, S.10aInfluence of Vernalization and Photoperiod Responses on Cold Hardiness in Winter Cereals  ap. 1006-1011.  aepub  aAn understanding of the genetic regulation of low-temperature (LT) tolerance is a prerequisite for the development of cold tolerant cultivars for high stress regions. Vernalization requirement in winter habit cereals and photoperiod responsiveness in spring habit cereals has been shown to influence expression of the LT tolerance genes. The objective of the present study was to determine the influence of photoperiod response on expression of LT tolerance genes in vernalization requiring winter habit cultivars Norstar and Warrior wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell) and Kold barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). These cultivars were subjected to 8-h-short day (SD) and 20-h-long day (LD) photoperiods at cold acclimating temperature (4°C) over a period of 0 to 98 d. Final leaf number (FLN) was determined at intervals throughout the acclimation period to measure vernalization status. Photoperiod sensitivity did not affect vernalization as both SD and LD plants reached vernalization saturation at the same time. However, a significant increase in leaf number and delayed double ridge formation between 49 and 98 d under 4°C SD non-inductive flowering condition relative to the LD treatments indicated that SD delayed phenological development. Low-temperature tolerance gene expression as measured by LT₅₀ was influenced before the signal for floral transition as indicated by FLN measurements. Photoperiodic response of SD sensitive winter barley and wheat cultivars was reflected in the level of expression of LT tolerance beginning in the early stages of vernalization and plant development. Subsequent LT acclimation continued for a longer time and to colder temperatures under SD compared to LD. These results support the hypothesis that vernalization and photoperiod responses regulate the expression of LT tolerance genes through their influence on the rate of plant development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aTriticum aestivum 3aacclimation 3acold 3acold tolerance 3aflowering 3agene expression 3agenes 3agrowth habit 3aleaves 3aphenology 3aphotoperiod 3atemperature 3avernalization 3awheat 3awinter 3awinter barley1 aLimin, A.

Patch-burn grazing is a management technique that uses historic grassland disturbance as a model to create heterogeneous grassland composition and structure, providing for the diverse habitat requirements of grassland birds. Though this management technique has been used successfully in relatively extensive grasslands, its utility on smaller grassland patches is less clear. We examined the efficacy of patch-burn grazing to restore habitat heterogeneity and increase grassland bird diversity in relatively small pastures (15–32ha) in a grassland landscape fragmented by cultivation and tree encroachment. In 2006, we established 12 experimental pastures in the Grand River Grasslands of southern Iowa and northern Missouri, with 4 pastures in each of three treatments: 1) patch-burn graze, with spatially discrete fires and free access by cattle (the fire-grazing interaction), 2) graze-and-burn, with free access by cattle and a single burn of the entire pasture every third year, and 3) burn-only, with a single burn of the entire pasture every third year and no grazing. Patch-burn grazing in the first phase of the project (2007–2009) did not generate habitat heterogeneity or significant differences in bird diversity. From 2010 to 2013, stocking rates were reduced to increase residual vegetation in unburned patches at the end of the grazing season to increase heterogeneity. Habitat heterogeneity in patch-burn graze pastures subsequently increased relative to other treatments. Concomitantly, diversity of obligate grassland birds also increased in patch-burn graze pastures and was greatest in 2012 and 2013. We conclude that the fire-grazing interaction can be used to restore habitat heterogeneity and increase grassland bird diversity, even in relatively small grassland patches embedded in a highly fragmented landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3acattle 3afires 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3agrazing management 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3apastures 3apopulation dynamics 3astocking rate 3atrees 3aIowa 3aMissouri 0adiversity 0agrassland birds 0agrazing 0aheterogeneity 0apatch-burn graze 0aprescribed fire1 aMiller, James R.1 aDebinski, Diane M.1 aEngle, D.

However, the processes of conjugating ligands to NPs surface are complicated with low yield. In this study, a hydrophilic shell with excellent biocompatibility was successfully constructed on individual gold NPs or gold nanorods (NRs) by encapsulating NPs or NRs in graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets through electrostatic self-assembly. This versatile and facile approach remarkably decreased the cytotoxicity of gold NPs or NRs capping with surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and provided abundant functional groups on NPs surface for further linkage of polyethylenimine (PEI). The PEI-functionalized GO-encapsulating gold NPs (GOPEI-AuNPs) were applied to delivery DNA into HeLa cells as a novel gene vector. It exhibited high transfection efficiency of 65% while retaining 90% viability of HeLa cells. The efficiency was comparable to commercialized PEI 25 kDa with the cytotoxicity much less than PEI. Moreover, the results on transfection efficiency was higher than PEI-functionalized GO, which can be attributed to the small size of NPs/DNA complex (150 nm at the optimal w/w ratio) and the spherical structure facilitating the cellular uptake. Our work paves the way for future studies focusing on GO-encapsulating, NP-based nanovectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiocompatibility 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3acommercialization 3acytotoxicity 3aencapsulation 3agenes 3agold 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrophilicity 3aligands 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananorods 3ananosheets 3apolyethyleneimine 3asurfactants 3atransfection 3aviability 0agraphene oxide 0agold nanoparticles 0agold nanorods 0agene delivery 0acore/shell materials1 aYang, Darong1 aMei, Lin1 aLu, Bingan1 aChen, Libao1 aLi, Qiuhong1 aZhu, Haizhen1 aWang, Taihong0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2013 Apr. 10, v. 5, no. 7 p.2715-2724dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam400212j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003100164245014500195300001600340520095600356592002801312650002201340650001401362650001701376650001401393650001801407650002101425650001901446650001701465650001301482650001301495650001801508650002501526650003701551650002801588650002901616650003001645650003701675650003001712650003001742650005101772650002601823650003101849650002701880650004101907700002301948700003101971700003102002700002802033773009602061856004802157852000902205655001202214IND4479194820221120190844.0121003e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447919482DNAL7 a220095702pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-011-0770-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrujillo-Villanueva, Karen14aThe sequential exposure to jasmonate, salicylic acid and yeast extract promotes sanguinarine accumulation in Argemone mexicana cell cultures  ap. 379-385.  aThe effects of the sequential application of methyl jasmonate (MeJa), salicylic acid (SA) and yeast extract (YE) to Argemone mexicana cell cultures were compared to either the sole application of each elicitor, or to the three-partite mixture. The highest sanguinarine accumulation occurred using the sequential treatment (ninefold over unexposed control cultures), followed by the single application of YE (fivefold). The elicitor mixture produced less sanguinarine than sole exposure to YE but higher than MeJa alone. SA did not produce any effect. Transcripts corresponding to tyrosine decarboxylase and berberine bridge enzyme accumulated in treated cells, but did not correlate with alkaloid accumulation. Discrete epifluorescence foci, surrounding the nucleus and scattered throughout the cytoplasm of elicited cells, suggested the presence of alkaloid-accumulating vesicles which could participate in a mechanism to avoid sanguinarine toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgemone mexicana 3aberberine 3acell culture 3acytoplasm 3ajasmonic acid 3amethyl jasmonate 3asalicylic acid 3asanguinarine 3atoxicity 3atyrosine 3ayeast extract 2aArgemonexmetabolism 2aBenzophenanthridinesxmetabolism 2aCell Culture Techniques 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aCyclopentanesxmetabolism 2aCytoplasmic Vesiclesxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aIsoquinolinesxmetabolism 2aOxidoreductases, N-Demethylatingxbiosynthesis 2aOxylipinsxmetabolism 2aSalicylic Acidxmetabolism 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aTyrosine Decarboxylasexbiosynthesis1 aRubio-Piña, Jorge1 aMonforte-González, Miriam1 aRamírez-Benítez, Efraín1 aVázquez-Flota, Felipe,0 tBiotechnology letters.g2012 Feb., v. 34, no. 2 p.379-385dSpringer-Verlagx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-011-0770-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03634naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007700168300001600245500001500261520192800276592002802204650001002232650001402242650001102256650001302267650001102280650001002291650001302301650001102314650001102325650001102336650001102347650001302358650000902371650001502380650003002395650001102425650002202436650001302458650001302471651001202484651001202496653001902508653003202527653003102559653002402590653002502614653002702639700002302666700002102689700002102710700002202731700002102753700002102774773012102795856008302916852000902999655001203008IND60524729420221121200331.0190412e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052472942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rama.2016.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrane, Kelly K.10aElk Foraging Site Selection on Foothill and Mountain Rangeland in Spring  ap. 319-325.  a2019-12-06  aPrevious research suggests facilitative grazing by cattle during the preceding summer-fall can enhance spring foraging habitat of Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni). However, previous studies were limited to 1 year or conducted within relatively small experimental pastures. We evaluated elk foraging site selection during spring across 4 years and 59 040 ha of foothill and mountain rangeland in northwestern Wyoming and west-central Montana. Elk in spring avoided foraging in nonforested portions of cattle-grazed pastures where cattle had not grazed during the previous summer−early fall. In contrast, elk selected foraging sites where cattle had grazed lightly (11−30% forage use) or moderately (31−60% forage use), and selection by elk was stronger for moderately grazed sites. Neither moderate nor light cattle grazing intensity were correlated with any other elk habitat attribute that we sampled, and both moderate and light cattle grazing intensity exerted more influence on elk foraging site selection than any other variables, including distance to security cover, distance to primitive roads, distance to improved roads, aspect, or slope. We developed and validated a resource selection model that correctly classified 80−89% of elk foraging observations across five study sites and 4 years. Resource managers can use our model to map predicted changes in elk grazing distribution when considering potential habitat adjustments in security cover, roads, or cattle grazing intensities and distribution. Our results indicate that resource managers can use targeted cattle grazing in summer−early fall to purposely modify elk forage conditions to 1) increase elk foraging efficiency in spring, 2) lure elk away from places needing rest or deferment from spring elk grazing, or 3) lure elk away from places where elk in spring are experiencing conflicts with humans, predators, or other wildlife.  aPublisher supplied data 3aroads 3apredators 3asummer 3apastures 3aforage 3ahills 3amanagers 3aautumn 3ahumans 3acattle 3amodels 3awildlife 3aelks 3arangelands 3aCervus canadensis nelsoni 3aspring 3agrazing intensity 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3aWyoming 3aMontana 0aCervus elaphus 0aresource selection function 0atargeted livestock grazing 0aforage conditioning 0agrazing facilitation 0aCervus elaphus nelsoni1 aMosley, Jeffrey C.1 aMosley, Tracy K.1 aFrost, Rachel A.1 aSmith, Michael A.1 aFuller, Wendy L.1 aTess, Michael W.0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2016 July, v. 69, no. 4 p.319-325dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44569x1550-74247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2016.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245009000203300001600293520131400309592002801623650001901651650002101670650002101691650001201712650002301724650001001747650002201757650001601779650001201795650001601807650001401823650001801837650001501855650001001870651001001880653001901890653002201909653001601931653002101947700005701968700005902025700006002084773014502144856008202289852000902371655001202380IND60625893420221119165353.0190417e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062589342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wep.2018.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerloni, Eva1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0451-866210aAdaptive capacity to climate change in the wine industry: A Bayesian Network approach  ap. 165-177.  aThis study assesses the main factors influencing the behavior of wine producers and the strategies implemented by them with regard to changing climatic conditions. To do so, we adopted a Bayesian Network combining climatic, technical, and economic factors, as well as farmer perception and environmental actions. Based on the scientific literature reviewed, a set of research hypotheses was formulated and compared with empirical evidence collected in the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna. Climatic data, both at the regional and vineyard levels were collected and primary information on wine growing and wine making firms was gathered by means of a producer survey, including 56 wine farms. The results showed that the probability to be negatively affected by the effects of climate change is influenced by structural and technical farm characteristics and by farmer readiness to embrace change. Local climatic conditions, particularly temperature and water surplus, are the factors that most affect both wine production and adaptation behavior in the study area. We conclude that the adoption of focused management and appropriate adaptation strategies, as well as appropriate policies with regard to regulation, incentives and support, are crucial issues for farmers to face the ongoing climatic challenge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aeconomic factors 3afarmers 3afarmers' attitudes 3afarms 3aissues and policy 3aprobability 3asurveys 3atemperature 3avineyards 3awine industry 3awinemaking 3awines 3aItaly 0aClimate change 0aAdaptive capacity 0aWine sector 0aBayesian Network1 aCamanzi, Luca1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0738-62791 aMulazzani, Luca1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2336-93991 aMalorgio, Giulio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6899-88800 tWine economics and policy.g2018 Dec., v. 7, no. 2 p.165-177dElsevier B.V.aUniCeSV, University of FlorencewJournal:21613x2212-97747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wep.2018.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245017900166300001200345520105100357592002801408650002701436650003201463650003101495650001101526650001901537650002001556650001301576653001601589653003801605653001801643653004201661653004201703653003601745700001401781700001801795700001701813700002001830773008501850856008401935852000902019655001202028IND60788802520221122085839.0220919e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078880252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2022.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Li Xia10aTranscriptomic analysis reveals crucial regulatory roles of immediate-early response genes and related signaling pathways in coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus infection  ap. 1-9.  aCoronavirus infection of cells differentially regulates the expression of host genes and their related pathways. In this study, we present the transcriptomic profile of cells infected with gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). In IBV-infected human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells (H1299 cells), a total of 1162 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 984 upregulated and 178 downregulated genes, was identified. These DEGs were mainly enriched in MAPK and Wnt signaling pathways, and 5 out of the 10 top upregulated genes in all transcripts were immediate-early response genes (IEGs). In addition, the induction of 11 transcripts was validated in IBV-infected H1299 and Vero cells by RT-qPCR. The accuracy, reliability and genericity of the transcriptomic data were demonstrated by functional characterization of these IEGs in cells infected with different coronaviruses in our previous publications.

However, whether the thickness variation of the introduced biomimetic layer impacts the behavior of the adhered immune effector cells is yet to be dissected fully. In this study, we used a surface-induced atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) method to synthetize and graft poly-phenoxyethyl methacrylate (PHEMA) brushes having different lengths on the glass substrates. Primary murine peritoneal macrophages were collected and cultured on the PHEMA brushes and we investigated the influence of polymer brushes having different lengths on macrophages phenotype and function. Our results demonstrated that the thicker brushes (200 nm and 450 nm) are superior to the thinner layers (50 nm) for macrophages survival, proliferation, cell elongation and migration. Moreover, the thicker brushes are more beneficial for macrophage’s activities and functions, presented by the increased production of M1-associated cytokines IL-6 and MCP-1, the elevated cell phagocytosis and the activation molecule F4/80 expression, and the reduced macrophages apoptosis in thicker brushes-sustained macrophages. Our data suggests that the thickness of the substrate grafting layer directly impacts macrophages recruitment and pro-inflammatory function, which is important in determining the intrinsic immuno-compatibilities of the surface modified-biomaterials and mediates material-host interactions in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abiomimetics 3acell growth 3aglass 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3amice 3aphagocytosis 3aphenotype 3apolyhydroxyethyl methacrylates 3apolymerization 0aImmune response 0aMacrophage 0aPoly-phenoxyethyl methacrylate (PHEMA) brushes 0aSurface grafting1 aHuang, Tao1 aHu, JiJie1 aZan, Fei1 aLiao, ZhaoHong1 aGu, RuiCai1 aWu, Gang1 aLiao, Hua0 tOpen life sciences.g2020 May 03, v. 15, no. 1 p.198-208dDe GruyterwJournal:23145x2391-54127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biol-2020-00203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245015100171520164800322592002801970650002501998650001702023650001002040650001602050650002002066650001402086650000902100650001102109650001402120653001602134653001602150653002502166653002002191653002002211700005602231700001502287700001702302700001502319700001802334700001502352700002302367700002702390700001802417773009102435856009002526852000902616655001202625IND60780488020221123045135.0220809e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078048802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1353702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ling10aFate and ecological risks of antibiotics in water-sediment systems with cultivated and wild Phragmites australis in a typical Chinese shallow lake  aRiver carrying antibiotics from upstream posed serious threats to receiving lake, and plants might had effects on antibiotics. Therefore, samples of waters, sediments and tissues of cultivated and wild Phragmites australis were collected to analyse antibiotics fate and ecological risks (RQs) in Zaozhadian Lake. Our results revealed that the total antibiotics showed an increasing tendency in surface/pore water and P. australis tissues and a decreasing tendency in overlying water and sediments from the lake entrance to the centre. The bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of two sulfonamides (SAs) and three quinolones (QNs) increased in sediments and decreased in those of erythromycin in pore water from Site 1 to Site 11. Three QNs and two tetracyclines (TCs) were dominant antibiotics in pore water/sediment and surface/overlying water respectively. Higher levels of two SAs in surface/pore water and two macrolides (MAs) in overlying/pore water and sediments were observed in the wild P. australis region, while higher values of two TCs in overlying/pore water and three QNs in sediment were observed in the cultivated P. australis region. Higher BAFs of SAs and QNs in sediments were observed in the cultivated and wild P. australis region respectively. The RQs of oxytetracycline and two MAs posed moderate risks in surface/overlying water from more than 50% of sampling sites. Norfloxacin exhibited moderate RQ and low ∑RQ levels in sediments, and showed high risk in pore water. Our findings imply that much more attention should be given to the antibiotics from river inputs and management normatives to control antibiotic pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhragmites australis 3aerythromycin 3alakes 3anorfloxacin 3aoxytetracycline 3apollution 3arisk 3arivers 3asediments 0aAntibiotics 0aRiver input 0aPhragmites australis 0aBioaccumulation 0aEcological risk1 aBai, Junhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2613-21431 aWang, Chen1 aWei, Zhuoqun1 aWang, Yaqi1 aZhang, Kegang1 aXiao, Rong1 aJorquera, Milko A.1 aAcuña, Jacquelinne J.1 aCampos, Marco0 tChemosphere.g2022 Oct., v. 305 p.135370-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1353703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245010400170300001600274520200500290592002802295650001102323650001402334650002802348650002102376650001802397650001502415650002102430650001102451650001902462650001502481650002002496653002402516653001302540653002602553653002902579653003202608653001302640700001902653773010802672856008802780852000902868655001202877IND60633885820221120130407.0190325e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063388582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2019.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Haifei10aEulerian–Lagrangian flow-vegetation interaction model using immersed boundary method and OpenFOAM  ap. 176-192.  aThis paper presents a novel coupled flow-vegetation interaction model capable to resolve the flow and motion of flexible vegetation with large deflections simultaneously on a hybrid Eulerian–Lagrangian grid. The hydrodynamics model is based on a Navier–Stokes flow solver with the Volume of Fluid surface capturing method in OpenFOAM. The deforming and moving vegetation are tracked through a series of Lagrangian grids attached to the vegetation and embedded in the computational domain of OpenFOAM. The governing equations for the flexible vegetation motion are based on a slender rod theory and are solved by a Finite Element Method on a vegetation-following Lagrangian grid. The hydrodynamics and vegetation models are coupled through the vegetation-induced hydrodynamic forces using a novel diffused immersed boundary method to avoid excessive fluid grid refinements around the vegetation. The standard two-equation k − ε turbulence model is extended for vegetated flow by incorporating additional closure terms of vegetation effects. The newly developed coupled flow-vegetation model is validated against experiments for both individual single-stem vegetation and a vegetation patch in a large-scale wave flume. Model results of asymmetric displacement of the vegetation motion, wave height decay, and wave kinematics within and outside the vegetation patch are in good agreement with measurements. The drastical change in wave radiation stress by the presence of vegetation patch leads to a strong current jet near the top of vegetation patch, which in turn drives a local circulation pattern around the vegetation patch. The effect of vegetation bending stiffness on the model results and empirical drag and inertia coefficients for calculating the hydrodynamic forces are examined in detail. Maximum turbulence energy is observed close to the bed and the top of vegetation patch just before and after the wave crest/trough, where the relative flow velocity to vegetation is large.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aequations 3afinite element analysis 3ahydraulic flumes 3ahydrodynamics 3akinematics 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aturbulent flow 3avegetation 3awater resources 0aFlexible vegetation 0aRANS-VOF 0aFinite element method 0aImmersed boundary method 0aFluid-structure interaction 0aOpenFOAM1 aZou, Qing-Ping0 tAdvances in water resources.g2019 Apr., v. 126 p.176-192dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2019.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02414naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010800173300001800281520098800299592002801287650001301315650001901328650001101347650001401358650000901372650001501381650001501396650001401411650001101425650001101436650000901447650002401456650001901480650000901499650001201508650001501520651001001535653001801545653001301563653001601576653002101592653001801613653001001631700001401641700002601655773012001681856008601801852000901887655001201896IND60582037420221116141801.0200503e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058203742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.07.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamachandra, T.V.10aQuantification of annual sediment deposits for sustainable sand management in Aghanashini river estuary  ap. 1263-1273.  aSedimentation involving the process of silt transport also carries nutrients from upstream to downstream of a river/stream.

This communication is based on field research in the Aghanshini river basin, west coast of India. Silt yield in the river basin and the sedimentation rate assessed using empirical techniques supplemented with field quantifications using soundings (SONAR), show the sediment yield of 1105–1367 kilo cum per year and deposition of sediment of 61 (2016) to 71 (2015) cm. Quantifications of extractions at five locations, reveal of over exploitation of sand to an extent of 30% with damages to the breeding ground of fishes, reduced productivity of bivalves, etc., which has affected dependent people's livelihood.

Water column measurements were carried out from 9⁰N to 21⁰N (stations II-2 to II-14) along 68⁰E transect in the EAS during the beginning of fall intermonsoon (FIM) of 2014. Both in-situ and satellite-derived chlorophyll a (Chl a) showed higher biomass at 15⁰N (station II-8) compared to northern and southern stations. We explored the possible physical processes which can lead to high biological productivity at this station. Our study shows that nearly two times enhancement in Chl a at station II-8 was contributed by an open-ocean front, which occurred two days before the measurement. Based on phytoplankton marker pigments, it was evident that haptophytes were abundant at II-8 with a minor contribution from diatoms and dinoflagellates. This condition also led to a high concentration (4.9 nM) of dimethylsulphide (DMS), an anti-green house gas with a net flux of 3.76 μmol m⁻²d⁻¹ at this site. Among the picophytoplankton, Synechococcus were abundant at this station, however Prochlorococcus were absent as confirmed by both marker pigment and flow cytometric counts. The case study presented here demonstrates the dynamic nature of open ocean fronts and their overall contribution to the productivity of the eastern Arabian Sea during the oligotrophic inter-monsoon period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaptophyta 3aMiozoa 3aProchlorococcus 3aSynechococcus 3abiomass 3acase studies 3achlorophyll 3adimethyl sulfide 3aflow cytometry 3aphytoplankton 3aresearch 3asatellites 3aArabian Sea 0aOcean fronts 0aSea surface temperature 0aPhytoplankton pigments 0aDimethylsulphide 0aEastern Arabian sea1 aChndrasekhararao, A.V.1 aVidya, P.J.1 aShenoy, Damodar M.1 aGauns, Mangesh1 aUskaikar, Hema1 aAparna, S.G.0 tMarine environmental research.g2020 Sept., v. 160 p.105023-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2020.1050233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245013100171300001600302520124800318592002801566650001501594650001701609650001501626650001101641650001401652650001501666650001101681650001801692650000701710650001601717650001301733700002201746773009101768856008301859990002301942852000901965655001201974IND60094549220221120081301.0141104e20110615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009454922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.desal.2011.01.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDebnath, Sushanta10aEquilibrium modeling of single and binary adsorption of Cd(II) and Cu(II) onto agglomerated nano structured titanium(IV) oxide  ap. 330-342.  aAdsorption reactions of Cd(II) and Cu(II) with nanoparticle agglomerates of titanium(IV) oxide (NHTO) were investigated from single and bi-component systems at optimized pH 5.0. Kinetic data of metal ion removal reactions described the pseudo-second order equation very well. Both Langmuir and Redlich–Peterson models described the equilibrium data well (R²>0.95). Values of the monolayer adsorption capacities (mg·g⁻¹) of Cd(II) (49.50 to 60.24) and Cu(II) (42.02 to 52.63) were high, and that increased with increasing temperature on the reactions. Thermodynamic analyses of the equilibrium data suggested that the removal reactions were spontaneous [−∆G⁰, kJ·mol⁻¹=24.31 to 32.73 for Cd(II); and 19.62 to 27.38 for Cu(II)]. Spontaneity of the reactions increased with increasing temperature. Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of either Cd(II) or Cu(II) was less in presence of each other than that of single component systems. The mean adsorption energy estimation suggested that the interaction between either of the metal ions with NHTO was columbic type. About 71 to 75% of adsorbed metal ions could be recovered as the metal oxide from their solutions, which were obtained by the desorption reaction with 0.1M HCl.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adesalination 3adesorption 3aenergy 3aequations 3ametal ions 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apH 3atemperature 3atitanium1 aGhosh, Uday Chand0 tDesalination.g2011 June 15, v. 273, no. 2-3 p.330-342dElsevier B.V.x0011-91647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2011.01.0433Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006300151245010600214500002200320520178600342592002802128650001302156650002902169650001602198650001802214650000902232650001102241653002702252653002602279653001002305653003502315653002602350653003102376700003002407700002302437700001702460773008002477856008502557852000902642655001202651IND60582037520221116141737.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058203752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomlinson, Derek W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4926-986310aUnderstanding complex LNAPL sites: Illustrated handbook of LNAPL transport and fate in the subsurface  aPre-press version  aThe goal of the paper is to highlight the management of the complexities and risks for light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) sites, and how the Illustrated Handbook of LNAPL Transport and Fate in the Subsurface (CL:AIRE, London. ISBN 978-1-905046-24-9. http://www.claire.co.uk/LNAPL; “LNAPL illustrated handbook”) is useful guidance and a tool for professionals to understand these complexities and risks. The LNAPL illustrated handbook provides a clear and concise best-practice guidance document, which is a valuable decision support tool for use in discussions and negotiations regarding LNAPL impacted sites with respect to the risks of LNAPL sites. The LNAPL illustrated handbook is a user-friendly overview of the nature of LNAPL contamination in various geological settings including unconsolidated, consolidated, and fractured rock environments to best understand its fate and behavior leading to the appropriate management and/or remedial approach of the two major risks associated with a LNAPL source. As a source term, LNAPL has chemicals that form dissolved- and vapor-phase plumes, which are referred to as composition-based risks; and being a liquid there is the risk that the source may expand impacting a greater volume of the aquifer, which are referred to as saturation-based risks. There have been significant developments in recent years on the understanding of the complex behavior of LNAPL and associated groundwater and vapor plumes; however, the state of practice has often lagged these improvements in knowledge. The LNAPL illustrated handbook aids the site investigator, site owners, and regulators to understand these risks, and understand how these risks behave through better conceptual understanding of LNAPL transport and fate in the subsurface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3adecision support systems 3agroundwater 3aprofessionals 3arisk 3avapors 0aComposition-based risk 0aSaturation-based risk 0aLNAPL 0aLight non-aqueous phase liquid 0aConceptual site model 0aLNAPL illustrated handbook1 aRivett, M.

Due to limitations in using conventional approaches, cell based regenerative strategies may provide an alternative option to address such issues. In the current study, we sought to determine the osteogenic potential of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) isolated from impacted 3ʳᵈ molars. DPSCs were isolated from human dental pulp tissue (n=6) using explant culture. Growth characteristics of DPSCs were determined using plating efficiency, and the number and time of population doublings. After characterization, DPSCs were induced to differentiate into osteoblasts and were assessed using polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and histological analysis. Results indicated that DPSCs can be isolated from impacted human third molars, and that DPSCs exhibited typical fibroblastic morphology and excellent proliferative potential. In addition, morphological changes, histological analysis and expression of lineage specific genes confirmed osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs. In conclusion, DPSCs isolated from impacted 3rd molars have high proliferative potential and ability to differentiate into osteoblasts.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone formation 3ahistology 3ahumans 3aosteoblasts 3atooth pulp 0ahuman dental pulp stem cells 0aimpacted tooth 0athird molars 0adental pulp 0aosteoblast1 aBalouch, Samira Shabbir1 aRiaz, Nabeela1 aChoudhery, Mahmood S0 tOpen life sciences.g2020 May 06, v. 15, no. 1 p.229-236dDe GruyterwJournal:23145x2391-54127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biol-2020-00233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245013200156300001800288520094800306592002801254650001101282650001201293650001401305650001101319650001901330650001401349650002201363650001901385653001401404653002001418653002001438653001601458653002101474653002501495700002401520700002301544700002201567773012301589856007501712852000901787655001201796IND60527594320170710000000.0160715e20130410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052759432DNAL7 a10.1021/am400364u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosti, Ronny10aStabilized CdSe-CoPi Composite Photoanode for Light-Assisted Water Oxidation by Transformation of a CdSe/Cobalt Metal Thin Film  ap. 2364-2367.  aIntegration of water splitting catalysts with visible-light-absorbing semiconductors would enable direct solar-energy-to-fuel conversion schemes such as those based on water splitting. A disadvantage of some common semiconductors that possess desirable optical bandgaps is their chemical instability under the conditions needed for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, we demonstrate the dual benefits gained from using a cobalt metal thin-film as the precursor for the preparation of cobalt-phosphate (CoPi) OER catalyst on cadmium chalcogenide photoanodes. The cobalt layer protects the underlying semiconductor from oxidation and degradation while forming the catalyst and simultaneously facilitates the advantageous incorporation of the cadmium chalcogenide layer into the CoPi layer during continued processing of the electrode. The resulting hybrid material forms a stable photoactive anode for light-assisted water splitting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acadmium 3acatalysts 3acobalt 3amaterial forms 3aoxidation 3aoxygen production 3asemiconductors 0acatalysis 0awater oxidation 0awater splitting 0asolar fuels 0aelectrochemistry 0acomposite electrodes1 aYoung, Elizabeth R.1 aBulović, Vladimir1 aNocera, Daniel G.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2013 Apr. 10, v. 5, no. 7 p.2364-2367dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam400364u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03247naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245015400169520180400323592002802127650002302155650001402178650001202192650001202204650001402216650001702230650001902247650001402266650002002280650001602300650001302316650001902329650001302348650001002361653001202371653003102383653001502414653002302429653002702452653001202479700001902491700001302510700001902523700001902542773009802561856008502659852000902744655001202753IND60788802820221122142239.0221004e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078880282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2022.1189572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Hong-Rui10aRelease and fate of As mobilized via bio-oxidation of arsenopyrite in acid mine drainage: Importance of As/Fe/S speciation and As(III) immobilization  aMining activities expose sulfidic minerals including arsenopyrite (FeAsS) to acid mine drainage (AMD). The subsequent release of toxic arsenic (As) can have great negative implications for the environment and human health. This study investigated the evolution of secondary products and As speciation transformations during arsenopyrite bio-oxidation in AMD collected from a polymetallic mine. Immobilization of the As solubilized via arsenopyrite bio-oxidation using red mud (RM) was also studied. The results show that the high ionic strength (concentrations of dissolved Fe³⁺, SO₄²⁻, and Ca²⁺ reached values up to 0.75, 3.38, and 0.35 g/L, respectively) and redox potential (up to +621 mV) of AMD (caused primarily by Fe³⁺) enhanced the dissolution of arsenopyrite. A high [Fe]ₐq/[As]ₐq ratio in the AMD favored the precipitation of tooeleite during arsenopyrite bio-oxidation, and the formation of other poorly crystalline products such as schwertmannite and amorphous ferric arsenate also contributed to As immobilization. Bacterial cells served as important nucleation sites for the precipitation of mineral phases. Arsenopyrite completely dissolved after 12 days of bio-oxidation in AMD and the [As]ₐq (mainly present as As(III)) reached 1.92 g/L, while a greater [As]ₐq was observed in a basal salts medium (BSM) assay (reaching 3.02 g/L). An RM addition significantly promoted As(III) immobilization, with final [As(III)]ₐq decreasing to 0.16 and 1.43 g/L in AMD and BSM assays respectively. No oxidation of As(III) was detected during the immobilization process. These findings can help predict As release from arsenopyrite on contact with AMD and, on a broader scale, assist in designing remediation and treatment strategies to mitigate As contamination in mining.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid mine drainage 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3acalcium 3aevolution 3ahuman health 3aionic strength 3aoxidation 3aredox potential 3aremediation 3aresearch 3asolubilization 3atoxicity 3awater 0aArsenic 0aArsenopyrite bio-oxidation 0aSpeciation 0aAcid mine drainage 0aArsenic immobilization 0aRed mud1 aZhang, Duo-Rui1 aLi, Qian1 aNie, Zhen-Yuan1 aPakostova, Eva0 tWater research.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 223 p.118957-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.1189573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005500155245009600210520149100306592002801797650001201825650001901837650001801856650001901874650001101893650001701904650001401921650001501935650002401950650001101974650001401985650001501999650002502014653001502039653001702054653001502071653001902086653002902105700001602134700002702150700005902177700002502236700005702261700002502318773009102343856009002434852000902524655001202533IND60780488420221123045138.0220809e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078048842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1353752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPriya, A.K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0190-982810aHeavy metal remediation from wastewater using microalgae: Recent advances and future trends  aMicroalgae-based wastewater treatment has previously been carried out in huge waste stabilization ponds. Microalgae, which can absorb carbon dioxide while reusing nutrients from sewage, has recently emerged as a new trend in the wastewater treatment business. Microalgae farming is thought to be a potential match for the modern world's energy strategy, which emphasizes low-cost and environmentally benign alternatives. Microalgae are being used to treat wastewater and make useful products. Microalgae, for example, is a promising renewable resource for producing biomass from wastewater nutrients because of its quick growth rate, short life span, and high carbon dioxide utilization efficacy. Microalgae-based bioremediation has grown in importance in the treatment of numerous types of wastewater in recent years. This solar-powered wastewater treatment technology has huge potential. However, there are still issues to be resolved in terms of land requirements, as well as the process's ecological feasibility and long-term viability, before these systems can be widely adopted. Due to cost and the need for a faultless downstream process, it is difficult to deploy this technology on a large scale. Other recent breakthroughs in wastewater microalgae farming have been investigated, such as how varied pressures affect microalgae growth and quality, as well as the number of high-value components produced. In this review, the future of this biotechnology has also been examined.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3abioremediation 3abiotechnology 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3aheavy metals 3alongevity 3amicroalgae 3arenewable resources 3asewage 3aviability 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aMicroalgae 0aHeavy metals 0aWastewater 0aCost-effective 0aEnvironmentally friendly1 aJalil, A.A.1 aVadivel, Sethumathavan1 aDutta, Kingshuk1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8971-46211 aRajendran, Saravanan1 aFujii, Manabu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7319-60141 aSoto-Moscoso, Matias0 tChemosphere.g2022 Oct., v. 305 p.135375-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1353753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02414naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245009600171300001600267520131600283592002801599650001401627650001501641650001101656650002001667650001601687653003201703653002001735653002001755653003901775653002501814700002101839773010701860856008801967852000902055655001202064IND60633886220221120141458.0190425e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063388622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2019.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoussa, Roger10aEvaluating lateral flow in an experimental channel using the diffusive wave inverse problem  ap. 120-133.  aLateral flow L(t) is a major process during flood events, which can be either gains (positive) or losses (negative) to the channel. The inverse problem consists of evaluating L(t) knowing the inflow I(t) and the outflow O(t) on a channel. However L(t) is very difficult to measure on real channels, and we are always not sure to which extent the evaluated L(t) is close to the real one. This paper aims at evaluating L(t) in a channel using the analytical solution of the inverse problem of the Hayami diffusive wave equation (DWE) with L(t) uniformly distributed along the channel. We conceived and built a novel experimental channel where I(t), O(t) and L(t) are highly controlled at 1 s time step and we realize 62 experimental hydrograph scenarios corresponding to different shapes of I(t) and L(t). We validate the hypotheses of both the DWE Hayami model and the corresponding inverse model (with very high criteria functions values for a large majority of scenarios) which reflects the ability of the DWE inverse model to reproduce complex lateral flow hydrograph dynamics. We discuss the limits of application of the DWE especially for short wave lengths. The coupled experimental-modelling approach proposed herein opens promising perspectives regarding the evaluation of lateral flow on real channels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3ahydrograph 3amodels 3awater resources 3awavelengths 0aDiffusive wave equation DWE 0aInverse problem 0aHayami equation 0aUniformly distributed lateral flow 0aExperimental channel1 aMajdalani, Samer0 tAdvances in water resources.g2019 May, v. 127 p.120-133dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2019.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245013500171300001100306520150000317592002801817596006501845650001801910650001101928650001201939650001401951650002201965650001801987650003102005650001402036650001702050650001802067650001602085650001602101651001002117700001802127700002302145700001602168700002302184700002202207773011802229856008102347852000902428655001202437IND60646365720221120171941.0200110e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064636572DNAL7 a10.1186/s13717-019-0173-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuthulakshmi, A.

METHODS: The monthly abundance and distribution of zooplankton and some physico-chemical parameters were investigated in coastal waters near a nuclear power plant, Kalpakkam 2011. Zooplankton and surface water samples collected from three different locations (stations P1, P2 and P3) in the heated and non-heated parts of the coastal waters were analyzed using standard methods. RESULTS: Among all plankton genera in the cooling water, zooplankton was observed most sensitive group to entrainment-induced stress. Thirty genera were identified over the period of the investigation. Zooplankton population followed a trend as P1 > P3 > P2. A clear monthly variation and slight differences among stations were observed in terms of the zooplankton genera. The investigations revealed that changes in zooplankton genera across water bodies could be associated with differing temperature. CONCLUSION: Our results clearly demonstrate that heated water discharge from the Madras Atomic Power Station has a negligible effect on zooplankton population at engineered canal near Plutonium Recycle Project (station P2). There is no impact on zooplankton population due to thermal effluent discharge into the coastal area (stations P1 and P3). Hence, further investigation is required to estimate the impact zone at either side during different seasons.  aPublisher supplied data  a2008/36/93-BRNS/2887cBoard for Research in Nuclear Sciences 3acoastal water 3acoasts 3acooling 3aeffluents 3afishery resources 3anuclear power 3aphysicochemical properties 3aplutonium 3apower plants 3asurface water 3atemperature 3azooplankton 3aIndia1 aNatesan, Usha1 aFerrer, Vincent A.1 aDeepthi, K.1 aVenugopalan, V.

Strategies are needed to reduce costs of crop establishment while maintaining or improving productivity. The objective of this study was to assess the viability of ratooning pigeonpea in maize (Zea mays L.)—pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.) intercropping over four cropping seasons (2012–2015) at Ilonga Research Institute, eastern Tanzania. Two major factors were considered: cropping system (intercropping vs. sole cropping) and tillage (conventional tillage vs. no-tillage), while ratooning (cutting pigeonpea at 30cm and 60cm above ground) was a minor factor. Total grain yields of all intercropped maize and pigeonpea were significantly higher than those of maize and legume in the corresponding sole crop treatments showing a high complementarity between maize and pigeonpea crops. All the intercrop treatments had LER values greater than 1, even in situations where component crop yields were small. Results suggested that a ratooning height of 30cm allowed large maize yields whereas a height of 60cm allowed larger pigeonpea yields, and the choice of ratooning height might depend on the farmer’s objective per season. The tillage system had no significant effect on crop yield. The hypothesis that ratooning pigeonpea is an effective cost reduction strategy that maintains or increases productivity in maize-pigeonpea intercropping was supported. When ratooning was practiced in the intercrops, the seed cost reduction of 23% per season was recorded. Ratooning in sole pigeonpea entailed a larger seed cost reduction from TZS40, 000.00 to TZS13, 333.00 (1US$=TZS2, 000.00) per season representing a reduction of 67%. The cost reduction due to ratooning was significant as generally less than 10% of the smallholder farmers are able to purchase significant quantities of seed. The prevailing cropping systems and general farmers’ resource endowment in eastern Tanzania coupled with the fragmented seed systems especially for legumes provide a greater scope for the wide scale practice of ratooning pigeonpea in maize-pigeonpea intercropping, reducing seed costs while maintaining productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCajanus cajan 3aZea mays 3acontinuous cropping 3aconventional tillage 3acorn 3acost effectiveness 3acrops 3acutting 3afarmers 3agrain yield 3aintercropping 3ano-tillage 3apigeon peas 3aplant establishment 3apurchasing 3aratooning 3aseeds 3aviability 3aTanzania 0aSmallholder farmers 0aRain-fed 0aSeed cost 0aSustainable intensification 0aTillage systems1 aMakoko, Bashir1 aSariah, John0 tField crops research.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 203 p.24-32dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2016.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03392naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245017200167520151500339592002801854650001801882650001501900650002201915650002001937650001201957650001601969650001201985650001301997650002302010650001702033650002002050650002302070650001602093650001702109650001402126650001402140650001902154650000702173650001602180650001302196650001002209650000902219650001902228650001802247650001602265650001102281653002402292653002002316653002102336653003802357653002802395700005302423700001602476700001602492700001402508700001402522700001402536773009802550856008502648852000902733655001202742IND60788803020221120105918.0221004e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078880302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2022.1189622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Shuman10aEfficient remediation of Mn2+ and NH4+-N in co-contaminated water and soil by Acinetobacter sp. AL-6 synergized with grapefruit peel biochar: Performance and mechanism  aElectrolysis manganese slag produced in industrial manganese production causes massive leachate containing heavy metal Mn²⁺ and inorganic NH₄⁺-N, which causes serious hazard to the water body and soil. A cost-effective alternative to address the multiple pollution is urgently needed. This study investigated the synergy of grapefruit peel biochar (BC) and strain AL-6 to remediate Mn²⁺ and NH₄⁺-N in sequencing batch bioreactor (SBR) and soil column. The results showed that, in SBR, under the condition of C/N 5, temperature 30°C, BC and strain AL-6 showed fabulous performance to remove Mn²⁺ (99.3%) and NH₄⁺-N (97.7%). The coexisting ions Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺ had no effects on the removal of Mn²⁺ and COD, however, 23.3% removal efficiency of NH₄⁺-N was curtailed. Characterization found that the presence of MnCO₃ confirmed the adsorption of Mn²⁺ by functional groups action, and gas chromatography indicated that BC and strain AL-6 promoted the reduction of N₂O and organic carbon. In addition, BC and strain AL-6 helped to immobilize 799.41 mg L⁻¹ of Mn²⁺ and 320 mg L⁻¹ of NH₄⁺-N after 45 d in the soil column. And the determination of TOC, CEC, pH, Eh, soil enzymatic activity (catalase and urease), and microbial diversity and abundance confirmed that BC and strain AL-6 increased the soil fertility and bioavailability of pollutants. Totally, BC and strain AL-6 possess great potential to remediate Mn²⁺ and NH₄⁺-N pollution in water and soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aadsorption 3aammonium nitrogen 3abioavailability 3abiochar 3abioreactors 3acalcium 3acatalase 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrolysis 3aenzyme activity 3agas chromatography 3agrapefruits 3aheavy metals 3aleachates 3amanganese 3aorganic carbon 3apH 3aremediation 3aresearch 3aslags 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3asurface water 3atemperature 3aurease 0aMn2+ immobilization 0aWater treatment 0aSoil remediation 0aHeterotrophic nitrifying bacteria 0aGrapefruit peel biochar1 aAn, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1717-52321 aRan, Binbin1 aYang, Zihao1 aXu, Bohan1 aZhao, Bin1 aLi, Zheng0 tWater research.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 223 p.118962-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.1189623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03476naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245014500173300001300318520221400331592002802545650002302573650001302596650003002609650002702639650001402666650001302680650003402693650000902727650001202736650001302748650002002761650001602781700002602797700006602823773010402889856008802993852000903081655001203090IND60633886420221120141425.0190425e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063388642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2019.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLibera, Arianna10aHydraulic conductivity and porosity heterogeneity controls on environmental performance metrics: Implications in probabilistic risk analysis  ap. 1-12.  aHeterogeneities in natural porous formations, mainly manifested through the hydraulic conductivity (K) and, to a lesser degree, the porosity (ϕ), largely control subsurface flow and solute transport. The influence of the heterogeneous structure of K on transport processes has been widely studied, whereas less attention is dedicated to the joint heterogeneity of conductivity and porosity fields. Our study employs Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the coupled effect of K−ϕ spatial variability on the transport behavior (and uncertainty) of conservative and reactive plumes within a 3D aquifer domain. We explore multiple scenarios, characterized by different levels of heterogeneity of the geological properties, and compare the computational results from the joint K−ϕ heterogeneous system with the results originating from generally adopted constant ϕ conditions. In our study, the spatially variable K−ϕ fields are positively correlated. We statistically analyze key Environmental Performance Metrics: first arrival times and peak mass fluxes for non-reactive species and increased lifetime cancer risk for reactive chlorinated solvents. The conservative transport simulations show that considering coupled K−ϕ fields decreases the plume dispersion, increases both the first arrival times of solutes and the peak mass fluxes at the observation planes. A positive correlation between aquifer connectivity and peak mass fluxes is identified for both homogeneous and heterogeneous ϕ. Our conservative transport results indicate that the relevance of ϕ variability can depend on the metric of interest, the control plane-source distance as well as the level of heterogeneity of the conductivity field. The analysis on reactive transport shows that ϕ variability only slightly affects the mean increased lifetime cancer risk at the control planes but leads to a considerable reduction of the cancer risk uncertainty. We also see that the sensitivity of cancer risk towards ϕ heterogeneity can be influenced by the level of variability of the conductivity field, the source-to-control plane distance, but is not affected by the manner in which the contaminant concentration is computed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aaquifers 3aenvironmental performance 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aneoplasms 3aporosity 3aprobabilistic risk assessment 3arisk 3asolutes 3asolvents 3asubsurface flow 3auncertainty1 aHenri, Christopher V.1 ade Barros, Felipe P.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9104-01600 tAdvances in water resources.g2019 May, v. 127 p.1-12dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2019.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012900157300002000286520100800306592002801314650002701342650002201369650002401391650001301415650001001428650002101438650001901459650001801478650001801496650001901514650001901533650001301552650002101565650001801586700001701604700001701621700001201638700001201650700001601662700001901678700001401697773012401711856007401835852000901909655001201918IND60664878820221122162832.0190912e20140226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066487882DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra00179f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Caihua10aCelastrol-modified TiO₂ nanoparticles: effects of celastrol on the particle size and visible-light photocatalytic activity  ap. 12098-12104.  aIn this study, celastrol (CSL), a triterpene compound which is derived from the Chinese medicinal plant Tripterygium wilfordii, was used to synthesize CSL-modified TiO₂ nanoparticles by a hydrothermal treatment method.

The modification of CSL does not alter the crystalline structure of the TiO₂ but can prevent TiO₂ from further aggregating and provides photosynthesis pigments as an in situ dye-sensitizing source. Compared to pure TiO₂, the resulting CSL-modified TiO₂ nanoparticles exhibit enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity and showed an excellent cyclic stability in the decomposition of methylene blue (MB). In addition, the photocatalytic degradations of MB were all demonstrated to follow a first-order kinetic model. The enlarged specific surface area and CSL-modified surface improved the visible-light photocatalytic activity of nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTripterygium wilfordii 3acrystal structure 3ahot water treatment 3akinetics 3alight 3amedicinal plants 3amethylene blue 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotosynthesis 3apigments 3atitanium dioxide 3atriterpenoids1 aLiu, Quanwen1 aGao, Shanmin1 aLi, Kai1 aXu, Hui1 aLou, Zaizhu1 aHuang, Baibiao1 aDai, Ying0 tRSC advances.g2014 Feb. 26, v. 4, no. 24 p.12098-12104dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra00179f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03475naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245009800174300001600272520191000288592002802198650003402226650001702260650002502277650001002302650002002312650001802332650004302350650002002393650001602413650001502429650002802444650001002472651001402482651001102496651001002507651001202517653002702529653002602556653001702582653002202599653001702621653002402638700003702662700002302699700002002722773012402742856008202866852000902948655001202957IND60625894120221119165151.0190530e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062589412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.inpa.2018.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Nattane Luíza10aUsing Support Vector Machines and neural networks to classify Merlot wines from South America  ap. 265-278.  aWines with a clear geographical origin are an issue of interest for consumers and food industries. This paper presents a data mining study of Merlot wines from South America to identify the fingerprint of their geographical origin. A group of samples from Argentina (n = 17), Brazil (n = 12), Chile (n = 48), and Uruguay (n = 6) was analyzed. Twenty chemical compounds were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These compounds include antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, total anthocyanins, individual anthocyanins and color. Four binary classification problems were performed (Brazil versus non-Brazil, Argentina versus non-Argentina, Chile versus non-Chile, and Uruguay versus non-Uruguay) to investigate the geographic characteristics of each country. Through the evaluation of binary classifications in our dataset it was possible to identify the main variables (chemical compounds) that discriminate between the countries. We used the following algorithms: Synthetic Minority over-sample Technique and under-sampling to balance the dataset of each classification approach, the Relief algorithm to obtain a variable importance ranking and the classifiers Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptron and Radial Basis Function Network with dynamic decay adjustment. SVM model obtained the highest performance measures among the classifiers for each dataset (93.73% of accuracy for the Brazil versus non-Brazil, 91.18% for the Argentina versus non-Argentina, 79.16% for the Chile versus non-Chile, and 91.67% for the Uruguay versus non-Uruguay classification). These accuracies were achieved by the search of the possible variable subsets according to Relief for each classification approach. We found that some variables, such as DPPH, wine color and individual anthocyanins, are among the most important variables in the characterization of Merlot wines.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3acolor 3adata collection 3afood industry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aneural networks 3apolyphenols 3aprovenance 3asupport vector machines 3awines 3aArgentina 3aBrazil 3aChile 3aUruguay 0aSupport Vector Machine 0aMultilayer Perceptron 0aAnthocyanins 0aFeature selection 0aMerlot wines 0aSouth America wines1 aLlobodanin, Laura Andrea García1 aCastro, Inar Alves1 aBarbosa, Rommel0 tInformation processing in agriculture.g2019 June, v. 6, no. 2 p.265-278dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23276x2214-31737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.inpa.2018.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03201naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245015800158300001800316520152700334592002801861650002201889650003701911650002401948650001101972650001901983650001402002650002302016650002102039650001502060650001502075650000902090650001502099650001302114650001402127650001402141650001102155650001302166650002402179650003702203653001502240653002602255653002102281653002302302653002102325700001802346700001702364700001502381700001802396700001402414773012302428856007502551852000902626655001202635IND60527594720221118050831.0160715e20130410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052759472DNAL7 a10.1021/am40044782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Yingjing10aPPyNT-Im-PtAu Alloy Nanoparticle Hybrids with Tunable Electroactivity and Enhanced Durability for Methanol Electrooxidation and Oxygen Reduction Reaction  ap. 2752-2760.  aPolypyrrole nanotubes (PPyNTs)/PtAu alloy nanoparticle (NP) hybrids were synthesized in gram-scale by using covalently attached imidazolium moieties as a linker. The approach involves the surface functionalization of PPyNTs with pendant imidazolium moieties (PPyNT-Im), anion-exchange with Pt and Au precursors, and followed by the reduction of metal ions to produce the PtAu alloy NPs on the surface of PPyNTs. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), and elemental mapping showed that both Pt and Au were atomically distributed in the PtAu alloy NPs without phase segregation. The composition of the PtAu alloy NPs can be simply controlled by adjusting the feed ratio in the metal precursor solution. The electrocatalytic properties of prepared PPyNT-Im-PtₓAuy (the suffixes x and y represent the relative molar ratio of Pt and Au in the feed, respectively) NP hybrids were determined by the composition of alloy NPs. The Pt-rich NP hybrids, PPyNT-Im-Pt₈Au₂, showed highly electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the methanol oxidation in both acidic and alkaline solutions, whereas the Au-rich NP hybrids, PPyNT-Im-Pt₂Au₈, showed an enhanced catalytic activity and durability upon oxygen reduction. The present study provided a simple and effective approach for the preparation of PtAu alloy catalysts with controllable composition for high-performance fuel cells and electrochemical sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalloy nanoparticles 3aalloys 3aanion exchange 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3adurability 3afuel cells 3agold 3ametal ions 3amethanol 3ananotubes 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aplatinum 3asensors (equipment) 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aPtAu alloy 0apolypyrrole nanotubes 0aelectrocatalysts 0amethanol oxidation 0aoxygen reduction1 aLiu, Changhai1 aPan, Congtao1 aQiu, Lihua1 aWang, Suidong1 aYan, Feng0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2013 Apr. 10, v. 5, no. 7 p.2752-2760dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam40044783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245007800197300001800275500002000293520167800313592002801991596005602019650001202075650001202087650001402099650001302113650001402126650001302140650001102153650001702164650001102181650001502192650002002207650001802227650001602245650000902261700001402270700001702284700001602301700001602317700001402333700001802347773015102365856007302516852000902589655001202598IND60664334720221122235421.0190910e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066433472DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.61362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Zhenzhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1042-722210aImproved NO removal from flue gas by hydrazine and its mechanism analysis  ap. 3263-3268.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Selective non‐catalytic reduction (SNCR) is a proven technique to lessen nitric oxide (NO) emissions from stationary sources. However, the process using ammonia or urea as a reducing agent is only effective in a narrow and high temperature window, with the maximum NO abatement declining when increasing the oxygen (O₂) content. Large industrial boilers may be often under a variable load and an excess of O₂, which could decrease the effectiveness of the de‐NOx process. This study investigated hydrazine (N₂H₄) as a reagent to improve SNCR performance. RESULTS: NO reduction by N₂H₄ was experimentally investigated in a pilot‐scale flow reactor. The effect of reaction temperature, molar ratio of NH₂ to NO (normalized stoichiometric ratio, NSR), initial NO level and O₂ concentration on the NO reduction in flue gas containing 7.4–17.4% (v/v) O₂ at temperatures between 450 and 1100 °C was determined. The experimental results indicated that NO reduction by N₂H₄ was possible in dual temperature ranges, and the optimum reaction temperatures were about 580 and 1060 °C at NSR = 2.0. Moreover, the N₂H₄–NO reaction is less O₂‐sensitive. A chemical kinetic model was developed to correctly describe the non‐catalytic reduction of NO by N₂H₄ in the presence of O₂. CONCLUSION: Hydrazine‐based SNCR is an alternative method for NO reduction occurring in dual temperature ranges and excess O₂. The present model provided a satisfactory prediction of the experimental results, offering an effective tool for process simulation over a wide range of operating conditions. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  aZZsdl15073cShanghai Municipal Education Commission 3aammonia 3aboilers 3aemissions 3aflue gas 3ahydrazine 3akinetics 3amodels 3anitric oxide 3aoxygen 3aprediction 3areducing agents 3astoichiometry 3atemperature 3aurea1 aHong, Liu1 aGuo, Ruitang1 aPan, Weiguo1 aLi, Fangqin1 aWu, Jiang1 aRen, Jianxing0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2019 Oct., v. 94, no. 10 p.3263-3268dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.61363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01975naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245007700156300001800233520084100251592002801092650001101120650000901131650001801140650001301158650001501171650001901186650001701205653003001222653001901252653001501271653001801286700001301304700001701317700001701334700001801351773012601369856007301495852000901568655001201577IND60527594820221118050814.0160715e20130410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052759482DNAL7 a10.1021/am40049142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Liang10aPorous Conjugated Polymer Nanotip Arrays for Highly Stable Field Emitter  ap. 2761-2766.  aLarge area (26.7 cm²) nanotip arrays of porous conducting poly [5, 10, 15, 20-tetra (4-ethynylphenyl) porphyrin] diyne (TEPPD) have been successfully fabricated by an in situ cross-coupling reaction on the surface of the copper foil, which will open a new routine for large-area nanofabrication of porous conducting polymer on a conducting substrate. The surface-area of TEPPD nanotip arrays is up to 146 m²/ g. Interestingly, the nanotip arrays of TEPPD display a good field-emission property and exhibit a better stability of field emission than that of organic and polymeric nanostructures because of the good heat radiation of porous, which is comparable to some important nanostructures of inorganic semiconductor. The porous conducting polymer could be used for new field-emission emitter and other molecular electronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3afoil 3ananomaterials 3apolymers 3aporphyrins 3asemiconductors 3asurface area 0aporous conjugated polymer 0ananotip arrays 0alarge area 0afield emitter1 aWang, Ke1 aQian, Xuemin1 aLiu, Huibiao1 aShi, Zhiqiang0 tACS applied materials .g2013 Apr. 10, v. 5, no. 7 p.2761-2766dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am40049143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245014900166300001800315500002000333520168000353592002802033596006302061596005802124650001802182650002102200650001202221650002102233650001202254650002002266650001402286650001202300650001202312650001102324650000702335650002002342650001302362650001102375650000902386700001502395700006002410773015102470856007302621852000902694655001202703IND60664334820221123015749.0190910e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066433482DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.61512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFitz‐Binder, Christa12aA second life for low‐grade wool through formation of all‐keratin composites in cystine reducing calcium chloride–water–ethanol solution  ap. 3384-3392.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Coarse low grade wool holds a share of more than 40% of the worldwide production of 1.2 million tons per year. Wool hair with a diameter above 32.5 μm and recycled wool waste represent an important source of high quality keratin. An efficient and simple shaping procedure to form all‐keratin composites could open a new approach to utilise wool keratin for production of sustainable and biodegradable all‐keratin composite. RESULTS: In this work the dissolution and regeneration of wool keratin was studied using a concentrated solution of calcium chloride–water–ethanol as solvent and thioglycolate as reducing agent to open disulphide bonds. Up to 70% of the wool keratin dissolved in the solvent at pH 7, 60 °C. After dilution with water a share of 80% of the total keratin could be obtained as regenerated composite structure while 20% of the protein remains in solution. Based on the model studies, all‐keratin composites were prepared by impregnation of wool with solvent followed by thermal consolidation in a heated press at 60 °C and 2.2–3.3 bar pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The new method for production of all‐keratin composites permits production of a protein‐based bio‐composite, which opens new applications for low value coarse wool and recycled wool waste. By use of cheap chemicals and thermal consolidation in standard equipment scale‐up of the technology is expected to be straightforward and commercially feasible, leading to a bio‐based and biodegradable composite material. © 2019 The Authors.

In the present study, the behavior of cuprous chloride (CuCl) in water solutions was comprehensively investigated, and the medium pH was found to be critical for engineering the reactions and final products. Accordingly, a facile and efficient process based on pH-controlled hydrolysis was designed to fabricate a unique nanostructure, hollow Cu₂O nanocubes. In this process, commercially available CuCl micro-powder is first dissolved in highly acidic water. Then, upon increasing the pH, uniform CuCl nanocubes precipitate and further serve as self-sacrificial templates to produce hollow Cu₂O nanocubes via hydrolysis. The synthesis is fast, takes place at room temperature and is solely based on tuning the medium pH. The product exhibits a homogenous size, well-defined shape, surfactant-free surface and excellent optical properties, indicating that hydrolysis-based synthetic routes can be a powerful method for preparing novel nanostructures on a large scale and at low cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3achlorides 3acopper 3acuprous oxide 3aengineering 3ahydrolysis 3ananomaterials 3aoptical properties 3apH1 aZhou, Yue1 aKulinich, Sergei A.1 aLi, Jia-Jun1 aHan, Li-Li1 aQiao, Shi-Zhang1 aDu, Xi-Wen0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2012 Dec. 4, v. 1, no. 2 p.302-307dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ta00138a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245006400160300002000224520171200244592002801956650002101984650001602005650001302021650003302034650001002067650002202077650001302099650001102112650001402123650001102137650002002148650001902168650001102187650001302198700002002211700003002231773012302261856007402384852000902458655001202467IND60664879020221122232632.0190912e20140519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066487902DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra00181h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLochab, Bimlesh10aNaturally occurring phenolic sources: monomers and polymers  ap. 21712-21752.  aExploration of sustainable alternatives to chemicals derived from petro-based industries is the current challenge for maintaining the balance between the needs of a changing world while preserving nature. The major source for sustainable chemicals is either the natural existing plant sources or waste generated from agro-based industries. The utility of such resources will supplement new processed materials with different sets of properties and environmental friendliness due to their biodegradability and low toxicity during preparation, usage and disposal. Amongst other polymers used on a day-to-day basis, phenolic resins account for vast usage. Replacement of petro-based monomers such as phenol and its derivatives either partly or completely utilized for the synthesis of such resins is ongoing. Extraction of natural phenolic components from cashew nut shell liquid, lignin, tannin, palm oil, coconut shell tar or from agricultural and industrial waste, and their utilization as synthons for the preparation of bio-based polymers and properties obtained are reviewed in this paper. This review article is designed to acknowledge efforts of researchers towards the “3C” motto – not only trying to create but also adapting the principles to conserve and care for a sustainable environment. This review paper describes how extraction, separation and recovery of desired phenolic compounds have occurred recently; how substituted phenol compounds, unmodified and modified, act as monomers for polymerization; and how the presence of sustainable phenolic material affects the properties of polymers. There are about 600 references cited and still there is a lot to uncover in this research area.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acashew nuts 3acoconuts 3aenvironmental sustainability 3ahulls 3aindustrial wastes 3aindustry 3alignin 3apalm oils 3aphenol 3aphenolic resins 3apolymerization 3aresins 3atoxicity1 aShukla, Swapnil1 aVarma, I.

Thermochemical reduction of Ag⁺ ions in the IMC bulk for 30 min at 150 °C led to formation of silver-containing nanocomposites and this fact was confirmed by wide-angle X-ray scattering method. Transmission electron microscopy showed that different sized of silver nanoparticles were formed depending on the chemical structure of IPEC. The average size of silver nanoparticles was found to be 4.7 nm for pectin––Ag–chitosan⁺; 5.3 nm for pectin––Ag–starch⁺; 6.3 for CMC––Ag–β-CD⁺ and 9 nm for starch––Ag–starch⁺, correspondingly. The nanocomposites having smaller average nanoparticle size exhibited higher antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and E. coli strains. Pectin––Ag–chitosan⁺ nanocomposites formed by thermochemical reduction of Ag⁺ ions showed that the diameter of the inhibition zone against S. aureus and E. coli strains was 19.7 and 32.6 mm, respectively, whereas these values were 15.6 and 14 mm, respectively, for the same nanocomposites obtained by chemical reduction using ascorbic acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantimicrobial properties 3aascorbic acid 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3achemical reduction 3achemical structure 3achitosan 3aions 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3apectins 3apolymers 3asilver 3astarch 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awide-angle X-ray scattering 0aInterpolyelectrolyte complexes 0aSilver-containing nanocomposite 0aStructure 0aMorphology 0aThermomechanical properties 0aAntimicrobial activity1 aRiabov, S.1 aSinelnikov, S.1 aRadchenko, O.1 aKobylinskyi, S.1 aRybalchenko, N.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2020 Aug. 15, v. 242 p.116431-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1164313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03454naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245013800152300001800290500002000308520163500328592002801963596005401991596008202045596006902127596005902196596005902255596007902314650001902393650001202412650001402424650001202438650001402450650002302464650002302487650001102510650001302521650002602534650001202560650001102572650001302583650001702596650001602613700001502629700001502644700001702659700001502676773015102691856007302842852000902915655001202924IND60664334920221122191304.0190910e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066433492DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.61072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Jing10aHyper‐cross‐linked polymer based carbonaceous materials as efficient catalysts for ethyl levulinate production from carbohydrates  ap. 3073-3083.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Catalytic upgrading of biomass into various alkyl levulinates has gained wide attention recently. Particularly, ethyl levulinate (EL) shows great potential as gasoline additive and substitute of biodiesel fuels. RESULTS: Hyper‐cross‐linked organic polymer based carbonaceous materials with large surface areas and strong Brϕnsted acidity were synthesized and developed as highly efficient solid acids for the direct transformation of biomass derived carbohydrates into biofuel candidate ethyl levulinate (EL). Controllable Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and proper acid density of as‐prepared carbonaceous materials were demonstrated to be crucial for the successful synthesis of EL. Among the catalysts, α,α′‐dichloro‐p‐xylene derived hyper‐cross‐linked organic carbocatalyst (HDS‐3.6) exhibited the best results for EL formation with the optimal yield of 70.3% at a temperature of 423 K, which was comparable with those of frequently‐used solid acids such as commercial Amberlyst‐15 and metal oxides. The presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in the catalytic system facilitated the production of intermediates 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 5‐ethoxymethylfurfural. Notably, the hyper‐cross‐linked organic polymers with abundant Brϕnsted acid sites were much more effective in the catalytic synthesis of levulinate esters from ketoses. CONCLUSION: The prepared hyper‐cross‐linked organic polymers were efficient and robust catalysts to produce various biomass derived alkyl levulinates with high activity and stability. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFC1901200cNational Key R&D Program of China  a2013B090800026cScience and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province  a2018A030313856cNatural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province  a51606202cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51806226cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aQYZDY‐SSW‐JSC038cFrontier Key Projects of Chinese Academy of Sciences 3aBronsted acids 3aacidity 3abiodiesel 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aesters 3agasoline 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3aketoses 3aoxides 3apolymers 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aZhang, Jun1 aLi, Denian1 aYuan, Haoran1 aChen, Yong0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2019 Oct., v. 94, no. 10 p.3073-3083dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.61073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04101naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245015100178506010400329506007600433520218600509592002802695506003702723650001802760650001102778650001802789650002302807650002102830650001702851650001102868650001402879650001502893650001702908650001702925653001602942653002202958653002202980653003003002653003303032700002503065700002203090700002603112700001803138700002003156700002403176700002203200700006203222700001903284700005403303773009103357856009003448852000903538655001203547IND60780488920221207080952.0220714e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078048892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1353812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJakóbczyk, Paweł10aElectrocatalytic performance of oxygen-activated carbon fibre felt anodes mediating degradation mechanism of acetaminophen in aqueous environments  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCarbon felts are flexible and scalable, have high specific areas, and are highly conductive materials that fit the requirements for both anodes and cathodes in advanced electrocatalytic processes. Advanced oxidative modification processes (thermal, chemical, and plasma-chemical) were applied to carbon felt anodes to enhance their efficiency towards electro-oxidation. The modification of the porous anodes results in increased kinetics of acetaminophen degradation in aqueous environments. The utilised oxidation techniques deliver single-step, straightforward, eco-friendly, and stable physiochemical reformation of carbon felt surfaces. The modifications caused minor changes in both the specific surface area and total pore volume corresponding with the surface morphology. A pristine carbon felt electrode was capable of decomposing up to 70% of the acetaminophen in a 240 min electrolysis process, while the oxygen-plasma treated electrode achieved a removal yield of 99.9% estimated utilising HPLC-UV-Vis. Here, the electro-induced incineration kinetics of acetaminophen resulted in a rate constant of 1.54 h⁻¹, with the second-best result of 0.59 h⁻¹ after oxidation in 30% H₂O₂. The kinetics of acetaminophen removal was synergistically studied by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques, revealing various reaction pathways attributed to the formation of intermediate compounds such as p-aminophenol and others. The enhancement of the electrochemical oxidation rates towards acetaminophen was attributed to the appearance of surface carbonyl species. Our results indicate that the best-performing plasma-chemical treated CFE follows a heterogeneous mechanism with only approx. 40% removal due to direct electro-oxidation. The degradation mechanism of acetaminophen at the treated carbon felt anodes was proposed based on the detected intermediate products. Estimation of the cost-effectiveness of removal processes, in terms of energy consumption, was also elaborated. Although the study was focussed on acetaminophen, the achieved results could be adapted to also process emerging, hazardous pollutant groups such as anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetaminophen 3acarbon 3acarbon fibers 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3aspectroscopy 3asurface area 0aCarbon felt 0aPorous electrodes 0aElectro-oxidation 0aPlasma-chemical treatment 0aAcetaminophen mineralisation1 aSkowierzak, Grzegorz1 aKaczmarzyk, Iwona1 aNadolska, Małgorzata1 aWcisło, Anna1 aLota, Katarzyna1 aBogdanowicz, Robert1 aOssowski, Tadeusz1 aRostkowski, Paweł1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9778-42831 aLota, Grzegorz1 aRyl, Jacek1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0247-38510 tChemosphere.g2022 Oct., v. 304 p.135381-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1353813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245005800184300001800242520161700260592002801877650002301905650001101928650002101939650001001960650001001970650001601980650001401996650003002010650001802040650002202058650001002080650001202090650007702102650002802179650002402207650002402231650002802255650001402283650003402297650001002331700001902341700001702360773009602377856004802473852000902521655001202530IND4451615520221119175943.0121003e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445161552DNAL7 a212590052pmid7 a10.1007/s00284-011-9873-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Sheng-Yong10aPhylogenetic Analysis of Methanogens in the Pig Feces  ap. 1386-1389.  aIn order to assess methanogen diversity in feces of pigs, archaeal 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were constructed from feces of the pig. After the amplification by PCR using primers Met86F and Met1340R, equal quantities of PCR products from each of the five pigs were mixed together and used to construct the library. Sequence analysis showed that the 74 clones were divided into ten phylotypes as defined by RFLP analysis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that three phylotypes were most closely affiliated with the genus Methanobrevibacter (46% of clones). The library comprised 55.4% unidentified euryarchaeal clones. Three phylotypes (LMG4, LMG6, LMG8) were not closely related to any known Euryarchaeota sequences. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the archaea found in the libraries were all clustered into the Euryarchaeota. The data from the phylogenetic tree showed that those sequences belonged to three monophyletic groups. Phylotypes LGM2 and LGM7 grouped within the genus Methanobrevibacter. Phylotypes LGM4, LGM6, LGM8 and LGM9 grouped within the genus Methanosphaera. Other phylotypes grouped together, and formed a distantly related sister group to Aciduliprofundum boonei and species of the Thermoplasmatales including Thermoplasma volcanium and Thermoplasm acidophilum. Our results showed that methanogens belonging to the genus Methanobrevibacter were predominant in pig feces, and that many unique unknown archaea sequences were also found in the library. Nevertheless, whether these unique sequences represent new taxonomic groups and their role in the pig gut need further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanobrevibacter 3aclones 3adigestive system 3afeces 3agenes 3amethanogens 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aArchaeaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aDNA, Archaealxgenetics 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aMethanexmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSwine1 aYang, Cui-Feng1 aZhu, Wei-Yun0 tCurrent microbiology.g2011 May, v. 62, no. 5 p.1386-1389dSpringer-Verlagx0343-86517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-011-9873-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245015100158300002000309520134500329592002801674650001501702650001301717650002801730650001901758650002501777650000901802650002001811650001801831650001401849700001801863700001701881700001401898773012401912856007402036852000902110655001202119IND60664879220221122232613.0190912e20140422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066487922DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra00183d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShukla, R.

The impact of the amount of dispersed nanoparticles (0.01 wt%, 0.05 wt%, 0.10 wt%) on the electro-optical, dielectric and material parameters of the ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLCs) has been demonstrated. The dopant strongly influences the switching characteristics and has an effect on the saturation voltage of the FLC materials. Electro-optical measurements demonstrated that a relatively large (0.10 wt%) LiNbO₃ dopant concentration decreases the response time and saturation voltage by approximately 40% and 25% respectively, compared with non-doped FLCs. The effect of LiNbO₃ nanoparticle concentration on the material and dynamical parameters (i.e. spontaneous polarization, dielectric permittivity, dielectric absorption, dielectric strength, dc conductivity, and rotational viscosity) is presented. The observed behaviours are discussed in terms of capture of impurity ions on the surface of the harvested LiNbO₃ nanoparticles. Ion capturing leads to enhancement of the localized electric field inside the smectic layers. The fast switching response and the low operational voltage of these FLC nanocolloids support their application in nanometric scale electronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acolloids 3adielectric permittivity 3aelectric field 3aelectronic equipment 3aions 3aliquid crystals 3ananoparticles 3aviscosity1 aLiebig, C.

Covering 60,900 ha, pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) stands prevail and cover 51.1% of the total forest area of 119,200 ha in the catchment areas of the River Vorskla’s tributaries. The way oak stands are distributed in regards to trophotopes points at favourable conditions for their growth, as 81.7% of the area is a fresh fertile oak forest site type. Forest stands aged 41–80 years (39.8 % of the total area) and 81–120 years (50.4%) are prevailing. Natural oak stands cover almost 66.5% and planted ones grow at 33.5%. Distribution of oak stands in regards to the functional categories of forests shows a significant predominance of the protective forests. They cover 46.6% of the total area. The commercial forests cover 23.0%, the recreational ones make 18.8% and the forests with conservational, academic, historical and cultural purpose cover 11.6 %. Distribution patterns of oak forests in the catchments of the River Vorskla’s tributaries should be considered in the forest management in order to conserve their biodiversity and enhancing the performance of important environmental, protective, recreational and other functions. The article contains results of the study on the natural regeneration of Quercus robur and other wood species under the canopy of oak stands and on felling sites. The further research perspectives are a thorough study of the stand characteristics and the typological structure of forests in terms of certain wood species in the catchments of rivers all over Ukraine. It will help developing principles for the catchment and landscape zonation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus robur 3abiodiversity 3acanopy 3aforest management 3aforests 3alandscapes 3anatural regeneration 3arivers 3awatersheds 3awood 3aUkraine 0aforest category 0aQuercus robur L. 0aRiver Vorskla 0atributary’s1 aBondar, Oleksandr1 aRumiantsev, Maksym0 tFolia oecologica.g2020 May 01, v. 47, no. 1 p.70-80dSciendowJournal:15705x1338-70147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/foecol-2020-00093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245009200164520180800256592002802064650001502092650001902107650002102126650001502147650001202162650001302174650001302187650001602200650001902216650001902235653003902254653001302293653004902306653002602355653002702381700001602408700001402424700001602438700001502454700005102469700001802520700001402538700005702552700001502609773009802624856008502722852000902807655001202816IND60788803520221120095150.0221004e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078880352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2022.1189692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Yanxi10aThermally assisted efficient electrochemical lithium extraction from simulated seawater  aExtracting lithium electrochemically from seawater has the potential to resolve any future lithium shortage. However, electrochemical extraction only functions efficiently in high lithium concentration solutions. Herein, we discovered that lithium extraction is temperature and concentration dependent. Lithium extraction capacity (i.e., the mass of lithium extracted from the source solutions) and speed (i.e., the lithium extraction rate) in electrochemical extraction can be increased significantly in heated source solutions, especially at low lithium concentrations (e.g., < 3 mM) and high Na⁺/Li⁺ molar ratios (e.g., >1000). Comprehensive material characterization and mechanistic analyses revealed that the improved lithium extraction originates from boosted kinetics rather than thermodynamic equilibrium shifts. A higher temperature (i.e., 60 ᵒC) mitigates the activation polarization of lithium intercalation, decreases charge transfer resistances, and improves lithium diffusion. Based on these understandings, we demonstrated that a thermally assisted electrochemical lithium extraction process could achieve rapid (36.8 mg g⁻¹ day⁻¹) and selective (51.79% purity) lithium extraction from simulated seawater with an ultrahigh Na⁺/Li⁺ molar ratio of 20,000. The integrated thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle can harvest thermal energy in heated source solutions, enabling a low electrical energy consumption (11.3–16.0 Wh mol⁻¹ lithium). Furthermore, the coupled thermal-driven membrane process in the system can also produce freshwater (13.2 kg m⁻² h⁻¹) as a byproduct. Given abundant low-grade thermal energy availability, the thermally assisted electrochemical lithium extraction process has excellent potential to realize mining lithium from seawater.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3aelectric power 3aelectrochemistry 3afreshwater 3alithium 3aresearch 3aseawater 3atemperature 3athermal energy 3athermodynamics 0aElectrochemical lithium extraction 0aSeawater 0aThermally regenerative electrochemical cycle 0aMembrane distillation 0aWaste heat utilization1 aYuan, Ziwen1 aYu, Zixun1 aWang, Cheng1 aZhong, Xia1 aWei, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-29211 aYao, Yuanyuan1 aSui, Xiao1 aHan, Dong Suk1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4804-53691 aChen, Yuan0 tWater research.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 223 p.118969-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.1189693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03700naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245010500173520209900278592002802377650002302405650001502428650001302443650001702456650001402473650001902487650001502506650001102521650002002532650001502552650001502567650001102582650001102593650001902604650001502623651001002638653002602648653001502674653004502689653001702734653001902751700001902770700001702789700001702806700001502823700001702838700001502855700001602870700001402886700001702900700001502917773009102932856009003023852000903113655001203122IND60780489020221120071629.0220809e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078048902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1353822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Hezhong10aTracing the sources of phosphorus in lake at watershed scale using phosphate oxygen isotope (δ18OP)  aPhosphorus (P) is normally considered as the limited nutrient for shallow freshwater lakes and can potentially trigger eutrophication on account of high concentrations. Due to the various transportation and transformation processes, P source apportionment and management in lake ecosystems have become more and more difficult. Combining with sequential extraction of P fractions and mineralogical analysis, the isotopic compositions of oxygen in phosphate (δ¹⁸OP) of resin-extractable P from the different samples including soil, estuary sediments, pond sediments, and lake sediments in the Shijiuhu Lake catchment, China, were investigated. The results showed that δ¹⁸OP values ranged from +15.23 to +21.92‰ in agricultural soil, +16.53 to +24.10‰ in estuary sediments, +18.90 to +20.90‰ in pond sediments, and +17.42 to +19.70‰ in lake sediments. Isotopic signatures indicated that chemical fertilizers with heavier δ¹⁸OP values (+20.70 to +26.50‰) were the predominant contributors of P in the soil. The river transportation together with Fe/Al–P desorption on anaerobic condition simultaneously stimulated the enrichment of P in the lake sediments, even though the biotic activity regulated the isotope values moving toward the equilibrium. Eroded soil was the important source of P in lake and pond sediments via drainage and runoff, and conserved the source isotope signal in the samples. Stronger biotic activity in the aquatic environments dragged δ¹⁸OP values toward the equilibrium. However, conspicuous off-equilibrium isotope signature suggested the terrestrial sources in the aquatic ecosystems. The calculation of two end-member linear mixing models suggested that soils also predominantly controlled the P occurrence in the lake sediments with contribution higher than 80%, indicating that decreasing inputs from the agricultural activities is important in P reduction on catchment scale. Generally, δ¹⁸OP from different sources can provide indirect and important evidences for the identification and management of P sources in the lake catchment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3adesorption 3adrainage 3aeroded soils 3aestuaries 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater 3aoxygen 3aoxygen isotopes 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3arivers 3arunoff 3atransportation 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aSource identification 0aPhosphorus 0aIsotopes of oxygen in phosphate (δ18OP) 0aContribution 0aLake catchment1 aWang, Haixiang1 aDong, Azhong1 aZhou, Yanwen1 aHuang, Rui1 aYin, Hongbin1 aZhang, Lei1 aLiu, Enfeng1 aLi, Qiang1 aJia, Binchan1 aCai, Yiwei0 tChemosphere.g2022 Oct., v. 305 p.135382-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1353823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03482naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245018800201300001800389500002000407520186700427592002802294596004002322596006402362596003902426650002502465650002402490650001102514650001902525650002402544650002802568650003202596650001302628650001702641650001202658650002602670650001002696700001802706700001902724700006002743773015102803856007302954852000903027655001203036IND60664335120221122220601.0190910e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066433512DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.61292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoopnarain, Ashira1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8866-304910aNew insights into the metagenomic link between pre‐treatment method, addition of an inoculum and biomethane yield during anaerobic digestion of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes)  ap. 3217-3226.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) is a fast growing water weed that threatens the aquatic ecosystem and human activities, hence control of the plant is essential. One such control approach is to harvest and utilize hyacinth as a substrate for anaerobic digestion (AD). Various factors influence AD performance, including substrate pre‐treatment and microbial community composition, amongst others. This study was aimed at establishing the link between method of substrate pre‐treatment, microbial diversity, inoculum addition and biogas yield during AD of hyacinth. RESULTS: The addition of an inoculum resulted in microbial community stability and early biomethane production of up to 0.4 L irrespective of pre‐treatment method. However, cultures that lacked inoculum showed distinct microbial community structure variation in response to pre‐treatment method, and minimal early biomethane production (up to 0.1 L). Biogas produced by cultures lacking inoculum was initially mostly composed of carbon dioxide (up to 100% of total biogas), but as digestion proceeded, an increase in biomethane production was observed (up to 60% of total biogas), which correlated with the shift in microbial community structure and increased microbial diversity. This indicates the presence of biogas‐producing microorganisms associated with the collected hyacinth. Canonical correspondence analysis proved that dynamic changes in microbial community structure and biogas yield were strongly correlative. CONCLUSION: This study proves that hyacinth pre‐treatment influences microbial community structure and concomitant biogas yield in the absence of an inoculum. The addition of an inoculum aids in stability of microbial community structure and biogas yield irrespective of method of hyacinth pre‐treatment. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a96735cNational Research Foundation  aRCN 234203cSouth Africa ‐ Norway Research Co‐operation  aK5/2543cWater Research Commission 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3acarbon dioxide 3acommunity structure 3acorrespondence analysis 3agas production (biological) 3ainoculum 3ametagenomics 3amethane 3amicrobial communities 3aweeds1 aNkuna, Rosina1 aNdaba, Busiswa1 aAdeleke, Rasheed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8974-422X0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2019 Oct., v. 94, no. 10 p.3217-3226dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.61293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245012200160300001600282520119700298592002801495650004401523650001201567650001801579650002301597650001801620650002501638650001901663650001101682650001901693650000901712650001801721650001801739650002101757650002201778650002101800653003201821653002501853653002601878653002101904700002001925700001701945700002001962700001601982773009901998856007702097852000902174655001202183IND60695109520221120132009.0210802e20200526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069510952DNAL7 a10.1515/hf-2018-02952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yinling10aEffect of enzymatic hydrolysis lignin on the mechanical strength and hydrophobic properties of molded fiber materials  ap. 469-475.  aIn this study, poplar chemi-mechanical pulp was used as a raw material to investigate the effect of enzymatic hydrolysis lignin (EHL) content on the tensile strength and hydrophobicity of molded fiber materials (MFMs). The tensile strength and hydrophobic properties of the fabricated MFMs with different EHL contents were evaluated, and changes in their microstructure, chemical structure, and thermal stability were characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, respectively. Results show that under the experimental conditions used herein, the addition of EHL could increase the tensile strength and surface water contact angle of MFMs up to 20.3 MPa and 95.0°, respectively. The SEM observations indicate that the addition of EHL expanded the contact area between the EHL and fibers, thereby reducing the holes between fibers. The FTIR and TG analyses indicated that hot-pressing degraded EHL to form small molecular substances and improved the reaction with aldehydes produced via carbohydrate degradation, improving both the inter-fiber bonding strength and hydrophobicity of the MFM surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPopulus 3acarbohydrates 3achemical structure 3acontact angle 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3alignin 3amicrostructure 3apulp 3araw materials 3asurface water 3atensile strength 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 0aenzymatic hydrolysis lignin 0ahydrophobic property 0amolded fiber material 0atensile strength1 aXiao, Shengling1 aYue, Jinquan1 aZheng, Dingyuan1 aCai, Liping0 tHolzforschung.g2020 May 26, v. 74, no. 5 p.469-475dDe GruyterwJournal:1940x1437-434X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hf-2018-02953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03691naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245008000168300001400248520239100262592002802653650001402681650001502695650002102710650001302731650001902744650002102763650001502784650001302799650003302812650001502845653001402860653001702874653002402891653001302915653001402928653004202942700002002984700001803004700001903022700002603041773007403067856008303141852000903224655001203233IND60553817820221118003559.0161023e20150315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055381782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2014.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiazik, Joanna14aThe versatile electron microscope: An ultrastructural overview of autophagy  ap. 44-53.  aBoth light microscopy (LM) and electron microscopy (EM) are able to reveal important information about the formation and function of various autophagic compartments. In this article we will outline the various techniques that are emerging in EM, focusing on analyzing three-dimensional morphology, collectively known as volume electron microscopy (volume EM), as well as on methods that can be used to localize proteins and antigenic epitopes. Large cell volumes can now be visualized at the EM level by using one of the two complementary imaging techniques, namely Serial Block-face Scanning Electron Microscopy (SB-SEM) or Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM). These two block-face imaging methods reveal ultrastructural information from all membrane-bound organelles such as autophagic compartments to be visualized in a three-dimensional space, in association with their surrounding organelles. Another method which falls into the volume EM category is dual-axis electron tomography (ET). This method is more suited to reconstructing smaller volumes from areas of interest that require nano-structural detail to be confirmed such as membrane contact sites (MCSs) between autophagic compartments and various organelles. Further to this, to complement the morphological identification of autophagic compartments, immunolabeling can be carried out at the EM level to confirm the nature of various autophagic compartments depending on the localization of various antigens at a sub-cellular level. To determine this, various immunolabeling techniques can be carried out, namely the pre-embedding or the post-embedding immunolabeling methods. Examples of both of these methods will be described in this chapter. Correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM) can be used to visualize the same autophagic organelles under the LM, followed by high-resolution imaging under the EM. Finally, cryofixation has revolutionized the EM field by allowing rapid immobilization of cells and tissue in the near native state, so samples are no longer prone to artefacts induced by chemical fixation. Collectively, this chapter will discuss the aforementioned capabilities of the EM in more detail, with a particular focus on autophagy, namely the impact of EM in the study of the morphology and biogenesis of the phagophore/isolation membrane (referred to as the phagophore hereafter).  aPublisher supplied data 3aautophagy 3abiogenesis 3acryopreservation 3aepitopes 3aimage analysis 3alight microscopy 3aorganelles 3aproteins 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atomography 0aAutophagy 0aCryofixation 0aElectron tomography 0aImmunoEM 0aVolume EM 0aCorrelative light-electron microscopy1 aVihinen, Helena1 aAnwar, Tahira1 aJokitalo, Eija1 aEskelinen, Eeva-Liisa0 tMethods.g2015 Mar. 15, v. 75 p.44-53dElsevier Inc.x1046-20237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2014.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03898naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245015400164300001800318500002000336520192100356592002802277596009702305596005902402596004902461650001302510650002402523650001102547650001302558650002402571650002102595650002202616650001102638650001302649650000902662650001402671650002302685650001602708650002602724650002502750650001802775650001402793650001902807650001102826650002502837650002502862700002102887700002102908700001702929700001802946700001802964700002002982700006103002773015103063856007303214852000903287655001203296IND60664335220221122220630.0190910e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066433522DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.61202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz Viggi, Carolina10aMagnetite nanoparticles enhance the bioelectrochemical treatment of municipal sewage by facilitating the syntrophic oxidation of volatile fatty acids  ap. 3134-3146.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Microbial electrochemical technologies (METs) represent a novel platform to harvest the energy trapped in municipal wastewater. At the anode of METs, electro‐active bacteria (EAB) anaerobically oxidize wastewater constituents using the electrode as the terminal electron acceptor and, by so doing, generate an electric current. To convert complex wastewater constituents into electricity, EAB must not only establish syntrophic relationships with other members of the microbial community, but also compete with methanogens for consumption of hydrogen and acetate. Here, we examined the addition of magnetite nanoparticles (NPs) (250 mg Fe L⁻¹) as a novel strategy to manipulate such metabolic interactions and in turn maximize the efficiency of wastewater treatment and the yield of electric current generation. RESULTS: Batch experiments carried out either in the presence of a mixture of volatile fatty acids or of a synthetic sewage demonstrated that magnetite addition accelerate the rate of electrogenic oxidation of specific compounds, particularly propionate (up to 120%), an intermediate which frequently accumulates during anaerobic treatment processes, while correspondingly enhancing electric current generation (up to 90%), and diminishing the rate of competing methane generation (up to 50%). Notably, the composition of the microbial community was not substantially affected by the presence of magnetite nanoparticles, possibly suggesting that these latter facilitated extracellular electron transfer mechanisms (among microbes and with the electrode), rather than enriching conditions for specific microorganisms. CONCLUSION: The addition of magnetite NPs may represent a practical strategy to kick‐start a bioelectrochemical system designed for wastewater treatment and improve the effectiveness of electrogenic substrate oxidation processes. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  aLR11ES31cMESRS (Ministry of High Education and Scientific Research of the Tunisian Republic  cMIUR (the Italian Ministry of University and Research)  aERANETMED_NEXUS‐14‐035cWE‐MET Project 3aacetates 3aanaerobic treatment 3aanodes 3abacteria 3abioelectrochemistry 3aelectric current 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3airon 3amagnetite 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3amunicipal wastewater 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3apropionic acid 3asewage 3avolatile fatty acids 3awastewater treatment1 aCasale, Stefania1 aChouchane, Habib1 aAskri, Refka1 aFazi, Stefano1 aCherif, Ameur1 aZeppilli, Marco1 aAulenta, Federico1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6819-79440 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2019 Oct., v. 94, no. 10 p.3134-3146dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.61203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006600147245011000213300001800323520107100341592002801412650002001440650001201460650001801472650001701490650000901507650001001516650000901526650001401535650001601549650002201565650001301587650002101600650001901621650000901640650001501649651000901664700002401673773016301697856008201860852000901942655001201951IND60646366520221120141001.0190816e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064636652DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-018-1725-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSafari Sinegani, A.

The samples were obtained from four sites of water entrance to the lake using a sequential extraction method. The soil sampled from the release site of wastewater of sodium sulfate plant had the lowest total heavy metal contents compared to other sites. Although the HNO₃ extractable fraction was the most important phase for the four heavy metals, this fraction in salty soils was not the main fraction for Cd. The KNO₃ extractable and bioavailability and contamination factor (CF) of the heavy metals were considerably high in the salt-affected soils. The NaOH extractable Fe of the non-salty soils was higher than that of the salty soils. The order of metal reactivity assessed by CF in the studied soils was observed to be Cd > Pb > Mn ≫ Fe. However, the increasing effect of salinity on promoting the metal-soluble and exchangeable form (mobility) followed the order of Cd > Mn > Pb ≫ Fe.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3afractionation 3aheavy metals 3airon 3alakes 3alead 3amanganese 3anitric acid 3apotassium nitrate 3asalinity 3asodium hydroxide 3asodium sulfate 3asoil 3awastewater 3aIran1 aSafari Sinegani, M.0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2019 July, v. 16, no. 7 p.3297-3308dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2208x1735-14727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-018-1725-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011700173520099200290592002801282650002201310650001601332650001401348650002401362650001201386650002001398650001501418650002101433650001301454650002501467650001301492653000801505653000701513653000701520653000801527653000801535653001101543653000901554653000901563653001101572653000701583653000901590653002301599653001101622653001601633653001601649653001201665653002701677653001401704653001701718700002301735700001901758700003001777773010901807856008601916852000902002655001202011IND60696045420221119185906.0200614e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069604542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1164412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdallah, Maha M.10aHyaluronic acid and Chondroitin sulfate from marine and terrestrial sources: Extraction and purification methods  aHyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) are valuable bioactive polysaccharides that have been highly used in biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. Extensive research was done to ensure their efficient extraction from marine and terrestrial by-products at a high yield and purity, using specific techniques to isolate and purify them. In general, the cartilage is the most common source for CS, while the vitreous humor is main used source of HA. The developed methods were based in general on tissue hydrolysis, removal of proteins and purification of the target biopolymers. They differ in the extraction conditions, enzymes and/or solvents used and the purification technique. This leads to specific purity, molecular weight and sulfation pattern of the isolated HA and CS.

The permeation behaviors were measured by the pure water flux and the solute rejection. The thermal stability of the UF membranes was observed by measuring the relative ratio of the permeate flux (Jₜ)/pure water flux(J₀). The relative flux for the poly (ethyleneglycol) (PEG, MW 2.0×10⁴) aqueous increased with increasing operation temperature and the performances of the CPI membranes treated with common organic solvents had the same values. The CPI membranes were easy to fabricate, because CPIs dissolved well in aprotic polar solvents. The preparation conditions and operation method proposed herein could play an important role in the permeation properties of the UF membranes. Further, the CPI membranes exhibited outstanding resistance to common organic solvents as well as thermal stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesalination 3aimides 3asolutes 3asolvents 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3aultrafiltration0 tDesalination.g2012 June 15, v. 296 p.46-52dElsevier B.V.x0011-91647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2012.04.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03258naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245010500165300001600270500000900286520175400295592002802049650002502077650002502102650002002127650002102147650001102168650001602179650001902195650001202214650001702226650001202243650001402255650001702269650002802286650001002314650001602324700001802340700001402358700001502372700001702387700002202404700001902426700002302445700001702468700001402485700001802499773012102517856008102638852000902719655001202728IND60665853220221118003953.0191228e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066585322DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2005.02472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorsley, R. D.10aIdentification of QTLs Associated with Fusarium Head Blight Resistance in Barley Accession CIho 4196  ap. 145-156.  aepub  aFusarium head blight (FHB), incited by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe [teleomorph Gibberella zea (Schwein)], reduces quality of harvested barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) because of blighted kernels and the presence of deoxynivalenol (DON), a mycotoxin produced by the pathogen. CIho 4196, a two-rowed type, is one of the most resistant accessions known in barley; however, it possesses many undesirable agronomic traits. To better understand the genetics of reduced FHB severity and DON accumulation conferred by CIho 4196, a genetic map was generated using a population of recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between Foster (a six-rowed malting cultivar) and CIho 4196. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses were performed using data obtained from 10 field environments. The possible associations of resistance QTLs and various agronomic and morphological traits in barley also were investigated. The centromeric region of chromosome 2H flanked by the markers ABG461C and MWG882A (bins 6–10) likely (P < 0.001) contains two QTLs contributing to lower FHB severity and plant height, and one QTL each for DON accumulation, days to heading, and rachis node number. The QTL for low FHB severity in the bin 8 region explained from 3 to 9% of the variation, while the QTL in the bin 10 region explained from 17 to 60% of the variation. A QTL for DON accumulation that explained 9 to 14% of the variation was found in the bin 2 region of chromosome 4H. This may represent a new QTL not present in other FHB resistant sources. Resistance QTLs in the bin 8 region and bin 10 region of chromosome 2HL were provisionally designated Qrgz-2H-8 and Qrgz-2H-10, respectively. The QTL for DON accumulation in chromosome 4H was provisionally named QDON-4H-2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium graminearum 3aFusarium head blight 3aHordeum vulgare 3aagronomic traits 3abarley 3achromosomes 3adeoxynivalenol 3aheading 3ainbred lines 3amalting 3apathogens 3aplant height 3aquantitative trait loci 3aseeds 3ateleomorphs1 aSchmierer, D.1 aMaier, C.1 aKudrna, D.1 aUrrea, C.

Crantz] is an alternative oil crop that has potential in aquaculture and food production. However, glucosinolates (GSs) in camelina seed and meal constrain their application in human and animal consumption. Glucosinolates are plant secondary metabolites commonly found in the Brassicaceae family. The aims of this study were to determine whether nitrogen (N) alone or in combination with sulphur (S) application affected GS concentration in camelina seeds, as well as whether different genotypes differed in GS concentrations. Our results showed that the application of 25 kg S ha⁻¹ significantly increased GS content compared with 0 kg S ha⁻¹. Applied N rates were negatively correlated with the amounts of total and individual GSs when no S was applied. The low GS content with high N rates was probably due to a dilution effect of S content. Applied N rates did not affect the amounts of total and individual GSs when 25 kg S ha⁻¹ was applied. Seed protein content was negatively correlated with the total GSs depending on growing season and genotype when no S was applied. The cultivar, Calena, had the highest amount of GSs among five genotypes. The results indicated that GSs in camelina can be manipulated by cultural management practices including N and S application.  aPublisher supplied data  cAtlantic Innovation Fund  cGenome Atlantic 3aCamelina sativa 3aaquaculture 3acultivars 3afood production 3agenotype 3aglucosinolates 3ahumans 3anitrogen 3aoil crops 3aprotein content 3asecondary metabolites 3asulfur1 aLi, Jili1 aCaldwell, Claude D.0 tCrop science.g2016 Nov., v. 56, no. 6 p.3250-3262dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2016.01.00183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009300168300001600261520169900277592002801976650001002004650001502014650002402029650002302053650001802076650002002094650001302114650001902127650002402146700005902170700002302229700001802252773010702270856008502377852000902462655001202471IND60645393420221120150957.0200612e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064539342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2019.05.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKukkala, Aija10aIdentifying national responsibility species based on spatial conservation prioritization  ap. 411-419.  aThe concept of National responsibility species (NRS) was developed to coordinate the conservation efforts of species occurring in multiple countries. Calculated as the fraction of the global species' distribution within a country, it measures the contribution of a local population to global survival of the species. However, there may be more co-occurring species in one region than another, making the conservation of a species more cost-efficient in the first than the latter. If cost-efficient resource allocation is the goal, then identifying NRS should also be based on spatial priorities. We propose that a species is considered NRS when a large part of its distribution falls within high priority areas in a country. We identify NRS from spatial conservation prioritization outputs to (1) maximize the overall cost-efficiency of allocation of conservation resources and (2) to provide information about which species the spatial priorities are based on. We analyzed data on vertebrates in the Birds and Habitats directives in the EU28 countries and compared the traditional NRS measure to three alternative strategies. While the majority of species maintained their NRS status in most countries regardless of the approach, differences occurred, with varying numbers and identities of responsibility species in a country, or responsibilities for species shifting between countries. The differences were largest in geographically marginal countries and for species that were distributed across a few countries. Other NRS approaches may also be useful, and the choice of approach should ultimately depend on the purpose and complement information on conservation status in decision-making.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3acomplement 3aconservation status 3acost effectiveness 3adata analysis 3adecision making 3ahabitats 3aprioritization 3aresource allocation1 aMaiorano, Luigi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2957-89791 aThuiller, Wilfried1 aArponen, Anni0 tBiological conservation.g2019 Aug., v. 236 p.411-419dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2019.05.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006400153245013700217300001600354520103000370592002801400650001101428650001301439650002301452650002001475651001701495651001901512653001801531653001201549653001801561653001401579700002001593700002101613700002101634700001901655700001801674700002601692700002401718700002501742700002301767700002301790700002501813700002101838700002001859700002001879773011301899856008802012852000902100655001202109IND60583722820221121043455.0190318e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058372282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.10.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArcangeli, Antonella1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2156-998710aAmount, composition, and spatial distribution of floating macro litter along fixed trans-border transects in the Mediterranean basin  ap. 545-554.  aMarine litter is a major source of pollution in the Mediterranean basin, but despite legislative requirements, scant information is available for the ongoing assessment of this threat.Using higher size classes as proxy for litter distribution, this study gave a synoptic estimation of the amount, composition, and distribution of floating macro-litter in the Mediterranean. The average amount of macro-litter was in a range of 2–5items/km2, with the highest in the Adriatic basin. Seasonal patterns were present in almost all study areas and were significant in the Ligurian Sea, Sardinian-Balearic basin, and Central Tyrrhenian Sea. Plastic accounted for >80% of litter in all areas and seasons, with the highest proportion in the Adriatic Sea, Ligurian Sea, and Sicilian-Sardinian Channels; in the Bonifacio Strait, Tyrrhenian Sea, and Sardinian-Balearic basin, litter composition was instead more diverse. Spatial analysis suggested an almost homogeneous distribution of litter without evident regular aggregation zones.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aplastics 3aseasonal variation 3awater pollution 3aAdriatic Sea 3aTyrrhenian Sea 0aMarine litter 0aPlastic 0aMediterranean 0aPollution1 aCampana, Ilaria1 aAngeletti, Dario1 aAtzori, Fabrizio1 aAzzolin, Marta1 aCarosso, Lara1 aDi Miccoli, Valentina1 aGiacoletti, Antonio1 aGregorietti, Martina1 aLuperini, Cristina1 aParaboschi, Miriam1 aPellegrino, Giuliana1 aRamazio, Martina1 aSarà, Gianluca1 aCrosti, Roberto0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2018 Apr., v. 129, no. 2 p.545-554dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.10.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01489naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245009600162300001800258520026500276592002800541650001200569650002300581650002700604650002600631650001300657650002200670650000900692650002200701650001400723700002200737700002300759700002200782700002100804700002400825700002600849773013300875856007401008852000901082655001201091IND60659860820221119030108.0190823e20130523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065986082DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc42301h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkobelev, Igor Y.10aEfficient epoxidation of olefins by H₂O₂ catalyzed by iron “helmet” phthalocyanines  ap. 5577-5579.  aHigh yields of epoxides were obtained in the oxidation of a large range of olefins using 1.2–2 equiv. of H₂O₂ in the presence of iron helmet phthalocyanines.

This study evaluated whether green tea polyphenols (GTP) can avert fibrosis or vascular disruption along with mechanisms in rats with chronic inflammation. Forty 3-month-old female rats were assigned to a 2 (placebo vs. lipopolysaccharide, administration) x 2 (no GTP vs. 0.5% GTP in drinking water) factorial design for 12 weeks. Masson's trichrome staining evaluated myocardial fibrosis in coronary vessels and surrounding myocardium. Whole blood specimens were counted for differentials. Spleen TNF-alpha mRNA expression was determined by real-time RT-PCR. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by mean separation procedures. After 12 weeks, lipopolysaccharide administration induced myocardial fibrosis in vessels and surrounding myocardium, spleen TNF-alpha mRNA expression, and leukocytes, while GTP supplementation in drinking water significantly averted such observation. GTP attenuates myocardial fibrosis through a suppression of chronic inflammation and innate immune responses. 3aanalysis of variance 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acardiomyopathy 3achronic diseases 3acoronary vessels 3adisease prevention 3adrinking water 3afibrosis 3agene expression 3agreen tea 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3aleukocytes 3amessenger RNA 3amyocardium 3aplacebos 3apolyphenols 3arats 3aspleen 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avasculitis 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aDietary Supplements 2aFemale 2aFibrosisxpathology 2aFlavonoidsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aHeartxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aInflammationxprevention & control 2aMyocardiumxpathology 2aPhenolsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aPolyphenols 2aRandom Allocation 2aRats 2aTeaxchemistry 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aSamathanam, Christina1 aTatum, Owatha1 aGraham, Suzanne1 aTubb, Christine1 aCao, Jay J.1 aDunn, Dale M.1 aWang, Jia-Sheng0 tInflammation research .g2011, v. 60, no. 7 p.665-672wJournal:jnl4237776x1420-908X7nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/569543Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00011-011-0320-y  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/HNRC1700.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245013400156520139600290592002801686650002101714650001401735650001201749650001101761650001601772650001001788650001701798651001001815700001701825700001601842700002001858700001401878773012001892856007402012852000902086655001202095IND60780924320221119032644.0220623e20220611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078092432DNAL7 a10.3390/f130609122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Huilin 10aModeling Primary Branch Diameter and Length for Planted Pinus koraiensis by Incorporating Neighbor Competition in Northeast China  aKorean pine (Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et Zucc.) is the most important forest vegetation in northeast China. The timber quality of this tree species is largely driven by branch growth and distribution within the crown. Thus, developing branch diameter and length models, especially those that include competition indices, is essential. A total of 48 Korean pine trees were selected to conduct destructive measurements of branch characteristics. This was carried out on all live branches, and a branch diameter and length model was developed. Various indices, including the absolute depth into the branch base (DINC) from tree tip, were used. The equation with the largest Rₐdⱼ² and smallest root mean square error (RMSE) values was selected as the best model. Each parameter from the best model was reparameterized to the tree variables and competition indices. Finally, the branch diameter model that included diameter at the breast height (DBH), tree height (HT), and the crown length index (CLI), and the branch length model that included DBH and HT exhibited the best performance. The Rₐdⱼ² and RMSE values were 0.42 and 4 mm, respectively, for the branch diameter model, and 0.77 and 63 cm, respectively, for the branch length model. Branch diameter and length increased as DBH increased and decreased as HT increased. Furthermore, branch diameter decreased as the CLI increased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus koraiensis 3aequations 3aforests 3amodels 3atree height 3atrees 3awood quality 3aChina1 aLiu, Qifeng 1 aSong, Ying 1 aJiang, Mengzhu 1 aYin, You 0 tForests.g2022 June 11, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f130609123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245017800182500002200360520167900382592002802061650001702089650001702106650001802123650001202141650002202153650001902175650001702194650001102211650000702222650001302229650001602242651001902258651001802277653001802295653001402313653001402327653001902341653001902360653001102379700002302390700001802413773009502431856008402526852000902610655001202619IND60583723120221121032809.0171024s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058372312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIntxauspe-Zubiaurre, Beñat10aVariations to calcareous nannofossil CaCO3 content during the middle Eocene C21r-H6 hyperthermal event (~47.4Ma) in the Gorrondatxe section (Bay of Biscay, western Pyrenees)  aPre-press version  aThe carbonate content of calcareous nannofossils is dependent on seawater composition. One of the factors that affect seawater chemistry and consequently the degree of calcification in coccolithophores is temperature, as seen in present day warming oceans. The depth at which carbonates are dissolved (Calcite Compensation depth, CCD) can rise due to an increase in HCO3– and decrease in pH, leading to a major dissolution on the seabed and burndown. Similar processes have also been deduced for Eocene hyperthermal events, such as the PETM and ETM2. This study reports changes in coccolith carbonate mass from a hemipelagic setting (Gorrondatxe, at 1500m paleodepth) during the core of a minor Eocene hyperthermal event, namely the C21r-H6 event (47.44–47.32Ma). Image analysis techniques were used to determine differences in the carbonate mass of selected calcareous nannofossil taxa, revealing species-specific patterns. The CaCO3 mass of Chiasmolithus solitus decreased by 50% over the course of the C21r-H6 event, and many specimens also lost their crossed central bars, an additional indication of mass loss; Reticulofenestra sp. (3–5μm) showed a similar trend, but the percentage of mass lost was lower; Toweius pertusus, interpreted as being reworked, mirrored the behaviour of Chiasmolithus solitus, suggesting that the CaCO3 mass loss may have occurred on the seabed, rather than in the water column. In general, it can be concluded that the lysocline rose to 1500m paleobathymetry in the Bay of Biscay during the C21r-H6 event. Formation of corrosive bottom water in the North Atlantic Ocean is regarded as being responsible for the rise in the lysocline.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEocene epoch 3abicarbonates 3acalcification 3acalcite 3acalcium carbonate 3aimage analysis 3amicrofossils 3aoceans 3apH 3aseawater 3atemperature 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aBay of Biscay 0aAcidification 0aLysocline 0aCoccolith 0aCarbonate mass 0aImage analysis 0aEocene1 aFlores, José-Abel1 aPayros, Aitor0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245011600159300001600275520154800291592002801839650002401867650001301891650001301904650002601917650001001943650001301953650001601966650001701982650001301999650002002012650000702032650001802039650001302057650003302070700001202103700001502115700001302130700001502143700001802158700001302176700001902189700001602208773014002224856008202364852000902446655001202455IND4515806120221120065218.0200928e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451580612DNAL7 a10.1007/s12272-012-0509-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Dan10aPreparation and characterization of a novel pH-sensitive coated microsphere for duodenum-specific drug delivery  ap. 839-850.  aThe aim of this study is to develop a duodenum-specific drug delivery system on the basis of a pH-sensitive coating and a mucoadhesive inner core for eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in the ulcer duodenum. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate maleate (HPMCAM) was used as the pH-sensitive material, which dissolves around pH 3.0. The mucoadhesive microspheres loaded with furazolidone (FZD-ad-MS) were prepared by the emulsification-solvent evaporation method using Carbopol 971NP as the mucoadhesive polymer. The prepared pH-sensitive coated mucoadhesive microspheres (AM-coated-MS) were characterized in regards to particle size, drug loading efficiency, morphological change, drug stability, drug release and in vitro anti-H. pylori activity. The particle size was 160.97 ± 47.24 μm and 336.44 ± 129.34 μm, and the drug content was 42.33 ± 3.43% and 10.96 ± 1.29% for FZD-ad-MS and AM-coated-MS, respectively. The morphological changes in different pH media were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). HPMCAM coating improved the stability of the FZD-ad-MS and these particles were expected to remain intact until their arrival in the duodenum. The drug release was extremely suppressed at pH 1.2 for AM-coated-MS, but increased at pH 4.0 after regeneration of FZD-ad-MS. In addition, FZD-ad-MS exhibited excellent anti-H. pylori activity in vitro. Thus, the HPMCAM-coated microspheres developed in this study hold great promise for use as a duodenum-specific drug delivery system for H. pylori clearance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aacetates 3acoatings 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aduodenum 3aevaporation 3afurazolidone 3amaleates 3amethylcellulose 3apH 3aparticle size 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aZhu, Xi1 aWang, Yang1 aJin, Yun1 aXu, Xuefan1 aFan, Tingting1 aLiu, Yan1 aZhang, Zhirong1 aHuang, Yuan0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2012 May, v. 35, no. 5 p.839-850dPharmaceutical Society of KoreawJournal:J000001242x0253-62697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12272-012-0509-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245011000159300001600269520158700285592002801872653002901900653003401929700001601963700001301979700001801992700001202010773011302022856008102135852000902216655001202225IND60516688120221122045218.0160326e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051668812DNAL7 a10.1017/S09502688150011442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLIU, L.10aPredicting the incidence of hand, foot and mouth disease in Sichuan province, China using the ARIMA model  ap. 144-151.  aHand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is an infectious disease caused by enteroviruses, which usually occurs in children aged <5 years. In China, the HFMD situation is worsening, with increasing number of cases nationwide. Therefore, monitoring and predicting HFMD incidence are urgently needed to make control measures more effective. In this study, we applied an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to forecast HFMD incidence in Sichuan province, China. HFMD infection data from January 2010 to June 2014 were used to fit the ARIMA model. The coefficient of determination (R²), normalized Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and mean absolute percentage of error (MAPE) were used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the constructed models. The fitted ARIMA model was applied to forecast the incidence of HMFD from April to June 2014. The goodness-of-fit test generated the optimum general multiplicative seasonal ARIMA (1,0,1) × (0,1,0)₁₂ model (R² = 0·692, MAPE = 15·982, BIC = 5·265), which also showed non-significant autocorrelations in the residuals of the model (P = 0·893). The forecast incidence values of the ARIMA (1,0,1) × (0,1,0)₁₂ model from July to December 2014 were 4103–9987, which were proximate forecasts. The ARIMA model could be applied to forecast HMFD incidence trend and provide support for HMFD prevention and control. Further observations should be carried out continually into the time sequence, and the parameters of the models could be adjusted because HMFD incidence will not be absolutely stationary in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 0aARIMA; forecasting; hand 0afoot and mouth disease (HFMD)1 aLUAN, R.

The cDNA clone encoding ETIb was isolated from the seed cDNA library constructed in the lambda phage λgt11. The ETIb cDNA insert consists of 765 bp, including an open reading frame of 606 pb from ATG to TGA codons. The deduced amino acid sequence consists of 202 amino acids, having the signal peptides of 22 amino acids in the N-terminus and 2 amino acids in C-terminus. The cDNA fragment encoding the mature form of ETIb was introduced into an expression vector, pET-22b, and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (ED3) in a functional form. Furthermore, the ETIb mutant bP61R/F62L, in which Pro⁶¹ and Phe⁶² in ETIb were changed to the corresponding amino acid residues Arg and Leu, respectively, as in ETIa, was constructed, and its inhibitory potency toward tPA was assayed. This mutant showed significant tPA inhibitory activity, albeit less than ETIa. The result demonstrates that the Arg⁶¹ and Leu⁶² residues in ETIa are important in inhibiting tPA, and also suggests that beside these two residues, the other amino acid(s) or other structural element may be involved in interaction of ETIa with tPA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aErythrina variegata 3aEscherichia coli 3aamino acids 3abacteriophages 3abiotechnology 3acDNA libraries 3acodons 3agenetic vectors 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aplasminogen activator 3asignal peptide 3atrypsin 3atrypsin inhibitors 0atrypsin inhibitor 0atissue-type plasminogen activator inhibitor 0acDNA cloning; expression1 aYamasaki, Nobuyuki1 aKimura, Makoto0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g1997 Jan. 1, v. 61, no. 6 p.1041-1043dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.61.10413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245014400161300001600305520142500321592002801746596006301774596009501837650002701932650002401959650002701983650000902010650001302019650001402032650002102046650001902067650001502086650000902101650002102110650000902131700001202140773016102152856008202313852000902395655001202404IND60629494820221118030052.0190514e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062949482DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-018-1727-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, X.10aResponses of litter decomposition and nutrient release of Bothriochloa ischaemum to soil petroleum contamination and nitrogen fertilization  ap. 719-728.  aTo assess the effects of petroleum contamination or fertilization with nitrogenous fertilizer in contaminated soil on the litter decomposition of Bothriochloa ischaemum, a phytoremediating species, its litter was placed in litterbags and buried in uncontaminated soil, and petroleum-contaminated soil with and without urea fertilization (petroleum concentration: 45 g/kg, the ratio of soil C/N was adjusted to 25:1 after urea fertilization) for a 6-month decomposition experiment at consistent soil moisture and room temperature (20–25 °C). The results indicated that petroleum contamination significantly inhibited the overall decomposition (the turnover period was extended by 44.35%) and nutrient release (the release of P, K and Fe was inhibited, while the release of N and Zn was accelerated) of B. ischaemum litter, while N fertilization significantly intensified the inhibitory effects of petroleum contamination (significantly extended the turnover period of decomposition by 36.71% again and simultaneously inhibited the release of C, N, P and Zn). Consequently, this research suggests that additional measures should be simultaneously used with phytoremediation to alleviate the inhibitory effects of petroleum on B. ischaemum litter decomposition. However, fertilizing the contaminated soil with urea might cause potential disadvantages, and it should not be applied in conjunction with phytoremediation.  aPublisher supplied data  a31501342cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  aYDBK2017-26cthe Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Yan’an University 3aBothriochloa ischaemum 3aambient temperature 3afertilizer application 3airon 3anitrogen 3apetroleum 3aphytoremediation 3apolluted soils 3asoil water 3aurea 3aurea fertilizers 3azinc1 aLiu, Z.0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2019 Feb., v. 16, no. 2 p.719-728dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2208x1735-14727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-018-1727-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01911naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245009000163300001600253520061900269592002800888650002300916650001500939650001400954650003300968650001101001650001901012650002001031650001701051650001001068650001201078650000901090650001401099650001101113653003101124653001501155653001701170653003001187700001901217773015301236856007901389852000901468655001201477IND60522658920221119141500.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052265892DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1980-9-10092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeser, Joseph10aImmunological Studies of Catechol Methyltransferase from the Yeast Candida tropicalis  ap. 712-716.  aImmunization of rabbits with purified catechol methyltransferase from Candida tropicalis yielded a potent antiserum.

Among them, quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have gained significant interest due to the advantages of quantum dots (QDs) including easy fabrication, multiple exciton generation, band-gap energy controllability and high absorption coefficient. A QDSC consists of a metal oxide photoanode, QDs, electrolyte and a counter electrode (CE). In comparison with the photoanode and QDs, the CE has not been paid much attention. As an essential part of QDSCs, the CE plays an important role in the charge transport and collection of the device. Here, the recent progress in the development of CEs is reviewed, and the key issues for the materials, structures and performance evaluation of CEs are also addressed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy conversion 3aquantum dots 3asolar cells 3asolar energy1 aTian, Jianjun0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 20, v. 6, no. 93 p.90082-90099dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra19226b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02197naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002700144245006300171300001800234520105000252650001201302650002001314650001901334650001601353650001601369650001601385650002001401650001201421650001201433650000901445650001301454650001701467700002101484700003101505700002001536700002501556773016201581856004701743852000901790655001201799IND4535033520221119224223.0151207e20150819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453503352DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b026472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClaumarchirant, Lorena10aSterol Composition in Infant Formulas and Estimated Intake  ap. 7245-7251.  aSterol contents in infant formulas (IFs) from the European market were determined, and their intakes by infants between 0 and 6 months were evaluated. Total animal sterols (mg/100 mL) ranged from 1.71 to 5.46, cholesterol being the main animal sterol (1.46â5.1). In general, cholesterol and desmosterol were lower than the human milk (HM) values indicated by other authors. Total plant sterol (mg/100 mL) ranged from 3.1 to 5.0. Î²-Sitosterol, the most abundant phytosterol, ranged from 1.82 to 3.01, followed by campesterol (0.72â1.15), stigmasterol (0.27â0.53), and brassicasterol (0.14â0.28). Cholesterol intake (mg/day) ranged from 9 to 51 and plant sterol intake (mg/day) from 19 to 50. The sterol profile of IFs is highly dependent on the type and quantity of fats used in their formula. The use of bovine milk fat and milk fat globule membrane in the IFs can approximate the profile of animal sterols to those found in HM, though cholesterol intakes in breastfed infants are still higher than in formula-fed infants. 3aanimals 3abeta-sitosterol 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3acampesterol 3acholesterol 3ainfant formulas 3ainfants 3amarkets 3amilk 3amilk fat 3astigmasterol1 aMatencio, Esther1 aSanchez-Siles, Luis Manuel1 aAlegria, Amparo1 aLagarda, Maria Jesus0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 Aug. 19, v. 63, no. 32 p.7245-7251dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b02647  aDNAL 7aarticle02305naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010600168300001600274520106100290592002801351650001401379650002701393650002501420650002201445650002201467650001401489650002101503650001201524650002601536650001901562650002101581653002401602653001701626653001701643653001901660653001301679773010801692856008601800852000901886655001201895IND60622709620221123011418.0190329e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062270962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.10.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbe, Kentaro10aNovel fabrication of high-modulus cellulose-based films by nanofibrillation under alkaline conditions  ap. 488-491.  aWe herein propose a novel continuous process for fabricating high-modulus films based on cellulose nanofibers. In place of a dissolution process, the pulps were mechanically disintegrated into nanofibers by ball-milling in an 8% NaOH solution. NaOH treatment loosened the hydrogen bonding between the cellulose microfibrils in the pulps, and a highly concentrated suspension (8%) of cellulose nanofibers with a uniform diameter of approximately 20–50 nm was prepared after ball-milling for 90 min. The resulting nanofiber suspensions prepared in the NaOH solution exhibited the crystal forms of both Cellulose I and Cellulose II, although the Cellulose II content gradually increased upon increasing the milling time. Finally, hydrogels were formed following neutralization of the suspensions, and the hydrogel sheets were hot-pressed into thin films at 120 °C. The Young’s moduli of the films were significantly higher than those of typical regenerated cellulose films due to the presence of some remaining Cellulose I and a high crystallinity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3acellulose microfibrils 3acellulose nanofibers 3acrystal structure 3afilms (materials) 3ahydrogels 3ahydrogen bonding 3amilling 3amodulus of elasticity 3aneutralization 3asodium hydroxide 0aCellulose nanofiber 0aHigh modulus 0aBall milling 0aNaOH treatment 0aHydrogel0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 205 p.488-491dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.10.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245015000177300002500327520110500352592002801457650001501485650001701500650003701517650000801554650001301562650001901575650001401594650001001608650001601618650001901634650001801653651001001671700001901681700001701700700002001717700002401737700001801761773010501779856008801884990002301972852000901995655001202004IND60098530420221121024937.0141104e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009853042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.03.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHattori, Hiromitsu10aBirth of a healthy infant after intracytoplasmic sperm injection using pentoxifylline-activated sperm from a patient with Kartagener’s syndrome  ap. 2431.e9-2431.e11.  aOBJECTIVE: To describe the delivery of a healthy female infant after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using pentoxifylline-activated sperm from a patient with Kartagener’s syndrome.

The focus of this paper is on the choice of contract instruments to incentivise the provision of ecosystem service outputs from farms. The farmer is better informed than the regulator in terms of hidden information about costs and hidden-actions relating to effort. The results show that with perfect information, the regulator can contract equivalently on inputs or outputs. With hidden information, input-based contracts are more cost effective at reducing the informational rent related to adverse selection than output-based contracts. Mixed contracts are also cost-effective, especially where one input is not observable. Such contracts allow the regulator to target variables that are “costly-to-fake” as opposed to those prone to moral hazard such as effort. Further results are given for fixed price contracts and input-based contracts with moral hazard. The model is extended to include a discussion of repeated contracting and the scope that exists for the regulator to benefit from information revealed by the initial choice of contract. The models are applied to a case study of contracting with farmers to protect high biodiversity native vegetation that also provides socially-valuable ecosystem services.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3acost effectiveness 3aecosystem services 3afarmers 3afarms 3aindigenous species 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aprices1 aHanley, Nick0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2016 Apr., v. 63, no. 4 p.765-787dSpringer Netherlandsx0924-64607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-016-0002-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02333naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012200158300002200280520128000302592002801582650001101610650002001621650001101641650001901652650002401671650002201695650001601717650001601733700001701749700001901766773012701785856007401912852000901986655001201995IND60641186420221120173800.0190505e20161111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064118642DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra19227k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Jeng-Shin10aMicrowave-assisted chemical bath deposition process to fabricate CdS buffer layers used in Cu(In,Ga)Se₂ solar cells  ap. 107886-107893.  aA microwave-assisted chemical bath deposition process was successfully developed for preparing CdS buffer layers in Cu(In,Ga)Se₂ solar cells. Crystallized CdS films with densified microstructures were formed on Cu(In,Ga)Se₂ absorber layers at 55 °C. The duration of the reaction was only 4 min. Increasing the reaction temperature facilitated homogeneous precipitation and suppressed heterogeneous precipitation, thereby decreasing the thickness of CdS films, and reduced Vₒc, Jₛc, FF, and the conversion efficiency. When CdS buffer layers were prepared at 55 °C, a conversion efficiency of 10.2% was achieved, and the corresponding values of Vₒc, Jₛc, and FF were measured to be 0.574 V, 32.5 mA cm⁻², and 55.0%, respectively. Moreover, as the reaction temperature was increased, the shunt conductance, the diode factor, and the saturated current worsened, owing to insufficient coverage of CdS films. Increasing the reaction temperature decreased the photoluminescence intensity of Cu(In,Ga)Se₂ films covered by the prepared CdS films.

Apigenin, a flavone, and kaempferol, a flavonol, were analyzed at 67.9 MHz by ¹³C FT NMR. The ¹³C enrich­ ment confirmed that acetate contributes primarily to the flavonoid A ring. The coupling patterns between adjacent ¹³C atoms of the A ring indicate that the cyclization direction of the A ring is random in both compounds. While randomization of apigenin could have occurred chemically through opening of the pyrone ring under the acid conditions used for glycoside hydrolysis, ran­ domization of the more stable flavonol must have occurred biosynthetically. The latter result supports the conclusion that a chalcone is an intermediate in flavonoid biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPetroselinum crispum 3aacetates 3aapigenin 3abiosynthesis 3acell suspension culture 3achalcone 3achromatography 3aethanol 3aglycosides 3ahydrolysis 3akaempferol 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aparsley 3astable isotopes 0a13C-NMR 0aApigenin 0aKaempferol 0aFlavonoid 0aBiosynthesis1 aHahlbrock, Klaus0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 35, no. 9-10 p.717-721dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:21135x0939-50757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1980-9-10103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001100148245013800159300001800297520175500315592002802070650001302098650001802111650001102129650002502140650001302165650001302178650002402191650001402215650001902229700001302248700001402261700001302275700001102288773016202299856008302461852000902544655001202553IND60774609520221119133227.0221002e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077460952DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-021-03251-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, E.10aWaste rocks from the industrial mining process: hazard metals stabilization behavior evaluating and reusing as construction materials  ap. 3685-3700.  aRecycling wastes to renewable resources with proper methods deserve world’s extensive efforts. In this work, antimony mining waste rocks from the industrial mining process contenting hazard metals are incorporated as substitutes for aggregate to produce cement mortars and concrete products. The stabilization behaviors of hazard metals in those products are evaluated and the stabilize mechanisms are discussed. The solidification and stabilization effectiveness are evaluated by examining the leaching behavior of the contained hazard metals including Sb, As and Pb. The leaching results indicate that the concentrations of the evaluated hazard metals in cement mortars and concrete products are reduced over time, and the cement mortars exhibit higher reducing rate. The reduced leaching behavior can be attributed to the increased hydration products of silicate precipitation. The main contents of antimony mine waste rocks and compressive strength of cement mortar and concrete produced with different amounts of antimony mining waste rocks incorporated are also analyzed to evaluate their resource possibility. The results reveal that the main contents in antimony mining waste rocks are similar to the benchmark cement (SiO₂ + CaO + Al₂O₃ > 75%). In addition, much better compressive strength over 42.5 MPa is obtained at 28 days curing period when antimony mining waste rocks were added as substitutes for standard sands to produce cement mortar. The improved compressive strength can be attributed to the reduced porosity and improved pore structures. The improved compressive strength and decreased hazard metals concentration indicate the antimony mining waste rocks a promising material reused as renewable resource.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimony 3acalcium oxide 3acement 3acompression strength 3aconcrete 3aporosity 3arenewable resources 3asilicates 3asolidification1 aChen, H.1 aHuang, F.1 aZhou, L.1 aYu, Z.0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2022 May, v. 19, no. 5 p.3685-3700dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2208x1735-14727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-021-03251-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01726naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245008200159300001600241520039800257592002800655650001200683650002200695650001500717650002300732650003600755650001600791650004400807650002200851700001900873700001900892700001400911700001800925700002100943700001500964700001600979700001400995700001901009700001601028700002001044700001701064773010301081856007501184852000901259655001201268IND60578775320221116153351.0170814e20140117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057877532DNAL7 a10.1021/ol403315d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Wen-Juan10a(±)-Paeoveitol, a Pair of New Norditerpene Enantiomers from Paeonia veitchii  ap. 424-427.  a(+)-Paeoveitol and (−)-paeoveitol, a pair of new norditerpene enantiomers, were isolated from the root of Paeonia veitchii.

A survey of the perception of the farmers, and an assessment of the biophysical impact of catch crops (CC) and tillage (C = Control plot) on soil organic matter, bulk density, infiltration capacity (single ring infiltrometer), and runoff generation and soil erosion (rainfall simulation experiments) was carried out. Two representative fields as study sites were selected in Les Alcusses valley, within Els Alforins wine production region. The results show that the use of CC increased soil organic matter, favored higher infiltration rates and runoff generation was delayed. Moreover, runoff rates and soil erosion were lowered. The perception of the farmers was mainly against the use of catch crops due to their view as it being ‘dirty’, their cost, and the loss of their reputation and respect by other farmers. Our survey proves that the farmers would accept the catch crops if a subsidy of 76.56 € ha⁻¹ on average would be paid. Farmers see the use of a catch crop more as a benefit for the health of the Planet than for themselves. To achieve land degradation neutrality, education and dissemination programs should be developed to teach and inform the farmers of their key role in the proper management of vineyards.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3acatch crops 3aeconomic costs 3aeducation 3ainfiltrometers 3aland degradation 3arainfall simulation 3arunoff 3asocial impact 3asoil erosion 3asoil organic matter 3asurveys 3atillage 3aviticulture 3awinemaking 3aSpain1 aRodrigo-Comino, Jesús,0 tLand.g2021 Feb. 18, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land100202053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011000163500002200273520127700295592002801572650001701600650001801617650002301635650002101658650001201679650000901691650002401700650002501724650002001749650001801769650002101787653000901808653002201817653001801839653002001857653001701877700001801894700001601912700001401928700001701942700001701959700001701976700001801993700001302011700002002024700001702044773008202061856008102143852000902224655001202233IND60561854620221119231111.0170208s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056185462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2017.01.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shiwen12aA role of KIT receptor signaling for proliferation and differentiation of rat stem Leydig cells in vitro  aPre-press version  aIn the testis, KIT ligand (KITL, also called stem cell factor) is expressed by Sertoli cells and its receptor (c-kit, KIT) is expressed by spermatogonia and Leydig cells. Although KITL-KIT signaling is critical for the spermatogenesis, its roles in Leydig cell development during puberty are not clear. In the present study, we investigated effects of KITL on stem Leydig cell proliferation and differentiation. Using an in vitro culture system of seminiferous tubules from Leydig cell-depleted testis, we found that KITL increased the proliferation activity of putative stem Leydig cells at higher concentration (10 and 100 ng/ml). Low concentration (1 ng/ml) of KITL significantly induced the differentiation of stem Leydig cells via increasing the expression level of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (Star). In contrast, higher concentration (100 ng/ml) of KITL inhibited the differentiation of stem Leydig cells via inhibiting the steroidogenic enzyme (Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, and Hsd17b3) expression levels. We cultured rat progenitor Leydig cells with KITL for 48 h and did not find any influence of KITL on the proliferation and androgen production of these cells. In conclusion, KITL is a growth factor that regulates the development of the stem Leydig cell.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeydig cells 3aSertoli cells 3acell proliferation 3ain vitro culture 3apuberty 3arats 3aregulatory proteins 3aseminiferous tubules 3aspermatogenesis 3aspermatogonia 3astem cell factor 0aKITL 0aStem leydig cells 0aProliferation 0aDifferentiation 0aTestosterone1 aChen, Xiaomin1 aWang, Yiyan1 aLi, Linxi1 aWang, Guimin1 aLi, Xiaoheng1 aChen, Haolin1 aGuo, Jingjing1 aLin, Han1 aLian, Qing-Quan1 aGe, Ren-Shan0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2017.01.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03426naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245014900166300001600315520189700331592002802228596002002256596002402276650001402300650001602314650001902330650001602349650002602365650000902391650002402400650001102424650001202435650001002447650001202457650001202469650001402481651001602495653002702511653002402538653003102562653001802593700001502611700001802626700001602644700001602660700001402676773012302690856008602813852000902899655001202908IND60629828820221118124750.0190204e20190304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062982882DNAL7 a10.1080/00480169.2018.15591092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRidler, AL10aProduction responses and cost-benefit of long-acting pre-lambing anthelmintic treatment of yearling ewes in two commercial flocks in New Zealand  ap. 105-108.  aAIMS: To investigate the production responses and cost-benefit of administering a controlled-release anthelmintic capsule (CRC) to pregnant yearling ewes prior to lambing. METHODS: Yearling ewes from two commercial sheep flocks (A, n=489; B, n=248) in the North Island of New Zealand were enrolled in the study. Prior to lambing, CRC containing albendazole and abamectin were administered to half the ewes while the other half remained untreated. Ewe liveweights and body condition scores were measured prior to lambing, at weaning and, for Flock B, prior to subsequent mating. Lambs were matched to dams shortly after birth and the weight and number of lamb weaned per ewe were determined. A cost-benefit analysis was undertaken for Flock B considering the increased weight of lamb weaned per ewe, and the weight of ewes at the next mating and the benefit in terms of lambs born. RESULTS: The mean weight at weaning of treated ewes was greater for treated than untreated ewes by 2.76 (95% CI 0.64–4.88) kg in Flock A (p<0.001) and 2.35 (95% CI −0.41–5.12) kg in Flock B (p=0.003); the weight of lamb weaned per ewe was greater for treated than untreated ewes by 1.43 (95% CI −0.71 to –3.49) kg in Flock A (p=0.041) and 3.97 (95% CI 1.59–6.37) kg in Flock B (p<0.001), and ewe liveweight prior to subsequent mating was greater for treated than untreated ewes in Flock B by 4.60 (95% CI 3.6–5.6) kg (p<0.001). There was no difference in the percentage of lambs reared to weaning between treated and untreated ewes in either flock (p>0.8). The overall cost-benefit of treatment for Flock B was NZ$9.44 per treated ewe. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Pre-lambing CRC administration to yearling ewes resulted in increased ewe weaning weights and weight of lamb weaned in both the flocks studied. There was an economic benefit in the one flock where this was assessed.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgResearch SSIF  cC.

Such marginals description is sufficient for power systems related operational problems if and only if optimal decisions are to be made for each lead-time and each location independently of each other. However, many of these operational processes are temporally and spatially coupled, while uncertainty in photovoltaic (PV) generation is strongly dependent in time and in space. This issue is addressed here by analysing and capturing spatio-temporal dependencies in PV generation. Multivariate predictive distributions are modelled and space–time trajectories describing the potential evolution of forecast errors through successive lead-times and locations are generated. Discrimination ability of the relevant scoring rules on performance assessment of space–time trajectories of PV generation is also studied. Finally, the advantage of taking into account space–time correlations over probabilistic and point forecasts is investigated. The empirical investigation is based on the solar PV dataset of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition (GEFCom) 2014.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aenergy 3aevolution 3aspace and time 3auncertainty 0aStochastic dependence 0aMultivariate distribution 0aPhotovoltaic energy 0aSpace–time correlation1 aGooi, Hoay Beng1 aPinson, Pierre0 tApplied energy.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 176 p.80-91dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008200171300001600253520163300269592002801902650001101930650002601941650002001967650001501987650001102002650002102013650001002034650000902044650001602053650001602069650001102085650001902096650001102115650001802126650001502144650001902159650001102178650001102189650001302200650001202213651001602225700001902241700001902260700002102279700001602300700001902316700001602335773011602351856008102467852000902548655001202557IND60515218020221117232109.0160312e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051521802DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-015-0257-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOng, Homervergel G.10aEthnobotany of the wild edible plants gathered in Ulleung Island, South Korea  ap. 409-427.  aDocumentation of diversity and assessment of cultural importance of wild edible plants gathered and consumed in Ulleung Island, South Korea was conducted in this research by asking 83 key informants (average age 70) using semi-structured interview questionnaire, and utilizing quantitative ethnobotanical indices such as use value (UV) and fidelity level (FL). A total of 66 taxa in 36 families of wild food plants were recorded, 10 of which, endemic. Asteraceae and Rosaceae were the most represented families with 10 taxa for each. Leaves, young shoots and fruits were the most collected plant parts especially in spring. The plants which recorded high UVs were Allium ochotense (0.627), Aster pseudoglehnii (0.398) and Aruncus dioicus var. kamtschaticus (0.349), indicating that these plants are considered the most important by the informants. This study also recorded 29 wild edible plant taxa with 100 % FL values. Notable plants (and their preparation) with relatively high FL and use-mentions are Vitis coignetiae (89.47 %), Anthriscus sylvestris (86.67 %) and Lilium hansonii (86.67 %) which are consumed as fruit, prepared by parboiling the shoots and by steaming the bulbs, respectively. Category 5 “Cooked” (COO) was the most preferred mode of preparation when taken as a whole recording 49 % of the total, implying that wild edible plants play a big role in the informants’ regular diet despite growing modernization in the island brought about by government-led tourism and infrastructure development programs. Some social, cultural, nutritional and ecological aspects were also discussed in this paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium 3aAnthriscus sylvestris 3aAruncus dioicus 3aAsteraceae 3aLilium 3aVitis coignetiae 3abulbs 3adiet 3aethnobotany 3afood plants 3afruits 3ainfrastructure 3aleaves 3amodernization 3aparboiling 3aquestionnaires 3ashoots 3aspring 3asteaming 3atourism 3aSouth Korea1 aChung, Jae-Min1 aJeong, Hye-Ran1 aKim, Yŏng-dong,1 aChoi, Kyung1 aShin, Chang-Ho1 aLee, You-Mi0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2016 Mar., v. 63, no. 3 p.409-427dSpringer Netherlandsx0925-98647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-015-0257-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02181naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245008800167300002000255520092500275592002801200650002201228650001801250650001401268650001701282650001901299650001301318650001601331650001301347650001101360650001101371650001901382650001601401650001701417700002801434700005901462773017301521856008001694852000901774655001201783IND60600981820221121232114.0180705e20171108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060098182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b020982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaur, Kamalpreet10aEnhancement in Conversion and Selectivity of Trivalerin Using Reactive Distillation  ap. 12488-12494.  aThe feasibility and potential of reactive distillation was studied to evaluate the enhancement in trivalerin selectivity in the esterification of valeric acid with glycerol, using n-octane as an entrainer over sulfated iron oxide catalyst. Effect of process parameters such as entrainer loading, reaction temperature, and reaction time was evaluated. Results have indicated that the selectivity toward trivalerin can be enhanced up to 95.07%, in comparison to batch process (74.80%), using the stoichiometric molar ratio, which describes the novelty of this work. Kinetic models such as pseudo-homogeneous, Eley–Rideal, and Langmuir–Hinshelwood model were used to study the kinetics of the reaction. The Eley–Rideal model supported the proposed mechanism with higher reliability and accuracy, resulting in an activation energy of 23.77 kJ/mol, which is plausibly less, compared to the batch process (27.37 kJ/mol).  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3abatch systems 3acatalysts 3adistillation 3aesterification 3aglycerol 3airon oxides 3akinetics 3amodels 3aoctane 3aprocess design 3atemperature 3avaleric acid1 aWanchoo, Ravinder Kumar1 aToor, Amrit Pal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7092-15480 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 Nov. 08, v. 56, no. 44 p.12488-12494dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b020983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002200144245015300166300001800319520132000337650001501657650001801672650002101690650001401711650001601725650001401741650001001755650000901765650002001774650001601794650001101810650001501821650001301836650001201849650002101861650004401882650000901926650001001935700002401945700001901969700002201988773016202010856004702172852000902219655001202228IND4535034020221119224234.0151207e20150819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453503402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b023162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrice, Neil P.

The sugar composition consists of l-arabinofuranose (l-Araf, 55.2%) and d-galactopyranose (d-Galp 30.1%), with smaller components of d-xylose (11.2%), d-mannose (3.5%), and glucuronic acid (GlcA, â¼2%), the latter linked via a galactosyl residue. Permethylation identified 3-linked Galp residues, some substituted at the 2-position with Galp or Manp, terminal Araf and Xylp, and an internal 3-substituted Araf. NMR (HSQC, TOCSY, HMBC, DOSY) identified Î²Galp and three Î±Araf spin systems, in an Araf-Î±1,3-Araf-Î±1,2-Araf-Î±1,2-Galp structural motif. Diffusion-ordered NMR showed that the FGP has a molecular weight of 1â10 MDa. Unlike gum arabic, the FGP does not contain a hydroxyproline-rich protein (HPRP). FGP forms stable gels at >15% w/v and at 1â12% solutions are viscous and are excellent emulsifiers of flavoring oils (grapefruit, clove, and lemongrass), giving stable emulsions for â¥72 h. Lower concentrations (0.1% w/v) were less viscous, yet still gave stable grapefruit oil/water emulsions. Hence, FGP is a Î²1,3-linked arabinogalactan with potential as a gum arabic replacement in the food and beverage industries. 3aCymbopogon 3aVitis riparia 3aarabinogalactans 3abeverages 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3afrost 3agels 3aglucuronic acid 3agrapefruits 3agrapes 3agum arabic 3aindustry 3amannose 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3astems1 aVermillion, Karl E.1 aEller, Fred J.1 aVaughn, Steven F.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 Aug. 19, v. 63, no. 32 p.7286-7293dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b02316  aDNAL 7aarticle03731naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013600167300001600303520212000319536023302439592002802672596011202700596007102812596006402883650001502947650002002962650001902982650002003001650001903021650001003040650001203050700001903062700001903081700001403100773013603114856008603250852000903336655001203345IND60629829120221118123456.0190211e20190117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062982912DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2018.15136662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Xianwei10aVery high resolution remote sensing image classification with SEEDS-CNN and scale effect analysis for superpixel CNN classification  ap. 506-531.  aPixel-based convolutional neural network (CNN) has demonstrated good performance in the classification of very high resolution images (VHRI) from which abstract deep features are extracted. However, conventional pixel-based CNN demands large resources in terms of processing time and disk space. Therefore, superpixel CNN classification has recently become a focus of attention. We therefore propose a CNN based deep learning method combining superpixels extracted via energy-driven sampling (SEEDS) for VHRI classification. The approach consists of three main steps. First, based on the concept of geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA), the image is segmented into homogeneous superpixels using the SEEDS based superpixel segmentation method thereby decreasing the number of processing units. Second, the training data and testing data are extracted from the image and concatenated on a superpixel level at a variety of scales for CNN. Third, the training data are input to train the parameters of CNN and abstract deep features are extracted from the VHRI. Using these extracted deep features, we classify two VHRI data sets at single scales and multiple scales. To verify the effectiveness of SEEDS based CNN classification, the performance of SEEDS and three others superpixel segmentation algorithms are compared, and the superpixel extraction via SEEDS method was found to be the optimal superpixel segmentation approach for CNN classification. The scale effect on CNN classification accuracy was investigated by comparing the four superpixel segmentation methods. We found that (1) There is no strong evidence that using scales combinations is better than a single scale in some specific situations; (2) Natural objects with low complexity are not as sensitive to scale as artificial objects; (3) For a simple VHRI that contains clear artificial objects and simple texture, the classification result with multiple scales performs better a the single scale; (4) In contrast, for the complex VHRI containing a large number of complex objects, the classification result with a single small-scale best.  aThis work was supported by the the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41671369, 41671341);the National Key Research and Development Program (2017YFB0503600);the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities;  aPublisher supplied data  a41671369a41671341cthe National Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a(2017YFB0503600cthe National Key Research and Development Program  cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3aimage analysis 3aprocessing time 3aremote sensing 3aseeds 3atexture1 aMing, Dongping1 aChen, YangYang1 aWang, Min0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2019 Jan. 17, v. 40, no. 2 p.506-531dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2018.15136663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011900166300001600285520109700301592002801398650002401426650001401450650002401464650002801488650001701516650002601533650001301559650001201572650001801584653002101602653002001623653003001643653001801673700001701691700003301708700005501741700002101796700001801817773010801835856008601943961001202029852000902041655001202050IND60622710020221120130306.0210114e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062271002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.10.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCuevas, A.10aEco-friendly modification of a regenerated cellulose based film by silicon, carbon and N-doped carbon quantum dots  ap. 238-244.  aModification of a regenerated cellulose thin film by inclusion of different non-toxic nanodots (silicon-dots (SiDs), carbon-dots (CDs)) or nitrogen-doped carbon dots (N-CDs)) by aqueous nanodots solution immersion was performed. Nanodots presence into the cellulosic structure was evidenced by confocal microscopy images at different depth and changes in film mechanical, electrical and optical parameters. Our results reveal that the inclusion of the different nanodots in the cellulosic support increases, indifferent percentages, the mechanical resistance and electrical conductivity of modified films, but they hardly affect light transmittance. Particularly, modification with N-CDs largely favored film conductivity due to the presence of the higher number of charged functional groups (CNH₂ and OCNH₂) groups) on N-CDs surface, allowin gus the attainment of a flexible, fluorescent and transparent high conductive eco-friendly film. In fact, the non-toxic character of both support-film and nanodots, endorses the use of these new nano-engineering films in biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon quantum dots 3acellulose 3aconfocal microscopy 3aelectrical conductivity 3afluorescence 3amechanical properties 3amoieties 3asilicon 3atransmittance 0aCellulosic films 0aCarbon nanodots 0aSpectroscopy ellipsometry 0aTransmittance1 aCampos, B.B.1 aRomero, Rachelq(Rachel L.),1 aAlgarra, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2410-84301 aVázquez, Mª.I.1 aBenavente, J.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 206 p.238-244dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.10.0743Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/DA  aDNAL 7aarticle02149naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012000168300001600288520103600304592002801340650002701368650001201395650001401407650001601421650002001437650003001457650001501487650000901502650001701511650001701528700002201545700001801567773011101585856008201696852000901778655001201787IND60759724820221118041319.0220124e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075972482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2021.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeffery, Rebecca10aGenetic and environmental factors shape the host response to Helicobacter hepaticus: insights into IBD pathogenesis  ap. 145-155.  aPathobionts are members of the gut microbiota with the capacity to cause disease when there is malfunctioning intestinal homeostasis. These organisms are thought to be major contributors to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a group of chronic inflammatory disorders driven by dysregulated responses towards the microbiota. Over two decades have passed since the discovery of Helicobacter hepaticus, a mouse pathobiont which causes colitis in the context of immune deficiency. During this time, we have developed a detailed understanding of the cellular players and cytokine networks which drive H. hepaticus immunopathology. However, we are just beginning to understand the microbial factors that enable H. hepaticus to interact with the host and influence colonic health and disease. Here we review key H. hepaticus-host interactions, their relevance to other exemplar pathobionts and how when maladapted they drive colitis. Further understanding of these pathways may offer new therapeutic approaches for IBD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter hepaticus 3acolitis 3acytokines 3ahomeostasis 3aimmunopathology 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3amice 3apathogenesis 3atherapeutics1 aIlott, Nicholas E1 aPowrie, Fiona0 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2022 Feb., v. 65 p.145-155dElsevier LtdwJournal:12432x1369-52747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2021.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001200153245014300165520123300308592002801541650001101569650001601580650001501596650001901611650002101630650001201651650001401663653002401677653002801701653002101729653001901750653002601769700001601795700001501811700001501826700001701841700001501858700001501873700001901888700001201907700001701919773011901936856008802055852000902143655001202152IND60727510620221123043815.0220103e20210620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072751062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1451162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Li10aPurification of black alkali liquor by microchannel filtration to promote energy savings and consumption reduction in lye cleaning systems  aTraditionally, multistage plate-frame filtration or centrifugal treatment methods are used to remove fiber from black alkali liquor with high viscosity and high fiber impurity content. However, these methods are limited by the long processes and high consumption of energy and materials. Therefore, in this paper, a new microchannel (deep) filtration process and device were proposed and used to replace the original “three-step” separation process (i.e., metal plate-frame filtration, first-stage polypropylene filtration and second-stage polypropylene filtration) and device. Separation media with different particle sizes were used to carry out online separation experiments. Results showed that an effective separation could be realized by using the combined multiparticle media with a length-diameter ratio of <30. Specifically, the average separation efficiency was higher than 90%. The workload was reduced by 66%. The floor area was decreased by 52%. The energy consumption was reduced by 64%. The material consumption was nearly zero. It is hoped that this study can not only benefit energy savings and cleaner production in the viscose fiber industry but also serve as a useful guide for other chemical industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3afiltration 3apolypropylenes 3atextile industry 3aviscose 3aviscosity 0aBlack alkali liquor 0aMicrochannel filtration 0aFiber separation 0aEnergy savings 0aConsumption reduction1 aTian, Jinyi1 aFu, Pengbo1 aPan, Jiake1 aChen, Jianqi1 aLv, Wenjie1 aZhao, Bibo1 aZhong, Chunyan1 aLiu, Yi1 aWang, Hualin0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 June 20, v. 774 p.145116-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1451163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011300168300001600281520116400297592002801461650001701489650002901506650002201535650001301557650001201570650003101582650001201613650001501625650001801640650002101658650001801679650000701697650001001704650001201714653004701726653004801773653003701821653004501858653005401903653006601957653004102023653001802064653002702082653005502109653002602164653001802190700001402208700001802222773010802240856008602348852000902434655001202443IND60525308220221118030825.0190318e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052530822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.09.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei,cDaifu,10aPreparation of novel stable antibacterial nanoparticles using hydroxyethylcellulose and application in paper  ap. 543-550.  aTaking advantage of the self-assembly between the components, novel stable antibacterial nanoparticles were efficiently fabricated via a facile one-step co-polymerization of acrylic acid (AA) and N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) on a mixed aqueous solution of poly(hexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride) (PHMG) and hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC). The z-average hydrodynamic diameters of the nanoparticles ranged from 220nm to 450nm. The inner layer of the nanoparticles is composed of water-insoluble interpolymer complexes of PHMG and PAA networks, while the outer layer is composed of PHMG and HEC. The nanoparticles are stabilized by electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding interactions, and the chemical bonds. The nanoparticle solution remained stable in a wide pH range of 2.0–12.0 and at salt concentrations below 0.25mol/L. The nanoparticles were incorporated into handsheets using a dipping treatment. The resulted handsheets exhibited excellent antimicrobial activities even after multiple water washing treatments. The nanoparticles are promising in fabricating paper, water-based coatings and textiles with permanent antibacterial activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylic acid 3aantibacterial properties 3aaqueous solutions 3acoatings 3adipping 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afabrics 3aguanidines 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrogen bonding 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apaper 3awashing 0aHexamethylene diamine (PubChem CID: 16402) 0aGuanidine hydrochloride (PubChem CID: 5742) 0aAcrylic acid (PubChem CID: 6581) 0aAmmonium persulfate (PubChem CID: 62648) 0aN,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (PubChem CID: 8041) 0aN,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylene diamine (PubChem CID: 8037) 0aHydrochloric acid (PubChem CID: 313) 0aNanoparticles 0aAntibacterial activity 0aPoly(hexamethylenediamine guanidine hydrochloride) 0aHydroxyethylcellulose 0aSelf-assembly1 aChen, Yan1 aZhang, Youwei0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 136 p.543-550dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.09.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04178naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245020400170520225600374592002802630650001402658650002002672650002302692650002702715650002102742650000902763650004302772650002102815650002702836650001502863650001402878650001602892650002702908650001502935650002402950650001002974650003702984650002903021650001003050650001003060651001003070653001503080653001403095653001403109653001003123653002103133700001603154700001803170700001803188700001503206700001803221700001503239700002103254700001203275700001203287700001603299700001603315773010303331856008503434852000903519655001203528IND60685103820221116233623.0220411e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068510382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1092952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Yang-Cheng10aPredictors of phthalate metabolites in urine and follicular fluid and correlations between urine and follicular fluid phthalate metabolite concentrations among women undergoing in vitro fertilization  aPhthalate metabolites in follicular fluid (FF) may negatively affect normal folliculogenesis; however, the predictors of phthalate metabolite concentrations in urine and FF and relationships between urine and FF phthalate metabolite concentrations among women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) are poorly understood. To investigate predictors of phthalate metabolites in urine and FF and correlations between urine and FF phthalate metabolite concentrations among women undergoing IVF. We recruited 305 women seeking infertility treatment at a reproductive center in Wuhan, China, from October to November 2016. Information regarding demographic characteristics, personal care product use and plastic material contact was obtained through direct interviews. Concentrations of 8 phthalate metabolites in urine and FF samples were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Associations regarding metabolite concentrations in urine and FF samples were analysed by Spearman's correlation and linear regression. Generalized linear regression was used to examine potential predictors of phthalate metabolite concentrations in urine and FF. Weak to moderate associations between urine and FF samples were found for monoethyl phthalate (MEP) and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP) (correlation coefficient: MEP, 0.350; MEOHP, 0.377); no associations were observed for other metabolites. The predictive powers of urinary metabolite concentrations in determining FF metabolite concentrations were uniformly low, with R² ≤ 0.113. Body mass index (BMI) and educational level were inversely associated with the urinary concentrations of certain metabolites. Higher household income, intake of bottled drinks within 48 h, and use of shower gel and soap were frequently associated with higher urinary metabolite concentrations. BMI, higher household income and use of disposable plastic cups within 48 h were associated with higher metabolite concentrations in FF. Phthalate metabolite concentrations in urine and FF vary according to sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyle factors. Phthalate metabolite concentrations in urine may not be appropriate for estimating ovary phthalate exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3abody mass index 3aeducational status 3afollicular development 3afollicular fluid 3agels 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahousehold income 3ain vitro fertilization 3ainterviews 3alifestyle 3ametabolites 3apersonal care products 3aphthalates 3aregression analysis 3asoaps 3asociodemographic characteristics 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aurine 3awomen 3aChina 0aPhthalates 0aPredictor 0aIVF women 0aUrine 0aFollicular fluid1 aDu, Yao-Yao1 aWang, Yi-Xing1 aDeng, Tao-Ran1 aLiu, Chong1 aTeng, Xue-Mei1 aHua, Xiang1 aYuan, Xiao-Qiong1 aGuo, Na1 aYin, Li1 aZeng, Qiang1 aLi, Yu-Feng0 tEnvironmental research.g2020 May, v. 184 p.109295-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1092953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02108naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245006400204300001300268506011700281506007600398520077300474592002801247506003701275650002601312650000801338650001901346650002001365650001301385650002101398650002001419650001401439650002201453700006001475773010801535856008201643852000901725655001201734IND60759725020221207101358.0220614e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075972502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2021.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKreis, Victor1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0913-369710aClostridioides difficile – phage relationship the RNA way  ap. 1-10.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aClostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile)-associated diarrhea is currently the most frequently occurring nosocomial diarrhea worldwide.

Of the 200 regulatory RNAs identified by deep sequencing and targeted approaches, many function as antitoxins within type I toxin-antitoxin modules and CRISPR RNAs for anti-phage defenses.

Hydrogen and oxygen nanobubbles were generated from water electrolysis on the surface of a Au/Pd alloy modified ITO electrode. The formation of single H₂ and O₂ nanobubbles was imaged in real time during a potential scan using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. Our results show that while O₂ nanobubbles can be detected at an early stage in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the formation of H₂ nanobubbles requires a significant overpotential. Our study shows that thin-film-coated ITO electrodes are simple to make and can be useful electrode substrates for (single molecule) spectroelectrochemistry research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolysis 3afluorescence microscopy 3agold 3ahydrogen 3aimage analysis 3aindium tin oxide 3ananobubbles 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3apalladium1 aFan, Yunshan1 aAnderson, Todd J.1 aZhang, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1737-12410 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Feb. 06, v. 92, no. 5 p.3682-3688dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b047933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245009300160300001600253520188800269592002802157650001502185650001502200650002002215650002402235650000902259650002602268650000902294650002402303650002102327650001802348650001402366650001402380650001502394650002002409650001802429700001702447700001802464700001702482700001802499700002202517773008502539856008102624852000902705655001202714IND60120247220221120065218.0150201e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012024722DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-014-3101-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibb, H.10aDoes morphology predict trophic position and habitat use of ant species and assemblages?  ap. 519-531.  aA functional traits-based theory of organismal communities is critical for understanding the principles underlying community assembly, and predicting responses to environmental change. This is particularly true for terrestrial arthropods, of which only 20 % are described. Using epigaeic ant assemblages, we asked: (1) can we use morphological variation among species to predict trophic position or preferred microhabitat; (2) does the strength of morphological associations suggest recent trait divergence; (3) do environmental variables at site scale predict trait sets for whole assemblages? We pitfall-trapped ants from a revegetation chronosequence and measured their morphology, trophic position [using C:N stoichiometry and stable isotope ratios (δ)] and characteristics of microhabitat and macrohabitat. We found strong associations between high trophic position (low C:N and high δ¹⁵N) in body tissue and morphological traits: predators were larger, had more laterally positioned eyes, more physical protection and tended to be monomorphic. In addition, morphological traits were associated with certain microhabitat features, e.g. smaller heads were associated with the bare ground microhabitat. Trait-microhabitat relationships were more pronounced when phylogenetic adjustments were used, indicating a strong influence of recent trait divergences. At the assemblage level, our fourth corner analysis revealed associations between the prevalence of traits and macrohabitat, although these associations were not the same as those based on microhabitat associations. This study shows direct links between species-level traits and both diet and habitat preference. Trait-based prediction of ecological roles and community structure is thus achievable when integrating stoichiometry, morphology and phylogeny, but scale is an important consideration in such predictions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormicidae 3aarthropods 3achronosequences 3acommunity structure 3adiet 3aenvironmental factors 3aeyes 3ahabitat preferences 3aland restoration 3amicrohabitats 3aphylogeny 3apredators 3aprediction 3astable isotopes 3astoichiometry1 aStoklosa, J.1 aWarton, D.

Hence, the present study was aimed to determine a means of suitable eco-friendly temperature stress alleviation for growth of wheat. Seeds of two wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars were primed with two potential plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), Bacillus safensis and Ochrobactrum pseudogrignonense, and 1-month-old young seedlings were subjected to heat treatment for different time periods. PGPR priming improved the heat stress tolerance level of wheat seedlings. Among the two, B. safensis was more effective for improving thermotolerance. High temperature induced the accumulation of ROS and was responsible for membrane injury and chloroplast ultrastructure damage. As a defense reaction, plants in turn activated antioxidant signalling which increased redox enzyme activity and accumulated osmolytes like proline and glycine betaine. However, PGPR priming, especially B. safensis, not only maintained cell viability and restored chloroplast structure thus reducing photosynthetic damage but also improved the antioxidative response significantly which was quite low in uninoculated plants after heat challenge. PGPR-mediated amelioration of heat stress seems to be associated with less ROS production, membrane damage, maintenance of chloroplast structure and enhanced chlorophyll content, increased expression of an array of redox enzymes and accumulation of osmolytes which improved overall thermotolerance. This study revealed a future prospective of eco-friendly and low-cost seed priming technique for amelioration of abiotic stresses.  aPublisher supplied data  aIF140228cDepartment of Science & Technology, Govt. of India 3aOchrobactrum 3aTriticum aestivum 3aantioxidants 3abetaine 3acell viability 3achlorophyll 3achloroplasts 3acultivars 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3aheat treatment 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aproline 3aseed priming 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3astress tolerance 3atemperature 3atropics 3aultrastructure 3awheat 3aIndia1 aChakraborty, Bishwanath1 aChakraborty, Usha0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2018 Dec., v. 37, no. 4 p.1396-1412dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-018-9789-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001700162245010100179300001400280506002800294520110800322592002801430506003701458650001901495650002101514650001101535650001101546650001301557650001601570650001901586650002601605650001201631650002701643650001401670650001101684650002001695650001301715650002601728651001001754653001901764653002001783653002501803700002401828700002901852700002501881773014101906856009702047852000902144655001202153IND60784535620221207121628.0200917e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078453562DNAL7 ahttps://doi.org/10.37833/cord.v20i01.3792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhanapal, R.10aInfluence of drip irrigation on growth and yield of cod x wct coconut (cocos nucifera l.) hybrid  ap. 37-43.  aResource is Open Access  aA field experiment on drip irrigation for Chowghat Orange Dwarf X West Coast Tall (COD X WCT) coconut hybrid was conducted in laterite soil at Central Plantation Crops Research Institute, Kasaragod (Kerala, India) to study the drip irrigation requirement and its influence on growth and yield. The treatments included were three levels of drip irrigation (at 33, 66 and 100% E0 daily), basin irrigation (100% E0) and rainfed control. The experimental results revealed that annual leaf production and leaf nutrient status of coconut palm was significantly higher in the irrigated treatments compared to the rainfed control. The female flower production and nut yield with 66 per cent of Eo was on par with 100 per cent of Eo through drip and 100 per cent of Eo through basin irrigation and significantly superior compared to drip irrigation at 33 per cent of E0 and rainfed control. Drip irrigation equal to 66 per cent of open pan evaporation (Eo) proved to be the economically efficient method of irrigation with water saving of 34 per cent compared to 100 per cent of Eo through basin and drip method.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCocos nucifera 3abasin irrigation 3abasins 3acoasts 3acoconuts 3aevaporation 3afemale flowers 3afield experimentation 3ahybrids 3airrigation requirement 3alaterites 3aleaves 3amicroirrigation 3aresearch 3aresearch institutions 3aIndia 0acoconut hybrid 0adrip irrigation 0agrowth and nut yield1 aMaheswarappa, H.

It consists of a circular crown of filter paper, soaked in a RTIL or a DES, placed upon a disposable screen printed carbon cell, so as to contact the outer edge of the carbon disk working electrode, as well as peripheral counter and reference electrodes. The electrical contact between the paper crown soaked in RTIL or DES and SPCE electrodes is assured by a gasket, and all components are installed in a polylactic acid holder. As a result of this configuration, a sensitive, fast-responding, membrane-free gas sensor is achieved where the real working electrode surface is the boundary zone of the carbon working disk contacted by the paper crown soaked in the polyelectrolyte. This assembly provides a portable and disposable electrochemical platform, assembled by the easy immobilization onto a porous and inexpensive supporting material such as paper of RTILs or DESs which are characterized by profitable electrical conductivity and negligible vapor pressure. The electroanalytical performance of this device was evaluated by voltammetric and flow injection analyses of oxygen which was chosen as prototype of electroactive gaseous analytes. The results obtained pointed out that this assembly is very profitable for the analysis of gaseous atmospheres, especially when used as detector for FIA in gaseous streams.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon electrodes 3achemical species 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aflow injection analysis 3agases 3aoxygen 3apaper 3apolylactic acid 3aprototypes 3avapor pressure 3avoltammetry1 aDossi, Nicolò1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2136-32601 aGiannilivigni, Emanuele1 aFattori, Andrea1 aSvigelj, Rossella1 aBontempelli, Gino1 aGiacomino, Agnese1 aDaniele, Salvatore0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Feb. 03, v. 92, no. 5 p.3689-3696dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b048183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245016400165520138100329592002801710650004101738650001601779650001501795650001601810650002601826653001801852653002701870653002401897653002301921700001501944700001401959700001601973700001801989700002002007700001302027700001802040700001702058773012502075856008502200852000902285655001202294IND60766323120221120123821.0220420e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076632312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2022.1067602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yang13aAn optimal goal point determination algorithm for automatic navigation of agricultural machinery: Improving the tracking accuracy of the Pure Pursuit algorithm  aThe development of precision agriculture requires the implementation of automatic navigation technology for agricultural machinery. Path tracking control as one of the key steps in automatic navigation technology has great research value. Pure Pursuit algorithm as a popular control algorithm for automatic navigation technology for agricultural machinery, the look-ahead distance is the key to the tracking effect, while the calculation of look-ahead distance has the problem that many influencing factors are difficult to be accurately described by mathematical expressions, which leads to the difficulty to select a suitable goal point tracking path. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a path tracking algorithm for agricultural machinery based on the optimal goal point. The algorithm simulates the look-ahead behavior of the driver and searches for optimal goal point in the look-ahead area according to the evaluation function. The objective of the study is to minimize the lateral error and heading error to achieve the adaptive optimization of the goal point. Finally, the feasibility of the algorithm proposed in this paper was verified in simulations and bumpy field tests under various different conditions, with tracking errors reduced by more than 20% compared to the pure pursuit algorithm. The tracking accuracy is significantly improved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural machinery and equipment 3aagriculture 3aalgorithms 3aelectronics 3aprecision agriculture 0aPath tracking 0aAgricultural machinery 0aLook-ahead distance 0aOptimal goal point1 aLi, Yankai1 aWen, Xing1 aZhang, Gang1 aMa, Qianglong1 aCheng, Shangkun1 aQi, Jian1 aXu, Liangyuan1 aChen, Liqing0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2022 Mar., v. 194 p.106760-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2022.1067603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245008700177520159500264592002801859650002901887650002301916650002501939650001201964650001101976650001201987650002201999650001302021650001202034650002002046650001602066650001302082650001902095650001702114650001802131650001802149650001002167650002302177650002502200650000902225653002102234653001302255653002302268700002302291700003302314700002302347700001902370700003702389773011602426856008502542961001202627852000902639655001202648IND60688242320221118100139.0200509e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068824232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2020.1181252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHakamada, Rodrigo Eiji10aInfluence of stand density on growth and water use efficiency in Eucalyptus clones  aWe examined the influence of stand density and genotype on transpiration and water use efficiency in high productivity plantations. Three widely planted Eucalyptus clones that differ in drought tolerance and productivity (E. urophylla, E. urophylla × E. grandis and E. grandis × E. camaldulensis, clones IP, B2 and C3, respectively) were measured at four densities (590, 1030, 1420, and 2950 trees ha⁻¹). Over the 1-year study period (1.5–2.5 years after planting), individual biomass increment decreased with increasing density, from 21 kg tree⁻¹ at 590 trees ha⁻¹ to 6 kg tree⁻¹ at 2950 trees ha⁻¹. Stand increment typically follows the reverse pattern, increasing as density increases. This was the case for two clones (IP and B2), but stand increment was consistent across tree spacings for C3. Transpiration increased with density, from a low of 622 mm yr⁻¹ to a high of 879 mm y⁻¹. Some of the increased water use resulted from higher leaf area index at higher densities. The B2 clone transpired the most water on average, produced the greatest increment (23 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ for 1030 trees ha⁻¹), and produced the most wood L⁻¹ transpiration (water use efficiency, 2.3 g biomass L⁻¹). The clone C3 had the lowest increment (only 12 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) because of the combination of low transpiration and low water use efficiency (only 1.5 g biomass L⁻¹). Optimizing clone selection and silviculture for the combination of high yield and high water use efficiency may help reduce risks from drought as well as water conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus camaldulensis 3aEucalyptus grandis 3aEucalyptus urophylla 3abiomass 3aclones 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agenotype 3ahybrids 3aleaf area index 3aplantations 3aplanting 3arisk reduction 3asilviculture 3astand density 3atranspiration 3atrees 3awater conservation 3awater use efficiency 3awood 0aPlanting density 0aStocking 0aClonal plantations1 aHubbard, Robert M.1 aMoreira, Gabriela Gonçalves1 aStape, José Luiz,1 aCampoe, Otavio1 aFerraz, Silvio Frosini de Barros0 tForest ecology and management.g2020 June 15, v. 466 p.118125-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.1181253Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03529naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245018800168506011700356506007600473520176300549592002802312506003702340650002102377650002602398650001602424650001402440650003802454650001202492650001002504650001502514650004802529650001702577651000902594653002602603653001402629653002102643653001802664653001302682700002402695700002802719700002402747700001802771700002702789700001902816773009302835856008602928852000903014655001203023IND60788739920221207142405.0220914e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078873992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e102302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 afathi, Javad10aEvaluation of aminoglycoside modifying enzymes, SCCmec, coagulase gene and PCR-RFLP coagulase gene typing of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from hospitals in Shiraz, southwest of Iran  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStaphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen that causes various infections. Aminoglycosides are broad-spectrum antibiotics used to treat methicillinresistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections. Typing of S. aureus isolates by coagulase gene typing and PCR-RFLP coa gene is a fast and suitable method for epidemiological studies. Aim of the present study was to evaluate the resistance to aminoglycosides, staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec) types, coagulation typing and PCR-RFLP coa gene in clinical isolates of S. aureus. 192 S. aureus isolates were collected from Namazi and Shahid Faghihi hospitals. Antibiotic resistance was measured by disk diffusion method and MIC was determined for gentamicin. The presence of genes encoding aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (AME) and mecA gene were assessed by PCR. Also the coagulase typing, PCR-RFLP coa gene, and SCCmec typing were performed. Out of 192 isolated S. aureus isolates, 83 (43.2%) MRSA isolates were identified. In this study, a high resistance to streptomycin and gentamicin (98.7%) were observed. Among the AME genes, the aac (6′)-Ie-aph (2″) gene was the most common. Based on the SCCmec typing, it was determined that the prevalence of SCCmec type III (45.8%) was highest. From the amplification of the coa gene, 5 different types were obtained. Also, in digestion of coa gene products by HaeIII enzyme, 10 different RFLP patterns were observed. According to this study, aminoglycoside resistance is increasing among MRSA isolates. As a result, monitoring and control of aminoglycoside resistance can be effective in the treatment of MRSA isolates. Also, typing of S. aureus isolates based on coagulase gene polymorphism is a suitable method for epidemiological studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal pathogens 3aantibiotic resistance 3acoagulation 3adigestion 3adisk diffusion antimicrobial test 3aenzymes 3agenes 3agentamicin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3astreptomycin 3aIran 0aStaphylococcus aureus 0aAMEs gene 0aCoagulase typing 0aSCCmec typing 0aRFLP coa1 aHashemizadeh, Zahra1 aDehkordi, Reza Solymani1 aBazargani, Abdollah1 aJavadi, Kasra1 aHosseini-Nave, Hossein1 aHadadi, Mahtab0 tHeliyon.g2022 Aug., v. 8, no. 8 p.e10230-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e102303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245016000161520145700321592002801778650003301806650002601839650001301865650002201878650002301900650001201923650002701935650002801962650002201990653004602012653001702058653003102075653002302106700001802129700001302147700001702160700001702177773011302194856008202307852000902389655001202398IND60759725520221118041303.0220103e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075972552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2021.1083002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Lin10aHighly efficient synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant chiral 3-N-substituted-azacyclic alcohols using two enantiocomplementary short chain dehydrogenases  aBioreductions catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) play an important role in the synthesis of chiral alcohols. In this study, we reported two stereocomplementary alcohol dehydrogenases from Flavobacterium psychrophilum (FpADH) and Flavobacterium sp. (FsADH), which showed the potential industrial application in highly efficient synthesis of a series of enantiomerically pure 3-N-substituted-azacyclic alochols. Both the enzymes showed high catalytic activity toward the model substrate N-Boc-4-piperidone (NBPO) and presented a strict enantioselectivity for the corresponding alcohol products. In addition, both enzymes showed broad substrate scope, including ketoesters, acryl ketones, and heterocyclic ketones. Using glucose dehydrogenase coexpressed with each of the enzymes to realize the efficient coenzyme recycling, various pharmaceutically relevant chiral 3-N-Boc azacyclic alcohols were asymmetrically synthesized at high substrate concentrations (343.7–643.8 g/L) and low equilvelent of NADP⁺ (0.1 mM) with excellent enantioselectivity (> 99.5% e.e), which have met the requirements of biocatalytic processes in the industry, and demonstrated the feasibility of FpADH and FsADH for industrial application in the biotransformation of chiral 3-N-substituted-azacyclic alcohols. The molecular basis of the enantioselectivity and catalytic efficiency of both enzymes were revealed the by molecular docking and MD simulation analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFlavobacterium psychrophilum 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aalcohols 3abiotransformation 3aenantioselectivity 3aglucose 3aheterocyclic compounds 3aindustrial applications 3asimulation models 0aChiral 3-N-substituted azacyclic alcohols 0aBioreduction 0ashort chain dehydrogenases 0aN-Boc-3-piperidone1 aZhang, Yiping1 aLiu, Yan1 aWang, Hualei1 aWei, Dongzhi0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2022 Jan., v. 178 p.108300-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2021.1083003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012400167520154600291592002801837650000801865650001301873650001201886650001201898650002001910650001401930650002001944650001001964650002001974650002001994650001702014650001502031650002602046650001802072653002302090653001902113653002502132653001702157653002402174700001702198700001502215700002002230773010302250856008502353852000902438655001202447IND60685104420221116234033.0220411e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068510442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1093012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Mengsi10aOptimizing supply airflow and its distribution between primary and secondary air in a forced-draft biomass pellet stove  aForced-draft biomass stoves improve the pollutant emission performance of biomass combustion. The parameters of supply airflow and its distribution between primary air (PA) and secondary air (SA) have a significant effect on the performance of this stove type. In this study, we designed an air supply control system to accurately quantify the airflow rates, and monitored the dynamic emissions of focused pollutant species including carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), particulate matter (PM₂.₅), and the fuel burning rate. The tested stove had a combustion structure typical of many popular stoves, and wood pellets were the burning fuel. Three total airflow rates (92 L/min, 184 L/min, and 276 L/min) were selected, and six distributions between PA and SA (PA:SA) for each airflow rate were tested, which included 10:0 (full PA), 8:2, 6:4, 5:5, 4:6, and 2:8. The results showed that the test duration, burning rate, and pollutant (CO, NOₓ, and PM₂.₅) emission performances of different airflows or distributions varied. Overall, when the PA and SA distribution mode was determined, the total airflow rate of 184 L/min was the optimal supply airflow rate. Under the same total airflow rate, the burning and emission performances were better when the primary and secondary airflows were similar, namely from 4:6 to 6:4. This study provided core information about stove air supply and distribution, which is essential to quantitatively determine the stove air supply mode to significantly improve stove performances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair flow 3abiomass 3aburning 3acarbon monoxide 3aemissions 3afuel combustion 3afuels 3aheating systems 3anitrogen oxides 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3aquantitative analysis 3awood products 0aForced-draft stove 0aBiomass pellet 0aAirflow distribution 0aBurning rate 0aPollutant emissions1 aLi, Pengchao1 aShan, Ming1 aYang, Hsu-tung,0 tEnvironmental research.g2020 May, v. 184 p.109301-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1093013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02130naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008100171520099200252592002801244650002601272650002101298650001701319650003001336650001101366650001001377650001201387650001401399650001701413651001801430653001601448653001701464653001601481653002201497700002401519773010701543856008501650852000901735655001201744IND60759725720221118041359.0220124e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075972572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.parint.2021.1025262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngrisano, Fiona10aPlasmodium vivax – How hidden reservoirs hinder global malaria elimination  aPlasmodium vivax is the most geographically widespread human malaria parasite. Global malaria efforts have been less successful at reducing the burden of P. vivax compared to P. falciparum, owing to the unique biology and related treatment complexity of P. vivax. As a result, P. vivax is now the dominant malaria parasite throughout the Asia-Pacific and South America causing up to 14 million clinical cases every year and is considered a major obstacle to malaria elimination. Key features circumventing existing malaria control tools are the transmissibility of asymptomatic, low-density circulating infections and reservoirs of persistent dormant liver stages (hypnozoites) that are undetectable but reactivate to cause relapsing infections and sustain transmission. In this review we summarise the new knowledge shaping our understanding of the global epidemiology of P. vivax infections, highlighting the challenges for elimination and the tools that will be required achieve this.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aPlasmodium vivax 3aepidemiology 3ageographical distribution 3ahumans 3aliver 3amalaria 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3aSouth America 0aHypnozoites 0aTransmission 0aElimination 0aHidden reservoirs1 aRobinson, Leanne J.0 tParasitology international.g2022 Apr., v. 87 p.102526-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12048x1383-57697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2021.1025263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012700165300001800292520112400310592002801434650001301462650001501475650001801490650001701508650002101525650001801546650001901564650002201583650000901605650001501614650002801629650001401657700001701671700001301688700001501701700001401716700005201730773012801782856008401910852000901994655001202003IND60685396120221122091109.0200303e20200207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068539612DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b048782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wei10aIn Situ Fluorescence Imaging of the Levels of Glycosylation and Phosphorylation by a MOF-Based Nanoprobe in Depressed Mice  ap. 3716-3721.  aElucidating the relationship between glycosylation and phosphorylation of protein post-translational modifications is of great significance for understanding most diseases. Mass spectrometry has been widely used in research of protein phosphorylation and glycosylation. However, to realize in situ and dynamic analysis of the levels of phosphorylation and glycosylation in cells and in vivo, mass spectrometry still has certain difficulties. Herein, a nano-MOF-based fluorescent probe with Zr(IV) and boric acid as the active center was designed and prepared. Fluorescence detection and imaging of phosphate is achieved through the specific interaction of Zr(IV) and phosphate. With aim to achieve specific recognition of glycosylation sites, the boronic acid group was modified in the MOF structure, and the fluorescence of the MOFs was regulated by the alizarin red. Thus, the glycosylation sites were recognized by the competition between alizarin red and glycosyl. Finally, the nanoprobe was successfully applied for in situ fluorescence imaging of the levels of glycosylation and phosphorylation in depressed mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalizarin 3aboric acid 3aboronic acids 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aglycosylation 3aimage analysis 3amass spectrometry 3amice 3aphosphates 3aprotein phosphorylation 3azirconium1 aLiu, Xiaolei1 aLi, Ping1 aZhang, Wen1 aWang, Hui1 aTang, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8712-70250 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Feb. 07, v. 92, no. 5 p.3716-3721dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b048783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008200170300001600252520122000268592002801488650002401516650002401540650001201564650002001576650001401596650001201610650001101622650002601633650001201659650001701671650000901688650001501697650002101712650001501733650001001748650001101758650000901769650000901778651001001787653002001797653000701817653002901824653000701853653000701860700003701867700002801904773012001932856008502052852000902137655001202146IND60335702120221119013310.0150729e20151003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6033570212DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2014.10037862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPastor, Jesus,10aHeavy-Metal Phytostabilizing Potential of Agrostis castellana Boiss. & Reuter  ap. 988-998.  aThe soils of many abandoned mine sites in the central region of Spain are heavily polluted with a number of different metals. Having frequently found Agrostis castellana growing at these old mine sites, this study was designed to assess its remediation capacity for this type of setting. In an initial field study, plant specimens were collected from 4 abandoned mine sites to determine pollutant concentrations in their roots and shoots. This was followed by a 4-year bioassay in a controlled environment in which soils collected from the mines were used to set up microcosms. Maximum root concentrations of the most polluting elements present in the bioassay were 3625 mg kg ⁻¹ Zn, 2793 mg kg ⁻¹ Cu, 13042 mg kg ⁻¹ Pb, 49 mg kg ⁻¹ Cd and 957 mg kg ⁻¹ As. These concentrations represent root bioaccumulation indices of over 1 and usually >2. In contrast, indices of transfer to above-ground phytomass were always < 1, indicating this species is a good candidate for use as a phytostabilizer. However, the high metal concentrations that could reach the above-ground mass of this plant determines a need for close monitoring and avoiding the use of areas under restoration for hunting or grazing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrostis castellana 3aaboveground biomass 3aarsenic 3abioaccumulation 3abioassays 3acadmium 3acopper 3afield experimentation 3agrazing 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amonitoring 3aphytoremediation 3apollutants 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil 3azinc 3aSpain 0aabandoned mines 0aCu 0aMediterranean grasslands 0aPb 0aZn1 aGutiÉrrez-ginÉs, María-Jesús1 aJesús Hernández, Ana,0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2015 Oct. 3, v. 17, no. 10 p.988-998dTaylor & Francisx1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2014.10037863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03534naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009100166520214800257592002802405650002102433650001502454650002302469650001902492650002502511650001802536650001702554650001102571650001102582650002402593650002002617653002802637653001602665653001502681653002902696653003602725700001502761700002002776700001702796700001502813700002102828700001802849773010302867856008502970852000903055655001203064IND60685104520221116234838.0220411e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068510452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1093022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Deqian10aBackwashing behavior and hydrodynamic performances of granular activated carbon blends  aOzone-biological activated carbon (O₃-BAC) process has been proved to be an efficient and cost-effective technology in advanced treatment of drinking water. However, O₃-BAC raises strict requirements in adsorption, hydrodynamic and regeneration performances, which one single activated carbon could hardly all-sided meet. Blending activated carbons seems to be an appropriate and economically feasible method to deal with the issue. Thus, the uniformity and stability of activated carbon blends during water treatment, especially in backwashing process are of great importance. In this paper, cyclic experiments of downward adsorption and upward backwash on 11 typical commercial granular coal-based activated carbons and their blends were carried out in column test. Hydrodynamic performances such as bed expansion rate and bed pressure drop were measured. The uniformity and stability of activated carbon blends were investigated by determining iodine number of samples collected from different heights of activated carbon bed. Then, both traditional regression methods and back-propagation neural network model were utilized to predict superficial velocity at 30% bed expansion rate and maximum bed pressure drop of activated carbon blends. The results indicate that water backwashing process has no effect on the composition proportion of activated carbon blends, and slightly changes the particle distribution of activated carbon bed regarding pore structure and adsorption capacity. A three-layer back-propagation neural network model for superficial velocity at 30% bed expansion rate yields mean relative errors of 2.17%, which is much lower than that given by traditional regression methods such as 5.53% (weighted average), 4.08% (linear) and 4.06% (polynomial). Moreover, the back-propagation neural network model for maximum bed pressure drop yields mean relative errors of 1.37%, which is much lower than that given by traditional regression methods such as 4.31% (weighted average), 4.28% (linear) and 4.22% (polynomial). The non-linear relationships can be accurately identified by the back-propagation neural network model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3acost effectiveness 3adrinking water 3aeconomic feasibility 3ahydrodynamics 3aiodine value 3amixing 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3awater treatment 0aActivated carbon blends 0aBackwashing 0aUniformity 0aHydrodynamic performance 0aBack-propagation neural network1 aXie, Qiang1 aHuang, Xiaoqing1 aWan, Chaoran1 aDeng, Feng1 aLiang, Dingcheng1 aLiu, Jinchang0 tEnvironmental research.g2020 May, v. 184 p.109302-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1093023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245012000180506002800300520133800328592002801666506003701694653002001731653001801751653002001769653002001789700002701809700002701836700003001863700002801893700002901921773011301950856008702063852000902150655001202159IND60784536220221207123835.0211103s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078453622DNAL7 a10.17268/sci.agropecu.2021.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCayotopa-Torres, José 10aNuevos agentes de biorremediación de cadmio: Especies de Trichoderma nativas de la rizósfera de árboles de cacao  aResource is Open Access  aLa absorción de cadmio (Cd) por la planta de cacao y la mayor acumulación en granos, representa un problema para las exportaciones y la industria chocolateraTrichoderma spp. nativas con capacidad de remoción y tolerancia a Cd, colectadas del suelo rizosférico de árboles de cacao. in vitro fueron inoculadas 10 cepas Trichoderma spp. nativas en medio de cultivo papa dextrosa agar (PDA) contaminado con tres concentraciones de Cd (25 ppm, 100 ppm y 250 ppm) y en medio de cultivo papa dextrosa (PD) contaminado con 5 ppm de Cd.

As well, statistical model development is often limited by the lack of broad-scale repeated forest measurements needed to capture changes in 1 or more variables and the corresponding changes in forest dynamics (e.g., growth in diameter and height), while assuming other variables do not change, or their changes do not significantly affect the forest dynamics of interest. In many forested countries, comprehensive monitoring programs have amassed large amounts of diverse forest measurement data. Here we propose a new approach for using artificial neural network-based machine learning to synthesize spatiotemporal tree measurement data collected over a vast area of boreal forest in central Canada to model diameter at breast height (DBH)-height and DBH-height-age relationships for 6 dominant tree species. More than 30 potentially important stand structure, site, and climate variables were considered. We used an individual-based modelling approach by considering each individual tree measurement as an instance of the complex relationships modelled; together, broad-scale long-term monitoring data contain many such instances, representing considerable spatial and temporal scale variation in forest growth and growing conditions. Using this approach, we significantly improved DBH-height and DBH-height-age models. And the models developed allowed us to analyze the effects of environmental conditions or changes in these conditions on forest growth. This may be the first attempt at applying this type of approach, which can be used to more accurately model, for example, forest growth, mortality, and how they are affected by changing climate in a variety of forest types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3aboreal forests 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3adata collection 3aforest dynamics 3aforest growth 3aforest types 3amonitoring 3amortality 3aneural networks 3astand structure 3astatistical analysis 3astatistical models 3asustainable forestry 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3aCanada1 aYang, Hongqiang1 aMan, Rongzhou1 aWang, Weifeng1 aSharma, Mahadev1 aPeng, Changhui1 aParton, John1 aZhu, Huaiping1 aDeng, Ziwang0 tForest ecology and management.g2020 June 15, v. 466 p.118104-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.1181043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245017600172300001600348520171100364592002802075650001602103650001102119650001602130650001302146650001302159650000902172650001202181650001102193650002302204650001202227650001802239650001602257650001002273650002202283650001602305650001102321773010602332856005502438852000902493655001202502IND4479060720221120105048.0120418e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447906072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1479-8298.2011.00505.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aINOUE, Takenari10aEffects of temperature on the development of overwintering immature stages of the near‐threatened butterfly Leptalina unicolor (Bremer & Grey) (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae)  ap. 180-188.  aOverwintering larvae of multivoltine and univoltine populations of Leptalina unicolor were reared under various constant and fluctuating temperatures superimposed on a photoperiod of either 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness (LD 12:12) or LD 15:9. Diapause of the larvae terminated in midwinter (by early February). All the larvae of both populations pupated after two molts without feeding and the head capsule width of the final instar larvae was smaller than that of the penultimate instar ones. The photoperiod did not significantly affect larval development, but long‐day conditions (LD 15:9) hastened pupal development. The thermoperiod had a significant effect on the development of the multivoltine population. When multivoltine population larvae were kept under a low fluctuating temperature regime (cryophase/thermophase = 14/20°C), the period until adult eclosion was shorter than that under a constant temperature of 17°C. On the contrary, when larvae were kept under a high fluctuating temperature regime (24/30°C), the period until adult eclosion was longer than that under a constant temperature of 27°C. However, the univoltine population did not show such a reaction to the fluctuating temperature. The durations of final instar larva and pupa of the multivoltine population were shorter than those of the univoltine population. The developmental zeros of penultimate and final instar larvae and pupae of the univoltine population were lower than those of the multivoltine population. The head capsule width of penultimate instar larvae and the forewing length of adults of the univoltine population were larger than those of the multivoltine population for both sexes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHesperiidae 3aadults 3abutterflies 3adiapause 3aeclosion 3ahead 3ainstars 3alarvae 3alarval development 3amolting 3aoverwintering 3aphotoperiod 3apupae 3apupal development 3atemperature 3awinter0 tEntomological science.g2012 Apr., v. 15, no. 2 p.180-188dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1343-87867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1479-8298.2011.00505.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024003900136040001800175100002000193245016100213506007600374506003100450520140600481592002801887596008301915596004501998596004102043596005502084506003702139650002602176650001602202650001502218650001802233650002002251650001602271650001602287650001502303650002502318650001802343650001602361653002402377653002302401653001002424653003602434653002002470700001802490700002602508700001502534700002202549700001802571700002102589700002102610773011402631856008602745852000902831655001202840IND60746039620221207050438.0220118e20220105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074603962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1267122chorus7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1267122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFedorova, Ganna10aWater reuse for aquaculture: Comparative removal efficacy and aquatic hazard reduction of pharmaceuticals by a pond treatment system during a one year study  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aAquaculture is increasing at the global scale, and beneficial reuse of wastewater is becoming crucial in some regions. Here we selected a unique tertiary treatment system for study over a one-year period. This experimental ecosystem-based approach to effluent management included a treated wastewater pond (TWP), which receives 100% effluent from a wastewater treatment plant, and an aquaculture pond (AP) that receives treated water from the TWP for fish production. We examined the fate of a wide range of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in this TWP-AP system and a control pond fed by river water using traditional grab sampling and passive samplers. We then employed probabilistic approaches to examine exposure hazards. Telmisartan, carbamazepine, diclofenac and venlafaxine, exceeded ecotoxicological predicted no effect concentrations in influent wastewater to the TWP, but these water quality hazards were consistently reduced following treatment in the TWP-AP system. In addition, both grab and passive sampling approaches resulted in similar occurrence patterns of studied compounds, which highlights the potential of POCIS use for water monitoring. Based on the approach taken here, the TWP-AP system appears useful as a tertiary treatment step to reduce PhACs and decrease ecotoxicological and antibiotic resistance water quality hazards prior to beneficial reuse in aquaculture.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cGrantová Agentura České Republiky  cMinisterstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibiotic resistance 3aaquaculture 3adiclofenac 3aecotoxicology 3afish production 3ariver water 3atelmisartan 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater quality 3awater reuse 0aPharmaceutical fate 0aTertiary treatment 0aPOCIS 0aProbabilistic hazard assessment 0aBiological pond1 aGrabic, Roman1 aGrabicová, Kateřina1 aTurek, Jan1 aVan Nguyen, Tuyen1 aRandak, Tomas1 aBrooks, Bryan W.1 aZlabek, Vladimir0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Jan. 05, v. 421 p.126712-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1267123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007900168520123100247592002801478650003201506650001601538650001801554650001101572650001601583650001601599650001401615650001701629650001901646650002001665650002001685650002101705650003101726653001701757653003501774653000801809700001601817700001901833700001201852700001901864700001901883700001701902700001301919700001501932700001901947773011901966856008502085852000902170655001202179IND60759726020221118041243.0220124e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075972602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2021.1590902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Huijuan10aDECR1 directly activates HSL to promote lipolysis in cervical cancer cells  aFatty acids have a high turnover rate in cancer cells to supply energy for tumor growth and proliferation. Lipolysis is particularly important for the regulation of fatty acid homeostasis and in the maintenance of cancer cells. In the current study, we explored how 2,4-Dienoyl-CoA reductase (DECR1), a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase associated with mitochondrial and cytoplasmic compartments, promotes cancer cell growth. We report that DECR1 overexpression significantly reduced the triglyceride (TAG) content in HeLa cells; conversely, DECR1 silencing increased intracellular TAG content. Subsequently, our experiments demonstrate that DECR1 promotes lipolysis via effects on hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). The direct interaction of DECR1 with HSL increases HSL phosphorylation and activity, facilitating the translocation of HSL to lipid droplets. The ensuing enhancement of lipolysis thus increases the release of free fatty acids. Downstream effects include the promotion of cervical cancer cell migration and growth, associated with the enhanced levels of p62 protein. In summary, high levels of DECR1 serves to enhance lipolysis and the release of fatty acid energy stores to support cervical cancer cell growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acell growth 3acell movement 3aenergy 3afatty acids 3ahomeostasis 3alipolysis 3amitochondria 3aneoplasm cells 3aoxidoreductases 3aphosphorylation 3atriacylglycerols 3auterine cervical neoplasms 0aTriglyceride 0aHormone sensitive lipase (HSL) 0ap621 aZhang, Jie,1 aYan, ZhongKang1 aQu, Min1 aZhang, Gaojian1 aHan, Jianxiong1 aWang, Feifei1 aSun, Kai1 aWang, Lili1 aYang, Xingyuan0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2022 Mar., v. 1867, no. 3 p.159090-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2021.1590903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245013700179300001600316520114500332592002801477650003201505650004401537650002201581650002001603650001201623650001401635650002501649650002201674650001601696650001601712650001001728650001101738650001401749650002601763650001901789650001701808650001701825650001101842650003301853653002701886653001901913653001701932653003301949653003201982653001802014700002002032700002002052700005902072773010802131856008602239852000902325655001202334IND60525309220221118031001.0190318e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052530922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.09.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagalakshmaiah, Malladi10aStructural investigation of cellulose nanocrystals extracted from chili leftover and their reinforcement in cariflex-IR rubber latex  ap. 945-954.  aThe morphology and chemical composition of chili fibres were investigated. Unusual low lignin content was found when compared to other annual plants. High aspect ratio cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were prepared from these fibres by an acid hydrolysis treatment. CNCs extracted from chili leftover were characterized using FT-IR, AFM, TGA and XRD to access their functional, structural, thermal and crystallinity properties, respectively. The length and diameter of the chili leftover CNC were 90–180nm and 4–6nm, respectively, resulting in an average aspect ratio of 26. This high aspect ratio ensures percolation at low filler content which in turn results in high thermal and mechanical properties of the nanocomposites. These CNCs were used to prepare nanocomposite films using the highly marketing commercial latex called Cariflex-Isoprene (IR) by casting/evaporation in order to investigate their reinforcing effect. The mechanical properties of nanocomposite films were investigated in both the linear and nonlinear range by DMA and tensile test, respectively, and their morphology was studied using scanning electron microscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum var. annuum 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacid hydrolysis 3aannuals 3acellulose 3achemical composition 3acrystal structure 3aevaporation 3ahot peppers 3alatex 3alignin 3amarketing 3amechanical properties 3ananocomposites 3ananocrystals 3aplant fibers 3arubber 3ascanning electron microscopy 0aCellulose nanocrystals 0aChili leftover 0aAspect ratio 0aScanning electron microscopy 0aDynamic mechanical analysis 0aTensile tests1 akissi, Nadia El1 aMortha, Gérard1 aDufresne, Alain1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8181-18490 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 136 p.945-954dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.09.0963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04053naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002000158245017000178300001800348520146600366592002801832650001401860650002501874650001601899650001201915650001601927650002101943650004301964650001102007650001802018650001302036650001202049650001402061650000902075650004602084650003902130650001202169650007102181650004802252650007202300650006802372650006202440650000902502650002502511650007902536650002702615650006802642650002702710650002002737650006902757650004802826650000902874650001802883650001802901650005502919650002802974650001203002700002103014700002103035700002003056700002103076700002303097700002003120773013003140856004003270852000903310655001203319IND50064343320221120234912.0130327e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006434332DNAL7 a234008962pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.58822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Chun‐Hsu10aInfluence of different particle processing on hypocholesterolemic and antiatherogenic activities of yam (Dioscorea pseudojaponica) in cholesterol‐fed rabbit model  ap. 1278-1283.  aBACKGROUND: Nanoparticle processing is implicated in enhancing bioactive or nutritional compound release from raw foods. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether different particle processing might affect the lipid‐lowering activity of Dioscorea pseudojaponica (DP) and to investigate whether DP could be a potential functional food for prevention of atherogenesis. Its possible molecular mechanisms were also evaluated. RESULTS: The results indicated that 50 mesh‐size DP (50 mesh DP) particles exhibited stronger effects than nanoscale DP (nano DP) particles in terms of lowering the level of serum cholesterol as well as reducing the extent of fatty liver and aortic fatty streak. Moreover, both DP particle types, particularly 50 mesh DP, significantly activated AMPK (5′‐adenosine monophosphate‐activated protein kinase) and deactivated ACC (acetyl‐CoA carboxylase), as demonstrated by the increased levels of both enzymes in their phosphorylated form. Coincidently, high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed a higher content (P < 0.01) of dioscin, a known lipid‐lowering compound, in 50 mesh DP than in nano DP. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that improper processing conditions will lead to the decomposition of bioactive components in yam. They also demonstrate for the first time that the lipid‐lowering mechanisms of DP may occur through the AMPK–ACC pathway. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aDioscorea 3acholesteremic effect 3acholesterol 3aenzymes 3afatty liver 3afunctional foods 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aproteins 3arabbits 3araw foods 3ayams 2aAMP-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aAcetyl-CoA Carboxylasexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aAnticholesteremic Agentsxanalysisxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aAortaxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aAtherosclerosisxbloodxetiologyxmetabolismxprevention & control. 2aCardiovascular Agentsxanalysisxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aCholesterol, Dietaryxadverse effectsxbloodxmetabolism. 2aDiet 2aDioscoreaxchemistry 2aDiosgeninxanalogs & derivativesxanalysisxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aFatty Liverxbloodxetiologyxmetabolismxprevention & control. 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFunctional Food 2aHypercholesterolemiaxbloodxdiet therapyxetiologyxmetabolism. 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aMale 2aNanoparticles 2aParticle Size 2aPlant Preparationsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aPlant Tubersxchemistry 2aRabbits1 aTsai, Chia‐Hua1 aLiu, Fon‐Chang1 aFan, Ming‐Jen1 aSheu, Ming‐Jyh1 aHsieh, Wen‐Tsong1 aWu, Chieh‐Hsi0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2013 Apr., v. 93, no. 6 p.1278-1283dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.5882  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245009800162300001800260520154400278592002801822650002401850650002701874650001201901650002801913650001401941650002201955650002301977650001702000650001902017700001702036700001902053700001302072700001202085700001902097773012602116856008202242852000902324655001202333IND60568318720221123042111.0170505e20170504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056831872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b030092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhifang10aDoping-Concentration-Induced Ferromagnetism and Antiferromagnetism in In2S3:Dy3+ Quantum Dots  ap. 9648-9654.  aDiluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS) quantum dots have been researched extensively due to their potential applications in next-generation spin-based devices. Herein, the cubic In₂S₃:Dy³⁺ DMS quantum dots (3–5 nm) with different doping concentrations were synthesized via a gas–liquid phase chemical deposition method. The effect of Dy³⁺ content on the photoluminescence (PL) and ferromagnetism was investigated. The PL emission spectra exhibit a blue-shift compared with those reported previously due to the increased quantum size confinement and enhanced intensity attributed to the Dy³⁺ doping. The distinct and stronger room-temperature ferromagnetism is observed from vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) measurement. The coexistence of ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases and antiferromagnetic interation plays a dominant position after a certain doping concentration value can be further confirmed according to the zero field cooling/field cooling (ZFC/FC) curves. As revealed in the magnetic origin study from first-principles calculations, the ferromagnetism obtained arises not only from the Dy atoms but also from the In vacancies. In addition, we also proposed a spontaneous mechanism based on the bound magnetic polaron theory to explain the change of saturation magnetizations along with Dy³⁺ doping concentration. This work provides experimental and theoretical guidance for designing and synthesizing unique spintronic materials, which can promote development of spintronic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aatmospheric deposition 3acooling 3aferrimagnetic materials 3amagnetism 3aphotoluminescence 3aphysical chemistry 3aquantum dots 3asemiconductors1 aYang, Tianye1 aZhao, Xiaojuan1 aZhao, Qi1 aYu, Hai1 aZhang, Mingzhe0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 May 04, v. 121, no. 17 p.9648-9654dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.7b030093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03297naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012800169500001900297520163600316592002801952650002301980650001002003650001002013650001602023650001002039650001602049650002002065650001302085650000902098650005002107650001502157650001202172650001402184650002302198650001202221653001002233653000902243653001702252653002602269653001102295700002102306700002102327700002102348700002202369700002002391700002202411700002402433700002402457700001802481700002002499773010602519856008502625852000902710655001202719IND60688242920221118100201.0200515e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068824292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.1086562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEclercy, Julie10aPCV2 co-infection does not impact PRRSV MLV1 safety but enhances virulence of a PRRSV MLV1-like strain in infected SPF pigs  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCo-infection by a type 1 modified live vaccine-like strain (MLV1-like) of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and a type 2 porcine circovirus (PCV2) was identified on a French pig farm with post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). An in vivo experiment was set up to characterize the virulence level of the MLV1-like strain compared with the parental MLV1 strain, and to assess the impact of PCV2 co-infection on the pathogenicity of both PRRSV strains. Six groups of six pigs each were inoculated only with either one of the two PRRSV strains or with PCV2, or co-inoculated with PCV2 and MLV1 or PCV2 and MLV1-like strains. Six contact pigs were added to each inoculated group to assess viral transmission. The animals were monitored daily for 35 days post-inoculation for clinical symptoms. Blood and nasal swabs were sampled twice a week, and tissue samples were collected during necropsy for viral quantification. Compared to MLV1-infected pigs, animals infected with the MLV1-like strain had increased PRRSV viremia and nasal shedding, a higher viral load in the tonsils, and lymph node hypertrophy at microscopic level. PCV2 co-infection did not influence clinical, virologic or transmission parameters for MLV1, but co-infected MLV1-like/PCV2 pigs had the most severe lung lesions, the highest viremia in contact animals and the highest transmission rate. Our study demonstrated that the MLV1 strain tested was safe when co-inoculated with PCV2 in piglets. However, co-infection by the MLV1-like strain and PCV2 resulted in increased virulence compared with that due to a single infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorcine circovirus 3ablood 3afarms 3ahypertrophy 3alungs 3alymph nodes 3amixed infection 3anecropsy 3anose 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3aviral load 3aviremia 3avirulence 3avirus transmission 3aviruses 0aPRRSV 0aPCV2 0aCo-infection 0aModified-live vaccine 0aSafety1 aLarcher, Thibaut1 aAndraud, Mathieu1 aRenson, Patricia1 aBernard, Cecilia,1 aBigault, Lionel1 aLedevin, Mireille1 aPaboeuf, Frédéric1 aGrasland, Béatrice1 aRose, Nicolas1 aBourry, Olivier0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2020 May, v. 244 p.108656-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.1086563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245007500210300001600285520185900301536012002160592002802280650000902308650001502317650001402332650001702346650001302363650001402376650001302390650001402403650002602417650002502443650001002468650001702478653002502495653002302520653001002543700001802553700002202571773013302593856008202726852000902808655001202817IND60778959420221117224443.0220603e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077895942DNAL7 a10.1177/1098612X2110331822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMérindol, Isabelle1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2919-368110aFeline urinary incontinence: a retrospective case series (2009–2019)  ap. 506-516.  aThe objective of this retrospective study was to describe the feline population presented for urinary incontinence at a veterinary teaching hospital between 2009 and 2019, with a particular focus on cats with a non-neurologic underlying cause. The medical records of cats diagnosed with urinary incontinence were retrospectively evaluated. Signalment, clinical presentation, results of diagnostic tests, diagnosis of the underlying cause and treatments were recorded. When information was available, outcome was recorded and follow-ups divided into three time frames (0–1 week, 1 week to 3 months and >3 months). Thirty-five cats were presented with urinary incontinence. Of these, 18 cats with complete medical records presented urinary incontinence of non-neurologic origin. The most common clinical signs at presentation were urine leakage while resting (12/18), urine-soiled perineum (8/18), urine dribbling (8/18) and no spontaneous micturition (5/18). The most common underlying cause was urethral obstruction (67%; 12/18), with a majority due to urethral strictures (58%; 7/12). Other causes were suspected inflammation (2/12), neoplasia (1/12), urolithiasis (1/12) and foreign body (1/12). In 8/10 cats in which it was performed, cystoscopy and contrast cystourethrography were the methods that led to the diagnosis. Twelve cats with urethral obstruction underwent interventional procedures, resulting in complete resolution of incontinence in 7/12 and improvement in 1/12. Urinary tract infection was a common complication after 3 months (4/18). When incontinence of non-neurologic origin is suspected in a cat, urethral obstruction should be considered.

In many jurisdictions governments at local, state and national levels are taking action to tackle some of the key challenges confronting food systems through a range of regulatory, legislative and fiscal measures. This article comprises a narrative review summarising recent relevant literature with a focus on the intersection between corporate power and public health. The review sought to identify some of the principal barriers for the design and support of healthy food systems and environments, as well as key reforms that can be adopted to address these barriers, with a focus on the role of local governments. RECENT FINDINGS: The review found that, where permitted to do so by authorising legislative and regulatory frameworks, and where political and executive leadership prioritises healthy and sustainable food systems, local governments have demonstrated the capacity to exercise legislative and regulatory powers, such as planning powers to constrain the expansion of the fast food industry. In doing so, they have been able to advance broader goals of public health and wellbeing, as well as support the strengthening and expansion of healthy and sustainable food systems. Whilst local governments in various jurisdictions have demonstrated the capacity to take effective action to advance public health and environmental goals, such interventions take place in the context of a food system dominated by the corporate determinants of health. Accordingly, their wider health-promoting impact will remain limited in the absence of substantive reform at all levels of government.  aPublisher supplied data  aGA28845caustralian research council 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3afast foods 3afood industry 3agovernance 3ahealthy diet 3aleadership 3apolitics1 aReeve, Belinda1 aCharlton, Karen0 tCurrent nutrition reports.g2022 Mar., v. 11, no. 1 p.82-93dSpringer USwJournal:21580x2161-33117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13668-022-00393-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03320naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245009900166520168900265592002801954650001601982650001301998650001102011650000902022650002102031650002002052650001302072650001002085650002002095650002002115650001102135650001602146650002302162650001902185650002702204650001502231650001502246650002302261650001902284650001502303650002302318650001802341650002502359651001002384653003602394653001802430700001702448700001502465700002002480700001502500700001802515773011602533856008402649852000902733655001202742IND60688243020221118095603.0200424e20200630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068824302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1061642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yunfei10aEvapotranspiration partitioning and crop coefficient of maize in dry semi-humid climate regime  aGuanzhong Plain is one of the most critical maize production areas in Northwest China. It is essential to study the maize irrigation requirement and improve water use efficiency in this area. There is a lack of knowledge about the evaporation portioning and irrigation requirements of crops grown in this region. Based on evapotranspiration observed in a maize cropland using the eddy covariance (EC) technique during four growing seasons (2013, 2014, 2015, and 2017), the seasonal variation of evapotranspiration components and the crop coefficients (Kc) for summer maize in a dry semi-arid area were determined. Energy partitioning has an obvious seasonal variation during growing seasons. The pattern of evapotranspiration partitioning has a clear seasonal variation with the development of the canopy. The pattern of the ratio of transpiration (T) to evapotranspiration (ET) is consistent with the canopy development. For four growing seasons, on a seasonal basis, the ratios of T to ET and E to ET were comparable. In addition, the locally developed crop coefficients were 0.57, 1.01, and 0.50 for the initial, mid, and late stages, respectively. The single crop coefficient derived from local datasets can provide a good prediction of ET. The Kc values reported in this paper were consistent with previous studies conducted in other regions using EC systems but were generally lower than the Kc values derived from ET data measured by lysimeters, the Bowen Ratio Energy Balance system, and the soil water balance method. This indicates that the variability of the locally developed crop coefficient caused by measurement methods is higher than the variability caused by climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBowen ratio 3aZea mays 3acanopy 3acorn 3acrop coefficient 3acrop production 3acropland 3acrops 3adata collection 3aeddy covariance 3aenergy 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3agrowing season 3airrigation requirement 3alysimeters 3aprediction 3aseasonal variation 3asemiarid zones 3asoil water 3asoil water balance 3atranspiration 3awater use efficiency 3aChina 0aEvapotranspiration partitioning 0aEnergy fluxes1 aCai, Huanjie1 aYu, Lianyu1 aPeng, Xiongbiao1 aXu, Jiatun1 aWang, Xiaowen0 tAgricultural water management.g2020 June 30, v. 236 p.106164-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1061643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006000152245010200212300001600314520159400330592002801924650001801952650001201970650001001982650001101992650001902003650001602022653001702038653001802055653003002073653002202103653001602125700002102141700005702162773009802219856008702317852000902404655001202413IND60564942220221117224728.0180830e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056494222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.07.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Min-Hsiung1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1740-248X10aPerformance investigation of an innovative vertical axis turbine consisting of deflectable blades  ap. 875-887.  aThe aim of this study is to investigate the performance of an innovative vertical axis turbine which possesses the blade-self-deflection function for ocean current and tidal energy application. The blade deflection is accomplished by interaction of blades and related mechanisms as the turbine rotates. To enhance the turbine performance, it is designed that the blade deflection not only increases the power output for a downstream blade, but also decreases the resistance for an upstream blade. The observation of the prototype in laboratory flume is displayed to validate the feasibility. Furthermore, a commercial code is employed to analyze the turbine performance. The velocity and pressure contours of the calculation domain are simulated to obtain the torque and power output of deflectable-blade turbine. Moreover, the results of performance analysis are validated by the experimental data.The detailed flow field analysis and hydrodynamic characteristic are reported as deflectable-blade turbine is driven by the water stream. The results show that the maximum and minimum total torque for this turbine occur at θ=45° and θ=75°, respectively as it rotates one-quarter turn. In performance comparison, the maximal power coefficient of the deflectable-blade turbine is 41.1% higher than that of traditional vertical axis turbine with fixed blades for stream velocity of 1m/s. Furthermore, the correlations of optimal angular velocity and maximal power output for the deflectable-blade turbine are obtained for current velocity from 0.6m/s to 2.2m/s for hydropower applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrodynamics 3astreams 3atides 3atorque 3awater currents 3awater power 0aTidal energy 0aOcean current 0aDeflectable-blade turbine 0aPower coefficient 0aPerformance1 aHuang, Guan-Ming1 aYeh, Rong-Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7299-94960 tApplied energy.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 179 p.875-887dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.07.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012900170300001800299520145600317592002801773650001601801650001701817650002101834650002301855650001901878650001401897650001801911650001101929650001701940650001801957650002201975650001501997650000702012700001802019700001802037700001702055700006802072700006102140773012802201856008402329852000902413655001202422IND60685396620221123012925.0200303e20200218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068539662DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b050282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrueger, Annika10aAntibody-Free Multiplex Measurement of 23 Human Cytokines in Primary Cell Culture Secretome Using Targeted Mass Spectrometry  ap. 3742-3750.  aCytokines are commonly measured by immunoassays; however, these have limited multiplexing capacity, are costly, and can exhibit cross-reactivity. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry is a robust method to quantify analytes with high specificity and multiplexing ability, hence we aimed to investigate its suitability as an alternative cost-effective method for cytokine measurement. Human keratinocyte conditioned media spiked with recombinant cytokines was used as an experimental system to evaluate sensitivity, linearity, and reproducibility of an MRM assay targeting 79 peptides representing 23 human cytokines. Our MRM method was able to identify 21 cytokines by two or more unique peptides and two cytokines by a single unique peptide. In a serum-free matrix, the median LOD and LOQ for cytokine peptides was 130 and 433 pg/mL, respectively. The presence of serum increased median LOD and LOQ by about 2.3-fold. The assay shows excellent replicate consistency with 8% intra- and 12% interday coefficient of variations. We found high pH reversed-phase fractionation a useful tool to increase assay sensitivity with the drawback of increasing its variability by approximately 10%. Overall, our results suggest utility of a multiplex cytokine MRM for routine measurement of secreted cytokines in cellular experiments under low serum conditions. Additional enrichment steps will be required in high complexity matrices such as serum.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3acell culture 3achemical species 3acost effectiveness 3across reaction 3acytokines 3afractionation 3ahumans 3aimmunoassays 3akeratinocytes 3amass spectrometry 3amonitoring 3apH1 aStoll, Thomas1 aShah, Alok K.1 aSinha, Rohit1 aFrazer, I.

In Venezuela, livestock infection represents an important veterinary problem whereas there appear to be few human cases reported, most of which are passively detected in health centres. However, results of recent surveys suggest that the situation may be underestimated in particular areas. To obtain a baseline for future fascioliasis assessment, studies were undertaken by means of rDNA ITS-2 and ITS-1 and mtDNA cox1 sequencing to clarify the specific status of Venezuelan lymnaeids, their geographical distribution and fascioliasis transmission capacity, by comparison with other American countries and other continents. RESULTS: Results obtained completely change the lymnaeid scenario known so far. The relatively rich lymnaeid fauna of Venezuela has been proven to include (i) Lymnaea meridensis and L. neotropica as the only native members, (ii) L. cubensis and Pseudosuccinea columella introduced from the Caribbean area, and (iii) Galba truncatula and L. schirazensis introduced from the Old World. The absence of representatives of the stagnicoline and Radix groups is remarkable. Four species are fascioliasis vectors: G. truncatula, L. cubensis and L. neotropica, which have the capacity to give rise to human endemic areas, and P. columella, which is a source of animal infection and is responsible for the spread of disease. Vector capacity in the apparently highland endemic L. meridensis is to be confimed, although may be expected given its phylogenetic relationships. Similarly as elsewhere, the non-transmitting L. schirazensis has been confused with L. cubensis, also with G. truncatula and possibly with L. neotropica. CONCLUSIONS: The new scenario leads to the re-opening of many disease aspects. In Venezuela, altitude appears to be the main factor influencing fascioliasis distribution. Human infection shows an altitude pattern similar to other Andean countries, although a differing highland/lowland impact on animal infection does not appear evident. The overlap of G. truncatula, L. cubensis and probably also L. neotropica in temperate and cold zones suggests a higher risk for human infection in mid and high altitude areas. A lymnaeid species mapping by means of DNA markers becomes a priority to determine human and animal fascioliasis distribution in Venezuela, owing to the importance of lymnaeid vectors in defining transmission and epidemiological patterns.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLymnaea 3aaltitude 3acold zones 3afascioliasis 3afauna 3agenetic markers 3ageographical distribution 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alivestock 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphylogeny 3apublic health 3aribosomal DNA 3arisk 3asequence analysis 3asurveys 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDisease Vectorsxclassification 2aFasciola hepaticaxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aFascioliasisxparasitologyxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aHumans 2aLivestockxparasitology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSnailsxclassificationxgeneticsxparasitology. 3aAndes region 3aCaribbean 3aVenezuela 0aVenezuela1 aGonzález, L Carolina1 aArtigas, Patricio1 aMas-Coma, Santiago0 tParasites & vectors.g2011 Dec., v. 4, no. 1 p.447-447dSpringer-Verlagx1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-4-200  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245013600172300001100308520169500319592002802014650002302042650002802065650000902093650002302102650001802125650002102143650001802164650001902182650001802201650002502219651001502244700001602259700002002275700001902295700002402314700002802338700002802366773009902394856008302493852000902576655001202585IND60771514520221117222440.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077151452DNAL7 a10.1186/s40795-022-00517-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanna, Md.

This study aimed to determine factors associated with household food insecurity and household dietary diversity among day laborers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 343 households of day laborers in Bangladesh using a semi-structured questionnaire. Household food security (HFS) and Household dietary diversity (HDD) scores were assessed using the HFS scale and household’s 24-h recall of intake of 12 food groups, respectively. RESULTS: The overall mean scores of HFS and HDD were 26.80 (SD, 4.83) and 4.08 (SD, 1.15). Having household head aged > 40 years and monthly household income > 5000 Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) were positively associated with HDD scores. Having an education level above secondary, monthly household income > 5000 BDT, and having a refrigerator were associated with the higher HFS scores, whereas having family members > 5 was a potential determinant of lower HFS scores. Pandemic-induced work loss and food scarcity were also potential determinants of lower HFS and HDD scores. Approximately 94% of respondents reported their wages were reduced, and 76% were deprived of the same quantity of food as pre-pandemic periods. CONCLUSIONS: Lower socio-economic status and pandemic-induced work loss affect the HFS and HDD. Interventions with financial aid and complemented food distributions, particularly among the wage looser, may improve the HFS and HDD of day laborers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3across-sectional studies 3adiet 3aeducational status 3afood security 3ahousehold income 3apublic health 3aquestionnaires 3arefrigerators 3asocioeconomic status 3aBangladesh1 aSayeed, Abu1 aKundu, Satyajit1 aKagstrom, Anna1 aSultana, Mst.

Recently, iron-based materials have been widely used to enhance denitrification and considered to be one of the potential methods for efficient treatment of low C/N ratio wastewater. However, the substance cycles between iron, nitrogen and phosphorus are complicated, the reviews about iron-enhanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance needs to be further concluded. The objective of this review is to discuss the role of iron in nitrogen and phosphorus removal, and to provide theoretical support for improving effiencies of wastewater treatment to a certain extent. Firstly, the biological or biochemical processes of iron-mediated nitrogen and phosphorus removal were briefly summarized. The iron-mediated nitrogen removal efficiencies were significantly associated with some conditions affecting biological processes such as iron dosage, or the addition of electron shuttles. The removal pathways and iron dosage were the main factors related to N₂O emission. In addition, iron had a great influence on phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs) which participated in phosphorus removal. On subsequently, the effects of iron on microbial activity, including promotion and inhibition, were revealed, with the pathways through which iron affected microbes way discussed simultaneously. Thirdly, the combination of iron with other materials was introduced, with the removal efficiencies of composite materials summarized. It was found that iron-based materials showed several advantages when combined with available materials such as activated carbon and metals. Finally, as the challenges for the processes of iron-enhanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal were still present, some suggestions for future research were proposed in this paper. Overall, this review suggests that iron-based materials play a critical role in the biological removal process of nitrogen and phosphorus, which may improve the potentiality of their applications in biological technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3adenitrification 3aenvironment 3airon 3amicrobial activity 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aBiological nitrogen and phosphorus removal 0aIron-based materials 0aMechanisms 0aMicrobes 0aLow C/N ratio wastewater1 aHe, Shengbing1 aWu, Fei0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 June 25, v. 775 p.145137-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1451373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012300169300001800292520122600310592002801536650001501564650001401579650001301593650001701606650001801623650001001641650001901651650002001670650001401690650002101704650001201725650000901737650001301746650001401759650002201773650002201795650001001817650001301827653001401840653001901854653002601873700002301899700002301922700002801945700002601973700002101999700002302020700002102043700002002064700002602084773010002110856008602210852000902296655001202305IND60535004320221121191811.0190319e20140929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053500432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.07.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPion, Corinne10aCharacterization and immunogenicity in mice of recombinant influenza haemagglutinins produced in Leishmania tarentolae  ap. 5570-5576.  aThe membrane displayed antigen haemagglutinin (HA) from several influenza strains were expressed in the Leishmania tarentolae system. This non-conventional expression system based on a parasite of lizards, can be readily propagated to high cell density (>108cells/mL) in a simple incubator at 26°C. The genes encoding HA proteins were cloned from six influenza strains, among these being a 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic strain from swine origin, namely A/California/07/09(H1N1). Soluble HA proteins were secreted into the cell culture medium and were easily and successfully purified via a His-Tag domain fused to the proteins. The overall process could be conducted in less than 3 months and resulted in a yield of approximately 1.5–5mg of HA per liter of biofermenter culture after purification. The recombinant HA proteins expressed by L. tarentolae were characterized by dynamic light scattering and were observed to be mostly monomeric. The L. tarentolae recombinant HA proteins were immunogenic in mice at a dose of 10μg when administered twice with an oil-in-water emulsion-based adjuvant. These results suggest that the L. tarentolae expression system may be an alternative to the current egg-based vaccine production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania 3aadjuvants 3aantigens 3acell culture 3aculture media 3agenes 3ahemagglutinins 3aimmune response 3ainfluenza 3alight scattering 3alizards 3amice 3apandemic 3aparasites 3aprotein secretion 3aprotein synthesis 3aswine 3avaccines 0aInfluenza 0aHaemagglutinin 0aLeishmania tarentolae1 aCourtois, Virginie1 aHusson, Stéphanie1 aBernard, Marie-Clotilde1 aNicolai, Marie-Claire1 aTalaga, Philippe1 aTrannoy, Emanuelle1 aMoste, Catherine1 aSodoyer, Régis1 aLegastelois, Isabelle0 tVaccine.g2014 Sept. 29, v. 32, no. 43 p.5570-5576dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.07.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010700166520171300273592002801986650001602014650002002030650001602050650002002066653004202086653003102128653001902159653004502178653005002223700001502273700001502288700001402303700001402317700001402331700001202345773012502357856008502482852000902567655001202576IND60766324120221120201939.0220420e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076632412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2022.1067762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Xuchao10aCG-ANER: Enhanced contextual embeddings and glyph features-based agricultural named entity recognition  aIn recent years, deep learning has greatly improved the performance of named entity recognition models in various fields, especially in the agricultural domain. However, most existing works only utilize word embedding models to generate the context-independent embeddings, which is limited in modeling polysemous words. Moreover, the abundant morphological information in agricultural texts has not been fully utilized. Besides, the local context information needs to be further extracted. To solve the aforementioned issues, a novel enhanced contextual embeddings and glyph features-based model was proposed. First, the contextual embeddings were dynamically generated by the fine-tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) on the domain-specific corpus (e.g., agricultural texts), and then the multi-granularity information was obtained from the layers of BERT. Thus, the contextual embeddings not only contain domain-specific knowledge but also include multi-grained semantic information. Second, a novel 3-dimension convolutional neural network-based framework was designed to capture the contextual glyph features for each character from the image perspective. Third, a channel-wised fusion architecture was also introduced to further improve the ability of the convolutional neural network layer to capture local context features. Experimental results showed that our proposed model achieved the best F₁-scores of 95.02% and 96.51% on AgCNER and Resume datasets, which indicated the effectiveness and generalization of our model to identify the entities in cross-domain texts. The ablation study in many aspects also demonstrated the better performance of the proposed model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3adata collection 3aelectronics 3aneural networks 0aAgricultural named entity recognition 0aFine-tuning language model 0aGlyph features 0a3-dimension convolutional neural network 0aBi-directional long short-term memory network1 aLu, Shuhan1 aTang, Zhan1 aBai, Zhao1 aDiao, Lei1 aZhou, Han1 aLi, Lin0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2022 Mar., v. 194 p.106776-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2022.1067763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245012600165500002000291520159700311592002801908650002001936650001201956650002401968650001101992650002002003650001002023650002202033650001502055651001202070700001902082700001702101773011702118856007402235852000902309655001202318IND60771514620221117222407.0220325e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077151462DNAL7 a10.1002/vetr.13842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLangton, Thomas E. S.10aAnalysis of the impact of badger culling on bovine tuberculosis in cattle in the high‐risk area of England, 2009–2020  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Since 2013, badger culling has been part of the UK Government's strategy for controlling bovine tuberculosis (bTB) within a high‐risk area (HRA) in England. Government surveillance data now enables an examination of bTB herd incidence and prevalence, its headline indicators, within and outside cull areas over the period 2009–2020. METHODS: Analysis compared herd incidence and prevalence data from within and outside badger culling areas. A range of models (GLMs, GLMMs, GAMs and GAMMs) were used to analyse incidence and prevalence in culled and unculled areas using frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Change in incidence across ten county areas within the HRA for the period 2010–2020 was also compared. RESULTS: Analyses based on Defra published data using a variety of statistical methodologies did not suggest that badger culling affected herd bTB incidence or prevalence over the study period. In 9 of 10 counties, bTB incidence peaked and began to fall before badger culling commenced. LIMITATIONS: There are limitations around the data available on culling location, temporal information and other confounding factors. As such, further analysis of any future datasets that may be released on bTB levels in areas where badger culling has been implemented is warranted. CONCLUSION: This examination of government data obtained over a wide area and a long time period failed to identify a meaningful effect of badger culling on bTB in English cattle herds. These findings may have implications for the use of badger culling in current and future bTB control policy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3abadgers 3abovine tuberculosis 3acattle 3adata collection 3aherds 3aissues and policy 3amonitoring 3aEngland1 aJones, Mark W.1 aMcGill, Iain0 tVeterinary record.g2022 Mar., v. 190, no. 6 p.e1384-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45502x0042-49007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/vetr.13843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010700173520134300280592002801623650001601651650001601667650002301683650002401706650001301730650001501743650002401758650001501782650002501797650001301822650001701835650002201852651001201874653002101886653001501907653002101922653002701943653001701970653001301987700001902000700002202019773012502041856008502166852000902251655001202260IND60766324220221120201904.0220420e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076632422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2022.1067772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarszalek, Michael10aPrediction of multi-year winter wheat yields at the field level with satellite and climatological data  aLong-term yield mapping is key to Precision Farming and needs to consider yield-relevant factors such as the water demand and nitrogen uptake. For the prediction of winter wheat yields, we incorporated climatological data and daily crop water requirements (CWR), Sentinel-2 time series, and the derived indices such as the normalised difference red edge (NDRE), red edge inflection point (REIP) and the normalized difference water index (NDWI). These factors were evaluated by using stepwise linear regression (LR) and random forest (RF). Robust field data sets from 2016 to 2018 with weighed yields from three regions in southern Germany in the range of 49 dt ha⁻¹ to 102 dt ha⁻¹ were used for calibration and validation. Indices reflecting the field variability were not better suited for yield prediction than climatological data alone. A new approach using all raw bands of Sentinel-2 in combination with evapotranspiration and precipitation, delivered a reduced number of features and explained 84% of the yield variance with a RMSE of 5.6 dt ha⁻¹. Alternatively, the NDWI-based CWR merged all significant parameters into one feature and explained 79% of the variance with a RMSE of 6.46 dt ha⁻¹. A sufficiently precise prediction of yields at the field level could contribute to an optimised agricultural management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aelectronics 3aevapotranspiration 3ameteorological data 3anitrogen 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asatellites 3atime series analysis 3avariance 3awinter wheat 3ayield forecasting 3aGermany 0aYield prediction 0aSentinel-2 0aMachine Learning 0aCrop Water Requirement 0aWinter Wheat 0aNitrogen1 aKörner, Marco1 aSchmidhalter, Urs0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2022 Mar., v. 194 p.106777-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2022.1067773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03224naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245014000163300001800303520163900321592002801960650000801988650002201996650002502018650001402043650003502057650001602092650001602108650001602124650002002140650002202160650001302182650001602195650001302211650001802224650001502242650001502257650001502272700001802287700002202305700001102327700005402338700005802392700005902450773012802509856008402637852000902721655001202730IND60685396920221123001211.0200303e20200114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068539692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b051052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xun10aAmplification Strategy of Silver Nanoclusters with a Satellite-Nanostructure for Substrate-Free Assay of Alkaline Phosphatase by ICP-MS  ap. 3769-3774.  aAlkaline phosphatase (ALP) plays critical roles in signal transmission and cell growth/apoptosis. Its abnormal level in serum/cell is tightly related to diseases, thus, serum and cellular ALP detection is of great significance for disease diagnosis. Herein, a novel approach for ALP assay based on a satellite-nanostructure is developed by conjugating lanthanide upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) with silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) through DNA bridging. UCNPs serve as the cores to conjugate with DNA fragments, followed by assembly of AgNCs as the satellites on UCNPs surface through the AgNCs-cytosine affinity, to produce the satellite-nanostructure of UCNPs@DNA-AgNCs. The presence of ALP converts phosphate groups into hydroxyl groups at DNA helix, weakening the coordination of DNA with UCNPs. As a result, the satellite AgNC labeling on DNA fragments strips off the UCNP surface. Silver is quantified by measuring isotope ¹⁰⁷Ag with ICP-MS, which further derives the content of ALP by correlation to the number of AgNCs. A linear calibration range is obtained in 0.005–120 U/L with a detection limit of 1.8 mU/L. The distinct advantage of this strategy, on one hand, is the substrate-free feature that eliminates the intermediate process of substrate reaction, where the substrate activity decrease and its instability may significantly deteriorate the sensitivity. On the other hand, ALP triggers the production of a large number of AgNCs resulting in substantial amplification on ICP-MS signal to give a favorable sensitivity. This is the first attempt for ALP detection by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aapoptosis 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3ablood serum 3acalibration 3acell growth 3adetection limit 3adisease diagnosis 3aisotopes 3alanthanides 3amoieties 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aphosphates 3asatellites1 aCheng, Zi-Han1 aZhang, Shang-Qing1 aWu, Na1 aYang, Ting1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5517-56581 aChen, Ming Li,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8536-88641 aWang, Jian-hua,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2175-36100 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Jan. 14, v. 92, no. 5 p.3769-3774dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b051053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245006600171300001600237520127200253592002801525650002501553650001901578650001401597650001401611650002201625650002201647650002201669650001801691650001401709650001201723650001001735651001001745653000801755653000801763653000801771653002901779653003101808653001501839700002401854700002201878773007801900856008301978852000902061655001202070IND60561852020221119231127.0170713e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056185202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta-Campi, M.T.10aWhat are the determinants of investment in environmental R&D?  ap. 455-465.  aTo face the challenges posed by climate change, environmental R&D and innovation are critical factors if we hope to cut emissions; yet, investment in environmental R&D remains below the social optimum. The aim of this paper is to analyse the determinants of investment in environmental innovation and to detect the differences, if any, with the determinants of investment in general innovation. In addition, this paper examines the relationship between environmental innovation R&D expenditure and a range of policy instruments, including environmental regulation and other policy measures including R&D subsidies and environmental taxes. The empirical analysis is carried out for 22 manufacturing sectors in Spain for the period 2008–2013. To overcome problems of data availability, we construct a comprehensive database from different surveys. The main implications from our results are (1). Managerial strategy appears as a relevant driver of environmental R&D investments. (2) The establishment of a policy mix between environmental, energy and technological regulatory measures is recommended. (3) The promotion of self-regulation through actions that encourage companies to follow a policy that affects their energy efficiency and is environmentally friendly.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aclimate change 3adatabases 3aemissions 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental law 3aissues and policy 3amanufacturing 3asubsidies 3asurveys 3ataxes 3aSpain 0aO30 0aQ50 0aQ58 0aEnvironmental innovation 0aTax and demand instruments 0aPanel data1 aGarcía-Quevedo, J.1 aMartínez-Ros, E.0 tEnergy Policy.g2017 May, v. 104 p.455-465dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245016400168520112700332592002801459650002401487650001801511650001701529650002001546650001101566650001901577650004101596650001101637650002301648650002501671651001001696653001101706653001501717653001901732653001701751653003901768700001501807700001501822700001301837700001801850700001701868700001501885700001801900773010001918856008702018852000902105655001202114IND60783427920221121032557.0220824e20221201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078342792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1336722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Dai-xin10aHeadspace GC/MS and fast GC e-nose combined with chemometric analysis to identify the varieties and geographical origins of ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe)  aFood authenticity regarding different varieties and geographical origins is increasingly becoming a concern for consumers. In this study, headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-GC–MS) and fast gas chromatography electronic nose (fast GC e-nose) were used to successfully distinguish the varieties and geographical origins of dried gingers from seven major production areas in China. By chemometric analysis, a distinct separation between the two varieties of ginger was achieved based on HS-GC–MS. Furthermore, flavor information extracted by fast GC e-nose realized the discrimination of geographical origins, and some potential flavor components were selected as important factors for origin certification. Moreover, several pattern recognition algorithms were compared in varietal and regional identification, and random forest (RF) led to the highest accuracies for discrimination. Overall, a rapid and precise method combining multivariate chemometrics and algorithms was developed to determine varieties and geographical origins of ginger, and it could also be applied to other agricultural products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZingiber officinale 3acertification 3achemometrics 3aelectronic nose 3aflavor 3afood chemistry 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aginger 3aheadspace analysis 3aproduct authenticity 3aChina 0aGinger 0aHS-GC–MS 0afast GC e-nose 0aChemometrics 0aGeographical origin discrimination1 aZhang, Xia1 aGuo, Sheng1 aYan, Hui1 aWang, Jie-mei1 aZhou, Jia-qi1 aYang, Jian1 aDuan, Jin'ao,0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Dec. 01, v. 396 p.133672-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1336723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03492naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005100148245012400199300001800323520172500341592002802066596005902094650001802153650001902171650001802190650002102208650001602229650001902245650001902264650002402283650001202307650001502319650002602334650002602360650001502386650003302401650002402434650001202458650001502470650001502485650001902500650002502519650001802544650002102562650001302583700001202596700005102608700001202659700001302671773016202684856008302846852000902929655001202938IND60774606720221119135020.0221002e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077460672DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-021-03287-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5561-478810aAlpine soil microbial community structure and diversity are largely influenced by moisture content in the Zoige wetland  ap. 4369-4378.  aThe Zoige alpine wetland is one of the most sensitive ecosystems to global climate change. It is the largest alpine wetland in the world and currently suffers from serious drought and degradation. In this study, soil microbial communities of five soils with different moisture content were investigated by Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA. The results showed that soil acidity and the content of soil nutrients decreased with the decrease in soil moisture. The microbial richness indices (Chao1 and ACE) and diversity index (Shannon) were highest in the flooded wetland (FW) and lowest in the unflooded mound near the flooded wetland (UW). The relative abundance showed four dominated phyla among all the soil microbes in five soils: Proteobacteria (36.5%), Acidobacteria (26.1%), Actinobacteria (9.4%) and Bacteroidetes (5.8%). Moreover, Proteobacteria (51.4%) of UW was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that of other soils, while Actinobacteria (1.6%), Gemmatimonadetes (0.9%) and Nitrospirae (0.03%) of UW were significantly (P < 0.05) lower than those of other soils. Principal component analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that soil samples of UW differed most from samples of other soils. Proteobacteria was positively correlated with water-soluble phosphorus, while Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were negatively correlated with total organic carbon and total nitrogen. Our findings revealed that soils in transitional unstable state from flooded to aridification had the lowest microbial diversity, and drought led to long-term changes in the microbial community in the Zoige wetland, which may cause further degradation of alpine wetland ecosystem functions.  aPublisher supplied data  a41271094cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aAcidobacteria 3aActinobacteria 3aBacteroidetes 3aGemmatimonadetes 3aNitrospirae 3aProteobacteria 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental science 3amicrobial communities 3aphosphorus 3aprincipal component analysis 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil pH 3asoil water 3atechnology 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal organic carbon 3awater content 3awater solubility 3awetlands1 aQin, J.1 aSun, H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2343-70211 aJia, Z.1 aChen, Y.0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2022 May, v. 19, no. 5 p.4369-4378dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2208x1735-14727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-021-03287-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245023400162300001600396520140300412592002801815650001501843650001301858650001101871650001301882650002001895650001201915650001201927650000701939650005801946650001302004700001402017700001402031700001802045773009102063856007402154852000902228655001202237IND60439198120221120072941.0151024e199911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043919812DNAL7 a10.1007/BF024936672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVachirapatama, N.10aDetermination of Niobium(V) and Tantalum(V) as 2-(5-bromo-2-pyridylazo)-5-diethylaminophenol (Br-PADAP)-citrate ternary complexes in geological materials using ion-interaction reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography  ap. 601-606.  aA method for the simultaneous separation and determination of Nb(V) and Ta(V) as ternary complexes with 2-(5-bromo-2-pyridylazo)-5-diethylaminophenol (Br-PADAP) and citrate using ion-interaction reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C 18 column has been developed. The mobile phase compositions and pre-column complex formation conditions were optimised. Under the optimum conditions, the Nb(V) and Ta(V) complexes were eluted within 4 min with a mobile phase of methanol-water (50% v/v) containing 12 mM tetrabutylammonium bromide and 12 mM citrate buffer at pH 7, with absorbance detection at 600 nm.

The method was applied to the analysis of geological samples (granite, basalt and andesite) and the results for Nb(V) obtained by the HPLC method using standard addition calibration agreed well with ICP-MS analysis and with certified values for all materials. For Ta(V), good agreement with certified values was obtained for granite samples using standard addition, but interferences were observed for basalt and andesite which prohibited the determination of Ta(V) in these samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aandesite 3abasalt 3acitrates 3adetection limit 3agranite 3aniobium 3apH 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3atantalum1 aDoble, P.1 aYu, Z.

However, a unified framework for estimating their costs and potentials is still needed due to the wide technology choices, especially considering their economic feasibility under fuel and carbon price uncertainties. Therefore, this study has employed a bottom-up approach to analyze the costs and potentials of 32 key technologies’ new promotions during the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016–2020), which combines the conservation supply curve (CSC) approach and break-even analysis. Findings show that (1) these 32 technologies have a total coal conservation potential of 275.77 Mt with a cost of 238.82 billion yuan, and their break-even coal price is 866 yuan/ton.

DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: University affiliated hospital. MATERIAL(S): The granulosa cells from 8–10-mm follicles were divided into four groups: unstimulated PCOS granulosa cells (n = 12), exogenous FSH (5 ng/mL)–stimulated PCOS granulosa cells (n = 12), internal FSH (150–300 IU/d)–stimulated PCOS granulosa cells (n = 20), and control granulosa cells from non-PCOS infertile patients with regular menstruation (control; n = 29). INTERVENTION(S): Exogenous FSH was added into the medium of unstimulated PCOS granulosa cells. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT(S): The secretory levels and mRNA abundance of AMH, the mRNA and protein levels of AMHRII, and the luciferase activity of AMH. RESULT(S): Both the secretiory level and mRNA abundance of AMH were significantly enhanced in PCOS granulosa cells. They could be partially suppressed by FSH. The mRNA and protein levels of AMHRII in PCOS granulosa cells were significantly increased. However, they were not affected by FSH. The luciferase activity of AMH in PCOS granulosa cells was significantly amplified but could be suppressed by FSH. CONCLUSION(S): Enhanced promoter activity can cause excessive production of AMH in PCOS granulosa cells. FSH may inhibit the excessive secretion of AMH by suppressing the luciferase activity of AMH promoter, but it has no effect on AMHRII expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-Mullerian hormone 3acase-control studies 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3agene expression 3agranulosa cells 3aluciferase 3amenstruation 3amessenger RNA 3apatients 3apolycystic ovary syndrome 3asecretion1 aWei, Li-Na1 aLiang, Xiao-Yan0 tFertility and sterility.g2011 June, v. 95, no. 7 p.2354-2358.e1dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.03.0473Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01606naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245011800152300001800270520054700288592002800835650001400863650001500877650002100892650002300913650002300936650001300959650001900972700002000991700001601011700001601027700002301043773010601066856007501172852000901247655001201256IND60578772920221116153416.0170814e20141003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057877292DNAL7 a10.1021/ol50265192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jing10aSkeletal Rearrangement of Cyano-Substituted Iminoisobenzofurans into Alkyl 2-Cyanobenzoates Catalyzed by B(C6F5)3  ap. 5220-5223.  aAn efficient method for the direct conversion of cyano-substituted iminoisobenzofurans into their corresponding alkyl 2-cyanobenzoates has been developed.

Besides their characteristic retention times, anthocyanins can easily be identified by an HPLC examination of the kinetics of appearance and disappearance of their partial hydrolysis products. This method is also applicable to 3-deoxyanthocyanins which is demonstrated with an extract from the fern Blechnum brasiliense. The described method allows optimal resolution of complex anthocyanin mixtures in the fol­lowing sequence of elution: 3-sophoroside-5-glucoside; 3-rutinoside-5-glucoside; 3,5-diglucoside; 3-sophoroside; 3-galactoside; 3-glucoside; 3-rutinoside; 5-glucoside; aglycone, and finally the forms acylated with p-coumaric acid. Substitution in the B-ring of the aglycone structure is the key factor for the range of the retention time. Thus cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside elutes earlier (-38 sec) than pelargonidin 3-sophoroside-5-glucoside.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlechnum 3acyanidin 3acyanin 3aferns and fern allies 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrolysis 3ap-coumaric acid 3apelargonidin 0aAnthocyanins 0a3-Deoxyanthocyanins 0aPartial Hydrolysis 0aHigh Performance Liquid Chromatography1 aAkavia, Naaman1 aReznik, Hans0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 35, no. 7-8 p.533-538dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1980-7-8023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01383naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245009400161300002000255520035700275592002800632650001400660650002300674650001700697650000900714650001400723650001700737650002500754700001800779700002100797700001900818773012500837856007400962852000901036655001201045IND60641183620221122003655.0190505e20160912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064118362DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra19170c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Zhong Wei10aFacile synthesis of a Fe₃O₄/MIL-101(Fe) composite with enhanced catalytic performance  ap. 86443-86446.  aA magnetic porous material, Fe₃O₄/MIL-101(Fe), has been successfully fabricated by using simple ultrasound-assisted electrostatic self-assembly technology, and was demonstrated to be a highly active heterogeneous catalyst for the dimerization reaction of o-phenylenediamine (OPD) in the presence of H₂O₂via synergistic peroxidase-like activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adimerization 3airon 3amagnetism 3aporous media 3aultrasonic treatment1 aDai, Fu Qiang1 aHuang, Cheng Zhi1 aLi, Yuan-Fang,0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 12, v. 6, no. 89 p.86443-86446dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra19170c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03979naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245010200165300001400267520245500281592002802736650001102764650003102775650001702806650001902823650000802842650001702850650001502867650002402882650001302906650001302919650001502932650001802947650001902965650001602984650001203000653001503012653001903027653001503046653002003061700001703081700001903098700002103117700002003138700001903158700001703177700005803194773010403252856008403356852000903440655001203449IND60629826220221118124608.0190328e20190330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062982622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2019.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamargo, M.10aMolecular pathways of varicocele and its repair – A paired labelled shotgun proteomics approach  ap. 22-32.  aVaricocelectomy is associated to improved semen quality and sperm functional quality, but individual response is highly variable. Thus, a prospective study was performed including 25 men who collected a semen sample before and 12 months after subinguinal microsurgical varicocelectomy. Semen analysis, sperm functional analysis, and seminal plasma proteomic analysis was performed before and 12 months after varicocelectomy, and according to improvement or not of semen quality (positive and negative outcome). Varicocelectomy led to an increase in semen volume and sperm count, morphology, and mitochondrial activity. In the pre- vs. post-samples, 698 proteins were quantified – 91 differentially expressed after varicocelectomy. In the positive vs. negative outcome analysis, 647 proteins were identified - 151 differentially expressed in the negative outcome group and 30 differentially expressed in the positive outcome group. Tripeptidyl peptidase-1 offered a predictive value for outcome, with an area under a ROC curve of 84.5%. It seems TPP1 is an outcome predictor for varicocelectomy in adults. More importantly, this study demonstrates that the seminal plasma proteome is different in men with varicocele when compared to post-treatment samples from the same individuals. Understanding and monitoring the molecular mechanisms of semen may further establish therapeutic options for these men.Although several large-scale studies have demonstrated varicocele is unequivocally associated to male infertility, these same studies have also demonstrated that varicocele is not a determinant of male infertility. We have yet to answer the question of why don't all men with varicocele present with infertility. Varicocele treatment improves semen quality, but its results are variable, and one cannot know who will and who will not benefit from surgical treatment. Results from this study strongly advance a concept that our previous studies have shown: that men with varicocele present an inflammatory semen profile. We have further demonstrated that men operated for varicocele present a decrease in this inflammatory profile, and that when they do not, semen quality remains unaltered. Trypeptidil peptidase-1, a seminal protein, was 3-fold higher in men with a positive outcome after the procedure, when compared to men with a negative outcome. Therefore, inflammation seems to be a central point to varicocele-derived male infertility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3agene expression regulation 3ainflammation 3amale fertility 3amen 3amitochondria 3amonitoring 3aprospective studies 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asemen quality 3aseminal plasma 3aspermatozoa 3asurgery 0aProteomics 0aSeminal plasma 0aVaricocele 0aVaricocelectomy1 aIntasqui, P.1 aBelardin, L.B.1 aAntoniassi, M.P.1 aCardozo, K.H.M.1 aCarvalho, V.M.1 aFraietta, R.1 aBertolla, R.P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6892-92440 tJournal of proteomics.g2019 Mar. 30, v. 196 p.22-32dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2019.01.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02405naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245008700170520100500257592002801262650001701290650001001307650002301317650001701340650001901357650001401376650001101390650000701401650001601408650000901424650001701433650003401450653002301484653003401507653002301541653000701564653001001571653003701581700001701618700001701635700001301652700001701665700001501682700001801697773010001715856008701815852000901902655001201911IND60783428020221121022526.0220824e20221201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078342802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1336732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuang, Qibin10aUV-fluorescence imaging for real-time non-destructive monitoring of pork freshness  aThis study aimed to develop a cost-effective fluorescence imaging system to rapidly monitor pork freshness indicators during chilled storage.

R. Br. (Apocynaceae)  ap. 61-71.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCalotropis procera (Ait.) R.Br. (Apocynaceae), an invasive woody milkweed, has expanded its range in northern Australia affecting rangeland and pastoral productivity. While self‐compatibility should enhance the species range expansion, spread of C. procera is limited by the availability of larger wasp and bee species that are able to vector its solid pollinia. Pollination efficiency is thus likely dependent on both pollinator abundance and plant density. Calotropis procera flowers year round in Australia but fruiting is limited to the warm months of the year when pollinators are most abundant, indicating that seasonal regulation of reproduction may be due to pollinator limitation. We examine the propositions that C. procera reproduction is regulated by the interaction between plant population density and pollinator pressure and that low pollinator pressure causes low per capita plant fecundity. All pollinators belonged to Order Hymenoptera and pollinator composition was similar at six of the seven sites. Fruit production per plant (fecundity) was lower above and below intermediate densities (350–550 plants ha⁻¹) of flowering plants with evidence of a weak Allee effect at lower plant density. Pollinator visitation rates per plant were low at high and low plant densities, and greatest at intermediate densities, while pollen supplementation experiments showed that C. procera is pollen limited (Pollen Limitation Indexfᵣᵤᵢₜ = 0.9) even at intermediate densities. Pollen limitation caused by low pollinator pressure at low plant densities and pollinator satiation at high plant densities may account for these fruit production trends. Management should be conducted in the colder months when pollinator pressure is low and plants are not reproducing. In addition, where stand eradication cannot be achieved in one attempt, management should reduce flowering plants to below intermediate densities where the fecundity per plant is low.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllee effect 3aCalotropis procera 3aHymenoptera 3abees 3afecundity 3aflowers 3aplant density 3apollen 3apollination 3apollinators 3arangelands 3asatiety 3awasps 3aAustralia1 aGreenfield, Michele Lisa1 aMcConchie, Cameron A.1 aBellairs, Sean M.1 aLawes, Michael J.0 tAustral ecology.g2017 Feb., v. 42, no. 1 p.61-71dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59958x1442-99857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aec.124013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245006900209300001400278520093500292592002801227650002901255650001901284650002401303650002301327650001901350650001301369650002101382650001001403650001501413650001901428650001501447650001001462650001801472650001601490650002101506650001801527700001801545700006301563700005901626700002501685700006301710700006301773700001801836700003401854773012501888856008502013852000902098655001202107IND60629826320221118124639.0190830e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062982632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cosust.2018.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeurlincx, Sven1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6740-652110aTowards restoring urban waters: understanding the main pressures  ap. 49-58.  aWater bodies in the urban landscape are omnipresent, with many being small, lentic waters such as ponds and lakes. Because of high anthropogenic forcing, these systems have poor water quality, with large consequences for the provisioning of ecosystem services. Understanding of the main pressures on urban water quality is key to successful management. We identify six pressures that we hypothesize to have strong links to anthropogenic forcing including: eutrophication, aquatic invasive species, altered hydrology, altered habitat structure, climate change, and micropollutants. We discuss how these pressures may affect water quality and ecological functioning of urban waters. We describe how these pressures may interact, posing challengers for water management. We identify steps that need to be taken towards sustainable restoration, recognizing the challenges that potentially interacting pressures pose to water managers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate change 3aecological function 3aecosystem services 3aeutrophication 3ahabitats 3ainvasive species 3alakes 3alandscapes 3alentic systems 3apollutants 3aponds 3asurface water 3aurban areas 3awater management 3awater quality1 aKuiper, Jan J1 aHoevenaar, Ellen CM1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3567-50111 aLurling, Miquel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6726-79041 aBrederveld, Robert J1 aVeraart, Annelies J1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6286-74841 aJanssen, Annette BG1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5000-71611 aMooij, Wolf M1 ade Senerpont Domis, Lisette N0 tCurrent opinion in environmental sustainability.g2019 Feb., v. 36 p.49-58dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2237x1877-34357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2018.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245007100177300001400248520106700262592002801329650001201357650002001369650002001389650002201409650002201431650001501453650001401468650001801482700002101500700006001521700005801581700002101639700001801660700002101678700002001699700002001719700001801739700007301757773012501830856008501955852000902040655001202049IND60629826420221118124631.0190830e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062982642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cosust.2018.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Vliet, Michelle TH10aModel inter-comparison design for large-scale water quality models  ap. 59-67.  aSeveral model inter-comparison projects (MIPs) have been carried out recently by the climate, hydrological, agricultural and other modelling communities to quantify modelling uncertainties and improve modelling systems. Here we focus on MIP design for large-scale water quality models. Water quality MIPs can be useful to improve our understanding of pollution problems and facilitate the development of harmonized estimates of current and future water quality. This can provide new opportunities for assessing robustness in estimates of water quality hotspots and trends, improve understanding of processes, pollution sources, water quality model uncertainties, and to identify priorities for water quality data collection and monitoring. Water quality MIP design should harmonize relevant model input datasets, use consistent spatial/temporal domains and resolutions, and similar output variables to improve understanding of water quality modelling uncertainties and provide harmonized water quality data that suit the needs of decision makers and other users.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adata collection 3adecision making 3ahydrologic models 3amodel uncertainty 3amonitoring 3apollution 3awater quality1 aFlörke, Martina1 aHarrison, John A1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0677-54781 aHofstra, Nynke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0409-51451 aKeller, Virginie1 aLudwig, Fulco1 aSpanier, J Emiel1 aStrokal, Maryna1 aWada, Yoshihide1 aWen, Yingrong1 aWilliams, Dickq(Richard J.),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9876-04910 tCurrent opinion in environmental sustainability.g2019 Feb., v. 36 p.59-67dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2237x1877-34357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2018.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02193naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245007500158300001600233520076000249592002801009650001301037650001801050650002201068650001301090650002101103650001001124650001801134650001101152650001201163650002001175650001601195650001301211650001301224650001401237653004801251653001801299653001801317700001301335700001701348700001801365700001301383700001901396700001501415700001801430773015201448856007801600852000901678655001201687IND60523087820221122213336.0160605e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052308782DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-2007-1-2212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Shu10aNuclear-Localized Plastid DNA Fragments in Protozoa, Metazoa and Fungi  ap. 123-132.  aWe analyzed nuclear-localized plastid-like DNA (nupDNA) fragments in protozoa, metazoa and fungi. Most eukaryotes that do not have plastids contain 40-5000 bp nupDNAs in their nuclear genomes. These nupDNA fragments are mainly derived from repeated regions of plastids and distribute through the whole genomes. A majority of nupDNA fragments is located on coding regions with very important functions. Similar to plastids, these nupDNAs most possibly originate from cyanobacteria. Analysis of them suggests that through millions of years of universal endosymbiosis and gene transfer they may have occurred in ancient protists before divergence of plants and animals/fungi, and some transferred fragments have been reserved till now even in modern mammals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnimalia 3aCyanobacteria 3aDNA fragmentation 3aProtozoa 3aeukaryotic cells 3afungi 3agene transfer 3agenome 3amammals 3aplants (botany) 3aplastid DNA 3aplastids 3aprotists 3asymbiosis 0aNuclear-Localized Plastid-Like DNA (nupDNA) 0aEndosymbiosis 0aGene Transfer1 aSun, Xin1 aMu, Lin-Chun1 aLiu, Wen-Juan1 aLei, Tao1 aWang, Jian-Hui1 aDu, Jun-Bo1 aLin, Hong-Hui0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 62, no. 1-2 p.123-132dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-2007-1-2213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245007700163300001800240520140900258592002801667596009901695650002301794650002501817650004401842650001501886650001301901650001601914650001901930650002001949650001201969650002001981650003202001650001802033650002202051650000702073650001502080650001402095650001502109700002102124700001502145773016202160856008302322852000902405655001202414IND60774607120221119134733.0221002e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077460712DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-021-03305-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumari, R.10aExploring triclosan degradation potential of Citrobacter freundii KS2003  ap. 3565-3580.  aThe removal of triclosan from the environment is a very challenging task owing to its persistent nature and lipophilic property. Citrobacter freundii KS2003, isolated from wastewater sample collected from a healthcare setting, was exploited for effective degradation of triclosan. Cell elongation was observed as a major morphological change in this isolate, when grown in the presence of triclosan. One-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) approach was applied to optimize various nutritional and environmental parameters. Citrobacter freundii KS2003 degraded 99.57 ± 0.6% of 250 mg/L of triclosan in M9 MSM at 30 ℃ and pH 8 under static condition within 96 h of incubation. Mass spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the formation of non-toxic 2,4-dichlorophenol as the main by-product by this isolate. Ion chromatography revealed partial dechlorination of triclosan. Also, the cell-free extract of Citrobacter freundii KS2003 showed the activity of catechol 1,2-dioxygenase enzyme (specific enzyme activity = 0.159 U/mg). 4-chlorocatechol was used as an inhibitor of catechol 1,2-dioxygenase enzyme. The absence of triclosan degradation in the presence of inhibitor suggested the involvement of dioxygenase enzyme in triclosan degradation by Citrobacter freundii KS2003. These findings proposed an ortho-cleavage pathway being followed by KS2003 for triclosan degradation.  aPublisher supplied data  aScheme no. 24(0340)/16/EMR-IIcCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi, India 3a2,4-dichlorophenol 3aCitrobacter freundii 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abyproducts 3acatechol 3acell growth 3adechlorination 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3ahealth services 3aion exchange chromatography 3alipophilicity 3amass spectrometry 3apH 3atechnology 3atriclosan 3awastewater1 aGhosh Sachan, S.1 aSachan, A.0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2022 May, v. 19, no. 5 p.3565-3580dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2208x1735-14727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-021-03305-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02199naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010500167300001400272520104700286592002801333650001201361650001501373650001501388650001501403650002201418650001601440650001601456650001301472651001001485653002201495653001801517653001601535653002201551653001401573653001101587773010901598856008501707852000901792655001201801IND50067170720221118032042.0190411e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006717072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2012.09.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBose, Purabi10aIndividual tenure rights, citizenship, and conflicts: Outcomes from tribal India's forest governance  ap. 71-79.  aThis paper examines how the new Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act 2006 shapes tribal households' claims to forest land rights in tribal India. It analyses the micro-dynamics of the Forest Rights Act using three dimensions: individual tenure rights, citizenship, and conflict to discuss the contested nature of household-level tenure rights to forest land. The arguments are based on data collected using in-depth semi-structured interviews from six Bhil tribal villages in Banswara district, Rajasthan. The findings indicate that the forest tenure reform promoted the individualisation of forest right claims – thereby increasing Bhil tribal inter-household-level conflicts – and that households' forest land tenure claims relate primarily to the formal recognition of their citizenship rights. The paper suggests that one of the priorities for a way forward is to work towards harmonising the government's own contradictory policies, and avoid competition between line departments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforests 3agovernance 3ahouseholds 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3aland rights 3aland tenure 3avillages 3aIndia 0aForest Rights Act 0aTenure rights 0aCitizenship 0aIndividualisation 0aConflicts 0aTribal0 tForest policy and economics.g2013 Aug., v. 33 p.71-79dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2012.09.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245011500160300001600275520115700291592002801448650002701476650001101503650001201514650001201526650001201538650001101550650001201561650001401573650001401587650001101601650001401612650000901626653002201635653002201657653002301679653002001702700002001722700001501742773015201757856007801909852000901987655001201996IND60522656620221116155943.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052265662DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1980-7-8072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPohl, W.

When the concentration of the divalent cations in the buffer was increased from 1 mᴍ to about 100 mᴍ the cation-concentration inside of the vesicles did not increase proportional to the outside concentration, but showed a saturation behaviour. The efflux of various cations mediated by ionophore A 23187 was measured and relative transport-rates were determined. The following sequence was obtained: Zn²⁺ > Mn²⁺ > Ca²⁺ > Mg²⁺ > Sr²⁺ ⪢ Ba²⁺ ≈ Li⁺ > Na⁺. The efflux of Ca²⁺ increased proportional to the square of the A 23187-concentration. To lecithin-vesicles containing ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA) inside different cations were added on the outside. In the presence of A 23187 divalent cations are transported into the vesicles and bound there by EDTA. During the influx of Me²⁺-ions into vesicles a H⁺-efflux was observed. The resulting pH-decrease was measured. The rate of the pH-change depended on the Me²⁺-ion used. The sequence was: Cd²⁺ > Zn²⁺ > Ca²⁺ > Mn²⁺ > Mg²⁺ ⪢ Sr²⁺, Ba²⁺.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3abarium 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acations 3alipids 3alithium 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3asodium 3astrontium 3azinc 0aIonophore A 23187 0aLecithin Vesicles 0aCation Specificity 0aProton Antiport1 aKreikenbohm, R.1 aSeuwen, K.0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 35, no. 7-8 p.562-568dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1980-7-8073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04105naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245011100186300001400297520185400311592002802165650002102193650002102214650002202235650001302257650001502270650001002285650004502295650003302340650001502373650000902388650006602397650001402463650002002477650001302497650001802510650008302528650005302611650004702664650003002711650003402741650001402775650003302789650002702822650002402849650007702873653001502950653001402965653002902979653001403008653002003022653001703042700001703059700003103076700002303107700002903130700002203159700002003181773013603201856008503337852000903422655001203431IND50060499020221118020415.0190416e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006049902DNAL7 a233328312pmid7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2012.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrun, Sophie10aMultilocus phylogeny and MALDI-TOF analysis of the plant pathogenic species Alternaria dauci and relatives  ap. 32-40.  aThe genus Alternaria includes numerous phytopathogenic species, many of which are economically relevant. Traditionally, identification has been based on morphology, but is often hampered by the tendency of some strains to become sterile in culture and by the existence of species-complexes of morphologically similar taxa. This study aimed to assess if strains of four closely-related plant pathogens, i.e., accurately Alternaria dauci (ten strains), Alternaria porri (six), Alternaria solani (ten), and Alternaria tomatophila (ten) could be identified using multilocus phylogenetic analysis and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) profiling of proteins. Phylogenetic analyses were performed on three loci, i.e., the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rRNA, and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd) and Alternaria major antigen (Alt a 1) genes. Phylogenetic trees based on ITS sequences did not differentiate strains of A. solani, A. tomatophila, and A. porri, but these three species formed a clade separate from strains of A. dauci. The resolution improved in trees based on gpd and Alt a 1, which distinguished strains of the four species as separate clades. However, none provided significant bootstrap support for all four species, which could only be achieved when results for the three loci were combined. MALDI-TOF-based dendrograms showed three major clusters. The first comprised all A. dauci strains, the second included five strains of A. porri and one of A. solani, and the third included all strains of A. tomatophila, as well as all but one strain of A. solani, and one strain of A. porri. Thus, this study shows the usefulness of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as a promising tool for identification of these four species of Alternaria which are closely-related plant pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria dauci 3aAlternaria porri 3aAlternaria solani 3aantigens 3adesorption 3agenes 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aionization 3aloci 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3aphylogeny 3aplant pathogens 3aproteins 3aribosomal RNA 2aAlternariaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aDNA, Fungalxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxanalysisxgenetics. 2aFungal Proteinsxgenetics 2aMycological Typing Techniques 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionizationxmethods 0aAlternaria 0aMALDI-TOF 0aMolecular identification 0aPhylogeny 0aPlant pathology 0aPleosporales1 aMadrid, Hugo1 aGerrits Van Den Ende, Bert1 aAndersen, Birgitte1 aMarinach-Patrice, Carine1 aMazier, Dominique1 aHoog, G.

Experiments were conducted by way of comparison under the N2 atmosphere. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), solid state ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance technique (¹³C NMR) and chemical titration analysis were used to semi-quantitatively or quantitatively determine the main functional groups in the coals. It was found that through the hydrocracking at 700°C, the summed yields of CH4 and C2H6 from two lignite coals reached as high as 21.2–22.9% (daf. coal), higher than those even from two subbituminous coals. This result was associated with the abundance of longer alkyl groups in two lignite coals. Two lignite coals were the most enriched with carboxyl groups, which was proved to be the principal precursor of CO2. The hydrocracking at 700°C allowed a distinct part of CO2 to convert into CO by the reversal gas water shift reaction, while the changes in the yields of H2O were indistinct. The hydrocracking at 700°C was also favorable for the production of BTX (benzene, toluene and xylene) and naphthalene. The simple linear regression was used to assess the correlations of the yields of main gaseous products (CH4, C2H6, CO2 and CO) and liquid products (H2O and BTX) obtained under varying conditions to some relevant coal properties such as volatile matter content and total oxygen content as well as to some structural parameters such as aliphatic ratio and carboxyl group content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abenzene 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3aethane 3alignite 3amethane 3amethane production 3anaphthalene 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxygen 3aregression analysis 3atitration 3atoluene 3axylene 0aDifferent rank coals 0aFTIR 0a13C NMR 0aHydrogasification 0aHydrocracking1 aZheng, Nan1 aWang, Jie0 tApplied energy.g2016 July 01, v. 173 p.438-447dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.04.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245015200160300001800312520126300330592002801593596005901621650001501680650001501695650002201710650001901732650001501751650002601766650001901792650001401811650001901825650002001844650001701864650001501881650003301896650002301929650001901952650001301971700001401984700005301998700001602051700001702067700001502084773016202099856008302261852000902344655001202353IND60774607420221119134922.0221002e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077460742DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-021-03283-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Y.10aDecolorizing brilliant green by mesoporous Pd–Fe magnetic nanoparticles immobilized on reduced graphene oxide: artificial neural network modeling  ap. 3935-3946.  aThe mesoporous Pd–Fe magnetic nanoparticles immobilized on the reduced graphene oxide were employed in the present work for the decolorization of toxic brilliant green in aqueous phase. The decolorization process was modeled using backpropagation artificial neural network and optimized by genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization. These magnetic nanocomposites were synthesized by the two-step reaction in aqueous phase method and then characterized with various methods. According to response surface methodology, the effect of operating parameters on the decolorization of brilliant green in aqueous solution was studied through batch experiments. On the basis of these experiments, the prediction ability of response surface methodology and backpropagation neural network method was assessed. The decolorization process follows Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetics. Furthermore, thermodynamics studies demonstrate that the adsorption of brilliant green onto the nanocomposites was endothermic and spontaneous. Overall, these mesoporous nanomaterials have the advantages of strong adsorption capacity and fast decolorization for brilliant green, and modeling of the removal process with artificial neural network was successful.  aPublisher supplied data  a21667012cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aadsorption 3aalgorithms 3aaqueous solutions 3adecolorization 3aendothermy 3aenvironmental science 3agraphene oxide 3amagnetism 3ananocomposites 3aneural networks 3aporous media 3aprediction 3aresponse surface methodology 3asorption isotherms 3athermodynamics 3atoxicity1 aQi, J.

Among the betaxanthins the corresponding derivatives of serine, threonine, ethanolamine, alanine, Dopa, phenylalanine and tryptophan are reported for the first time to contribute to the pigment pattern of fly agarics. Betalamic acid, the chromophoric precursor of betaxanthins and betacyanins, muscaflavin and seco-dopas were also detected. Furthermore, the red-purple muscapurpurin and the red muscarubrin were tentatively assigned while further six betacyanin-like components could not be structurally allocated. Stability studies indicated a high susceptibility of pigment extracts to degradation which led to rapid colour loss thus rendering a complete characterization of betacyaninlike compounds impossible at present. Taking into account these difficulties the presented results may be a starting point for a comprehensive characterization of the pigment composition of fly agarics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmanita muscaria 3aalanine 3abetacyanins 3acolor 3adihydroxyphenylalanine 3aethanolamine 3amass spectrometry 3aphenylalanine 3aserine 3athreonine 3atryptophan 0aAmanita muscaria 0aFly Agaric 0aBetalains1 aSchliemann, Willibald0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 62, no. 11-12 p.779-785dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:21135x0939-50757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-2007-11-12013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012300160300001600283520104900299592002801348650001101376650001601387650001101403650001701414650001501431650003101446650001001477650001101487650001401498650001301512700001701525700002501542700001701567700001801584773021201602856007401814852000901888655001201897IND50073197320221116174759.0150206e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007319732DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.123632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Doo‐Jee10aDecreased fat accumulation in 3T3‐L1 pre‐adipocytes treated with extracts of heat‐processed soy flour and breads  ap. 759-767.  aThe potential anti‐adipogenic effects of gluten‐free soy breads made from germinated soybean (GS), steamed soybean (SS) or roasted soybean (RS) were evaluated in an in vitro adipocyte cell model. GS and RS increased the total phenolic (TP) and total flavonoid (TF) contents of flours compared with the raw soybean (NS) flour. RS and GS had the highest TP (1.04 GAE mg g⁻¹) and TF (0.92 CAE mg g⁻¹) contents. Baking increased the TP content of breads, 0.09–0.26 GAE mg g⁻¹, compared with the flours. Fermentation during breadmaking increased the DPPH scavenging activities compared with the flours. The ABTS scavenging exhibited similar patterns to those of DPPH. Lipid accumulation in 3T3‐L1 cells shows that the alcoholic extracts (100 μg mL⁻¹) of SS flour and bread decreased adipocyte differentiation by 1.6‐ and 2.1‐fold, respectively, compared with control. SS bread extract substantially downregulated the adipogenesis‐related genes such as acetyl‐CoA carboxylase and glycerol‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase.  aPublisher supplied data 3abaking 3abreadmaking 3abreads 3afermentation 3aflavonoids 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amodels 3asoy flour 3asoybeans1 aChoi, Induck1 aYokoyama, Wallace H.1 aKim, Mi‐Ja1 aKim, Yookyung0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2014 Mar., v. 49, no. 3 p.759-767dPublished for the Institute of Food Science and Technology (U.K.) by Blackwell Scientific Publicationsx0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.123633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03780naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245016600172520171000338592002802048650002102076650002702097650001302124650002102137650002502158650001202183650003202195650002202227650001102249650002002260650001302280650002302293650001002316650001502326650001302341650003202354650001402386650001202400650001902412650001202431650001302443650002502456650002302481650001402504650000702518650001902525650001402544650001802558650002302576650001702599650001802616650002202634650000902656653001102665653001802676653000902694653001602703653001302719653001702732700002402749700002502773700002102798700002502819773012202844856008302966852000903049655001203058IND60629826920221118124259.0190516e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062982692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2019.01.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOyedele, Solomon A.10aEnhanced lipolytic activity potential of mutant Bacillus niacini EMB-5 Grown on Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) and biochemical characterization of purified lipase  aPalm oil mill effluent (POME) is a major waste from oil-palm industries often disposed indiscriminately into surrounding water bodies, adding up to retarding soil health and environmental pollution. Here, POME was beneficially used for lipase production by newly isolated microorganisms from oil-polluted soil. The identified microorganisms, using 16S rRNA gene analysis, were screened for lipolytic activity and treated with ethidium bromide for possible mutation in nucleotide sequence and enhancement of their lipolytic potential. A mutant strain of Bacillus niacini as confirmed by CodonCode aligner software showed the highest lipolytic activity compared to the wild type organisms. The crude lipase produced from the mutant strain was purified to apparent homogeneity using ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex A-50 and gel-filtration on Sephadex G-100. Some biochemical properties of the lipase were studied prior to its application for the hydrolysis of different oils. The 59 kDa purified lipase exhibited optimal activity at pH 9.0 and 40 °C. The enzyme is alkaline thermostable being active at pH 8.0–12 and retained about 60% of initial activity after 60 min of incubation at 90 °C. At 10 mM salt concentration, Al3+ and Ca2+ modulated the activity of the enzyme but inhibited by Cu2+, Hg2+, EDTA, β-mercaptoethanol, SDS and Urea. The Km and Vmax of the lipase with olive oil as substrate are respectively, 6.12 mg/mL and 59.64 μmol/min/mg as the enzyme was able to hydrolyze various natural oils. These remarkable properties make the purified EMB-5 lipase employable for biotechnological applications in lipid-utilizing industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus niacini 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aaluminum 3aammonium sulfate 3abeta-mercaptoethanol 3acalcium 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acomputer software 3acopper 3aenzyme activity 3aethidium 3agel chromatography 3agenes 3ahydrolysis 3aindustry 3aion exchange chromatography 3alipolysis 3amercury 3amicroorganisms 3amutants 3amutation 3anucleotide sequences 3aoil mill effluents 3aolive oil 3apH 3apolluted soils 3apollution 3aribosomal RNA 3asalt concentration 3asoil quality 3asurface water 3athermal stability 3aurea 0aLipase 0aBiotechnology 0aPOME 0aAgro-wastes 0aMutation 0aPurification1 aAyodeji, Adeyemi O.1 aBamidele, Olufemi S.1 aAjele, Joshua O.1 aFabunmi, Temitope B.0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2019 Mar., v. 18 p.101017-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2019.01.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245011700165300002200282520119900304592002801503650002301531650002201554650001501576650002801591650001101619650004901630650001001679650000901689650001401698650001401712650001701726700002401743700002701767700002601794700002801820700002401848700002201872773012701894856007402021852000902095655001202104IND60641184320221120105416.0190505e20161024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064118432DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra19189d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Alessandra S.10aEvidence of competition in the incorporation of Co²⁺ and Mn²⁺ ions into the structure of ZnTe nanocrystals  ap. 101226-101234.  aGlass-embedded Zn₁₋ₓ₋yMnₓCoyTe nanocrystals (with x = 0.01 and y varying from 0.000 to 0.800) were successfully synthesized using a protocol based on the melting–nucleation synthesis route and herein investigated by several experimental techniques. Optical absorption (OA) provides evidence of the incorporation of substitutional Co²⁺ ions in the semiconducting Zn₁₋ₓ₋yMnₓCoyTe lattice and shows that with increasing Co concentration these ions may also be dispersed into the glass matrix, causing structural disorder. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images reveal the size of the nanocrystals and magnetic force microscopy (MFM) gives evidence of the paramagnetic behavior of the doped samples. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman scattering reveal that high Co concentrations increase the structural disorder in the host glass matrix. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy reveals the presence of Mn²⁺ ions inside and at (or near) the surface of the ZnTe nanocrystals, and also that the increase of Co doping concentration reduces the incorporation of Mn²⁺ ions into the ZnTe structure, simultaneously increasing their dispersion into the glass matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3aatomic force microscopy 3acobalt 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aglass 3aions 3amagnetism 3amanganese 3ananocrystals1 aPelegrini, Fernando1 aFigueiredo, Leandro C.1 ade Souza, Paulo E.

DESIGN: Experimental mouse study. SETTING: University hospital. ANIMAL(S): Female C57Bl/6 mice. INTERVENTION(S): Cetrorelix is used as a GnRH-antagonist in ART treatments. To assess the effect of delayed ovulation on embryonic development, cetrorelix was applied concomitantly with follicle stimulation by pregnant mare serum gonadotropin. Ovulation was induced by hCG. Controls were stimulated with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin without delaying ovulation. Suppression of ovulation was assessed from the number of tertiary follicles, ruptured follicles, and corpora lutea in mouse ovaries after cetrorelix treatment. Number and weight of embryos and placentas, as well as number of resorption sites and dead embryos, was determined on day 17.5 of pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Inhibition of ovulation, embryonic development. RESULT(S): Cetrorelix inhibited ovulation in mice, as shown by an increase in number of tertiary follicles concomitant with a significant inhibition of follicle rupture and corpora lutea formation. Delayed ovulation caused by Cetrorelix treatment led to a significant increase in resorption sites and a significant decrease in embryonic weight of offspring. CONCLUSION(S): Preovulatory oocyte overripeness might have an effect on fertility and embryonic development during ART treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassisted reproductive technologies 3acorpus luteum 3aembryogenesis 3ahuman chorionic gonadotropin 3ahumans 3amice 3aoocytes 3aovulation 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 3apregnant mare serum gonadotropin 3aprogeny 3aresorption1 aHorsthemke, Bernhard1 aWinterhager, Elke1 aGrümmer, Ruth0 tFertility and sterility.g2011 June, v. 95, no. 7 p.2390-2394dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.03.0223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245005900160300001400219500002000233520172100253592002801974650001502002650001202017650001502029650001302044650003102057650001302088650001702101650000702118650002602125650001502151650001402166650001002180650001902190700002202209700002302231773011302254856007302367852000902440655001202449IND60587971220221119135206.0180103e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058797122DNAL7 a10.1111/aec.123992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFazlioglu, Fatih10aTesting specialization hypothesis on a stress gradient  ap. 40-47.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSpecialization can allow plants to perform well in their home environments at the expense of poor performance in other habitats. A great difference in performance across habitats is observed as high phenotypic plasticity in performance traits and a by‐product of selection. However, phenotypic plasticity (particularly adaptive plasticity) can be an active response to the selection by allowing the maintenance of performance. Therefore, specialization and adaptive plasticity delineate two opposing strategies. The specialization hypothesis presents a non‐adaptive interpretation of plasticity and predicts that phenotypic plasticity of performance traits is greater in specialization to good habitats, whereas bad habitat specialists express low plasticity in performance traits. We tested the specialization hypothesis using plants adapted to extremely stressful mine‐site habitats (sites with highly acidic soil and heavy metal contamination). Seeds of five herbaceous species were collected from high stress (mine site) and low stress habitats. We established a glasshouse experiment where seedlings from high and low stress habitats were grown under near neutral pH and acid soil treatments. We compared performance trait plasticity (e.g. biomass) from high stress and low stress populations and found that there was no significant difference in performance traits between high and low stress populations across treatments. The overall result did not support the specialization hypothesis. Moreover, our results suggest that the species invaded the mine sites are either extreme generalists or the surrounding populations retain some stress tolerant genotypes that are capable of invading the mine sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid soils 3abiomass 3abyproducts 3agenotype 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ahabitats 3aheavy metals 3apH 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aplasticity 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asoil treatment1 aWan, Justin S.

Reliable monitoring of threatened organisms is crucial for data‐driven conservation actions but remains a challenge owing to nonstandardized methods that depend on practical and taxonomic expertise, which is rapidly declining. Here, we show that a diversity of rare and threatened freshwater animals—representing amphibians, fish, mammals, insects and crustaceans—can be detected and quantified based on DNA obtained directly from small water samples of lakes, ponds and streams. We successfully validate our findings in a controlled mesocosm experiment and show that DNA becomes undetectable within 2 weeks after removal of animals, indicating that DNA traces are near contemporary with presence of the species. We further demonstrate that entire faunas of amphibians and fish can be detected by high‐throughput sequencing of DNA extracted from pond water. Our findings underpin the ubiquitous nature of DNA traces in the environment and establish environmental DNA as a tool for monitoring rare and threatened species across a wide range of taxonomic groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3aDNA 3aamphibians 3abiodiversity 3aecosystems 3afauna 3afish 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3alakes 3amammals 3amonitoring 3aponds 3asequence analysis 3astreams 3athreatened species 2aAmphibiansxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aBiodiversity 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aDNAxanalysis 2aEndangered Species 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFishesxgenetics 2aFresh Water 2aInsectaxgenetics. 2aLakes 2aTriturusxgenetics 0aEurope1 aKIELGAST, JOS1 aIVERSEN, LARS L.1 aWiuf, Carsten,1 aRASMUSSEN, MORTEN1 aGILBERT, M.

The feature of the developed process lies in the combination of a copper(i) salt with oxygen—the stoichiometric oxidant. Copper(ii) species are responsible for the oxidation of sulfonylhydrazides, they are generated in small amounts in the O₂/Cu(i)/Cu(ii) redox system, which is formed during the reaction. The combination of these three components enables one to obtain in the case of α-methylstyrenes only β-hydroxysulfones and in the case of α-unsubstituted styrenes, β-hydroxysulfones as the main products and β-ketosulfones as the by-products. With good yields β-hydroxysulfones were prepared by reduction of the reaction mixture containing both products β-hydroxysulfones and β-ketosulfones with NaBH₄. An electrochemical study revealed that the Cu(i)/Cu(II) pair can serve as an effective mediator of β-hydroxysulfones formation via redox processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3acopper 3aelectrochemistry 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3asodium borohydride1 aMulina, Olga M.1 aPirgach, Dmitry A.1 aDemchuk, Dmitry V.1 aSyroeshkin, Mikhail A.1 aNikishin, Gennady I.0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 30, v. 6, no. 96 p.93476-93485dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra19190h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245006600176300001600242520192300258592002802181650001902209650001702228650001302245650001202258650001902270650001102289650002502300650002002325650002202345650001202367650001002379650002102389650001302410650001602423650000902439651001102448653002102459653003702480653002102517653002202538653001902560653001102579700002402590773011102614856008502725852000902810655001202819IND50067170020221119035934.0190411e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006717002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2012.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSöderberg, Charlotta10aRising policy conflicts in Europe over bioenergy and forestry  ap. 112-119.  aGrowing concerns over emissions of green-house gases causing climate change as well as energy security concerns have spurred the interest in bioenergy production pushed by EU targets to fulfil the goal of 20per cent renewable energy in 2020, as well as the goal of 10per cent renewable fuels in transport by 2020. Increased bioenergy production is also seen to have political and economic benefits for rural areas and farming regions in Europe and in the developing world. There are, however, conflicting views on the potential benefits of large scale bioenergy production, and recent debates have also drawn attention to a range of environmental and socio-economic issues that may arise in this respect. One of these challenges will be that of accommodating forest uses – including wood for energy, and resulting intensification of forest management – with biodiversity protection in order to meet EU policy goals. We note that the use of biomass and biofuels spans over several economic sector policy areas, which calls for assessing and integrating environmental concerns across forest, agriculture, energy and transport sectors.In this paper, we employ frame analysis to identify the arguments for promoting bioenergy and assess the potential policy conflicts in the relevant sectors, through the analytical lens of environmental policy integration. We conclude that while there is considerable leverage of environmental arguments in favour of bioenergy in the studied economic sectors, and potential synergies with other policy goals, environmental interest groups remain sceptical to just how bioenergy is currently being promoted. There is a highly polarised debate particularly relating to biofuel production. Based on our analysis, we discuss the potential for how those issues could be reconciled drawing on the frame conflict theory, distinguishing between policy disagreements and policy controversies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abiodiversity 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3aenvironmental policy 3afarming systems 3aforest management 3aforests 3agases 3agreenhouse gases 3apolitics 3arural areas 3awood 3aEurope 0aBioenergy policy 0aEnvironmental policy integration 0aPolicy conflicts 0aForest management 0aFrame analysis 0aEnergy1 aEckerberg, Katarina0 tForest policy and economics.g2013 Aug., v. 33 p.112-119dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2012.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245009800164300001600262520158600278592002801864650001901892650002201911650001001933650001401943650002301957650001501980650001801995650001302013650002002026650001402046650001102060650001702071650001802088650001802106650002602124650001702150650000902167650001102176650001302187650001802200650001802218650001002236650001102246700001502257700001502272700001902287700001502306700001802321700001802339773009702357856008102454852000902535655001202544IND4467628220221119022712.0141110e20111220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446762822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2011.06.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlaru, Maarika10aLignin content and briquette quality of different fibre hemp plant types and energy sunflower  ap. 332-339.  aFibre hemp and energy sunflower are potential energy crops for production of solid biomass as renewable energy. The current study estimated (i) the lignin content of fibre hemp and energy sunflower plants grown on different nitrogen treatments and (ii) the quality of the briquettes made from different plant types of fibre hemp (i.e. monoecious and dioecious), energy sunflower and the combination of fibre hemp and energy sunflower. The monoecious and dioecious fibre hemp cultivars (Chameleon, Finola and Santhica-27, USO-31, respectively) and the energy sunflower cultivar Wielkopolski were grown in the experimental field in 2008–2010 on Stagnic Luvisol soil. The plants were grown on N treatments of N0, mineral nitrogen (100kgNha⁻¹), cattle slurry (100kgNha⁻¹), sewage sludge (100kgNha⁻¹) and vetch (100kgNha⁻¹). Calorific values (16.6–17.4MJkg⁻¹) of briquettes pressed from different materials did not differ significantly and had relatively low sulphur (<0.05%) and chlorine content (0.03–0.37%). Briquettes with higher compactness were made from the sunflower and the dioecious hemp. Dioecious hemp had significantly higher lignin content. The dioecious hemp needs lower GDD values for maturating, its stems lignin content was higher than of monoecious hemp by harvest time and therefore this plant type is more suitable for briquetting in Nordic climatic conditions. Comparison of the different N treatments indicated that application of sewage sludge decreased the emergence and density of the fibre hemp plants and the lignin content per kg of DM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChamaeleonidae 3aHelianthus annuus 3aVicia 3abioenergy 3abiomass production 3abriquettes 3acattle manure 3achlorine 3acrop production 3acultivars 3aenergy 3aenergy crops 3afiber content 3afiber quality 3afield experimentation 3aharvest date 3ahemp 3alignin 3anitrogen 3aplanting date 3asewage sludge 3astems 3asulfur1 aKukk, Liia1 aOlt, Jüri1 aMenind, Andres1 aLauk, Ruth1 aVollmer, Elis1 aAstover, Alar0 tField crops research.g2011 Dec. 20, v. 124, no. 3 p.332-339dElsevier B.V.x0378-42907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2011.06.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245012600173300001800299520152300317592002801840650001901868650002301887650002101910650001701931650001301948650001901961650001301980650001501993650000902008650001202017650001502029650001202044650001102056650001202067650001802079700002302097700002502120700002002145700002402165773009802189856008802287990002302375852000902398655001202407IND60098528520221120075304.0141104e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009852852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.03.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGouk, Sok Siam10aCryopreservation of mouse testicular tissue: prospect for harvesting spermatogonial stem cells for fertility preservation  ap. 2399-2403.  aOBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of vitrification, rapid freezing, and slow freezing in preserving testicular tissue for subsequent isolation of spermatogonial stem cells. DESIGN: Experimental study. SETTING: University-based laboratory. ANIMALS: Immature mouse testicular tissue. INTERVENTION(S): The tunica of the testis was manipulated before cryopreservation. The tunica was either breached with a fine needle or completely removed, or the testis was sectioned longitudinally into halves. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Cell viability by Trypan blue exclusion test and flow cytometry analysis of live-dead cytotoxicity test, measurement of hormonal production, enrichment of spermatogonial stem cells with use of magnetic-activated cell sorting technology. RESULT(S): Samples with tunica minimally penetrated with a needle point gave the highest cell viability after freezing and thawing. Vitrification protocol with use of an ethylene glycol–sucrose–based vitrification solution (40% vol/vol ethylene glycol–0.6 mol/L sucrose) was able to maintain postwarming cell viability and functions similar to those of noncryopreserved controls and significantly better than both conventional slow and rapid freezing protocols. Primitive spermatogonial stem cells were enriched successfully from vitrified tissue via magnetic-activated cell sorting. CONCLUSION(S): Vitrification of testicular tissue is a time- and cost-efficient strategy to preserve spermatogonial stem cells for potential transplantation procedure.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell viability 3acost effectiveness 3acryopreservation 3acytotoxicity 3aethylene 3aflow cytometry 3afreezing 3aharvesting 3amice 3asorting 3astem cells 3asucrose 3atestes 3athawing 3avitrification1 aJason Loh, Yu Feng1 aKumar, Srinivasan D.1 aWatson, Paul F.1 aKuleshova, Lilia L.0 tFertility and sterility.g2011 June, v. 95, no. 7 p.2399-2403dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.03.0353Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02256naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245011500166300001600281520085500297592002801152650000801180650001501188650001101203650001401214650001701228650000901245650001301254650001201267650002801279650000701307650001101314650001901325650002201344650001701366653002601383653002001409653002801429653002701457653002001484653001701504700002601521773015201547856007801699852000901777655001201786IND60522657120221119141500.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052265712DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1980-7-8122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtsuki, Lauren G.10aMethylmercury-Chromosome Interactions.

From changes observed in the integral and differential melting profiles, gathered via absorbance measurements at 260 nm as a function of CH₃HgOH concentration, it is concluded that methylmercury at low concentrations (1-10μᴍ), and prior to its denaturating the double-helix of the chromosomal DNA, interferes with the binding of DNA by histones H3 and H4 which is followed, at methyl- mercury concentrations between 10 and 32 μᴍ, also by its interfering with the complexing of DNA by the less basic histones H2A and H2B. DNA denaturation, in absence of the histones, proceeds only at methylmercury concentrations above 32 μᴍ under the experimental conditions given.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aabsorbance 3acalves 3achromatin 3adenaturation 3aheat 3ahistones 3amelting 3amethylmercury compounds 3apH 3asodium 3asodium sulfate 3athermal stability 3athymus gland 0aCalf Thymus Chromatin 0aCalf Thymus DNA 0aMethylmercury Complexes 0aUltraviolet Absorbance 0aHyperchromicity 0aDenaturation1 aGruenwedel, Dieter W.0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 35, no. 7-8 p.605-610dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1980-7-8123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01999naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245009000162300001600252520070000268592002800968650001800996650002701014650002401041650001101065650001701076650001701093650001601110650002701126650001801153650002101171653002301192653001601215653001601231653002401247700002301271700001801294700002201312773015401334856008001488852000901568655001201577IND60523088820221120130415.0160605e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052308882DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-2007-11-12062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGruhn, Nina10aBiologically Active Metabolites from the Basidiomycete Limacella illinita (Fr.)

The proposed method has been compared with another based on, hydro-distillation a conventional extraction procedure. Fresh cucalyptus leaves (4g) were extracted with water at 50 bar, 150°C and 2 mL min⁻¹ for 20 min. Hydro-distillation was performed on the same amount of leaves with 360 mL water for 3 h. After each extraction the compounds were removed from the aqueous extract by a single extraction with hexane (5 mL), detected by GC-FID, and identified by electron impact (EI) MS. The SWE-based method is clearly quicker and more efficient than the hydrodistillation-based method, because yields from the former for 11 of the 13 major compounds in the extract are higher after 20-min extraction than after hydrodistillation for 3h. This enables substantial cost savings of both energy and raw material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3aessential oils 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahexane 3ahydrodistillation 3aleaves 3araw materials1 aLuque de Castro, M.

This method reduces the protein and fluorophore quantities that are necessary for sample preparations and readings by two and three orders of magnitude, respectively, compared to conventional methods. In addition, readings can be obtained in just 2–6 s. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1-anilino 8-naphthalene sulfonic acid (ANS) were used for the first optimization of appropriate fluorophore-protein conditions for H₀ determination (20 μM ANS, 0.5–4 μM BSA, pH 5). Based on validation guidelines, the novel method shows linear behavior, good intraday precision, accuracy, and sensitivity. This method was robust against several factors, as determined by a Youden-Steiner test. Additional surface hydrophobicity determinations using several proteins demonstrate suitable method applicability. The present microvolumetric method provides a reliable technique to determine the H₀ of proteins for pharmaceutical, biotechnological, and food applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abovine serum albumin 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3afood chemistry 3ahydrophobicity 3apH 3asulfonic acids 0aANS-protein complex 0aMethod validation 0aProtein applicability 0aRobust method 0aFunctional properties1 aRodríguez-Celestino, Verónica1 aCenteno-Leija, Sara1 aSerrano-Posada, Hugo1 aCeballos-Magaña, Silvia G.1 aAguilar-Padilla, Jorge1 aMancilla-Margalli, Norma Alejandra1 aOsuna-Castro, Juan Alberto0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Dec. 01, v. 396 p.133681-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1336813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01215naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245008800210300001300298506007600311520014700387592002800534506003700562650002200599650001100621650001300632650002500645650002200670773010700692856008100799852000900880655001200889IND60119402720221207073118.0141214e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011940272DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2010-11-12-1442doi7 aPMC30464762pmcid7 a211720322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobinson, Peter N10aWhole-exome sequencing for finding de novo mutations in sporadic mental retardation  ap. 2516.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent work has used a family-based approach and whole-exome sequencing to identify de novo mutations in sporadic cases of mental retardation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adisease incidence 3agenome 3amutation 3anucleotide sequences 3asequence analysis0 tGenome biology.g2010 Dec., v. 11, no. 12 p.2516-2516dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2010-11-12-1443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01780naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010700158300001600265520048900281592002800770650002000798650001200818650001600830650002300846650002300869650004300892650003200935650001300967650002200980650004401002700002001046700001901066700001401085700001601099700002001115700001901135700001701154773010301171856007501274852000901349655001201358IND60578774020221116153534.0170814e20140117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057877402DNAL7 a10.1021/ol403198d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeng, Chang-An10aLC-MS Guided Isolation of (±)-Sweriledugenin A, a Pair of Enantiomeric Lactones, from Swertia leducii  ap. 370-373.  a(±)-Sweriledugenin A, a pair of novel enantiomeric lactones, were isolated from Swertia leducii under the guidance of LC-MS investigation.

Mammalian cells are constantly exposed to a wide variety of genotoxic agents from both endogenous and exogenous sources. The RAD51 protein is required for meiotic and mitotic recombination and plays a central role in homology-dependent recombinational repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs). Given the functional relevance of the DNA repair system on carcinogenesis, potential associations between genetic polymorphisms of DNA repair genes, cancer risk and response to therapy have been intensively evaluated. This is the first study evaluating the role of the RAD51 G172T genetic variants in cancer prognosis and clinical outcome of cervical cancer patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed RAD51 G172T polymorphism genotypes in cervical cancer patients who underwent a platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with radiotherapy. Genotyping was performed by Taqman™ Allelic Discrimination methodology. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Concerning the overall survival rates found using Kaplan–Meier method and Log Rank Test, we observed that the mean survival rates were statistically different according to the patients RAD51 genotypes. The group of patients carrying the T allele present a higher mean survival rate than the other patients (102.3months vs. 86.4months, P=0.020). Using the Cox regression analysis, we found an increased overall survival time for T-carrier patients, when compared with GG genotype, with tumor stage, age and presence of lymph nodes as covariates [hazard ratio (HR), 0.373; 95% CI, 0.181–0.770; P=0.008]. Among patients (n=193), RAD51 genotype frequency distributions were not under the influence of clinicopathologic characteristics, namely, treatment response (P=0.508), recurrence (P=0.150) and tumor stage (P=0.250). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study evaluating the role of the RAD51 G172T genetic variants in cancer prognosis and clinical outcome of cervical cancer patients. Our results indicate an influence of the RAD51 genetic variants in overall survival of cervical cancer. Thereby, RAD51 G172T genotypes may provide additional prognostic information in cervical cancer patients who underwent cisplatin-based chemotherapy in combination with radiotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenesis 3arisk 3aexogenous sources 3amitotic recombination 3asurvival rate 3adrug therapy 3aalleles 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3awomen 3aprognosis 3aregression analysis 3agenotype 3aDNA repair 3agenotyping 3amammals 3agenotoxicity 3apatients 3aradiotherapy 3alymph nodes 3agenetic polymorphism 2aCombined Modality Therapy 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMiddle Aged 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aRad51 Recombinasexgenetics 2aTreatment Outcome 2aUterine Cervical Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxradiotherapyxtherapy. 0achemotherapy1 aCatarino, Raquel1 aFaustino, Ilda1 aNogueira-Silva, Cristina1 aFigueiredo, Tiago1 aLombo, Liliana1 aHilário-Silva, Inês1 aPereira, Deolinda1 aMedeiros, Rui0 tGene.g2012 Aug. 10, v. 504, no. 2 p.279-283dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.05.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245007100162300001600233520128000249592002801529650002301557650001501580650000901595650001701604650002001621650001901641650001001660650001301670650001001683650001601693650001201709650002701721700001801748700002101766700002201787700001801809773014701827856007701974852000902051655001202060IND60118262820221120232337.0141126e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011826282DNAL7 a10.5326/JAAHA-MS-59842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFry, Joanna K.10aPollakiuria and Stranguria in a Labrador Retriever with Penile HSA  ap. 141-147.  aAn approximately 8 yr old castrated male Labrador retriever presented for evaluation of weight loss, stranguria, and pollakiuria. Lysis of the proximal one-third of the os penis was diagnosed on abdominal radiographs, and a positive contrast urethrography revealed a smoothly marginated filling defect along the dorsal aspect of the urethra at the level of the radiographically observed osteolysis. Regional ultrasound revealed an echogenic mass at the proximal aspect of the os penis with a severely irregular and discontinuous periosteal surface. A penile hemangiosarcoma (HSA) was confirmed on histopathologic evaluation after a penile amputation and scrotal urethrostomy were performed. Although HSA is a common malignant neoplasm in dogs, lysis of the os penis has not previously been documented. Adjunctive chemotherapy, although recommended, was declined, and the patient survived 236 days postoperatively. That survival time is considerably longer than the average survival time for patients with HSA, other than cutaneous forms of HSA. Although an uncommon presentation, HSA of the penis should be considered a differential diagnosis in older canines with signs of lower urinary tract disease, especially in breeds that have been documented to be predisposed to HSA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLabrador Retriever 3aamputation 3adogs 3adrug therapy 3ahemangiosarcoma 3ahistopathology 3amales 3apatients 3apenis 3aradiography 3aurethra 3aurinary tract diseases1 aBurney, Derek1 aHottinger, Heidi1 aFabiani, Michelle1 aFeagin, Clint0 tJournal of the American Animal Hospital Association.g2014 Mar., v. 50, no. 2 p.141-147dAmerican Animal Hospital Associationx0587-28717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5326/JAAHA-MS-59843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245007100167300001600238520128400254592002801538650001101566650001901577650001901596650002501615650001201640650002701652650001101679650002201690650001801712650002901730650002201759651001001781653001901791653001801810653002901828653002701857700001401884773011301898856008602011852000902097655001202106IND60628615720221117214107.0190202e20190320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062861572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.12.2982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Kaile10aCarbon finance and carbon market in China: Progress and challenges  ap. 536-549.  aClimate change has become one of the major challenges that humans have faced in recent years. As an economic measure to cope with climate change, carbon finance has drawn considerable attention in recent years, since it can promote low-cost emission reductions. As the largest developing country with rich carbon emission resources, China plays an important role in establishing a sound carbon trading market. This study presents a systematic review of the research and development progress and challenges of China's carbon finance and carbon market. Based on the brief introduction of some related concepts and background, this study mainly discusses the role of China's financial institutions in carbon finance, and the development of China's carbon market. Particularly, it focuses on the recent practices and the carbon trading pilots established in China. In addition, the major challenges for China to establish a national unified carbon market were pointed out, in terms of awareness, relevant professionals, sound legal systems and carbon financial product innovation. Finally, we put forward the policy implications for the future development of carbon finance and carbon market, which provides important decision support for establishing a unified global carbon market.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon markets 3aclimate change 3adeveloping countries 3afinance 3afinancial institutions 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3aprofessionals 3aresearch and development 3asystematic review 3aChina 0aCarbon finance 0aCarbon market 0aCarbon emissions trading 0aCarbon emission rights1 aLi, Yiwen0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Mar. 20, v. 214 p.536-549dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.12.2983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003300145245007500178300001800253500001100271520106900282592002801351650001901379650001901398650001101417650001501428650001501443650002601458650002201484650001501506650002001521650001501541650001401556650001501570650002501585650001401610650004401624651002501668700002501693700002101718700001901739700001701758700002301775700003001798700002901828700002001857700002201877700001901899773013001918856007902048852000902127655001202136IND60593986420221118013117.0180508e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059398642DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.141032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartín‐Hernández, Raquel10aNosema ceranae in Apis mellifera: a 12 years postdetection perspective  ap. 1302-1329.  aREVIEW  aNosema ceranae is a hot topic in honey bee health as reflected by numerous papers published every year. This review presents an update of the knowledge generated in the last 12 years in the field of N. ceranae research, addressing the routes of transmission, population structure and genetic diversity. This includes description of how the infection modifies the honey bee's metabolism, the immune response and other vital functions. The effects on individual honey bees will have a direct impact on the colony by leading to losses in the adult's population. The absence of clear clinical signs could keep the infection unnoticed by the beekeeper for long periods. The influence of the environmental conditions, beekeeping practices, bee genetics and the interaction with pesticides and other pathogens will have a direct influence on the prognosis of the disease. This review is approached from the point of view of the Mediterranean countries where the professional beekeeping has a high representation and where this pathogen is reported as an important threat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aNosema ceranae 3aadults 3aapiculture 3abeekeepers 3aenvironmental factors 3agenetic variation 3ahoney bees 3aimmune response 3ametabolism 3apathogens 3apesticides 3apopulation structure 3aprognosis 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3aMediterranean region1 aBartolomé, Carolina1 aChejanovsky, Nor1 aLe Conte, Yves1 aDalmon, Anne1 aDussaubat, Claudia1 aGarcía‐Palencia, Pilar1 aMeana Mañes, Aránzazu,1 aPinto, M.

We evaluated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and used Monte Carlo simulation for probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The cost-effectiveness threshold was extracted from previous literature. In comparison with no vaccination, all strategies were cost-effective with ICERs less than the threshold (US$24,302 per QALY gained). When compared with no vaccination, strategies 1–4 saved US$ 49.5, US$ 94.9, US$ 584.3, and US$ 1114.2 to gain one QALY respectively. In comparison with strategy 2, strategy 1 spent US$ 195.3 to gain one QALY, whilst strategies 3 and 4 showed less effectiveness with increased costs. All vaccination strategies were cost-effective, among which the strategy of PPV23 at 50/65 years with annual influenza vaccine was cost-effective even in comparison with current vaccination programme. These findings could help inform the design and implementation of vaccination strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3aMonte Carlo method 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3acost effectiveness 3ainfluenza vaccination 3ainfluenza vaccines 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apolysaccharides 3aquality-adjusted life year 0aPneumococcal infection 0aVaccine 0aQuality-adjusted life-years 0aCost-effective analysis1 aHuang, Junjie1 aNgai, Chun Ho1 aSun, Qingjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0976-38161 aKwok, Kin-On1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2804-54331 aWang, Harry HX1 aChong, Marc1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5610-12981 aWong, Martin CS0 tVaccine.g2022 Feb. 23, v. 40, no. 9 p.1282-1288dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.01.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100006100193245010100254506007600355520164500431592002802076506003702104650002602141650000802167650001002175650001302185650000902198650001702207650002502224650002202249650001402271650001402285650003202299653002002331653003202351653002302383700002102406700001602427700002002443773008802463856008702551852000902638655001202647IND60653814720221207075646.0191220e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065381472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anaerobe.2019.1020732doi7 aPMC69179122pmcid7 a313232902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSekulovic, Ognjen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1006-059510aExpanding the repertoire of conservative site-specific recombination in Clostridioides difficile  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent genomic analysis of an epidemic ribotype 027 (RT027) Clostridioides difficile strain revealed the presence of several chromosomal site-specific invertible sites hypothesized to control the expression of adjacent genes in a bimodal on-off mode. This process, named phase variation, is thought to enhance phenotypic variability under homogeneous conditions ultimately increasing population fitness in unpredictable environmental fluctuations. The full extent of phase variation mediated by DNA-inversions in C. difficile is currently unknown. Here, we sought to expand our previous analysis by screening for site-specific inversions in isolates that belong to the rapidly emerging ribotypes RT017 and RT078. We report the finding of one novel inversion site for which we demonstrate the inversion potential and quantify inversion proportions during exponential and stationary growth in both historic and modern isolates of the same ribotype. We then employ a computational approach to assess the prevalence of all sites identified so far in a large collection of sequenced C. difficile isolates. We show that phase-variable loci are widespread with some sites being present in virtually all analyzed strains. Furthermore, in our small subset of RT017 and RT078 strains, we detect no evidence of gain or loss of invertible sites in historic versus modern isolates demonstrating the relative stability of those genomic elements. Overall, our results support the idea that C. difficile has adopted phase variation mediated by DNA inversions as its major generator of diversity which could be beneficial during the pathogenesis process.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClostridium difficile 3aDNA 3agenes 3agenomics 3aloci 3apathogenesis 3aphenotypic variation 3apopulation growth 3aribotypes 3ascreening 3asite-specific recombination 0aPhase variation 0aSite-specific recombination 0aGenomic inversions1 aBourgeois, Jacob1 aShen, Aimee1 aCamilli, Andrew0 tAnaerobe.g2019 Dec., v. 60 p.102073-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12008x1075-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2019.1020733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245006400160300001600224520182700240592002802067596008102095650001102176650001102187650000902198650001202207650001702219650001102236650002002247650002402267650001602291650001702307700002302324700002202347700001702369773016402386856007502550961001302625852000902638655001202647IND60572276220221117034005.0220904s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057227622DNAL7 a10.13031/aea.121082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinhoss, John E10aComparing Radiant Heater Performance Using Spatial Modeling  ap. 395-405.  aRadiant heaters are the preferred method of providing supplemental heat in poultry houses because they heat the floor and chicks directly to create a suitable microclimate by allowing for a range of thermal comfort options. Heat distribution at the floor is commonly evaluated using infrared thermography, which provides assessments of floor temperature distributions but cannot directly compare energy reaching the floor to energy consumed. The objectives of this study were to develop a system to measure the radiant energy emitted by round radiant heaters that reached the floor (measuring plane), use spatial modeling to estimate total radiant flux output at the measuring plane, and compare heater gross radiant coefficients (GRC). A radiant heater test stand was constructed over a set of linear arrays mounted with thin-film radiant flux sensors. Radiant flux measurements (n=160 per heater) were taken within the heated area of six round radiant heaters with a nominal rated output of 11.72 kW. Radiant flux data were collected at heater canopy elevations of 1.22, 1.52, 1.83, and 1.98 m above the measuring plane. Results from non-linear regression analysis showed that for all heater and elevation combinations, the radial distance from the heater center axis to 95% of the final asymptotic value was 4.71 m or less. Total heated area ranged from 13.90 to 61.46 m2 between 1.22 and 1.83 m canopy elevations. Mean radiant energy reaching the measuring plane was 2.54, 3.00, 3.34, and 4.29 kW for canopy elevations of 1.22, 1.52, 1.83, and 1.98 m, respectively. Mean gross heat input was 10.76 kW and ranged from 9.39 to 13.17 kW across all heaters. GRC ranged from 0.21 to 0.41 and increased with heater elevations.

Since three molecules of tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF), APRIL, BAFF, and CD40L, could promote mucosal antibody responses, we made fusion constructs of them with an HIV-1 gp140 trimer and tested the mucosal gp140-specific antibody elicited by the fusion constructs in mice using a DNA prime-protein boost vaccination regimen. The fusion constructs formed trimers and displayed both broadly neutralizing antibody epitopes and non-broadly neutralizing antibody epitopes. Compared with the control construct, trimeric gp140, trimeric gp140-APRIL and gp140-BAFF fusion proteins mildly promoted B cell proliferation in vitro, enhanced HIV-1 gp140-binding IgG responses in vaginal lavage or fecal pellets, respectively, and decreased HIV-1 gp140-binding IgA in sera. Gp140-APRIL also augmented HIV-1 gp140-binding IgG in sera. Surprisingly, gp140-CD40L did not promote B cell proliferation in vitro and inhibited mucosal and systemic HIV-1 gp140-binding IgG or IgA. These results suggest that APRIL and BAFF should be further explored as molecular adjuvants for HIV-1 vaccines to enhance mucosal antibody responses, but covalent fusion of TNFSFs to gp140 may hinder their adjuvancy due to steric interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aDNA 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aadjuvants 3acell proliferation 3aepitopes 3afeces 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amucosa 3aneutralizing antibodies 3asecondary immunization 3atumor necrosis factors 3avaccines 0aHIV 0aVaccine 0aAdjuvant 0aAntibody 0aTNFSF1 aClayton, Kiera1 aGao, Wenbo1 aLi, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1893-90461 aZealey, Chris1 aBudylowski, Patrick1 aSchwartz, Jordan1 aYue, Feng Yun1 aBie, Yuan1 aRini, James1 aOstrowski, Mario0 tVaccine.g2020 Feb. 24, v. 38, no. 9 p.2149-2159dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.01.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03935naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100002300162245016400185300001800349520185900367592002802226650002102254650001302275650001602288650002002304650001202324650001502336650001602351650002102367650001402388650000902402650001502411650001502426650001102441650000902452650002302461650001602484650001602500650001202516650001102528650002702539650006702566650007302633650001102706650002802717650004102745650004302786650001902829650001402848653002102862653002702883653001702910653001902927700002202946700002102968700002202989700002203011773015303033856007803186852000903264655001203273IND60083491420221120075600.0190318e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008349142DNAL7 a237264202pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2012-64562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGurjar, Abhijit A.10aEvaluation of an alternative dosing regimen of a J-5 mastitis vaccine against intramammary Escherichia coli challenge in nonlactating late-gestation dairy cows  ap. 5053-5063.  aThe objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of an alternative vaccination regimen of a J-5 bacterin against intramammary Escherichia coli challenge in nonlactating late-gestation dairy cows. The parameters analyzed to assess the effect of vaccination were milk yield, milk conductivity, somatic cell count, J-5-specific serum IgG titers, and clinical signs. Twenty multiparous Holstein cows from the Cornell teaching and research dairy herd were paired by days in milk and were randomly selected to receive either the alternative off-label regimen of commercial J-5 bacterin or act as nonvaccinated controls. Cows received a first dose of bacterin 15d before dry off, a second dose with the same product at the day of dry off, and the third dose 2 wk after dry off. The cows in both groups were challenged 10 d before the expected calving date. Serum IgG (total, IgG1 and IgG2) levels were higher in vaccinates compared with control cows. Eighty-five percent of challenged quarters became infected between both groups of animals. Eight of the 10 vaccinated and 9 of the 10 control cows showed signs of clinical mastitis postfreshening. A non-severe clinical mastitis was observed 24 to 48h postparturition, characterized by flakes or clots in milk and mild swelling or pain. Off-label vaccination did reduce the clinical severity of clinical mastitis in the vaccinated group of cows as evidenced by reduced California mastitis test score, fewer flakes and lower overall clinical mastitis score. No significant differences between vaccinated and control groups were detected for rectal temperature. In conclusion, the alternative off-label vaccination scheme used in our study and evaluated in a novel E. coli challenge model did not prevent new intramammary infections but reduced clinical severity of experimentally induced E. coli mastitis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aHolstein 3ablood serum 3abovine mastitis 3acalving 3adairy cows 3adairy herds 3aimmunoglobulin G 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk curds 3amilk yield 3amodels 3apain 3asomatic cell count 3atemperature 3avaccination 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCell Countxveterinary 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aEscherichia coli Vaccinesxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aFemale 2aImmunoglobulin Gxblood 2aMammary Glands, Animalxmicrobiology 2aMastitis, Bovinexprevention & control 2aMilkxcytology 2aPregnancy 0aEscherichia coli 0aintramammary infection 0aJ-5 bacterin 0alate gestation1 aKlaessig, Suzanne1 aSalmon, Sarah A.1 aYancey, Robert J.1 aSchukken, Ynte H.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2013 Aug., v. 96, no. 8 p.5053-5063dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-64563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01687naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010500169300001600274520052600290592002800816650001700844650001000861650002300871650002900894650002100923650001700944700002400961700002300985700002001008700002201028700002101050700001901071700002301090773011001113856008101223852000901304655001201313IND60517580120221119150813.0160331e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051758012DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348160301382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStan’kov, I.

Although antiviral drugs have some effect in treating influenza infection, vaccination is still the most effective intervention to prevent possible pandemic outbreaks. We have developed a novel H5 influenza vaccine to improve the world’s pandemic preparedness. We produced a hemagglutinin (HA) of HPAI H5N1 virus A/Alberta/01/2014 (AB14) using both mammalian (m) and bacterial (b) expression systems. The purified recombinant proteins were formulated with a proprietary adjuvant (TriAdj) and their efficacy as vaccine candidates was evaluated in mice. Intramuscular delivery of two doses of TriAdj formulated mammalian expressed HA (m-HA/TriAdj) was shown to provide full protection against a lethal challenge of AB14 in mice. In contrast, bacterially expressed HA with TriAdj (b-HA/TriAdj), b-HA without adjuvant, and m-HA without adjuvant resulted in no protection in immunized mice. Furthermore, m-HA/TriAdj elicited significantly higher levels of balanced Th1 and Th2 responses and neutralizing antibody titres. All the mice in the m-HA/TriAdj group survived a lethal AB14 H5N1 challenge and showed no signs of disease or infection as demonstrated by no loss of body weight or detectable virus in the lungs. Our results suggest that m-HA formulated with TriAdj has potential to protect against pandemic H5N1 in the event of its cross over to the human host.  aPublisher supplied data 0aInfluenza A virus H5N1 0aAdjuvant 0aRecombinant HA vaccine1 aLandreth, Shelby1 aLiu, Guanqun,1 aBrownlie, Robert1 aGaba, Amit1 aLittel-van den Hurk, Sylvia van Drunen1 aGerdts, Volker1 aZhou, Yan0 tVaccine.g2020 Feb. 28, v. 38, no. 10 p.2387-2395dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.01.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02248naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010300168300001500271520101600286592002801302650002301330650002301353650002801376650001801404650001401422650002201436650001201458651001001470653001301480653001301493653002101506700002201527700001801549700002401567700002101591773014301612856008601755852000901841655001201850IND60763236420221123013849.0220118e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076323642DNAL7 a10.1080/09637486.2021.19211272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCensi, Laura10aEating behaviour, physical activity and lifestyle of Italian children during lockdown for COVID-19  ap. 93-105.  aIn March 2020 Italy went into lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic and children changed rapidly their lifestyles with possible negative effects on their health status. An online survey collected data on eating habits, physical activity, perception/behaviour of 1027 Italian 2–11 years children during lockdown. The chi-square test was applied to test differences in proportions. Results showed a tendency of eating behaviour to worsen as children age and by areas. Only 32.3% of the children had high adherence to Mediterranean Diet, with better scores in 2–5 years children. 78.1% of the children stopped their habitual physical activity, with higher percentage among 6–11 and in Northern children; only 51.8% maintained some activities at home, playing mainly movement games/sports. Children spent more time on devices, missed school and friends, being more bored and less creative. This framework highlights the growing need for strategies to preserve children’s health in this and future pandemics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aMediterranean diet 3achi-square distribution 3ahealth status 3alifestyle 3aphysical activity 3asurveys 3aItaly 0aCOVID-19 0achildren 0aeating behaviour1 aRuggeri, Stefania1 aGalfo, Myriam1 aBuonocore, Pasquale1 aRoccaldo, Romana0 tInternational journal of food sciences and nutrition.g2022 Jan. 2, v. 73, no. 1 p.93-105dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2066x1465-34787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09637486.2021.19211273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03553naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245018700152300001600339520230300355592002802658596005002686650001502736650000902751650001302760650002402773650001202797650001302809650001702822650002402839650001402863650001002877700002502887700001902912773016402931856007503095852000903170655001203179IND60572276420221117033337.0220904s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057227642DNAL7 a10.13031/aea.120372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Hu10aDifferences in Kernel Shape, Size, and Density between Healthy Kernels and Mold Discolored Kernels and their Relationship to Reduction in Aflatoxin Levels in a Sample of Shelled Corn  ap. 421-431.  aUnacceptably high levels of aflatoxin in shelled corn drastically reduce its market value and result in substantial economic losses. This study looked at the reduction in aflatoxin levels that could be achieved by removal of kernels discolored by mold and presumed to contain aflatoxin. The study related kernel physical characteristics to the reduction achieved using screening and density separation techniques which are currently in use in the grain industry. Physical properties of corn kernels discolored by mold and healthy corn kernels were determined in a sample taken from a 737 kg corn lot known to have relatively high levels of aflatoxin. Properties measured included kernel diameters, sphericity, and kernel density. Differences between discolored and healthy kernels in major diameter, minor diameter, sphericity, and density were statistically significant. Tests were also conducted at a commercial inbred seed corn processing facility using a screen cleaner and a gravity table. Removal of fine material (approximately 10% by weight) reduced aflatoxin levels by 84%. In two successive passes through a screen cleaner, removal of smaller kernels and kernel pieces with a round-hole sieve further reduced aflatoxin levels by 1.8% and 9.4%, respectively. After the smaller kernels and kernel pieces were added back to the lot, two successive passes through a gravity table reduced aflatoxin levels by 12.6% and 16.4%, respectively. Kernel density distributions of a sample taken before gravity table density sorting, and of samples of the higher and lower density fractions after sorting, were also determined. The effect of screening with a slotted sieve was studied by screening a 3 kg sample from the corn lot using a table top Clipper cleaner. This 3 kg sample had been previously screened to remove fines. The results indicate that, at least for some corn lots, aflatoxin levels can be reduced using a screen cleaner and a gravity table. The authors also concluded that insight into the effectiveness of aflatoxin reduction in corn by size and density sorting could be gained by conducting a size and density analysis on a representative sample of kernels taken from the corn being sorted.

This study compared the effects of abrupt versus gradual cessation of milking on milk leakage and dairy cow behavior. Holstein dairy cows were housed in groups of 6 and randomly assigned to either abrupt milk cessation (i.e., dry-off on d 0) or gradual milk cessation (i.e., skipped milkings beginning on d 0; dry-off on d 5). Four replicates were performed over time, for a total of 24 cows (mean ± SD; parity=2.3±1.2; milk production the day before d 0=24±5kg/d). Intramammary antibiotic, internal teat sealer, and external teat sealant were administered at dry-off. Measurements were taken from d −3 to 8 relative to dry-off. Three periods were identified for behavior data: baseline (d −3 to 1), period 1 (abrupt cows dry, gradual cows milking; d 0–4), and period 2 (all cows dry; d 5–8). Lying time was recorded with data loggers. Video scan samples (5-min intervals) were used to measure feeding time and motivation to be milked (i.e., standing at the pen's exit gate). Milk leakage was monitored every 20min during the 2-h period following the milking times of 0500 and 1500h after complete cessation of milking (period 1 for abrupt vs. period 2 for gradual). Composite milk samples were taken before dry-off (d −1, 0, and 5) and at the start of the next lactation (colostrum, 24h and 7–10 d postcalving) to determine somatic cell score (SCS) and conduct bacteriological examinations in clinical mastitis cases. Regardless of treatment, dry-off resulted in reduced lying time [14.1 vs. 13.2h/d; standard error of the difference (SED)=0.2], reduced lying bouts (10.7 vs. 8.3 bouts/d; SED=0.2), increased lying bout duration (1.4 vs. 1.7h/bout; SED=0.03) and increased feeding time (5.0 vs. 5.9h/d; SED=0.2). Compared with baseline, the odds of standing at the gate increased for abrupt cows (period 1: odds ratio=6.2; 95% CI: 2.7–14.4; and period 2: odds ratio=5.2; 95% CI: 1.8–14.6). No increase in time spent standing at the gate was noted in gradual cows. Frequency of leakage was greater in abrupt versus gradual cows (75 vs. 27%). Although the gradual treatment showed an increase in SCS over the 5 d of reduced milking frequency, both treatments showed an increase in SCS at calving and both returned to pre-experiment levels within 7 to 10 d after calving. This work demonstrates that gradually reducing milking frequency in high-producing cows results in reduced time spent anticipating milking and reduced milk leakage after dry-off.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aantibiotics 3acalving 3acolostrum 3adairy cows 3ahumans 3alactation 3amastitis 3amilk 3amilk production 3amilking frequency 3amothers 3amotivation 3asomatic cells 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aCattlexphysiologyxpsychology. 2aCell Countxveterinary 2aDairyingxmethods 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMilkxcytologyxsecretion. 0awelfare 0abehavior 0amilking frequency 0amastitis1 aLeslie, K.1 aWeary, D.M.1 avon Keyserlingk, M.A.G.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2013 Aug., v. 96, no. 8 p.5064-5071dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-65013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245012300170520160000293592002801893650001901921650001201940650001101952650001801963650002501981650001502006650001102021653001802032653002402050653001802074653003802092653004302130653003702173700002502210773009402235856008402329852000902413655001202422IND60778757920221118181612.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077875792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2022.1130762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMišík, Matúš10aEx Ante Governance in the European Union: Energy and climate policy as a ‘test run’ for the post-pandemic recovery  aThis paper asks what policy tools the European Commission used to push member states to align their national post-pandemic recovery preferences with its own preferences for the green (and digital) recovery. It claims that the Commission did not create new policy tool in response to the crisis, but utilised an existing one, previously successfully tested in climate and energy policy. This tool, ex ante governance, developed under the 2018 Governance Regulation, enabled the Commission to influence member states' national goals (defined in their National Energy and Climate Plans) before they were formally adopted. The Commission's main aim was to link the national targets with the 2030 climate and energy goals binding at the EU level. Ex ante governance helped the Commission achieve this linkage as it pushed member countries to commit to more ambitious national targets than they had originally intended. This enabled the EU27 to reach a commitment level that will support the 2030 climate and energy goals set at the EU level. This modus operandi contrasts with the previous ex post assessment process that was ineffective; the original rules on the Intergovernmental Agreements have revealed the limitations of this approach. Due to its success the Commission applied the ex ante governance model to the post-pandemic recovery, where it wanted to align member states' national preferences (presented in the National Recovery and Resilience Plans) with its green (and other) recovery objectives. Such a development indicates the emergence of a complex ex ante governance within the EU.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aclimate 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3aenvironmental policy 3agovernance 3amodels 0aEU governance 0aEuropean Commission 0aMember states 0aNational Energy and Climate Plans 0aNational Recovery and Resilience Plans 0aRecovery and Resilience Facility1 aOravcová, Veronika,0 tEnergy policy.g2022 Aug., v. 167 p.113076-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2022.1130763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245013700167300001800304500002000322520131900342592002801661650002801689650000901717650001601726650001601742650000901758650001201767650001301779650002201792650002601814650002001840650003701860650001101897700002401908700002501932700001901957700001801976773012901994856007902123852000902202655001202211IND60593986920221118013032.0180508e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059398692DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.141212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamayo, Elisabeth14aThe arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis uses a reductive iron assimilation pathway for high‐affinity iron uptake  ap. 1857-1872.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aArbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can improve iron (Fe) acquisition of their host plants. Here, we report a characterization of two components of the high‐affinity reductive Fe uptake system of Rhizophagus irregularis, the ferric reductase (RiFRE1) and the high affinity Fe permeases (RiFTR1‐2). In the extraradical mycelia (ERM), Fe deficiency induced activation of a plasma membrane‐localized ferric reductase, an enzyme that reduces Fe(III) sources to the more soluble Fe(II). Yeast mutant complementation assays showed that RiFRE1 encodes a functional ferric reductase and RiFTR1 an iron permease. In the heterologous system, RiFTR1 was expressed in the plasma membrane while RiFTR2 was expressed in the endomembranes. In the ERM, the highest expression levels of RiFTR1 were found in mycelia grown in media with 0.045 mM Fe, while RiFTR2 was upregulated under Fe‐deficient conditions. RiFTR2 expression also increased in the intraradical mycelia (IRM) of maize plants grown without Fe. These data indicate that the Fe permease RiFTR1 plays a key role in Fe acquisition and that RiFTR2 is involved in Fe homeostasis under Fe‐limiting conditions. RiFTR1 was highly expressed in the (IRM), which suggests that the maintenance of Fe homeostasis in the IRM might be essential for a successful symbiosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizophagus irregularis 3acorn 3ahomeostasis 3ahost plants 3airon 3amutants 3amycelium 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anutrient deficiencies 3aplasma membrane 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3ayeasts1 aKnight, Simon A.

In this paper, we review the global benefits of arbuscular mycorrhiza application for grapevine production and the impact of viticultural practices for these natural microorganisms to establish symbiotic associations with vine roots. This review aims to provide a brief overview of the status of and to outline the most important application and effects of AMF in viticulture in order to increase the sustainability of vineyards. Viticulture has to adapt to new challenges of pest and chemicals fertilizers management, climate change, global urbanization, land erosions, increasing droughts, world population growth and others factors that can affect the sustainability of viticultural production systems. One of eco-friendly approaches is to use the application of arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF). Response of grapevine to AMF application demonstrated a lot of benefits for viticultural ecosystems. Technologies on sustainable agriculture and conservation of ecosystems vineyards may consider arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi as biofertilizers. Arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi could be an effective tool for improving the agro-enviromental perfomance in viticultural farms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVitis 3abiofertilizers 3aclimate change 3apests 3apopulation growth 3asustainable agriculture 3aurbanization 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3avines 3avineyards 3aviticulture 0aarbuscular mycorrhiza fungi 0abiofertilizer 0aplant growth and development 0asymbiosis 0aVitis vinifera0 tCurrent Trends in Natural Sciences.g2016 Dec., v. 5, no. 10 p.107-116dEditura Universitatii din PitestiwJournal:27829x2284-953X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245008700174300001800261520169900279592002801978650002102006650001102027650002002038650002302058650001202081650002402093650002302117650002002140650002102160650002102181650002402202650003102226650001602257650001302273651001802286653000802304653001202312653001102324653001402335653001402349700002802363700002302391700002102414700002302435700002202458773009902480856008602579852000902665655001202674IND60682303120221116170145.0201202e20200330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068230312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.01.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, Erika L.10aAwareness and knowledge of HPV and HPV vaccination among adults ages 27–45 years  ap. 3143-3148.  aRecent guidelines indicate adults 27–45 years old can receive the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine based on a shared-decision with their healthcare provider. With this expansion in recommendations, there is a need to examine the awareness and knowledge of HPV and HPV vaccination among this age group for cancer prevention.HINTS-5 Cycle-2 is a national survey of US adults, and was restricted to a complete case analysis of adults ages 27–45 years (N = 725). Sociodemographic, healthcare, and health information correlates were assessed for the outcomes of HPV awareness, HPV vaccine awareness, knowledge of HPV and cervical cancer, and knowledge of HPV and non-cervical cancers. Survey-weighted logistic regression models were conducted.Most respondents were aware of HPV (72.9%) and HPV vaccination (67.1%). Respondents were more likely to be aware of HPV and HPV vaccination if they were female, had a higher level of education, and had previous cancer information seeking behaviors. Although there was widespread knowledge of HPV as a cause of cervical cancer (79.6%), knowledge of HPV as a cause of non-cervical cancers was reported by a minority of respondents (36.1%). College education was positively associated with cervical cancer knowledge (aOR = 4.62; 95%CI: 1.81–11.78); however, no significant correlates were identified for non-cervical HPV associated cancer knowledge.While more than half of adults ages 27–45 years are aware of HPV and HPV vaccination, there are opportunities to improve awareness and knowledge, particularly related to non-cervical cancers, as these are critical first steps toward shared decision-making for HPV vaccination in mid-adulthood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPapillomaviridae 3aadults 3adecision making 3aeducational status 3afemales 3ahealth care workers 3ahealth information 3ahealth services 3ahigher education 3anational surveys 3aregression analysis 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aUnited States 0aHPV 0aVaccine 0aAdults 0aKnowledge 0aAwareness1 aWheldon, Christopher W.1 aRosen, Brittany L.1 aManess, Sarah B.1 aKasting, Monica L.1 aMassey, Philip M.0 tVaccine.g2020 Mar. 30, v. 38, no. 15 p.3143-3148dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.01.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245008500174300001600259520142800275592002801703650001901731650005801750650002201808650001101830650002501841650001701866650001201883650002701895650001401922650002501936650002601961650001101987650002401998650001202022650001002034653002402044653001102068653002302079653003102102653001602133653001502149700002002164700001702184700002502201700002202226773011302248856008602361852000902447655001202456IND60628616320221117213349.0190202e20190320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062861632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.12.3042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPittau, Francisco,10aRetrofit as a carbon sink: The carbon storage potentials of the EU housing stock  ap. 365-376.  aIn the next decades, a large share of residential buildings in EU-28 is expected to be renovated to achieve the 2 °C target requested by the Paris Agreement by 2050. Bio-based materials used for increasing the thermal insulation and temporary store carbon in construction elements might be a valuable opportunity that can contribute to accelerate the transition to a zero-carbon society. This article investigates the effect of massively storing carbon in bio-based construction products when used for the renovation of existing facades. Five alternative construction solutions were compared, three with a large amount of fast-growing biogenic material used as insulation, one with timber used for the frame and additional fibrewood as insulation, and the last one with synthetic insulation. A statistic-based Geocluster model was developed to predict the future material flow for building renovation in EU-28 and a dynamic life cycle assessment performed in order to verify the contribution of construction materials in reducing/increasing the carbon emissions over time. The results show that fast-growing biogenic materials have an increased potential to act as a carbon sink compared to timber. In particular, if straw is used as an insulation material, the capacity to store carbon from the atmosphere is effective in the short-term, which represents an important strategy towards the Paris climate Agreement goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3abiobased products 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate 3aconstruction materials 3aemissions 3ainsulating materials 3alife cycle assessment 3amodels 3aresidential housing 3asociety 3astraw 0aBuilding renovation 0aEurope 0aBiogenic materials 0aCarbon capture and storage 0aDynamic LCA 0aGeocluster1 aLumia, Gabriele1 aHeeren, Niko1 aIannaccone, Giuliana1 aHabert, Guillaume0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Mar. 20, v. 214 p.365-376dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.12.3043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002500137245008300162300001800245520130800263592002801571650003301599650002601632650002901658650002101687650001001708650002701718650001201745650001801757650002001775653001301795653003101808653001601839653004001855653000901895653001201904700002501916700002101941700002101962700002201983773009802005856003802103852000902141655001202150IND50070623520221122065310.0131115s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007062352DNAL7 a10.1071/FP130892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPflieger, Stéphanie10aVIGS technology: an attractive tool for functional genomics studies in legumes  ap. 1234-1248.  aLegume species are among the most important crops worldwide. In recent years, six legume genomes have been completely sequenced, and there is now an urgent need for reverse-genetics tools to validate genes affecting yield and product quality. As most legumes are recalcitrant to stable genetic transformation, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) appears to be a powerful alternative technology for determining the function of unknown genes. VIGS technology is based on the property of plant viruses to trigger a defence mechanism related to post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). Infection by a recombinant virus carrying a fragment of a plant target gene will induce homology-dependent silencing of the endogenous target gene. Several VIGS systems have been developed for legume species since 2004, including those based on Bean pod mottle virus, Pea early browning virus, and Apple latent spherical virus, and used in reverse-genetics studies of a wide variety of plant biological processes. In this work, we give an overview of the VIGS systems available for legumes, and present their successful applications in functional genomics studies. We also discuss the limitations of these VIGS systems and the future challenges to be faced in order to use VIGS to its full potential in legume species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApple latent spherical virus 3aBean pod mottle virus 3aPea early-browning virus 3aRNA interference 3agenes 3agenetic transformation 3alegumes 3aplant viruses 3aproduct quality 0aFabaceae 0agene functional validation 0aLeguminosae 0apost-transcriptional gene silencing 0aRNAi 0asoybean1 aRichard, Manon M.

Different from conventional membrane-based micro-fuel cells, its cathode catalyst layer directly contacts with flowing aqueous electrolyte. This makes it essential to well understand the oxygen transport, dissolve and reaction in cathode catalyst layer of the microfluidic fuel cell. For the first time, a pore-scale Lattice Boltzmann method model is developed for the cathode catalyst layer with an underneath electrolyte microchannel. The various nanostructured catalyst layers are numerically reconstructed. The effects of key components (ionomer and catalyst mass fractions) and geometric parameters (porosity, isotropy) on oxygen transport and reaction are investigated and discussed. The modeling results suggest that local oxygen concentration and reaction rate are closely correlated to nanostructure. Oxygen transfer can be enhanced by increasing the porosity yet ionomer is found to be extra resistance. The ionomer and catalyst mass fractions have complex effects on oxygen transfer and reaction. Vertical-anisotropic catalyst layers benefit oxygen transfer, thus ordered nanostructure of cathode catalyst layer holds great potentials to enhance performance. The electrolyte flow rate shows the minimum influence on oxygen transfer and reaction. The modeling results can provide insights into multiphysics interaction and characteristics of oxygen transport in air-breathing cathode and also be reference for flow in porous media involving electrochemical reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3afuel cells 3aisotropy 3amodels 3ananomaterials 3aoxygen 3aporosity 3aporous media 0aMicrofluidic fuel cell 0aAir-breathing cathode 0aCatalyst layer 0aPore-scale modeling 0aLattice Boltzmann method 0aOxygen transport1 aZhang, Biao1 aZhu, Xun1 aYe, Ding-Ding1 aSui, Pang-Chieh1 aDjilali, Ned0 tApplied energy.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 277 p.115536-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1155363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245018800178300001400366520104700380592002801427650002501455650001401480650001701494650002801511650003001539650001201569650002401581650001801605650001101623650001601634650001501650650001401665653002501679653002001704653002501724653002001749653002301769700002901792700002901821700002501850700002901875773014201904856008602046852000902132655001202141IND60763236720221123023635.0220118e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076323672DNAL7 a10.1080/09637486.2021.19217072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerdá-Bernad, Débora10aProbiotic red quinoa drinks for celiacs and lactose intolerant people: study of functional, physicochemical and probiotic properties during fermentation and gastrointestinal digestion  ap. 49-59.  aThe consumption of probiotic foods is rather limited for many sectors of the population (vegans, lactose intolerant and celiacs). Therefore, it is necessary to offer functional alternatives for these sectors. Different red quinoa drinks were fermented with L. plantarum (QLPBB) and B. longum (QBLBB) at different times. Results showed that microbial concentration reached high levels (6–8 Log CFU/mL) after 6 h and probiotic viability was very high (6 Log CFU/mL) after gastrointestinal digestion (GD). However, QBLBB reached the best probiotic concentration at 24 h. From 6 h of fermentation, probiotic resistance to some antibiotics, especially B. longum, could have a great potential to restore the intestinal microbiota during and after treatment with certain antibiotics. QLPBB showed the highest levels of total polyphenols and antioxidant capacity (AOC) after GD. Therefore, these red quinoa drinks have potential as functional probiotic beverages for vegans, celiacs and allergic to milk protein and lactose-intolerant people.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3adigestion 3afermentation 3agastrointestinal system 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alactose 3alactose intolerance 3amilk proteins 3apeople 3apolyphenols 3aprobiotics 3aviability 0aAntioxidant capacity 0afunctional food 0alactic acid bacteria 0avegetable drink 0amicrobial survival1 aValero-Cases, Estefanía1 aPastor, Joaquín-Julián1 aFrutos, María José1 aPérez-Llamas, Francisca0 tInternational journal of food sciences and nutrition.g2022 Jan. 2, v. 73, no. 1 p.49-59dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2066x1465-34787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09637486.2021.19217073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011900173520164000292592002801932650002801960650001701988650001902005650001202024650002002036650001102056650000902067650002402076650001102100650001502111650002502126651001102151653002002162653001402182653003602196653004202232653002102274653002202295700002102317700001702338773009802355856008702453852000902540655001202549IND60706801320221123034928.0201202e20201115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070680132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1155632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWestermann, Paul10aUsing a deep temporal convolutional network as a building energy surrogate model that spans multiple climate zones  aSurrogate models can emulate physics-based building energy simulation with a machine learning model trained on simulation input and output data. The trained model is extremely fast to run, allowing us to estimate simulation outcomes for thousands of different building designs in seconds. Recent studies have shown the diverse benefits for sustainable building design. Surrogates were applied to provide rapid feedback at the early design stage, to accelerate sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis and design optimization, or to improve building model calibration.However, the current process of surrogate modelling offers much room for improvement. In particular, a surrogate model is bound to the specific building design problem it has been trained for. This includes a specific site, requiring time-intensive retraining if the building performance at another location is to be analysed.In this paper, we develop a single surrogate model that spans arbitrarily many locations. For that purpose, we are among the first to use a deep temporal convolutional neural network to process annual multivariate weather data with hourly resolution (≈150,000 inputs). The network learns features relevant to estimate heating or cooling demand. We combine these location-specific weather features with building design parameters to serve as input to a single surrogate model (feed-forward neural network). In a case study with 569 weather files from locations in Canada, we show that the surrogate model deviates by less than 3% when predicting annual heating demand for new building designs at locations outside of the training data set.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3acase studies 3aclimatic zones 3acooling 3adata collection 3aenergy 3aheat 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3aprediction 3auncertainty analysis 3aCanada 0aSurrogate model 0aMetamodel 0aBuilding performance simulation 0aTemporal convolutional neural network 0aMachine learning 0aClimate modelling1 aWelzel, Matthias1 aEvins, Ralph0 tApplied energy.g2020 Nov. 15, v. 278 p.115563-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1155633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245014800175300001600323520118600339536027101525592002801796650001901824650001301843650002601856650001401882650001901896653002301915653002301938653002401961653003601985653003702021700002102058700002402079700002202103700001902125700002002144700001802164773014402182856008602326852000902412655001202421IND60763236820221123023537.0220118e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076323682DNAL7 a10.1080/09637486.2021.19269352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDel Giorno, Rosaria10aHabitual coffee and caffeinated beverages consumption is inversely associated with arterial stiffness and central and peripheral blood pressure  ap. 106-115.  aThe effects of chronic coffee consumption on the cardiovascular system are still under debate. Aortic stiffness, wave reflections, and central and peripheral blood pressure (BP) are milestone indicators of cardiovascular-risk. We sought to investigate the association between coffee and caffeine consumption, arterial stiffness, and central/peripheral BP. Aortic stiffness was evaluated via pulse wave velocity (PWV); wave reflections with the augmentation index (AIx);peripheral systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and central BP (cSBP/cDBP) were non-invasively assessed. Coffee and caffeine consumption was ascertained using a questionnaire. A linear inverse relationship between coffee and caffeine consumption and arterial stiffness and central and peripheral BP was found.Light coffee and caffeine consumers showed β-coefficients for PWV–0.15, SBP–3.61, DBP–2.48, cSBP–3.21, and cDBP-2.18 (all p values < 0.05).Present findings suggest that coffee and caffeine consumption is inversely associated with arterial stiffness and central and peripheral BP in a large population sample. Interventional prospective studies are needed to demonstrate the causal association  aWe gratefully acknowledge for the financial support the Error!

Selection and placement of best management practices (BMPs) in heterogeneous watersheds, requires a multi-objective optimization framework to identify the most cost-effective conservation strategy to achieve desired water quality goals. In this paper, a novel optimization methodology was developed, utilizing a BMP database that includes BMP reduction efficiencies and costs, using a multi-objective sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II) combined with the Soil Water and Assessment Tool (SWAT) served as the NPS watershed model. Cost-effectiveness curves (optimal fronts) between pollutant reduction and total net cost input were obtained for the upper watershed of Miyun Reservoir. The optimal combination of BMP, which include a combination of conservation tillage, careful timing of 30% less fertilizer application, contour planting, and use of a 10-m edge-of-field buffer strip, indicate that the least costly scenario reduced total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loads by 33% at a cost of 1.02 × 106 China Yuan. The cost-effective scenario reduced TN and TP loads 44% and 68% at a cost of 2.52 × 107 and 5.64 × 107China Yuan. The greatest reduction scenario reduced TN and TP loads 55% and 76%, respectively, at a cost of 2.01 × 108 and 2.48 × 108 China Yuan. Watershed with poultry operations, required a 30% reduction in number of birds, along with a 30% reduction in the amount of manure applied was needed to achieve water quality goals. Use of the coupled BMP optimization model can assist the policy makers achieve a cost-effective implementation of best management practices to mitigate agricultural nonpoint sources at a watershed scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abest management practices 3abirds 3aconservation tillage 3acost effectiveness 3adatabases 3aeconomic costs 3afertilizer application 3ahydrologic models 3aissues and policy 3anonpoint source pollution 3aphosphorus 3aplanting 3apollutants 3apollution control 3apollution load 3apoultry 3asoil water 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aNutrient runoff 0aNonpoint source pollution 0aAgricultural conservation management 0aOptimization and placement 0aConservation targeting1 aYin, Peihong1 aSharpley, Andrew N.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 May 20, v. 220 p.581-592dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.02.1273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245013000164300001600294520151800310592002801828650001201856650001201868650001501880650001101895650001301906650001501919650001401934650001401948650002101962650002001983650001302003650002202016650001002038650002002048650001202068650003102080651001002111653003102121653002002152653002302172653001002195653001902205653002402224700001502248700002102263700001902284700001802303773011302321856008602434852000902520655001202529IND60628616720221117214054.0190202e20190320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062861672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.12.3082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jing10aSpatial-temporal variations and reduction potentials of volatile organic compound emissions from the coking industry in China  ap. 224-235.  aCoke production is a significant source of ambient volatile organic compound emissions; thus, stringent control measures must be applied. We fully characterized the trends in volatile organic compound emissions by the coking industry in China between 1949 and 2016 based on a factory-based database and process-specific emission factors. We then projected the reduction potentials in these emissions if different control policies were implemented in 2020 based on three emission scenarios. The results indicate that: (1) the emission factor of volatile organic compounds for coke plants under uncontrolled conditions was 3.065 g/kg coke, and benzene, toluene, and acetone were the most abundant emission species. (2) The annual volatile organic compound emissions from the coking industry increased by an order of magnitude from 3.38 Gg in 1949 to 1376.54 Gg in 2016. The emissions show distinct spatial characteristics, with significantly higher emissions in northern China than in other areas. (3) Compared to the uncontrolled scenario, if basic or more stringent control measures were fully implemented in China in 2020, then volatile organic compound emissions would be reduced by 59% or 82%, respectively. (4) Controlling coke oven flue gases through efficient combustion, sealing and cleaning the openings of coke ovens, and using gas blanketing or carbon absorbers in by-product facilities were the most effective technologies for controlling volatile organic compound emissions from coke production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3abenzene 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3acleaning 3acombustion 3adatabases 3aemissions 3aemissions factor 3aenergy industry 3aflue gas 3aissues and policy 3aovens 3astress response 3atoluene 3avolatile organic compounds 3aChina 0aVolatile organic compounds 0aCoking industry 0aEmission inventory 0aChina 0aControl policy 0aReduction potential1 aZhou, Yang1 aSimayi, Maimaiti1 aDeng, Yuanyuan1 aXie, Shaodong0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Mar. 20, v. 214 p.224-235dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.12.3083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01757naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012800165300001600293520069300309592002801002650001501030650001101045650001601056650002801072650002101100650001501121650001801136650000901154650001401163650001401177700001601191773011001207856008101317852000901398655001201407IND60517580920221119150920.0160331e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051758092DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348160300472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKerekovic, I.10aProperties of gold electrode modified with dimercaptosuccinic acid and electrochemical behavior of copper histidine complex  ap. 276-282.  aA self-assembled monolayer of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid was prepared on the surface of gold disc electrode.

Evidence from Deqing and Nanhai, Eastern coastal China  aThe continuing growth in demand for construction land in China along with the lagging capacity of government-controlled land supply call for solutions that could benefit both urban and rural development. The study analyzes whether opening up the rural construction land market in the course of establishing a unified land market can reduce shortage of urban construction land and associated urban land conflicts. Supply and demand functions of rural and urban construction land are estimated based on the first-hand and the second-hand data on official land transactions in Nanhai district and Deqing County, Eastern coastal China. The optimal land supply of local governments and rural collectives is determined assuming a Cournot-Nash duopoly equilibrium. The results show that a unified construction land market can improve efficiency of land transactions and substantially increase construction land supply. This effect is due to the complementary and substitutional relationship between the urban and rural land supply, where the former was found to be much stronger, especially in economically advanced areas. The observed substitution effect reflects along with the impact of the duopoly market the concurrent monopoly of local governments in coupon trading. The findings point out the relevance of establishing of the land market in different regions with different modes and inform other transition economies that are in the process of preparing or implementing land market reforms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland markets 3aland policy 3amonopoly 3arural areas 3arural development 3asupply balance 3aChina 0aChina 0aCournot-Nash equilibrium 0aDuopoly market 0aLand market efficiency 0aUnified construction land market1 aChatalova, Lioudmila1 aZhang, Anlu0 tLand use policy.g2022 Apr., v. 115 p.105996-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.1059963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01914naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245010800168300001800276520072000294592002801014650001601042650001501058650002201073700001701095700001901112700002301131700002401154700005901178700005601237700006201293773013301355856007901488852000901567655001201576IND60732990720221119111956.0210402e20210318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073299072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.0c030192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobayakawa, Takuya10aDevelopment of Methods for Convergent Synthesis of Chloroalkene Dipeptide Isosteres and Its Application  ap. 5091-5101.  aImproved methods of convergent synthesis for peptidomimetic utilizing a chloroalkene dipeptide isostere (CADI) are reported.

With this strategy, an Fmoc-protected CADI can be directly applied for solid-phase peptide synthesis. Using this approach, we have also identified the CADI-containing cyclo[-Lys-Leu-Val-Phe-Phe-] peptidomimetic, which is a superior inhibitor of amyloid-β aggregation than the parent peptide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3adipeptides 3aorganic chemistry1 aAzuma, Chika1 aWatanabe, Yuki1 aSawamura, Shunsuke1 aTaniguchi, Atsuhiko1 aHayashi, Yoshio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7010-69141 aTsuji, Kohei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4773-87931 aTamamura, Hirokazu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2788-25790 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2021 Mar. 18, v. 86, no. 7 p.5091-5101dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.0c030193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012600170300001800296520108100314592002801395650001501423650001701438650001101455650002201466650000901488650001701497650001501514651001201529651001901541653004301560653002501603653002701628653003101655653003601686653002501722700001601747700001601763773011501779856008601894852000901980655001201989IND60628616820221117213412.0190202e20190320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062861682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.12.3092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForrest, Nigel10aWater-independent residential properties as a transformational solution to achieve water sustainability in desert cities?  ap. 1038-1049.  aCities in regions around the world, such as the Colorado River Basin, face severe water challenges and need solutions that deliver significant progress towards sustainable urban water systems. Real-world experiments help stakeholders learn about solutions and select the most promising for scaling and transfer, but the sustainability experiments literature lacks guidance on how solution case studies might be done. An analytical framework for sustainability solutions developed by the authors is applied in a case study of a water-independent house experiment in Tucson, Arizona to provide insight into whether it could be a transformational solution towards a city-scale sustainable water system. Findings indicate technical feasibility, despite the arid climate, with sustainable co-benefits, but city-scale transformational potential is limited by house size, cost, and cultural acceptability, with a risk of negative systemic effect. Further experimentation towards a more effective solution is seen as worthwhile and areas for improvement and exploration are suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3acase studies 3acities 3aresidential areas 3arisk 3astakeholders 3awatersheds 3aArizona 3aColorado River 0aSustainable urban water transformation 0aScaling and transfer 0aWater self-sufficiency 0aSustainability experiments 0aAnalytical-evaluative framework 0aColorado River Basin1 aStein, Zoë1 aWiek, Arnim0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Mar. 20, v. 214 p.1038-1049dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.12.3093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245010200167300001800269500002000287520125900307592002801566650001901594650001601613650001801629650001901647650001201666650001401678650002401692650001201716650001201728650001101740650004201751650002301793650002601816650001501842650001701857651001001874700002401884700001801908700002101926700001901947700002101966700002201987700002502009773012902034856007902163852000902242655001202251IND60593987520221118013213.0180508e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059398752DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.141062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeslier, Victoria10aFundamental drivers for endolithic microbial community assemblies in the hyperarid Atacama Desert  ap. 1765-1781.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn hyperarid deserts, endolithic microbial communities colonize the rocks’ interior as a survival strategy. Yet, the composition of these communities and the drivers promoting their assembly are still poorly understood. We analysed the diversity and community composition of endoliths from four different lithic substrates – calcite, gypsum, ignimbrite and granite – collected in the hyperarid zone of the Atacama Desert, Chile. By combining microscopy, mineralogy, spectroscopy and high throughput sequencing, we found these communities to be highly specific to their lithic substrate, although they were all dominated by the same four main phyla, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria. Our finding indicates a fine scale diversification of the microbial reservoir driven by substrate properties. The data suggest that the overall rock chemistry and the light transmission properties of the substrates are not essential drivers of community structure and composition. Instead, we propose that the architecture of the rock, i.e., the space available for colonization and its physical structure, linked to water retention capabilities, is ultimately the driver of community diversity and composition at the dry limit of life.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aChloroflexi 3aCyanobacteria 3aProteobacteria 3acalcite 3achemistry 3acommunity structure 3adeserts 3agranite 3agypsum 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3alight transmission 3amicrobial communities 3amicroscopy 3aspectroscopy 3aChile1 aCasero, M.

However, the sulfur characteristics of limestones and then their influences on the SO2 emission have not been clarified yet. In the present study, 80 NSP cement lines with SO2 emission >200 mg/Nm3 were recorded, the sulfur content and species as well as pyrite morphology of limestones were analyzed and then correlated to their resulting SO2 emission. The results show that the SO2 emission of stack gas increases linearly with the SO3 content of limestone used, and sulfates lead to a 50% reduction in SO2 emission relative to sulfides. Compared with average SO2 emission, euhedral pyrite leads to a slightly higher SO2 emission, whereas metasomatic pyrite results in a lower SO2 emission, which can be attributed to the effects of accompanying elements (Ti, F, K, and Al etc.) on the desulfurization reaction and clinkerization in the whole NSP cement line. The relationships proposed can be used to predict the SO2 emission based on the sulfur characteristics of limestone and to rationally utilize high-sulfur limestone in cement industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acement 3adesulfurization 3aindustry 3alimestone 3apotassium 3apyrite 3asulfates 3asulfur 3asulfur dioxide 3aChina 0aSO2 emission 0aSulfur characteristics 0aLimestone 0aNSP cement line 0aPyrite1 aWu, Zhang,1 aLi, Bin1 aWang, Jiawei1 aRavat, Rasheeda1 aChen, Xinzhi1 aWei, Jiangxiong1 aYu, Qijun0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 May 20, v. 220 p.200-211dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.02.1333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100004400151245007900195300001300274520095600287536027601243592002801519596002401547596002301571596001901594650001101613650001801624650001601642650001201658653002601670653002501696653002001721653001701741700003301758700002501791700002201816700003201838773014101870856008602011852000902097655001202106IND60763237120221122235933.0220118e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076323712DNAL7 a10.1080/09637486.2021.19408852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBloise, Aline Maria Nunes de Lira Gomes10aCardiometabolic impacts of saturated fatty acids: are they all comparable?  ap. 1-14.  aIn last decades, a phenomenon named nutrition transition has been observed in many countries around the world. It has been characterised by increased consumption of fat-rich diets, predisposing to cardiometabolic diseases and high prevalence of the obesity. In the dietary recommendations cited to prevent metabolic diseases, there is a consensus to decrease intake of saturated fatty acids (SFA) to less than 10% of total energy intake, as recommended by the Food Safety Authorities. However, fatty acids of different chain lengths may exhibit different cardiometabolic effects. Thus, our major aim was to review the cardiometabolic effects of different classes of SFA according to carbon chain length, i.e. short-, medium- and long-chains. The review emphasises that not all SFA may have harmful cardiometabolic effects since short- and medium-chain SFA can provide beneficial health effects and participate to the prevention of metabolic disorders.  aThis work was supported by Fundação de Amparo a Ciência e Tecnologia de Pernambuco-PE-Brazil [PRONEM 0797-4.05/14], the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico - Brazil [CNPq 311386/2019-9] and CAPES/COFECUB Program (number: 797-14 and 923-20).  aPublisher supplied data  aPRONEM 0797-4.05/14  aCNPq 311386/2019-9  a797-14a923-20 3acarbon 3aenergy intake 3afood safety 3aobesity 0aSaturated fatty acids 0anutrition transition 0acardiometabolic 0adyslipidemia1 aSimões-Alves, Aiany Cibelle1 aDebora Santos, Alves1 aMorio, Béatrice,1 aCosta-Silva, João Henrique0 tInternational journal of food sciences and nutrition.g2022 Jan. 2, v. 73, no. 1 p.1-14dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2066x1465-34787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09637486.2021.19408853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245013400169300001600303520150200319592002801821650002101849650001701870650002201887650001801909650001501927650002201942650002501964650001001989650004401999653001502043653003002058653002102088653002302109653001802132700001802150700002002168700001902188700001802207773015602225856008302381852000902464655001202473IND60525651620221118022810.0190318e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052565162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2015.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakita, Charlene10aComparative analyses of flavonoid content in Moringa oleifera and Moringa ovalifolia with the aid of UHPLC-qTOF-MS fingerprinting  ap. 116-122.  aMoringa species are multipurpose plants with nutritional, medicinal and industrial benefits. The flavonoids content of Moringa oleifera and Moringa ovalifolia was studied using an Ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-qTOF-MS). The results revealed that the two species contain at least 17 flavonoids compounds between them. However, M. oleifera was found to contain the most flavonoids than M. ovalifolia which contained only three of the total flavonoids. Furthermore, all flavonoids in M. ovalifolia were shown to be glycosylated with only rutinoside. Based on the current findings, the two species seem to have a different composition of flavonoids, therefore suggesting an underlying variation at the genetic level for flavonoid biosynthesis. The difference in the flavonoids composition of the two species as seen from the results is mainly due to glycosylation capabilities, with M. oleifera being more superior in this case. Prior to this study, there has been no comprehensive investigation into the flavonoid content (or any phytochemical studies) of M. ovalifolia and its comparison to other Moringa species. Furthermore, vicenin-2 a molecule that has recently been linked to various medicinal properties has been identified in M. oleifera. Overall, M. oleifera (as compared to M. ovalifolia) is expected to exhibit wider pharmacological activities owing to its glycosylation complexity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMoringa oleifera 3abiosynthesis 3agenetic variation 3aglycosylation 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3amedicinal properties 3arutin 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aFlavonoids 0aGlycosylation Moringaceae 0aMoringa oleifera 0aMoringa ovalifolia 0aUHPLC-QTOF-MS1 aChimuka, Luke1 aSteenkamp, Paul1 aCukrowska, Ewa1 aMadala, Edwin0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2016 July, v. 105 p.116-122dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2015.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006700149245007800216506010400294506007600398520127700474592002801751506003701779650002301816650001101839650001801850650001901868653001901887653002601906653002601932700006701958700002302025700006602048773009402114856008402208852000902292655001202301IND60778758620221207144616.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077875862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2022.1130832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClavijo-Núñez, Susana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8969-754X10aEnergy poverty in Andalusia.

The research carried out in this work shows the importance it acquires in the current context, where a large part of the population lives confined to their homes due to the global COVID-19 pandemic and has to face higher energy costs, which affects their health and safety. This paper focuses on showing the need to study and take action on energy-poor households in Andalusia, which has been identified as one of the Spanish communities with the highest level of energy poverty. To this end, the main indicators are calculated for Andalusia. The research is transdisciplinary and has been developed by the Aura team of the University of Seville, which participates in the Solar Decathlon university competition. A high degree of energy vulnerability is concluded, with all the main indicators exceeding the national average. Finally, the conclusions section shows the need to modify the current methodology that defines vulnerable households and develop local databases in territories where the factors that affect energy vulnerability are homogeneous and evolving towards decentralised studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3aenergy poverty 0aEnergy poverty 0aVulnerable households 0aDecentralised studies1 aHerrera-Limones, Rafael1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9948-20191 aRey Pérez, Julia,1 aTorres-García, Miguel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2268-82510 tEnergy policy.g2022 Aug., v. 167 p.113083-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2022.1130833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100005800166245013000224300001800354520148400372592002801856650002301884650001801907650001501925650003101940650002901971650001302000650002602013653001602039653001402055653001502069653002802084700005302112700001902165700002602184773012902210856008102339852000902420655001202429IND60651518220221120093545.0190711e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065151822DNAL7 a293807172pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800170039862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFresán, Ujué1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8140-433814aThe Mediterranean diet, an environmentally friendly option: evidence from the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort  ap. 1573-1582.  aHow food is produced and consumed has consequences for ecosystems, such as resource use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission among others.

Participants (n 20 363) in the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort. Better adherence to the MedDiet was associated with lower land use (−0·71 (95 % CI −0·76, −0·66) m²/d), water consumption (−58·88 (95 % CI −90·12, −27·64) litres/d), energy consumption (−0·86 (95 % CI −1·01, −0·70) MJ/d) and GHG emission (−0·73 (95 % CI −0·78, −0·69) kg CO₂e/d). A statistically significant linear trend (P<0·05) was observed in all these analyses. In this Mediterranean cohort, better adherence to the MedDiet was an eco-friendly option according to resource consumption and GHG emission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean diet 3aeating habits 3aecosystems 3aenergy use and consumption 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aland use 3alife cycle assessment 0aSUN project 0aWater use 0aEnergy use 0aGreenhouse gas emission1 aMartínez-González, Miguel A.q(Miguel Ángel),1 aSabaté, Joan,1 aBes Rastrollo, Maira,0 tPublic health nutrition.g2018 June, v. 21, no. 8 p.1573-1582dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800170039863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03542naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245010100159300001800260520156500278592002801843650001001871650001401881650001701895650002801912650001601940650002401956650001001980650001901990650001702009650001802026650001702044650001102061650001202072650001102084650001702095650001702112650001802129650001302147650003102160650002602191650001602217653001902233653002802252653002602280653003202306653001102338700001602349700001502365700001302380700001802393700001802411700001802429700001302447700001402460700001702474700001602491700001902507700001902526700005402545700001902599773013902618856007802757852000902835655001202844IND60627054120221119091711.0190128e20181224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062705412DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b186642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Shiyao10aDual-Modified Novel Biomimetic Nanocarriers Improve Targeting and Therapeutic Efficacy in Glioma  ap. 1841-1854.  aGlioma is a fatal disease with limited treatment options and very short survival. Although chemotherapy is one of the most important strategies in glioma treatment, it remains extremely clinically challenging largely due to the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and the blood–brain tumor barrier (BBTB). Thus, the development of nanoparticles with both BBB and BBTB penetrability, as well as glioma-targeting feature, is extremely important for the therapy of glioma. New findings in nanomedicine are promoting the development of novel biomaterials. Herein, we designed a red blood cell membrane-coated solid lipid nanoparticle (RBCSLN)-based nanocarrier dual-modified with T7 and NGR peptide (T7/NGR-RBCSLNs) to accomplish these objectives. As a new kind of biomimetic nanovessels, RBCSLNs preserve the complex biological functions of natural cell membranes while possessing physicochemical properties that are needed for efficient drug delivery. T7 is a ligand of transferrin receptors with seven peptides that is able to circumvent the BBB and target to glioma. NGR is a peptide ligand of CD13 that is overexpressed during angiogenesis, representing an excellent glioma-homing property. After encapsulating vinca alkaloid vincristine as the model drug, T7/NGR-RBCSLNs exhibited the most favorable antiglioma effects in vitro and in vivo by combining the dual-targeting delivery effect. The results demonstrate that dual-modified biomimetic nanoparticles provide a potential method to improve drug delivery to the brain, hence increasing glioma therapy efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVinca 3aalkaloids 3aangiogenesis 3abiocompatible materials 3abiomimetics 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3acell membranes 3adrug therapy 3aencapsulation 3aerythrocytes 3aglioma 3aligands 3alipids 3ananocarriers 3ananomedicine 3ananoparticles 3apeptides 3aphysicochemical properties 3atransferrin receptors 3avincristine 0adual-targeting 0abiomimetic nanocarriers 0ablood−brain barrier 0ablood−brain tumor barrier 0aglioma1 aLiang, Meng1 aWang, Yuli1 aCui, Lin1 aGao, Chunhong1 aChu, Xiaoyang1 aLiu, Qianqian1 aFeng, Ye1 aGong, Wei1 aYang, Meiyan1 aLi, Zhiping1 aYang, Chunrong1 aXie, Xiangyang1 aYang, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3195-20691 aGao, Chunsheng0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Dec. 24, v. 11, no. 2 p.1841-1854dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b186643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245011800167300001600285500000900301520176000310592002802070650001302098650002902111650002102140650002402161650002402185650002002209650002602229650001302255650002102268650001002289650002202299650002602321650001802347650002902365650002102394650001302415650002902428650001702457650001702474650001502491650002202506650002702528651001302555700001902568700002302587700002202610773013702632856007902769852000902848655001202857IND60668653920221122223705.0191228e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066865392DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2004.13202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeForest, Jared L.10aAtmospheric Nitrate Deposition, Microbial Community Composition, and Enzyme Activity in Northern Hardwood Forests  ap. 132-138.  aepub  aOn a global scale, human activity has increased the atmospheric input of NO⁻ ₃ to many terrestrial ecosystems. Anthropogenic NO⁻ ₃ may be a potent modifier of ecosystem function, especially in temperate forests that are sometimes N limited. However, the impact of chronic N deposition on soil microorganisms is still poorly understood. Nitrate entering Lake States forests is rapidly assimilated by the microbial community and it is subsequently released as NH⁺ ₄ Because high levels of NH⁺ ₄ inhibit the activity of lignin-degrading soil fungi, we reasoned that chronic N additions could alter the composition and function of heterotrophic microbial communities in soil, and hence the ecosystem-level processes they mediate. We tested our hypothesis in four northern hardwood ecosystems in northern Michigan, which received experimental N additions (30 kg NO⁻ ₃–N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) during the past 8 yr. We quantified microbial community function by measuring the activity of extracellular enzymes involved in plant litter degradation and described microbial community composition using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Chronic N additions significantly suppressed β-glucosidase activity by 24% in mineral soil and suppressed phenol oxidase activity by 35% in surface litter. We found no evidence that chronic N additions altered microbial community composition; NO⁻ ₃ addition did not alter the relative abundance of bacterial, actinomycetal, fungal, or protozoan PLFAs. However, NO⁻ ₃ additions significantly reduced microbial biomass by 18% relative to the control treatment. Results indicate that N additions broadly suppressed all microbial groups, not just the activity and abundance of lignin-degrading fungi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProtozoa 3aanthropogenic activities 3abeta-glucosidase 3acommunity structure 3aecological function 3aenzyme activity 3aextracellular enzymes 3ahardwood 3ahardwood forests 3alakes 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3amineral soils 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aplant litter 3asoil ecology 3asoil fungi 3atemperate forests 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3aMichigan1 aZak, Donald R.1 aPregitzer, Kurt S.1 aBurton, Andrew J.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2004 Jan., v. 68, no. 1 p.132-138dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2004.13203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03936naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002900157245011900186300001600305506002800321520238100349592002802730506003702758650001602795650002302811650001102834650001602845650001502861650003302876650001302909650001002922650001702932651001402949653001402963653001002977653001502987653001303002653001403015653001503029653001703044653001703061653001103078653001503089700001903104700002203123700002103145773015103166856009203317852000903409655001203418IND60739963520221207061441.0210112e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073996352DNAL7 a10.21776/ub.industria.2020.009.03.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerdani, Claudia Gadizza10aKarakterisasi Mutu Ekstrak Kopi Hijau di Jawa Timur untuk Meningkatkan Nilai Ekonominya sebagai Bahan Sediaan Obat  ap. 228-240.  aResource is Open Access  aAbstrak Kandungan polifenol dalam kopi hijau berpotensi menurunkan akumulasi lemak viseral sehingga dapat menurunkan kadar kolesterol total secara signifikan.

Kata kunci: ekstraksi, fenol, kopi hijau, optimasi, polifenol Abstract Polyphenol of green coffee potentially reduces the accumulation of visceral fat so it decreases total cholesterol level significantly. Green coffee has a less delicious taste to be consumed. A study of polyphenol extraction for further processing should be done so it has a higher economic value. The study aimed to determine the optimal combination of solvent concentration and solvent addition ratio for the highest extraction yield and polyphenol’s content. The research method for this research was Response Surface Method with Central Composite Design. This research used two factors, solvent concentration (60-90%) and the solvent addition ratio (20-40 ml/g). The responses were the total phenol and extraction yield. The optimum condition obtained was in treatment with 84.92% solvent concentration and a 40 ml/g solvent ratio with the desirability of 0.87. The program prediction resulted total phenol of 534.50 mg GAE/g and extraction yield of 17.179%. The verified optimal solution obtained the total phenol was 538.83 mg GAE/g, and the yield was 15.39%.

MF138126. P. aeruginosa produced mono-/di-rhamnolipids congeners whereas, Meyerozyma sp. produced acidic and lactonic forms of sophorolipids with crude oil. The values of critical micelle concentrations of rhamnolipids and sophorolipids were 40 mg/L and 50 mg/L with reductions in surface tension of water to 29 mN/m and 33 mN/m. Dynamic light scattering revealed that the average diameter of micellar aggregates of rhamnolipids ranged between 300 and 350 nm and the average size of sophorolipids micelles was 309 nm and 380 nm. Biosurfactants from P. aeruginosa and Meyerozyma sp. exhibited emulsification activities of 87% and 84% in crude oil. Cell surface hydrophobicity of both strains was higher in the presence of hydrophobic contaminants. The biosurfactants showed stability under varying pH, NaCl concentrations and temperatures. Gravimetric and GC-MS analyses demonstrated that P. aeruginosa degraded 91% of the petroleum hydrocarbons while Meyerozyma sp. showed 87% biodegradation efficiency. P. aeruginosa and Meyerozyma sp. have also been found to degrade halogen-containing compounds and showed excellent crude oil degradation efficiency. It is concluded that both strains have high potential of applications in the bioremediation of hydrocarbons-contaminated sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeyerozyma 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3abiosurfactants 3aemulsifying 3ahydrophobicity 3amicelles 3apH 3apetroleum 3arhamnolipids 3asophorolipids 3asurface tension 0aBiodegradation 0aBioremediation 0aBiosurfactants 0aMicroorganisms 0aCrude oil1 aAli, Muhammad Ishtiaq1 aNaeem, Ali,1 aBadshah, Malik1 aIqbal, Mazhar1 aJamal, Asif1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5834-52101 aHuang, Zaixing0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 418 p.126276-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1262763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001800167245010200185300001600287500001500303520103900318592002801357650002601385650001401411650003101425650001301456650001301469650001101482650001401493650001001507650004801517650003501565650001801600650003701618650001101655650001301666650001401679650002601693651001001719653001201729653001001741653001001751653000801761653000801769653001001777653000801787653000801795653003401803653000701837653002201844653000801866653000801874653000801882653000701890653001001897653001001907653000801917653000701925700002301932700001701955773007401972856008202046852000902128655001202137IND60099063020221117192022.0161021e20130610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009906302DNAL7 a235668332pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.03.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Yan-Fang10aABCD1 mutations and phenotype distribution in Chinese patients with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy  ap. 117-120.  a2019-12-06  aX-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a neurodegenerative disorder resulting from mutations within the ABCD1 gene. Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) and childhood cerebral ALD (CCALD) are most common phenotypes in the Western ALD patients. Here we performed mutation analysis of ABCD1 in 10 Chinese ALD families and identified 8 mutations, including one novel deletion (c.1477_1488+11del23) and 7 known mutations. Mutations c.1772G>A and c.1816T>C were first reported in the Chinese patients. Mutations c.1661G>A and c.1679C>T were demonstrated to be de novo mutations. The dinucleotide deletion 1415_16delAG, described as a mutational hotspot in different ethnic groups, was identified in two families. In addition, we performed a retrospective nation-wide mutation study of X-linked ALD in China based on a literature review. The retrospective study further confirmed the hypothesis that exon 6 is a potential mutation cluster region in the Asian populations. Furthermore, it suggested that CCALD is the most common phenotype in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aretrospective studies 3aphenotype 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3amutation 3apatients 3aAsians 3achildhood 3aexons 2aATP-Binding Cassette Transportersxgenetics 2aAdrenoleukodystrophyxgenetics 2aAsian People. 2aDNA Mutational Analysisxmethods 2aHumans 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aRetrospective Studies 3aChina 0aChinese 0agenes 0aX-ALD 0aNBF 0aMRI 0aACALD 0aCNS 0aAMN 0aX-linked adrenoleukodystrophy 0afs 0aMutation analysis 0aTMD 0aPCR 0aCER 0akb 0aABCD1 0aCCALD 0adel 0aAO1 aNanac(Cartoonist)1 aWu, Zhi-Ying0 tGene.g2013 June 10, v. 522 p.117-120dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.03.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002500166245014100191300001800332520166000350592002802010650001702038650000902055650001402064650001302078650001802091650001702109650001702126650001102143650001002154650002602164650004302190650002502233650002202258650002402280650001702304650002302321650001202344653000902356653001702365653001602382700002802398700002402426700002002450700002102470700002302491700001902514700001702533700001802550773012802568856008102696852000902777655001202786IND60651518320221120093525.0190711e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065151832DNAL7 a294095622pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800170040132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEloranta, Aino-Maija10aBirth weight is associated with dietary factors at the age of 6–8 years: the Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children (PANIC) study  ap. 1278-1285.  aLow and high birth weight have been associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and CVD. Diet could partly mediate this association, e.g. by intra-uterine programming of unhealthy food preferences. We examined the association of birth weight with diet in Finnish children. Birth weight standard deviation score (SDS) was calculated using national birth register data and Finnish references. Dietary factors were assessed using 4 d food records. Diet quality was defined by the Finnish Children Healthy Eating Index (FCHEI). The Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children (PANIC) study. Singleton, full-term children (179 girls, 188 boys) aged 6–8 years. Birth weight was inversely associated (standardized regression coefficient β; 95 % CI) with FCHEI (−0·15; −0·28, −0·03) in all children and in boys (−0·27; −0·45, −0·09) but not in girls (−0·01; −0·21, 0·18) after adjusting for potential confounders (P=0·044 for interaction). Moreover, higher birth weight was associated with lower fruit and berries consumption (−0·13; −0·25, 0·00), higher energy intake (0·17; 0·05, 0·29), higher sucrose intake (0·19; 0·06, 0·32) and lower fibre intake (−0·14; −0·26, −0·01). These associations were statistically non-significant after correction for multiple testing. Children with birth weight >1 SDS had higher sucrose intake (mean; 95 % CI) as a percentage of energy intake (14·3 E%; 12·6, 16·0 E%) than children with birth weight of −1 to 1 SDS (12·8 E%; 11·6, 14·0 E%) or <−1 SDS (12·4 E%; 10·8, 13·9 E%; P=0·036). Higher birth weight may be associated with unhealthy diet in childhood.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirth weight 3aboys 3achildhood 3achildren 3aenergy intake 3afood choices 3afood records 3afruits 3agirls 3ahealthy eating habits 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutritional adequacy 3aphysical activity 3aregression analysis 3asmall fruits 3astandard deviation 3asucrose 0aDiet 0aDiet quality 0aPANIC study1 aJääskeläinen, Jarmo,1 aVenäläinen, Taisa1 aJalkanen, Henna1 aKiiskinen, Sanna1 aMäntyselkä, Aino1 aSchwab, Ursula1 aLindi, Virpi1 aLakka, Timo A0 tPublic health nutrition.g2018 May, v. 21, no. 7 p.1278-1285dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800170040133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01559naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012200170300001600292520047200308592002800780650001300808650001300821650001500834650001800849650001300867650002900880653001300909653001100922653002000933653001600953700002000969700001800989773009701007856008401104852000901188655001201197IND60647562920221119233832.0190620e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064756292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2018.05.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhan, Duy-Thach10aHigh-sensitivity and fast-response hydrogen sensor for safety application using Pt nanoparticle-decorated 3D graphene  ap. 167-171.  aIn this study, we synthesized platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (NPs) loaded onto three-dimensional (3D) graphene for hydrogen (H2) sensing using a polymer-assisted hydrothermal (HT) method.

In addition, this approach is economically competitive due to its simplicity and low cost, it requires no centrifugal separation for the soluble yeast cells and does not need support, as is the case with immobilized cells. This paper evaluates the behavior of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain with flocculent characteristics and the effect of altering the inlet sucrose concentration, flow cell recycle and residence time using a central composite design. A novel experimental process for ethanol fermentation was designed and evaluated by employing a cell-recycling two-tower-reactor system in which each tower was individually equipped with a settler for recycling flocculent yeast. The fermentation experiments were conducted in a system with two tower reactors, operated continuously in series. Fermentation yields of approximately 86% and productivity up to 18g/Lh were obtained in this process. The system was effective for continuous ethanol fermentation from sucrose, cane juice and molasses obtained from sugar manufacturing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abiomass 3aethanol fermentation 3aflocculation 3aimmobilized cells 3ajuices 3amanufacturing 3amolasses 3arecycling 3asucrose 3ayeasts 0aBioprocessing 0aBioreactors 0aEthanol 0aFermentation 0aFlocculation 0aSaccharomyces cerevisiae1 aSousa, Marina Del Bianco1 aGuidini, Carla Zanella1 aResende, Miriam Maria de1 aCardoso, Vicelma Luiz1 aRibeiro, Eloízio Júlio0 tProcess Biochemistry.g2015 Nov., v. 50 p.1725-1729dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2015.07.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03920naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002100167245011000188300001400298500001500312520170500327592002802032650003702060650001802097650001502115650001102130650002402141650004302165650001302208650001402221650001102235650001902246650001002265650001202275650002302287650001102310650001702321650001202338650004002350650007202390650004002462650002102502650001502523650006002538650000902598653000902607653000902616653000802625653001202633653000902645653002202654653000902676653000902685653001202694653001002706653000902716653001202725653000902737653000902746653004002755653000902795653001802804653001002822700002702832700002102859700002802880700003102908700002402939773007202963856008203035852000903117655001203126IND60099063120221117192011.0161021e20130610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009906312DNAL7 a235453072pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.03.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalán-Cobo, Ana10aCellular overexpression of Aquaporins slows down the natural HIF-2α degradation during prolonged hypoxia  ap. 18-26.  a2019-12-06  aOverexpression of cell membrane aquaporins (AQPs) has recently been associated with tumor formation, particularly with angiogenesis, cell migration and proliferation. Additionally, the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) family has been extensively implicated in tumor growth and recent studies evidence interplay between AQP expression and HIF stability. Therefore, we decided to explore the effect that AQP overexpression has on the long-term stability of HIF-2α in PC12 cells exposed to chronic hypoxia, characteristic of a growing tumor. HIF-2α levels were analyzed in five PC12 clones with stable overexpression of different proteins (AQP1, AQP3, AQP5, G6PD, and GDNF), in PC12 transiently expressing G6PD or Kv4.2, and in wild-type PC12 cells. Overexpression of AQP1, 3 or 5 in PC12 cells (o-AQP-c) prevented the HIF-2α down-expression otherwise observed, after 16h at 1% O2, in wt-PC12 and in PC12 overexpressing non-AQP proteins. Longer HIF-2α stability was also observed in o-AQP-c exposed to cobalt chloride or dimethyloxallyl glycine. Normal proteasome activity was confirmed in all clones analyzed. Levels of HIF target genes (PHD2 and 3, VEGF, and PGK1) were 2–4 fold higher in hypoxic o-AQP-c than in wt-PC12 cells, and morphological changes in colony shape together with higher cell proliferation rates were observed in all o-AQP-c. Interestingly, analysis of PHD levels under normoxia revealed lower (50%) PHD3 expression in o-AQP-c than in controls. Our results indicate that AQP overexpression in PC12 cells prolongs HIF-2α stability during chronic hypoxia, leading to higher level of induction of its target genes and likely conferring to these cells a more tumor-like phenotype.  aPublisher supplied data 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3acell movement 3aaquaporins 3acobalt 3agene overexpression 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3anormoxia 3aphenotype 3aclones 3acell membranes 3agenes 3ahypoxia 3acell proliferation 3aoxygen 3aangiogenesis 2aAnimals 2aAquaporinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aBasic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Hypoxiaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aPC12 Cells 2aProteasome Endopeptidase Complexxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRats 0aAQPs 0aPHDs 0aHIF 0aHIF-2α 0aPC12 0aAquaporins (AQPs) 0aGDNF 0aPGK1 0ao-AQP-c 0aTumor 0aVEGF 0aHypoxia 0aPHD3 0aG6PD 0aglucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase 0aDMOG 0aProliferation 0aCoCl21 aSánchez-Silva, Rocío1 aSerna Vara, Ana,1 aAbreu-Rodríguez, Irene1 aMuñoz-Cabello, Ana María1 aEchevarría, Miriam0 tGene.g2013 June 10, v. 522 p.18-26dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.03.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009400167500002200261520108500283592002801368650002601396650001501422650002401437650001901461650001701480650001001497650001401507650002101521650001801542650001401560650002301574650001901597650002301616653002201639653003101661653001801692653003501710700002601745700001901771773009101790856008301881852000901964655001201973IND60662874220221119053127.0191010s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066287422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2019.1156462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRafique, Rafia10aRecent advances of upconversion nanoparticles in theranostics and bioimaging applications  aPre-press version  aIn recent years, upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have attracted considerable research interest because of their unique optical merits (unique optical merits: sharp emissions, large anti-Stokes shifts, long lifetimes, and negligible photobleaching) that make them as ideal candidates for unified applications in biomedical fields including drug delivery, bioimaging, and cancer therapy. In this review, we illustrate the recent efforts on fabrication of UCNPs with organic, inorganic and biomolecules that create UCNPs as the next generation biomedical agents for drug delivery and cancer therapy. The introduction summarizes the recent developments and uses of UCNPs in analytical and biomedical research areas. We discuss the optical properties and the surface modifications of UCNPs and their synergistic theranostic applications in cancer therapies (chemo and photothermal) in vivo and in vitro studies. Further, we also discuss the cytotoxicity of UCNPs. Finally, the prospects and future challenges of UCNPs in drug delivery, bioimaging and cancer therapy are described.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical compounds 3abioimaging 3abiomedical research 3acancer therapy 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3aemissions 3ain vitro studies 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3aoptical properties 3aphotobleaching 3aprecision medicine 0aSurface chemistry 0aUpconversion nanoparticles 0aDrug delivery 0aIn vitro and in vivo studies1 aKailasa, Suresh Kumar1 aPark, Tae Jung0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2019, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2019.1156463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03696naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245008600160500001900246500002000265520158500285592002801870596005901898596007201957596013302029596008402162596006602246596007902312650003302391650004402424650002202468650001202490650002102502650001802523650002102541650001902562650001702581650001402598650001302612650002102625650001602646650002502662650001802687650001702705650001602722700001302738700001602751700005902767700001502826700001902841700001402860700001302874773013602887856007403023852000903097655001203106IND60717222920221120070103.0201110e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071722292DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.135152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yinglong10aBlending with shellac to improve water resistance of soybean protein isolate film  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe study aims to explore a new packaging film which is prepared with soybean protein isolate (SPI) and shellac (SHL) and research the effects of the amount of SHL on the water resistance and analyze the cause. Compared with the SPI film, the water resistance including water vapor permeability, moisture content, water absorption, contact angle, the resistance of mechanical strength and appearance to immersion water of SPI/SHL films were significantly improved. The films were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X‐ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscope. The microstructure of films has been changed by the addition of SHL because the hydrogen bond was formed between SPI and SHL by the results of FTIR and XRD. All results showed that a dense reticular structure was formed with SPI after adding SHL, which improved the water resistance of the composite films. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Shellac (SHL), which is recognized as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is a natural animal secretory substance with nontoxic, moisture proof, and other properties. Soybean protein isolate (SPI) film is a kind of biodegradable packaging material, which has been studied because of excellent degradability compared with petroleum synthetic polymer. However, the film made from SPI itself is easily soluble in water, which also has the disadvantage of poor water resistance. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to study the effect of SHL on the properties of SPI/SHL composite films and improve the water resistance of SPI film.  aPublisher supplied data  a31101386cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a16XG20cNortheast Agricultural University Academic Backbone Project  a2018001cOpen Topic of Engineering Technology Research Center of Meat Processing and Quality Safety Control of Liaoning Province  aLBH‐Q16019cPostdoctoral Research Initial Foundation of Heilongjiang Province  aC2018026cScience Foundation Project of Heilongjiang Province  a2017YFD0101302cThe National Key Research and Development Program of China 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanimals 3abiodegradability 3acontact angle 3ahydrogen bonding 3amicrostructure 3apermeability 3apetroleum 3apolymers 3aprotein isolates 3asoy protein 3astrength (mechanics) 3awater content 3awater uptake 3awater vapor1 aLi, Tong1 aZhang, Hong1 aZhang, Huajiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6481-49221 aChi, Yujie1 aZhao, Xiaotong1 aLi, Hanyu1 aWen, Yue0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2020 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.e13515-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.135153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03380naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006500155245015900220300001600379520163000395592002802025650001902053650000802072650001302080650002202093650001102115650001002126650001502136650000902151650001002160650001902170650002002189650001102209650002702220650001902247650001402266650001402280650000902294650002102303650000902324650001902333650001302352653002202365653001502387653001702402653001902419653002502438653001502463700002202478700002202500700002002522700002002542700002002562773009702582856009002679852000902769655001202778IND60614292220221122170227.0181015e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061429222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCurtis-Robles, Rachel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1391-531710aParasitic interactions among Trypanosoma cruzi, triatomine vectors, domestic animals, and wildlife in Big Bend National Park along the Texas-Mexico border  ap. 225-233.  aNational parks attract millions of visitors each year. Park visitors, employees, and pets are at risk of infection with various zoonotic pathogens, including Trypanosoma cruzi, causative agent of Chagas disease. Big Bend National Park is located along the Texas-Mexico border in a region with endemic triatomine insects- vectors of T. cruzi- yet the degree to which the parasite is transmitted in this region is unknown. We collected triatomines for T. cruzi detection and discrete typing unit (DTU) determination, and conducted blood meal analyses to determine recent hosts. As an index of domestic/peridomestic transmission, we tested residential dogs in the Park for exposure to T. cruzi. From 2015 to 2017, 461 triatomines of three species—Triatoma rubida, Triatoma gerstaeckeri, and Triatoma protracta—were collected in and around the Park. Adult triatomine encounters peaked in June of each year (52.8% of collections). We detected an overall infection prevalence of 23.1% in adult triatomines (n = 320) and 4.2% in nymph triatomines (n = 24). DTU TcI was the only T. cruzi strain detected. Of 89 triatomines subjected to blood meal analyses, vertebrate host DNA was successfully amplified from 42 (47.2%); blood meal sources included humans, domestic animals, and avian and mammalian wildlife species. Tested dogs were considered positive if reactive on at least two independent serologic assays; we found 28.6% seroprevalence in 14 dogs. These findings reveal interactions between infected triatomines, humans, dogs, and wildlife in and around Big Bend National Park, with potential risk of human disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChagas disease 3aDNA 3aTriatoma 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3aadults 3abirds 3ablood meal 3adogs 3ahosts 3ahuman diseases 3ahuman resources 3ahumans 3aimmunologic techniques 3anational parks 3aparasites 3apathogens 3apets 3arecreation users 3arisk 3aseroprevalence 3awildlife 0aTrypanosoma cruzi 0aTriatomine 0aVector-borne 0aChagas disease 0aDiscrete typing unit 0aBlood meal1 aMeyers, Alyssa C.1 aAuckland, Lisa D.1 aZecca, Italo B.1 aSkiles, Raymond1 aHamer, Sarah A.0 tActa tropica.g2018 Dec., v. 188 p.225-233dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245006700200500001900267500002000286520192500306592002802231596008002259650001102339650001002350650002002360650001102380650003002391650001802421650001002439650001502449650001602464650001202480650002202492773013602514856007402650852000902724655001202733IND60717223020221119053335.0201110e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071722302DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.135262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurlis, Emmanuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1562-533X10aSimple models for predicting water loss of bread during baking  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe baking process has received quite attention during the last three decades, due to its economic and industrial relevance, and since it is associated with staple foods like bread. Because of the composition and structure of dough, a series of complex, simultaneous and coupled phenomena occur in the product inside the oven, which make very difficult the design, control and optimization of the process. For these tasks, the use of mathematical models appears as an adequate solution, although they still represent a complex approach for industrial purposes and their use is limited. In this paper, we focus on prediction of water loss, which is relevant for different aspects of the process, for example, texture and sensory properties, economic impact, energy demand. Two simple models are developed based on knowledge about transport phenomena of bread baking. Both methods involve the estimation of a mass transfer coefficient, which can be related to operating conditions. Good prediction performance is found in both cases, in a common range of baking conditions. Finally, the use of water loss as a design and control variable of the process is discussed, and we propose the construction of a baking diagram with moisture loss as independent variable. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Overall, there is a lack of simple and accurate prediction methods for baking, in contrast with other traditional food process operations, since the complexity of the process makes very difficult the task of developing user‐friendly models. This work proposes two simple models to predict water loss variation during bread baking, based on knowledge about transport phenomena of the process. Implementation of the proposed methods needs simple adjustment of parameters, which can be related to operating conditions (oven temperature and apparent heat transfer coefficient). Besides, the construction of a baking diagram is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data  aPICT 2013‐2423cAgencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica 3abreads 3adough 3aeconomic impact 3aenergy 3aheat transfer coefficient 3amass transfer 3aovens 3aprediction 3atemperature 3atexture 3atraditional foods0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2020 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.e13526-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.135263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01949naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245006200163500002200225520088300247592002801130650002301158650004301181650003001224653002301254653003601277653003101313653002401344653001501368700001801383700002701401773009101428856008301519852000901602655001201611IND60662874420221119053206.0190906s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066287442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2019.1156342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Imran10aAdvances in chiral multidimensional liquid chromatography  aPre-press version  aIt is well known that the chiral separation is different but very important in separation science.

Influence on must and wine quality  ap. 343.  aResource is Open Access  aAims: Soil acidity decreases soil fertility and grapevine growth. Aluminum toxicity has been recognized as one of the most common causes of reduced grape yields in acid vineyard soils. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of two liming materials, i.e. dolomitic lime and sugar foam, on a vineyard cultivated in an acid soil. Methods and results: The effects were studied in two soil layers (0-30 and 30-60 cm), as well as on leaf nutrient contents, grape yield, and must and wine quality properties, in a vineyard dedicated to Vitis vinifera L. cv. Mencía cultivation. The data management and analysis were carried out using ANOVA. Conclusion: Sugar foam was more efficient than dolomitic limestone as liming material since it induced the highest decrease in soil acidity properties at the same calcium carbonate equivalent dose. Effects of liming on leaf nutrient contents, grape yield, and must and wine quality properties were barely observed. Significance and impact of the study: Until recently, little was known about the effects of liming on both vine nutritional status and must/wine quality properties. Thus, this research fills an important knowledge gap.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVitis vinifera 3aacid soils 3aaluminum 3acalcium carbonate 3acations 3adolomitic limestone 3afoams 3agrapes 3ainformation management 3aleaves 3anutritional status 3asoil fertility 3asoil pH 3asugars 3atoxicity 3avines 3avineyard soils 3avineyards 3awine quality 0asoil acidity 0aMencía 0averaison 0aauminum saturation 0atotal acidity1 aOLEGO, Miguel Ángel1 aSÁNCHEZ-GARCÍA, Mario1 aMEDINA, Jesús Esteban1 aVISCONTI, Fernando1 aCOQUE, Juan José Rubio1 aJIMENO, José Enrique GARZÓN0 tOENO One.g2017 Nov., v. 51, no. 4 p.343-343dInternational Viticulture and Enology SocietywJournal:27875x2494-12717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.2017.51.4.20393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03862naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245013700167300002000304520201100324592002802335650001502363650002402378650002802402650001502430650002102445650001002466650002002476650001902496650002102515650001302536650001702549650001602566650001902582650001702601650002802618650002502646650001102671650001902682650002102701650001202722650003002734650001302764650001702777650001302794650002402807650002202831650001702853650001802870650003702888650003702925700002802962700002202990700002903012773012403041856007403165852000903239655001203248IND60666802820221119205519.0190919e20141007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066680282DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra08247h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalgado, Christiane L.10aFluorescent bionanoprobes based on quantum dot-chitosan–O-phospho-l-serine conjugates for labeling human bone marrow stromal cells  ap. 49016-49027.  aBone replacement materials might be promising alternatives to autogenous bone transplants during the repair and reconstruction of human bone tissues. However, bone healing is a very complex process, and the roles of phosphatidylserine (PS) and its moieties are not yet completely understood. In the present study, fluorescent quantum dots (QDs) functionalized with chitosan–O-phospho-l-serine (chi–OPS) conjugates have been synthesized and characterized while focusing on their potential applications as nanoprobes for labeling human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSC). Essentially, chitosan was covalently linked to the peptide (O-phospho-l-serine, OPS) through the formation of amide bonds. In this sequence, these chi–OPS conjugates were utilized as direct capping ligands during CdS QDs (CdS/chi–OPS) biofunctionalization, which was achieved using a single-step process in an aqueous medium at room temperature. The core–shell nanostructures were characterized in detail by UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with selected area electron diffraction (SEAD). The TEM images associated with the UV-vis optical absorption results indicated that ultra-small nanocrystals were formed with average diameters ranging from 2.2 to 2.8 nm. In addition, the PL results showed that the nanoconjugates exhibited “green” fluorescent activity under ultraviolet excitation. Cell viability was assessed in vitro via an MTT analysis, revealing that the bioconjugates were not cytotoxic after 3 days of incubation. Moreover, a quantitative flow cytometry (QFC) analysis and confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFA) were performed, verifying the fluorescence-labeling efficiency and the endocytosis of the bionanoprobes by hBMSC. In summary, innovative fluorescent conjugates were developed with properties for use as biomarkers when imaging and detecting bone tissue regeneration and metabolic events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aambient temperature 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiomarkers 3abone substitutes 3abones 3acadmium sulfide 3acell viability 3achemical bonding 3achitosan 3acytotoxicity 3aendocytosis 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3afluorescent labeling 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3ain vitro studies 3aligands 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3amoieties 3ananocrystals 3apeptides 3aphosphatidylserines 3aphotoluminescence 3aquantum dots 3atissue repair 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aMansur, Alexandra A.

NH Black, Hispanic and adults born outside the fifty US states or Washington, DC had 2·20 (95 % CI 1·79, 2·69), 2·37 (95 % CI 1·91, 2·94) and 1·46 (95 % CI 1·19, 1·79) times the odds of consuming bottled water than their NH White and US-born counterparts. In 2007–2010, water filtration was associated with higher odds of drinking plain and tap water. While most US adults consumed plain water, the source (i.e. tap or bottled) and amount differed by race/Hispanic origin, nativity status and education. Water filters may increase tap water consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aadults 3abottled water 3across-sectional studies 3adental caries 3adiet recall 3adrinking 3aeducational status 3afiltration 3ahealth effects assessments 3aregression analysis 3asociodemographic characteristics 3atap water 3awater filters 3aDistrict of Columbia 0aPlain water intake 0aNHANES 0aDisparities 0aNutrition1 aHerrick, Kirsten A.,1 aWutich, Amber Y1 aYoder, Jonathan S1 aOgden, Cynthia L.,0 tPublic health nutrition.g2018 June, v. 21, no. 8 p.1455-1464dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800170040503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02131naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245006000174500002200234520099800256592002801254650001501282650001201297650001201309650001301321650001501334650001901349650001001368650002601378650003101404650001001435653002201445653002601467653002001493653001601513700002101529773009101550856008301641852000901724655001201733IND60662874520221119053113.0190906s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066287452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2019.1156422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScognamiglio, Viviana14aThe technology tree in the design of glucose biosensors  aPre-press version  aThe remarkable trend of biosensor technology for glucose monitoring driving towards nanotechnology has been widely demonstrated in the last decades by the multifarious research activities in this field. Actually, the convergence of cross cutting technologies beside nanotechnology boosted further progress in the last few years towards the design of low-cost, simple, disposable, and sustainable biosensing devices for point-of-care testing. Further efforts should be focalised towards the development of forefront wearable sensors able providing simple and non-invasive sampling (e.g. exploiting smart nanostructured epidermal sensors).

Data describing where these salamanders are likely to occur along environmental gradients, as well as their likelihood of detection, are important for the prevention and management of amphibian declines. We used presence/absence data from leaf litter bag surveys and a hierarchical Bayesian multispecies single-season occupancy model to estimate the occurrence of five species of plethodontids across reaches in headwater streams in the Gulf Coastal Plain. Average detection probabilities were high (range = 0.432–0.942) and unaffected by sampling covariates specific to the use of litter bags (i.e., bag submergence, sampling season, in-stream cover). Estimates of occurrence probabilities differed substantially between species (range = 0.092–0.703) and were influenced by the size of the upstream drainage area and by the maximum proportion of the reach that dried. The effects of these two factors were not equivalent across species. Our results demonstrate that hierarchical multispecies models successfully estimate occurrence parameters for both rare and common stream-breeding plethodontids. The resulting models clarify how species are distributed within stream networks, and they provide baseline values that will be useful in evaluating the conservation statuses of plethodontid species within lotic systems in the Gulf Coastal Plain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlethodontidae 3abags 3acoastal plains 3adrainage 3alotic systems 3amodels 3anormal values 3aplant litter 3asalamanders and newts 3astreams 3asubmergence 3asurveys1 aWaddle, J.

The investigations were performed at the Microbiology Department and trial fields of the Faculty of Agronomy in Čačak on smonitza and alluvium soils in field and under greenhouse conditions. Maize, wheat, barley and red clover were used as test plants in these studies. The quantitative composition of the fungi in the soils investigated was determined by the Čapek selective agar dilution method. The study results show that the number of soil fungi was dependent on the type and rate of agrochemicals used, on the growing season, and the soil zone the samples were taken from for the analysis. Lower nitrogen fertiliser rates (80 and 120 kg x ha-1) and organic fertilizers stimulated the development of soil fungi, unlike the rate of 150 kg x ha-1. Heavy metals, mercury and cadmium in particular, as well as high rates of the N-serve nitrification inhibitor, inhibited the development of this group of soil microorganisms. Generally, the adverse effect of contaminated irrigation water on the soil fungi was recorded in both soil types, and particularly in the smonitza under red clover. Low detergent (Meril) concentrations did not have any significant effect on this group of microorganisms. In this respect, it can be concluded that the soil fungi number dynamics can be used in monitoring soils polluted by different toxinogenic substances.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTrifolium pratense 3aadverse effects 3aagar 3aagrochemicals 3aagronomy 3aalluvium 3abarley 3acadmium 3acorn 3adetergents 3agreenhouses 3airrigation water 3amercury 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrogen fertilizers 3awheat 0acontaminated irrigation water 0adetergents 0afungi 0aheavy metals 0amineral fertilisers 0anitrification inhibitor 0aorganic fertilisers1 aMandić, Leka G.,1 aVesna, Šumanov1 aSvetlana, Raketić0 tZbornik Matice srpske za prirodne nauke.g2007, v. 2007, no. 113 p.179-191dMatica srpskawJournal:27734x0352-49067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2298/ZMSPN0713179D3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094024001800118040001800136100002600154245010300180300001400283520175300297592002802050650001402078650001902092650001502111650001302126650002402139650002602163650002202189651003102211700002002242700002802262700002802290773014702318856007102465852000902536655001202545IND60569497820221122235302.0180625e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056949782DNAL7 a10.1670/16-0902doi4 ahpet-50-04-03  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSemlitsch, Raymond D.10aExtinction Debt as a Driver of Amphibian Declines: An Example with Imperiled Flatwoods Salamanders  ap. 12-18.  aA comprehensive view of population declines and their underlying causes is necessary to reverse species loss. Historically, in many cases, a narrow view may have allowed species declines to continue, virtually undetected, for long periods of time (perhaps even decades). We suggest that extinction debt is likely responsible for numerous (perhaps most) amphibian declines and that this perspective should be incorporated into the structure of amphibian research and management. Extinction debt, originally proposed to explain changes in species richness following environmental disturbance, also may refer to the proportion of populations of an individual species that is expected to eventually be lost because of habitat change. A conservation framework to address extinction debt focuses research on threats at the individual, population, and metapopulation levels. This approach will help enhance, restore, and protect specific processes and habitats at the proper scale by directing management to the most vulnerable level and stage of a species. We illustrate this approach using Flatwoods Salamanders, Ambystoma cingulatum and Ambystoma bishopi, which occurred historically throughout the Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States but have experienced a greater than 85% loss of populations in recent years. Reversal of these losses is possible only if conservation and recovery efforts encompass individual, population, and metapopulation levels. We illustrate our framework by outlining actions that could be taken at each of these levels to help guide conservation and management of amphibians with complex life cycles and provide options for how to prioritize conservation actions in the face of logistical and budgetary shortfalls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmbystoma 3acoastal plains 3aextinction 3ahabitats 3apopulation dynamics 3asalamanders and newts 3aspecies diversity 3aSoutheastern United States1 aWalls, Susan C.1 aBarichivich, William J.1 aO'Donnell, Katherine M.0 tJournal of herpetology.g2017 Mar., v. 51, no. 1 p.12-18dthe Society for the Study of Amphibians and ReptileswJournal:19745x1937-24187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1670/16-0903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007100170300001800241520149400259592002801753650001701781650001801798650001001816650001701826650001201843650001901855650001601874650001601890650001501906650001301921650001501934650001301949653001901962653002801981653001702009653001502026700001902041700001802060773008702078856008502165852000902250655001202259IND60554127320221120134335.0161024e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055412732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2015.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Jian-Ying10aSugaring-out extraction of 2,3-butanediol from fermentation broths  ap. 1951-1957.  aSugaring-out is a novel phase separation method which was found firstly in the separation of acetonitrile. Nowadays sugaring-out extraction was tried in the recovery of metal ions, biomolecules, drugs and proteins, while its application in separation of hydrophilic primary metabolites from fermentation broths was unknown. In this work sugaring-out extraction of 2,3-butanediol was explored. The effects of sugars and solvents on phase separation and 2,3-butanediol distribution were investigated to obtain an appropriate sugaring-out extraction system. The system consisting of t-butanol/glucose/water was chosen to obtain the operation conditions according to 2,3-butanediol distribution and recovery, including glucose addition, 2,3-butanediol concentration and (NH4)2HPO4 concentration. The glucose-rich bottom phase was reused for fermentation of 2,3-butanediol after removing the solvent. When the fermentation broth (60.3g/L 2,3-butanediol) was mixed with 30% (w/v) glucose, 1.8% (w/v) (NH4)2HPO4 and equal volume of t-butanol, 76.3% 2,3-butanediol was distributed into the top phase and 80.4% glucose into the bottom phase, and 78.0% soluble proteins and 86.8% lactic acid were separated from 2,3-butanediol. When the bottom phase was diluted to prepare fermentation medium, glucose consumption and 2,3-butanediol production were similar to those using freshly prepared normal fermentation medium. Sugaring-out extraction is a novel alternative separation for bio-based chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aculture media 3adrugs 3afermentation 3aglucose 3ahydrophilicity 3alactic acid 3ametabolites 3ametal ions 3aproteins 3aseparation 3asolvents 0a2,3-Butanediol 0aSugaring-out extraction 0aFermentation 0aSeparation1 aLiu, Chun-Jiao1 aXiu, Zhi-Long0 tProcess Biochemistry.g2015 Nov., v. 50 p.1951-1957dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2015.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01432naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245013200166300001800298520032900316592002800645650002300673650002300696650001100719650001200730650001100742700001500753700001700768700001400785700001700799700001900816700001700835700001900852773010500871856008500976852000901061655001201070IND60579261720221116233254.0170816e20160415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057926172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.6b004982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Niannian10aCopper/Silver Cocatalyzed Oxidative Coupling of Vinylarenes with ICH2CF3 or ICH2CHF2 Leading to β-CF3/CHF2-Substituted Ketones  ap. 1780-1783.  aA novel copper/silver cocatalyzed oxidative coupling of vinylarenes with ICH₂CF₃ or ICH₂CHF₂ through a radical process has been developed.

Methods A questionnaire was completed by 1367 AVA members, and the data were analysed using the SAS System for Windows 7.0. Results The country lifestyle and the type of work were seen as major advantages for rural practitioners, and long working hours and after hours demands coupled with sexist attitudes in the case of women, were seen as the main disadvantages. Remuneration, the tiring and often dangerous nature of the work, and social and professional isolation were also seen as major disadvantages. Personal qualities, including the ability to relate to rural people and to fit into rural communities were seen as the most important qualities for a veterinarian in rural practice. The future of rural practitioners was seen to be closely linked to their ability to contribute to the financial viability of the whole animal enterprise and to the fortunes of the rural industries. Companion animals were also seen as a key part of the future work of rural practitioners. Conclusions Rural practitioners are characterised by a strong commitment to rural life and work, and they will increasingly be required to contribute to the financial viability of the whole animal enterprise. The full range of professional skills required are likely to be beyond the scope of the undergraduate veterinary course, but the internet and other modern forms of distance education should help practitioners to acquire relevant skills.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aattitudes and opinions 3abusiness enterprises 3adistance education 3aindustry 3alifestyle 3anational surveys 3apets 3aquestionnaires 3arural communities 3aveterinarians 3aviability 3awages and remuneration 3awomen 3awork schedules 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPractice Patterns, Physicians'xstatistics & numerical data. 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRural Health 2aSocieties 2aVeterinarians 2aVeterinary Medicine 3aAustralia 0aAustraliaxepidemiology.1 aNIETHE, GE0 tAustralian veterinary journal.g2001 July, v. 79, no. 7 p.464-469dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0005-04237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-0813.2001.tb13014.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006100144245011200205300001800317500001900335500002000354520140600374592002801780596003501808596003001843596001101873596002601884596006101910596006101971650003002032650001702062650001802079650001902097650001202116650001102128650001602139650001702155650001802172650001202190700002102202700005702223773012302280856007802403852000902481655001202490IND60717223520221119053400.0201110e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071722352DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2020001142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSladkov, Vladimir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1053-047310aAssignment of complex species by affinity capillary electrophoresis: The case of Th(IV)‐desferrioxamine B  ap. 1870-1877.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe electrophoretic mobility change of desferrioxamine B (DFO) was monitored by UV absorption spectrophotometry upon increasing the thorium(IV) concentration in the background electrolyte at two acidities ([HClO₄]Tₒₜ = 0.0316 and 0.0100 M). These data enabled to assess the speciation model and to determine the equilibrium constant of [Th(DFO)H₂]³⁺ at fixed ionic strength (I = 0.1 M (H,Na)ClO₄). Affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE) turned out to be most helpful in identifying the complexed species by ascertaining its charge and protonation state. The assignment of the correct stoichiometry relied on the reliable estimation of the electrophoretic mobility by assuming similar hydrodynamic radii for (DFO)H₄⁺ and the chelate. The value of the apparent equilibrium constant (log β₁₁₂ = 38.7 ± 0.4) obtained by ACE compares favorably well with those reported in the literature for thorium and a range of other metal ions, according to a linear free‐energy relationship. This method is useful for studying metal‐ligand binding equilibria and provides valuable information for further modelling the behavior of tetravalent actinides under environmental conditions. Structural information about the prevalent solution species in acidic conditions was gained by DFT calculations, confirming the bishydroxamato coordination mode of Th⁴⁺ by the diprotonated ligand.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR‐17‐CE08‐0053cPLUTON  cDéfi NEEDS Environnement  cPiRATE  aCA 18202cCOST Action  aANR‐17‐CE08‐0053cAgence Nationale de la Recherche  aCA 18202cEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology 3acapillary electrophoresis 3adeferoxamine 3ahydrodynamics 3aionic strength 3aligands 3amodels 3aprotonation 3aspectroscopy 3astoichiometry 3athorium1 aRoques, Jérôme1 aMeyer, Michel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2295-78260 tElectrophoresis.g2020 Nov., v. 41, no. 21-22 p.1870-1877dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938548x0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2020001143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02096naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001700167245007300184300001600257500001100273520063000284592002800914650001000942650002200952650001300974650001400987650001401001650001301015650001101028650001101039650003601050650003401086650004001120650004501160650002801205650004801233650002001281650003501301650004501336700002001381700001901401700002201420773008101442856008201523852000901605655001201614IND60099063820221117201008.0141105e20130615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009906382DNAL7 a235708792pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.03.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Ashok10aMyotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1): A triplet repeat expansion disorder  ap. 226-230.  aLETTER  aMyotonic dystrophy is a progressive multisystem genetic disorder affecting about 1 in 8000 people worldwide. The unstable repeat expansions of (CTG)n or (CCTG)n in the DMPK and ZNF9 genes cause the two known subtypes of myotonic dystrophy: (i) myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and (ii) myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) respectively.

The second aim was to study their contribution to the red Bordeaux wine concept. Methods and results: In experiment 1, red wines were presented to expert assessors in dark, then in clear glasses. Assessors selected wines where they detected specific red-/black-berry aromas and then rated the perceived intensity. Results showed a statistically significant impact of visual input on both detection and intensity rating of red-/black-berry aromas in red wines. As part of experiment 2, both red and white wines were rated using dark glasses only. Globally, red-/black-berry aromas were shown to be more specific to red wines. Finally, in experiment 3, red Bordeaux wine experts assessed the degree to which 21 wines (9 red Bordeaux wines, 8 red wines of various origins and 4 white wines) corresponded to their own red Bordeaux wine concept, and then evaluated the intensity of 4 fruity descriptors they had detected in these wines. The results revealed that the expert assessors shared coherent olfactory concepts of red Bordeaux wines, which enabled them to distinguish the red Bordeaux from the other wines presented. Conclusions: The existence of a red-/black-berry character specific to red wines was demonstrated. Moreover, it was shown for the first time that red Bordeaux wines tend to have their own sensory space. The distinctive character of these wines was found to relate to « black-berry » and « jammy-fruit » olfactory descriptors. Significance and impact of the study: This study clarified our knowledge of the fruity olfactory descriptors specific to red wines in general and red Bordeaux wines in particular.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aexperts 3afruiting 3afruits 3aglass 3aodors 3ared wines 3awhite wines 0ared- and black-berry aromas 0aolfactory descriptors 0awine presentation 0adistinctive similar fruity character 0ared Bordeaux wine1 aBarbe, Jean-Christophe1 aCornelis van Leeuwen1 aDubourdieu, Denis0 tOENO One.g2010 Mar., v. 44, no. 1 p.39-49dInternational Viticulture and Enology SocietywJournal:27875x2494-12717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.2010.44.1.14573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245005100172300001600223520114600239592002801385650002401413650002101437650001501458650001301473653000901486653002901495653001801524653003201542653002101574653002101595700001801616773011801634856008501752852000901837655001201846IND60479910420221120061649.0160124e20160217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047991042DNAL7 a10.1080/02827581.2015.10733482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagnussen, Steen10aModel-calibrated k-nearest neighbor estimators  ap. 183-193.  aA generalized difference, a model-calibrated (MC), and a pseudo-empirical likelihood (PEMLE) kNN estimator of a population mean and its sampling variance was assessed with simulated simple random (SRS) and one-stage cluster sampling (CLU) from three artificial and one actual multivariate populations. The number of nearest neighbors (k) for imputing values of a target variable varied from one to eight. The design-based MC estimator had the lowest bias, but bias varied among populations and target variables. In terms of root mean squared errors (RMSEs), the estimators had similar performance, yet RMSEs of MC and PEMLE were less variable. Results were uneven across populations and target variables. The value of k had little effect on RMSE suggesting an advantage of choosing a low value that retains most of the attribute variance in a map. Nominal confidence intervals computed from MC estimators of variance achieved overall the best coverage rate. Rankings of the estimators in SRS and CLU designs were similar. We recommend MC for practical kNN applications in forest inventories for pixel-level predictions and derived estimates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfidence interval 3aforest inventory 3aprediction 3avariance 0aBias 0aroot mean squared errors 0acoverage rate 0apseudo-empirical likelihood 0acluster sampling 0aforest inventory1 aTomppo, Erkki0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2016 Feb. 17, v. 31, no. 2 p.183-193dTaylor & Francisx1651-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2015.10733483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001200161245007000173300001400243500000900257520124700266592002801513650002201541650001501563650001101578650001501589650001101604650001401615650001001629650001301639650001501652650001501667650001401682650002301696651001001719700001701729773014601746856009601892852000901988655001201997IND60668655120221122223619.0191125e197401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066865512DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1974.03615995003800010021x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuo, S.10aKinetics of Phosphate Adsorption and Desorption by Lake Sediments  ap. 50-54.  aepub  aThe objectives of the present investigation were to gain information on the rate and extent of phosphate adsorption and desorption and the energy of phosphate adsorption by lake sediments, and to evaluate the influence of the sediments on the phosphorus status of lake waters. While phosphate adsorption by sediments from Sebasticook Lake, Maine, could be described by the Freundlich equation over a large phosphorus concentration range, the Langmuir equation provided a good fit to the experimental data only at low phosphorus concentrations. The deviation from the Langmuir isotherm at high phosphorus concentrations was explained by an increase in total negative potential of the surface due to phosphorus adsorption and increased interaction between adsorbate molecules. The rate of phosphorus adsorption by the sediments could be described by the equation X = KC₀t¹/ᵐ. The calculated activation energy was 2.7 kcal/mole. The desorption of phosphorus from minerals and sediments was dependent on the anionic species present in the solution. The replacing power of the anions appeared to be related to their ionic potential and complexing ability. The rate of phosphorus desorption could be described by the proposed kinetic equation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aadsorption 3aanions 3adesorption 3aenergy 3aequations 3alakes 3aminerals 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3asediments 3asorption isotherms 3aMaine1 aLotse, E.

Each partner developed a country-specific picture book based on the so-called EPIC-Soft picture book. Representative and common photo series were chosen achieving approximately 25 % of the original picture book (n 23). Three portions from each photo series were randomly selected. The study was performed within the Pilot study in the view of a Pan-European dietary survey – Adolescents, adults and elderly (PILOT-PANEU) project. A sample of adolescents and adults was recruited in five countries: Bulgaria (n 103), Finland (n 34), Germany (n 69), Hungary (n 62) and Portugal (n 77). Among the portions of the corresponding photo series and depending on the type of food, from 18 % (cheese) to 96 % (ratatouille) of participants chose the correct portions. In the perception study, agreement between the portions shown and reported was substantial (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)=0·805) and the mean difference was very low. In the memory study, agreement between the served and reported portions was lower than in the perception study (ICC=0·536). Agreement also seemed to decrease as the appearance of food on the plate differed from food in the picture. Overall, the picture series selected can be applied in future intake surveys to quantify foods similar to those depicted in the pictures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3acheeses 3adietary surveys 3aelderly 3afoods 3amemory 3aportion size 3aBulgaria 3aFinland 3aGermany 3aHungary 3aPortugal 0aFood picture book 0aPortion size estimation 0aValidation1 aLopes, Carla1 aGuiomar, Sofia1 aSevero, Milton1 aRangelova, Lalka1 aPetrova, Stefka1 aHorváth, Zuszsanna1 aCseh, Júlia1 aSchweter, Antje1 aLindtner, Oliver1 aAmbrus, Á.q(Árpád),1 aTorres, Duarte0 tPublic health nutrition.g2018 June, v. 21, no. 9 p.1654-1663dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800170041533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006100144245011100205300001800316520160500334592002801939650001901967650001301986650001701999650001402016650001202030650001802042650002402060650001402084650001702098653002802115653001702143653002302160653002202183653001802205700006202223700006402285773013902349856007802488852000902566655001202575IND60627055220221119091859.0190128e20181206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062705522DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b188432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbstiens, Kathrin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0270-183110aLigand Density and Linker Length are Critical Factors for Multivalent Nanoparticle–Receptor Interactions  ap. 1311-1320.  aAlthough there are a large number of studies available for the evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of targeted polymeric nanoparticles, little is known about the critical attributes that can further influence their uptake into target cells. In this study, varying cRGD ligand densities (0–100% surface functionalization) were combined with different poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) spacer lengths (2/3.5/5 kDa), and the specific receptor binding of targeted core–shell structured poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/poly(lactic acid)–PEG nanoparticles was evaluated using αᵥβ₃ integrin-overexpressing U87MG glioblastoma cells. Nanoparticles with 100% surface functionalization and short PEG2k linkers displayed a high propensity to form colloidal clusters, allowing for the cooperative binding to integrin receptors on the cellular membrane. In contrast, the high flexibility of longer PEG chains enhanced the chance of ligand entanglement and shrouding, decreasing the number of ligand–receptor binding events. As a result, the combination of short PEG2k linkers and a high cRGD surface modification synergistically increased the uptake of nanoparticles into target cells. Even though to date, the nanoparticle size and its degree of functionalization are considered to be the major determinants for controlling the uptake efficiency of targeted colloids, these results strongly suggest that the role of the linker length should be carefully taken into consideration for the design of targeted drug delivery formulations to maximize the therapeutic efficacy and minimize adverse side effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell membranes 3acolloids 3aglioblastoma 3aintegrins 3aligands 3ananoparticles 3apolyethylene glycol 3areceptors 3atherapeutics 0apolymeric nanoparticles 0amultivalency 0aintegrin targeting 0auptake efficiency 0alinker length1 aGregoritza, Manuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1954-69811 aGoepferich, Achim M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7646-02520 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Dec. 06, v. 11, no. 1 p.1311-1320dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b188433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005400146245008500200300001800285520138100303592002801684650001501712650001101727650001501738650000901753650001101762650002301773650001601796650001901812650001301831700001701844700005701861700005401918773013501972856008002107852000902187655001202196IND60631000020221117201925.0190215e20190125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063100002DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b116952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Diwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8119-766610aFirst-Principles Modeling of Lead-Free Perovskites for Photovoltaic Applications  ap. 3795-3800.  aThe material class of hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites has been rapidly progressed in the field of photovoltaic applications. However, this class of materials has limitations associated with its poor stability and toxicity of the lead element. Therefore, there is a strong desire to search for environmentally friendly perovskite materials without affecting the conversion efficiency. First-principles calculations have been employed to study thermodynamic stability, electronic, and optical properties of potential candidate lead-free perovskites. The results show that the ionization energy at the A-site can provide an explanation for the stabilities of hybrid perovskites. The bond lengths and bond angles are likely responsible for the discrepancy in the band gap. The results indicate that DAGeI₃ has better stability and suitable band gap among Ge-based AGeI₃ perovskites. It is observed that the Si-doped perovskites are energetically favorable. CsGe₂/₃Si₁/₃I₃ can become the potential candidate for the light absorption layer because of the ideal band gap among the Si-doped perovskites. Our study offers insights into how composition variation affects thermodynamic stability and electronic properties in this family of Ge-based perovskites. This work is helpful to obtain further insights into developing lead-free perovskite solar cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aenergy 3aionization 3alead 3amodels 3aoptical properties 3asolar cells 3athermodynamics 3atoxicity1 aLi, Qiaohong1 aJing, Huijuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1627-98031 aWu, Kechen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9531-22390 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Jan. 25, v. 123, no. 6 p.3795-3800dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b116953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01491naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245011300173300001800286520059100304592002800895650001400923650002300937650002300960650001100983700002000994773010501014856008501119852000901204655001201213IND60579262320221116232924.0170816e20160415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057926232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.6b005372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKotha, Sambasivarao10aTarget Specific Tactics in Olefin Metathesis: Synthetic Approach to cis-syn-cis-Triquinanes and -Propellanes  ap. 1808-1811.  aA concise and simple synthetic approach to cis-syn-cis-triquinanes and -propellanes has been demonstrated via olefin metathesis starting with exo-nadic anhydride. This approach involves a ring-opening and ring-closing metathesis sequence of norbornene derivatives using Grubb’s catalyst. Early-stage diallylation of norbornene derivatives is demonstrated followed by ring-closing metathesis that delivers propellanes exclusively. Surprisingly, ring-opening metathesis, late-stage diallylation, followed by ring-closing metathesis delivers triquinane as well as propellane derivatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aolefin1 aAswar, Vikas R.0 tOrganic letters.g2016 Apr. 15, v. 18, no. 8 p.1808-1811dAmerican Chemical Societyx1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.orglett.6b005373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245014000175520062500315592002800940650001400968650001500982650002000997650001401017650002201031650001801053650001301071650002001084650001101104650001401115653001601129653002001145653001301165653001401178700002201192700001901214700002101233700002301254700001901277700006001296700001901356700001901375700001801394700001801412700005901430700001801489773011501507856008501622852000901707655001201716IND60656205820221119070523.0200318e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065620582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2019.1039932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsubayashi, Makoto10aTransitions in morphological forms and rapid development of the asexual schizonts of Eimeria tenella through serial passaging in chicks  aAttenuated strains of avian Eimeria parasites, generated by the selection of precocious lines through serial passaging in chicks, have been used widely as live vaccines.

During the development of these high concentration liquid formulations (HCLF), challenges such as aggregation, gelation, opalescence, phase separation, and high solution viscosities are more prone compared to low concentrated protein formulations. These properties can impair manufacturing processes, as well as protein stability and shelf life. To avoid such unfavourable solution properties, a detailed understanding about the nature of these properties and their driving forces are required. However, the fundamental mechanisms that lead to macroscopic solution properties, as above mentioned, are complex and not fully understood, yet. Established analytical methods for assessing the colloidal stability, i.e. the ability of a native protein to remain dispersed in solution, are restricted to dilute conditions and provide parameters such as the second osmotic virial coefficient, B22, and the diffusion interaction coefficient, kD. These parameters are routinely applied for qualitative estimations and identifications of proteins with challenging solution behaviours, such as high viscosities and aggregation, although the assays are prepared for low protein concentration conditions, typically between 0.1 and 20 mg/ml (“ideal” solution conditions). Quantitative analysis of samples of high protein concentration is difficult and it is hard to obtain information about the driving forces of such solution properties and corresponding protein-protein self-interactions. An advantage of using specific spectroscopic methods is the potential of directly analysing highly concentrated protein solutions at different solution conditions. This allows for collecting/gaining valuable information about the fundamental mechanisms of solution properties of the high protein concentration regime. In addition, the derived parameters might be more predictive as compared to the parameters originating from assays which are optimized for the low protein concentration range. The provided information includes structural data, molecular dynamics at various timescales and protein-solvent interactions, which can be obtained at molecular resolution. Herein, we provide an overview about spectroscopic techniques for analysing the origins of macroscopic solution behaviours in general, with a specific focus on pharmaceutically relevant high protein concentration and formulation conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aproteins 3ashelf life 3aquantitative analysis 3aviscosity 3amanufacturing 3aliquids 3amonoclonal antibodies 3asubcutaneous injection 3amolecular dynamics 3aseparation 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aspectroscopy 3agelation 0aSelf-association 0aMonoclonal antibodies 0aMolecular crowding 0aColloidal stability 0atherapeutics 0aSpectroscopy 0aProtein-protein self-interaction 0aHigh protein concentration1 aHaeri, Haleh Hashemi1 aBlech, Michaela1 aHinderberger, Dariush1 aGaridel, Patrick0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 561-562 p.70-88dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2018.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245008700206300001800293520103300311592002801344650002001372650001501392650001801407650002401425650002901449650002101478650002201499650001101521653002301532653001601555653003301571653001701604653002301621700001601644700002001660773009901680856008501779852000901864655001201873IND60647564420221119233555.0190628e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064756442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2019.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBu, Xianbiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9683-799310aExperimental and simulation studies of geothermal single well for building heating  ap. 1902-1909.  aThe hydrothermal geothermal heating depends heavily on the existence of hot water reservoir and the shallow ground source heat pump occupies large area. Here a single well geothermal heating (SWGH) technology is shown, which does not depend on the existence of hot water reservoir. An experimental research on SWGH is carried out and a mathematical model describing the heat transfer through surrounding rock to well tube as well as inside the geothermal well is developed. The mathematical model validated by experimental data is then used to predict the performance of SWGH. It is found that the average extracted thermal output is respectively 448.49 and 413.63 kW in the first and tenth heating seasons. By changing the injection water temperature and velocity, SWGH system can meet the requirement of building heating load varying with the outdoor air temperature and adjust the imbalance of the extracted thermal output among different heating seasons. Understanding these will enable us to better apply SWGH technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aheat pumps 3aheat transfer 3amathematical models 3arenewable energy sources 3awater reservoirs 3awater temperature 3awinter 0aGeothermal heating 0aSingle well 0aDeep borehole heat exchanger 0aWell spacing 0aExperimental study1 aRan, Yunmin1 aZhang, Dongdong0 tRenewable energy.g2019 Dec., v. 143 p.1902-1909dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2019.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01779naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001800161245009300179300001600272500000900288520081300297592002801110650001601138650001901154650001501173650003301188700001501221773014801236856009601384852000901480655001201489IND60668655420221122223602.0191125e196811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066865542DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1968.03615995003200060022x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, M.

Two latosolic soils of nearly similar composition and varying greatly in soil fabric were used. Capillary conductivity of the soils and their water-stable aggregates were obtained. The results showed that the effect of macrofabric on water movement was more pronounced in the lowtension range (0–0.2 bar). Identical flow rates were obtained for the same size water stable aggregates of both soils, suggesting that intra-ped pores did not significantly contribute to water flow in this tension range. It was suggested, however, that microfabric might influence fluid flow properties in the high tension range.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil fabric 3asoil structure 3awater flow 3awater stable soil aggregates1 aUehara, G.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1968 Nov., v. 32, no. 6 p.770-774dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1968.03615995003200060022x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002500166245014700191300001800338520176000356592002802116650001402144650001302158650001602171650001402187650001302201650002102214650002602235650002002261650001102281650001102292651001102303651001902314653002102333653002002354653002702374653001802401700001802419773012902437856008102566852000902647655001202656IND60651519520221120103804.0190711e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065151952DNAL7 a294335942pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800170041772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPotvin Kent, Monique14aThe effectiveness of self-regulation in limiting the advertising of unhealthy foods and beverages on children’s preferred websites in Canada  ap. 1608-1617.  aTo assess the effectiveness of the self-regulatory Canadian Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CAI) in limiting advertising of unhealthy foods and beverages on children’s preferred websites in Canada. Syndicated Internet advertising exposure data were used to identify the ten most popular websites for children (aged 2–11 years) and determine the frequency of food/beverage banner and pop-up ads on these websites from June 2015 to May 2016. Nutrition information for advertised products was collected and their nutrient content per 100 g was calculated. Nutritional quality of all food/beverage ads was assessed using the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and UK Nutrient Profile Models (NPM). Nutritional quality of CAI and non-CAI company ads was compared using χ ² analyses and independent t tests. About 54 million food/beverage ads were viewed on children’s preferred websites from June 2015 to May 2016. Most (93·4 %) product ads were categorized as excessive in fat, Na or free sugars as per the PAHO NPM and 73·8 % were deemed less healthy according to the UK NPM. CAI-company ads were 2·2 times more likely (OR; 99 % CI) to be excessive in at least one nutrient (2·2; 2·1, 2·2, P<0·001) and 2·5 times more likely to be deemed less healthy (2·5; 2·5, 2·5, P<0·001) than non-CAI ads. On average, CAI-company product ads also contained (mean difference; 99 % CI) more energy (141; 141·1, 141·4 kcal, P<0·001, r=0·55), sugar (18·2; 18·2, 18·2 g, P<0·001, r=0·68) and Na (70·0; 69·7, 70·0 mg, P<0·001, r=0·23) per 100 g serving than non-CAI ads. The CAI is not limiting unhealthy food and beverage advertising on children’s preferred websites in Canada. Mandatory regulations are needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanadians 3aInternet 3aadvertising 3abeverages 3achildren 3anutrient content 3anutrition information 3anutritive value 3asodium 3asugars 3aCanada 3aUnited Kingdom 0aFood environment 0aSelf-regulation 0aDigital food marketing 0aHealth policy1 aPauzé, Elise0 tPublic health nutrition.g2018 June, v. 21, no. 9 p.1608-1617dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800170041773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006600146245015400212300001800366520114300384592002801527650003701555650001401592650002801606650002101634650001301655650002801668650002801696650002501724650002101749650001501770650004901785650001101834650001301845650001901858650001401877650001801891650001501909650002301924650003201947650003701979650003702016650001102053700001602064700001602080700006102096700005702157773013502214856008002349852000902429655001202438IND60631000220221117201911.0190215e20190122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063100022DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b117722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarac Oztuna, F.

The thickness of the Fe₃O₄/GO films was simply altered with the number of dip coating cycles. Multilayered films were chemically reduced with hydrazine vapor in order to increase the electrical conductivity. Characterization of multilayer films was performed with scanning transmission electron microscopy, UV–vis spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, quartz crystal microbalance, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. We have performed cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for the evaluation of Fe₃O₄/GO multilayers as possible electrochemical capacitor electrodes. Reduced Fe₃O₄/GO films exhibit high specific capacitances (varying between 200 and 350 F g–¹ at 5 mV s–¹), outperforming the layer-by-layer assembled iron oxides/carbon derivatives (carbon nanotube, graphene).  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadditives 3aatomic force microscopy 3acarbon nanotubes 3acoatings 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrical equipment 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenergy 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrazine 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3aphysical chemistry 3aquartz crystal microbalance 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3avapors1 aUnal, Ozlem1 aErdem, Emre1 aYagci Acar, Havva1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5601-88141 aÜnal, Uğur,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4718-12430 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Jan. 22, v. 123, no. 6 p.3393-3401dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b117723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100003100112245014100143300001800284506002800302520151600330592002801846506003701874653000901911653000801920653001801928653001501946653001401961700003501975700003502010700002602045773020602071852000902277655001202286IND60784590220221207134205.0201111e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078459022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManiglia, Fabíola Pansani10aCaracterísticas clínicas e nutricionais de indivíduos soropositivos para o HIV atendidos em uma clínica universitária de nutrição  ap. 1054-1060.  aResource is Open Access  aNo passado, pacientes que conviviam com o vírus HIV eram considerados desnutridos, fato que se transformou com o passar dos anos e o avanço dos métodos de tratamento. O presente estudo procurou analisar dados extraídos de 22 prontuários de pacientes portadores do vírus HIV atendidos em uma Clínica Universitária de Nutrição com o objetivo de identificar as características clínicas e nutricionais de indivíduos soropositivos e comparar com a literatura. Os dados obtidos para análise foram os dados socioeconômicos, antropométricos (peso, estatura, índice de massa corporal, circunferência da cintura, circunferência do braço, circunferência da panturrilha) e consumo alimentar (ingestão hídrica, frutas, hortaliças e o fracionamento das refeições). Os resultados apontaram que 63,3 % das pessoas atendidas são do sexo feminino. 50% dos pacientes tem idade entre 35-45 anos. Em relação aos dados antropométricos, como a circunferência do braço e circunferência da cintura observou-se prevalência de mulheres classificadas com obesidade, fato que pode ocasionar o desenvolvimento de doenças cardiovasculares. Referente a alimentação se nota um baixo consumo de frutas e hortaliças, e ingestão hídrica. Conclui-se que tais características justificam a inadequação do seu estado nutricional e potencializam o risco de morbimortalidade dessa população ao se associarem ao uso de substâncias prejudiciais, como o tabaco e o álcool, e ao uso da terapia antirretroviral.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 0aaids 0ahiv 0alipodistrofia 0anutrição 0aobesidade1 aBrentini, Dayene Joice Pereira1 aSilva, Ingrid Kérolyn Ribeiro1 aCouto, Larissa Soares0 tRevista brasileira de obesidade, nutrição e emagrecimento.g2020 Oct., v. 13, no. 83 p.1054-1060dInstituto Brasileiro de Pesquisa e Ensino em Fisiologia do ExercíciowJournal:27930x1981-99197nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle06446naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245008700206300001300293506007600306520412700382592002804509506003704537650002104574650002304595650003404618650003304652650003404685650003504719650003304754650001604787650002104803650001504824650001004839650001804849650002404867650002304891650002504914650002904939650002604968650001204994650001605006650002105022650002105043650001805064650001105082650002205093650002405115650001305139650001805152650001405170650002305184650002405207650001505231650000905246650001905255650001305274651001205287651001805299700002005317700001705337700001505354700001605369700002005385700001605405700003005421773012305451856008105574852000905655655001205664IND60517577820221207110516.0160331e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051757782DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-016-1195-z2doi7 aPMC48196012pmcid7 a269836082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLupton, J.

Most consumers are familiar with “essential nutrients,” e.g., vitamins and minerals, and more recently protein and important amino acids. These essential nutrients have nutrient reference values, referred to as dietary reference intakes (DRIs) developed by consensus committees of scientific experts convened by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and carried out by the Food and Nutrition Board. The DRIs comprise a set of four nutrient-based reverence values, the estimated average requirements, the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs), the adequate intakes and the tolerable upper intake levels for micronutrient intakes and an acceptable macronutrient distribution range for macronutrient intakes. From the RDA, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) derives a labeling value called the daily value (DV), which appears on the nutrition label of all foods for sale in the US. The DRI reports do not make recommendations about whether the DV labeling values can be set only for what have been defined to date as “essential nutrients.” For example, the FDA set a labeling value for “dietary fiber” without having the DV. Nutrient reference values—requirements are set by Codex Alimentarius for essential nutrients, and regulatory bodies in many countries use these Codex values in setting national policy for recommended dietary intakes. However, the focus of this conference is not on essential nutrients, but on the “nonessential nutrients,” also termed dietary bioactive components. They can be defined as “Constituents in foods or dietary supplements, other than those needed to meet basic human nutritional needs, which are responsible for changes in health status (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Office of Public Health and Science, Department of Health and Human Services in Fed Regist 69:55821–55822, 2004).” Substantial and often persuasive scientific evidence does exist to confirm a relationship between the intake of a specific bioactive constituent and enhanced health conditions or reduced risk of a chronic disease. Further, research on the putative mechanisms of action of various classes of bioactives is supported by national and pan-national government agencies, and academic institutions, as well as functional food and dietary supplement manufacturers. Consumers are becoming educated and are seeking to purchase products containing bioactives, yet there is no evaluative process in place to let the public know how strong the science is behind the benefits or the quantitative amounts needed to achieve these beneficial health effects or to avoid exceeding the upper level (UL). When one lacks an essential nutrient, overt deficiency with concomitant physiological determents and eventually death are expected. The absence of bioactive substances from the diet results in suboptimal health, e.g., poor cellular and/or physiological function, which is relative and not absolute. Regrettably at this time, there is no DRI process to evaluate bioactives, although a recent workshop convened by the National Institutes of Health (Options for Consideration of Chronic Disease Endpoints for Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs); March 10–11, 2015; http://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dri/) did explore the process to develop DVs for nutrients, the lack of which result in increased risk of chronic disease (non-communicable disease) endpoints. A final report is expected soon. This conference (CRN-International Scientific Symposium; “Nutrient Reference Value—Non-Communicable Disease (NRV-NCD) Endpoints,” 20 November in Kronberg, Germany; http://www.crn-i.ch/2015symposium/) explores concepts related to the Codex NRV process, the public health opportunities in setting NRVs for bioactive constituents, and further research and details on the specific class of bioactives, n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (also termed omega-3 fatty acids) and their constituents, specifically docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAdequate Intakes 3aCodex Alimentarius 3aEstimated Average Requirement 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aNational Institutes of Health 3aRecommended Dietary Allowances 3aTolerable Upper Intake Level 3aamino acids 3achronic diseases 3acommittees 3adeath 3adietary fiber 3adietary supplements 3adisease prevention 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeducational institutions 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aexperts 3afood intake 3afunctional foods 3ahealth promotion 3ahealth status 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3amechanism of action 3aminerals 3anormal values 3anutrients 3anutrition labeling 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apurchasing 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3avitamins 3aGermany 3aUnited States1 aBlumberg, J.

Samples of sweet orange (Citrus × sinensis) trees showing CL symptoms were collected during a survey in noncommercial citrus areas in the southeast region of Brazil in 2013 to 2016. Transmission electron microscopy analyses of foliar lesions confirmed the presence of rod-like viral particles commonly associated with CL in the nucleus and cytoplasm of infected cells. However, every attempt to identify these particles by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction tests failed, even though all described primers for the detection of known CL-causing cileviruses and dichorhaviruses were used. Next-generation sequencing of total RNA extracts from three symptomatic samples revealed the genome of distinct, although highly related (>92% nucleotide sequence identity), viruses whose genetic organization is similar to that of dichorhaviruses. The genome sequence of these viruses showed <62% nucleotide sequence identity with those of orchid fleck virus and coffee ringspot virus. Globally, the deduced amino acid sequences of the open reading frames they encode share 32.7 to 63.8% identity with the proteins of the dichorhavirids. Mites collected from both the naturally infected citrus trees and those used for the transmission of one of the characterized isolates to Arabidopsis plants were anatomically recognized as Brevipalpus phoenicis sensu stricto. Molecular and biological features indicate that the identified viruses belong to a new species of CL-associated dichorhavirus, which we propose to call Citrus leprosis N dichorhavirus. Our results, while emphasizing the increasing diversity of viruses causing CL disease, lead to a reevaluation of the nomenclature of those viruses assigned to the genus Dichorhavirus. In this regard, a comprehensive discussion is presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenome 3aOrchid fleck dichorhavirus 3atrees 3aBrevipalpus phoenicis 3aorchards 3aopen reading frames 3aviruses 3acytoplasm 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aCitrus 3anew species 3aleaves 3aArabidopsis 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amites 3abranches 3aCitrus leprosis virus N 3aproteins 3avirion 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asurveys 3aoranges 3aRNA 3aBrazil 0aOrchid fleck virus1 aChabi-Jesus, Camila1 aGuerra-Peraza, Orlene1 aTassi, Aline Daniele1 aKitajima, Elliot Watanabe1 aHarakava, Ricardo1 aSalaroli, Renato Barbosa1 aFreitas-Astúa, Juliana0 tPhytopathology.g2017 Aug., v. 107, no. 8 p.963-976dPhytopathologyx0031-949X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FPHYTO-02-17-0042-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03303naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245009600173300001400269520172100283592002802004650001202032650002202044650001302066650001802079650001502097650001802112650001202130650001802142650004102160650004302201650000902244650001902253650001602272650001302288650001402301650001102315650002002326650001302346650002702359650001502386653000802401653001302409653001502422653002202437653001702459653001602476700001602492700001402508700001502522700001502537773007502552856008902627852000902716655001202725IND60545298820221120195225.0160901e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054529882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.12.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez, S.10aOxidation of Orange G by persulfate activated by Fe(II), Fe(III) and zero valent iron (ZVI)  ap. 86-92.  aPersulfate (PS) was employed in the oxidation of Orange G (OG), an azo dye commonly found in textile wastewaters. Activation of PS was conducted with iron to generate sulfate free radicals (SO4-) with high redox potential capable to oxidize most of the organics in water. Identification of oxidation intermediates was carried out by analyzing at different times organic by-products generated from treatment of a concentrate dye solution (11.6mM) with 153mM of PS and 20mM of Fe(II) at 20°C. Intermediate reaction products (mainly phenol (PH) and benzoquinone (BQ), and in less extent aniline, phenolic compounds and naphthalene type compounds with quinone groups) were identified by GC/MS and HPLC, and an oxidation pathway was proposed for the oxidation of OG with iron activated PS. The effect of iron valence (0, II and III) in the oxidation of an aqueous solution of OG (containing 0.1mM) was studied in a 0.5L batch reactor at 20°C. Initial activator and PS concentrations employed were both 1mM. Complete pollutant removal was achieved within the first 30min when iron II or III were employed as activators. Quinone intermediates generated during pollutant oxidation may act as electron shuttles, allowing the reduction of Fe(III) into Fe(II) in the redox cycling of iron. Therefore, activation of PS by Fe(III) allowed complete OG removal. When zero valent iron (ZVI) was employed (particle diameter size 0.74mm) the limiting step in SO4- generation was the surface reaction between ZVI and the oxidant yielding a lower oxidation rate of the dye. An increase in the oxidant dosage (0.2mM OG, 2mM Fe(III) and 6mM PS) allowed complete pollutant and ecotoxicity removal, as well as mineralization close to 75%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaniline 3aaqueous solutions 3aazo dyes 3abenzoquinones 3abyproducts 3aecotoxicology 3afabrics 3afree radicals 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3airon 3amineralization 3anaphthalene 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aphenol 3aredox potential 3asulfates 3atextile mill effluents 3awastewater 0aDye 0aOrange G 0aPersulfate 0aOxidation pathway 0aIron valence 0aEcotoxicity1 aVasquez, L.1 aCosta, D.1 aRomero, A.1 aSantos, A.0 tChemosphere.g2014 Apr., v. 101 p.86-92dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.12.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024003000121040001800151100002700169245007700196300001600273500001100289520113300300592002801433650001101461650001301472650001201485650001501497650001301512650001101525650001701536650001501553650001401568650001401582700001501596700002201611700002701633700002001660700002501680700002001705700002401725700001601749700002001765700002201785700002401807700002301831700001501854700002001869700002401889700002101913700001901934700002501953700002201978700002002000700002602020700001702046700002302063700001902086700002202105700002102127700001802148700001802166700001902184700002402203700001602227700003002243700002302273773011602296856007302412852000902485655001202494IND60593984420221118013236.0180508e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059398442DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.129402doi7 a10.1111/ele.129402chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShefferson, Richard P.10aDrivers of vegetative dormancy across herbaceous perennial plant species  ap. 724-733.  aLETTER  aVegetative dormancy, that is the temporary absence of aboveground growth for ≥ 1 year, is paradoxical, because plants cannot photosynthesise or flower during dormant periods. We test ecological and evolutionary hypotheses for its widespread persistence. We show that dormancy has evolved numerous times. Most species displaying dormancy exhibit life‐history costs of sprouting, and of dormancy. Short‐lived and mycoheterotrophic species have higher proportions of dormant plants than long‐lived species and species with other nutritional modes. Foliage loss is associated with higher future dormancy levels, suggesting that carbon limitation promotes dormancy. Maximum dormancy duration is shorter under higher precipitation and at higher latitudes, the latter suggesting an important role for competition or herbivory. Study length affects estimates of some demographic parameters. Our results identify life historical and environmental drivers of dormancy. We also highlight the evolutionary importance of the little understood costs of sprouting and growth, latitudinal stress gradients and mixed nutritional modes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adormancy 3aflowers 3aherbivores 3alatitude 3aleaves 3alife history 3aperennials 3asprouting 3asymbiosis1 aKull, Tiiu1 aHutchings, M.

We investigated long-term changes in rates of species spread following establishment. We used the total area of countries invaded by 1171 insect species for which the date of first record in Europe is known, to estimate their current range radius (calculated as [invaded area]⁰.⁵/π). We estimated initial rates of radial spread and compared them among different groups of insects for all years (1800–2014) and for a subset of more recent decades (1950–2014). Accidentally introduced species spread faster than intentionally introduced species. Considering the whole period 1800–2014, spread patterns also differ between feeding guilds, with decreasing spread rates over residence time in herbivores but not in detritivores or parasitic species. These decreases for herbivorous species appeared mainly in those associated with herbaceous plants and crops rather than woody plants. Initial spread rate was significantly greater for species detected after 1990, roughly 3–4 times higher than for species that arrived earlier. We hypothesize that the political changes in Europe following the collapse of the Iron Curtain in 1989, and the further dismantling of customs checkpoints within an enlarged European Union (EU) have facilitated the faster spread of alien insect species. Also, the number of species first recorded in the Eastern Bloc of the politically-divided Europe before 1989 was lower than for the rest of Europe. A detailed analysis of six recent invaders indicated a dominant role of long-distance translocations related to human activities, especially with the plant trade, in determining rates of spread.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acrops 3adetritivores 3aecological invasion 3aeconomic impact 3aglobalization 3aherbaceous plants 3aherbivores 3ahumans 3ainsects 3ainterspecific variation 3aintroduced species 3apolitics 3atrade 3awoody plants 3aEurope1 aAuger-Rozenberg, Marie-Anne1 aBlackburn, Tim M.1 aGarnas, Jeff1 aPyšek, Petr,1 aRabitsch, Wolfgang1 aRichardson, David M.1 aWingfield, Michael J.1 aLiebhold, Andrew M.1 aDuncan, Richard P.0 tBiological invasions.g2016 Apr., v. 18, no. 4 p.907-920dSpringer International Publishingx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-016-1080-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245013300207300001300340520174800353592002802101650005302129650002802182650001102210650002302221650001802244650001102262653001402273653001502287653003302302653003102335653001002366653001202376653000802388653000902396653001302405653000902418653001102427653000702438653000802445653000802453653000702461773010102468856008502569852000902654655001202663IND60778755720221118181347.0220929e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077875572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nutres.2022.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBigman, Galya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4747-688810aDeficiency in vitamin D is associated with bilateral hearing impairment and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss in older adults  ap. 1-10.  aHearing impairment and vitamin D (VD) deficiency are both public health concerns. The purpose of the study was to examine whether VD deficiency and hearing impairment, specifically sensorineural hearing loss, are associated. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (2001-2006, 2009-2012) were used in this cross-sectional study. The pure-tone average (PTA) was calculated for each ear at low speech frequencies of 0.5 to 4.0 kHz (LPTA) and higher frequencies of 3.0 to 8.0 kHz (HPTA). Hearing impairment was defined as >25 dB (LPTA/HPTA) and was further divided to “unilateral” and “bilateral.” A subsample of 2010 participants with normal tympanometry and otoscopic examinations was analyzed to determine sensorineural hearing loss. Multivariable weighted multinomial regressions were used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. Overall, 3489 participants aged 50 years or older with mean age (mean ± SD) 61.5 ± 9.1 years were included in the final study sample, of those, 924 (21.8%) had VD deficiency (<20 ng/mL). Hearing impairment (bilateral and unilateral) was detected at 1648 (40.5%) participants at LPTA and 2589 (70.5%) participants at HPTA. In the multivariable models, VD deficiency was significantly associated with bilateral hearing impairment at the LPTA (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.12-1.89) and with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss at the LPTA (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.13-2.26) but such association was not observed at the HPTA (unilateral, P value = .274; bilateral, P value = .423). In conclusion, VD may have a significant role in the human auditory system, where its deficiency might affect both ears in particular the inner ears where the sensorineural hearing loss occurs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3across-sectional studies 3ahumans 3anutrition research 3apublic health 3aspeech 0aVitamin D 0aDeficiency 0aBilateral hearing impairment 0aSensorineural hearing loss 0aAging 0a25(OH)D 0aBMI 0aHPTA 0aLC-MS/MS 0aLPTA 0aNHANES 0aOR 0aPIR 0aSES 0aVD0 tNutrition research.g2022 Sept., v. 105 p.1-10dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl32600x0271-53177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2022.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002700180245009800207300001600305500001100321506007600332520115800408592002801566506003701594650001701631650000901648650003101657650001301688650001501701650001201716650001501728650001701743650002001760700001901780700002401799700001601823700002301839700002201862700002701884700002101911700002301932773011601955856007302071852000902144655001202153IND60593984520221207103102.0180508e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059398452DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.129332doi7 aPMC59472612pmcid7 a295422202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheppard, Catherine E.10aIntragroup competition predicts individual foraging specialisation in a group‐living mammal  ap. 665-673.  aLETTER  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIndividual foraging specialisation has important ecological implications, but its causes in group‐living species are unclear. One of the major consequences of group living is increased intragroup competition for resources. Foraging theory predicts that with increased competition, individuals should add new prey items to their diet, widening their foraging niche (‘optimal foraging hypothesis’). However, classic competition theory suggests the opposite: that increased competition leads to niche partitioning and greater individual foraging specialisation (‘niche partitioning hypothesis’). We tested these opposing predictions in wild, group‐living banded mongooses (Mungos mungo), using stable isotope analysis of banded mongoose whiskers to quantify individual and group foraging niche. Individual foraging niche size declined with increasing group size, despite all groups having a similar overall niche size. Our findings support the prediction that competition promotes niche partitioning within social groups and suggest that individual foraging specialisation may play an important role in the formation of stable social groupings.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMungos mungo 3adiet 3aecological differentiation 3aforaging 3agroup size 3amammals 3aprediction 3asocial class 3astable isotopes1 aInger, Richard1 aMcDonald, Robbie A.1 aBarker, Sam1 aJackson, Andrew L.1 aThompson, Faye J.1 aVitikainen, Emma I.

The selective adsorption of Pb²⁺ over Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ was investigated using citric acid modified sugarcane bagasse (SCA) in batch and column systems. Selective separation of Pb²⁺ from the mixed solution was achieved at a molar ratio 3.22 <Co,batchCa+Mg/Co,batchPb < 4.49 in batch mode while in a packed bed column, lead was selectively adsorbed by SCA up to a capacity of 0.767 mmol/g with a bed height of 7 cm, a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min and an initial lead concentration of 0.482 mmol/L. The dynamic study shows a close agreement between the experimental results and the Thomas and Yoon-Nelson models. The desorption study of equilibrium biosorbent SCA in a column system demonstrates that sodium chloride is a promising desorption reagent, with a desorption capacity of 80% Pb²⁺. In addition, synthetic lead wastewater with characteristics simulating the concentrate from desorption of saturated SCA was further treated in a fluidized bed denoted as pellet reactor. Lead (II) was quantitatively recovered at optimized conditions of pH 10, molar ratio [CO₃²⁻]: [Pb²⁺] = 3:1, superficial velocity 9.55 m/h, and initial lead concentration 2.43 mM. The well-controlled crystallization process of cerussite on the surface of grain sand in the pellet reactor is comparable with the chemical equilibrium speciation data obtained by Visual MINTEQ. Overall, the developed system comprising adsorption combined with a pellet reactor was found sufficient to remove and recover lead as PbCO₃ from wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaquatic environment 3abiosorbents 3acalcium 3acarbonates 3acerussite 3achemical equilibrium 3acitric acid 3acrystallization 3adesorption 3afluidized beds 3alead 3amagnesium 3amodels 3apH 3asodium chloride 3asugarcane bagasse 3awastewater 0aLead recovery 0aAdsorption 0aDesorption 0aPellet reactor 0aCrystallization 0aSugarcane bagasse1 aPham, Tien Duc1 aNguyen, Viet Tu1 aNguyễn, Khải,1 aPhạm, Thị Thùy,1 aBruggen, Bart van der,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Mar. 10, v. 213 p.1204-1216dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.12.2753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245006600166300001600232520112400248592002801372650001101400650002601411650001901437650001601456650002001472650002401492650001301516650001601529650004201545650001701587650003301604650001801637650001201655700001501667700001301682700001801695700001701713773008901730856008401819852000901903655001201912IND60572269820221122191944.0170713e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057226982DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-10-16-0379-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJooste, T.

With next-generation sequencing (NGS), it is possible to identify multiple viruses within a metagenomic sample. In this study, we explored the use of electronic probes (e-probes) for the simultaneous detection of 11 recognized citrus viruses. E-probes were designed and screened against raw sequencing data to minimize the bioinformatic processing time required. The e-probes were able to accurately detect their cognate viruses in simulated datasets, without any false negatives or positives. The efficiency of the e-probe-based approach was validated with NGS datasets generated from different RNA preparations: double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) from ‘Mexican’ lime infected with different Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) genotypes, dsRNA from field samples, and small RNA and total RNA from grapefruit infected with the CTV T3 genotype. A set of probes was made available that is able to accurately detect CTV in sequence data regardless of the input dataset or the genotype that plants are infected with.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aCitrus tristeza virus 3abioinformatics 3abiosecurity 3adata collection 3adouble-stranded RNA 3agenotype 3agrapefruits 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ametagenomics 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant viruses 3aviruses1 aVisser, M.1 aCook, G.1 aBurger, J.

Suramin is a polysulfonated napthylurea, which at noncytotoxic concentrations in vitro, increases tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy, including doxorubicin. The study authors evaluated the combination of noncytotoxic suramin and doxorubicin after amputation in dogs with OSA. The hypothesis was that treatment of dogs with appendicular OSA with amputation, adjuvant doxorubicin, and noncytotoxic suramin would be well tolerated and result in STs at least comparable to those of doxorubicin alone. Forty-seven dogs received 6.75 mg/kg of suramin IV followed by 30 mg/m2 of doxorubicin IV 4 hr later. Treatment was repeated q 2 wk for five doses. The median disease free time (DFI) was 203 days (range, 42–1,580+ days) and the median ST for all dogs was 369 days (range, 92–1,616+ days). There was no statistical difference in ST and DFI between greyhounds and nonngreyhounds. Adjuvant doxorubicin and noncytotoxic suramin was well tolerated in dogs with OSA following amputation. Additional studies are needed to determine if this combination treatment protocol provides additional clinical benefit compared with doxorubicin alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGreyhound 3aamputation 3acombination drug therapy 3adog diseases 3adogs 3adoxorubicin 3aintravenous injection 3aosteosarcoma 3asuramin1 aKisseberth, William1 aHosoya, Kenji1 aLara-Garcia, Ana1 aKosarek, Carrie1 aMurahari, Sridhar1 aAu, Jessie L-S.1 aWientjes, M.

For the treatment of alkylation waste sulfuric acid, the process convert waste sulfuric acid into dilute sulfuric acid and polymerized carbon materials through direct polymerization of acid soluble oil at below 473.15 K is proposed. Compared with the traditional pyrolysis process at 1373.15 K, the technology developed in this study can save more energy efficient with reduced carbon emissions. It was found that the removal rate of organic matter in waste acid was higher than 99.5 wt % at 453.15K. The dilute sulfuric acid obtained from the reaction can be used in the synthesis of sulphate. The polymeric carbon material has strong acidity. Further study indicates that the polymeric carbon material can be used as an efficient solid acid catalyst for the esterification of oleic acid and methanol to produce biodiesel. The results showed that conversion of oleic acid could reach 95.03 wt % under the optimized conditions, which remained higher than 91 wt % after reuse for 5 times. This work provides an alternative method to treat waste sulfuric acid and also a feasible and low cost route to obtain polymeric carbon material from the organic resources in the sulfuric acid as solid acid catalyst, which can reduce the manufacturing cost of biodiesel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aalkylation 3abiodiesel 3abutanes 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3aemissions 3aenergy efficiency 3aesterification 3afuel production 3amanufacturing 3amethanol 3aoils 3aoleic acid 3aorganic matter 3apollution 3apolymerization 3apyrolysis 3asulfates 3asulfuric acid 3awastes 0aWaste sulfuric acid 0aPolymeric carbon material 0aSolid acid catalysts 0aBiodiesel production1 aZhang, Xiangping1 aYang, Feifei1 aZhang, Suojiang0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 215 p.13-21dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.12.2793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245014400177300001600321520145800337592002801795650001301823650001701836650002301853650002001876650001901896650001501915650001901930650000901949650001601958650001401974650001401988650001902002650001802021650000702039650001902046650001502065650001402080650001702094650001902111653001702130653001402147653001902161653002002180653002202200700002102222700002002243700002302263700006202286700005902348773010502407856008702512852000902599655001202608IND60634817020221120150747.0190502e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063481702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.02.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalujkar, Sandeep A.10aUtilizing the iron tolerance potential of Bacillus species for biogenic synthesis of magnetite with visible light active catalytic activity  ap. 470-478.  aRecently, nanomaterial mediated degradation of water polluting industrial pollutant and dyes has become a topic of great interest. This study demonstrates enrichment, isolation, screening and molecular identification of iron tolerant Bacillus species for biosynthesis of iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (IOMNPs). Synthesis parameters such as 5 mM FeCl3, 7 days of static incubation at 37 °C and slightly alkaline pH range of 7–7.5 were the most optimum conditions. The spectroscopic and imaging studies demonstrated inverse spinel face-centered cubic structure of magnetite with average size of 81.3 nm, polydispersity of 0.343 and zeta potential of -42.49 mV. The specific saturation magnetization value and coercivity Hc of hysteresis loop of 28.1 emu/g and 5.8 Oe respectively confirmed the super-paramagnetic nature of IOMNPs. The comparison of phtotocatalytic activities under UV and visible light irradiation for degrdation of methyl violet, methylene blue, and rhodamine-B indicated that IOMNPs were visible light active photocatalysts. The study of effects of various reaction parameters indicated that catalyst loadings of 500–600 μg/mL, pH 7 and 20 μg/mL initial dye concetration were optimum conditions and reactions at these parameters were also observed to follow pseudo first order kinetics. This study successfully demonstrated the use of iron tolerant bacterium for visible light active, photocatalyst synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3aferric chloride 3agentian violet 3ahysteresis 3aimage analysis 3airon 3airradiation 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3amethylene blue 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aphotocatalysts 3apollutants 3ascreening 3aspectroscopy 3azeta potential 0aBiosynthesis 0aMagnetite 0aPhotocatalysis 0aDye degradation 0aChemical kinetics1 aJadhav, Suraj P.1 aPatil, Suhas S.1 aPatil, Sarjerao C.1 aSharma, Avinash S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1076-40421 aPawar, Kiran D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2519-24540 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 May 01, v. 177 p.470-478dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.02.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009800168300001600266520198700282592002802269650001502297650001202312650001402324650001902338650001102357650000902368650001202377650001502389650001302404650001002417651001502427653001702442653001102459653001602470653002202486700002102508700001802529700001402547773011302561856008602674852000902760655001202769IND60763234720221120021850.0220118e20211002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076323472DNAL7 a10.1080/00049158.2021.19732252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoran, J. C.10aEucalyptus bakeri: a potential source species for eucalyptus oil production in the subtropics  ap. 182-190.  aThere is a paucity of eucalypt species in tropical Australia that produce a foliar essential oil in high concentration and rich in 1,8-cineole, the sought-after component of medicinal eucalyptus oils. Eucalyptus bakeri, a mallee from the dry subtropical parts of northern New South Wales and Queensland, is an exception, with limited earlier studies reporting that this species produced foliar oil with commercial characteristics. The aim of this study was to determine the variation in foliar oil characteristics throughout the natural range of E. bakeri as a precursor to the more intensive field-testing of the species as a commercial source of eucalyptus oil. Mature leaves and, when available, coppice leaves for comparison were collected over three separate field trips in 2020 from individual trees representing each of 17 provenances throughout the natural range of E. bakeri in Queensland. Foliar oil concentrations on a fresh-weight basis throughout the provenances sampled were relatively high, averaging 2.3% for mature leaves and 2.8% for coppice leaves, with an individual tree high of 4.1% for both leaf categories. 1,8-Cineole was the dominant compound in all foliar oils sampled, averaging 89.3% (range 70.2–94.6%) in oils from mature leaves and 87.6% (range 79–92.5%) from coppice leaves. Sabinene levels, restricted to a maximum of 0.3% in some oil standards, averaged 0.3% (range trace – 1.5%) in oils from mature leaves and 0.4% (range trace – 0.7%) from coppice leaves. The high foliar oil concentrations and consistency in oil qualities mark this species as a potential candidate as a eucalyptus oil source species for the dry subtropics. Provenance/progeny trials are now needed to determine which provenances produce adequate growth rates and the silviculture required to manage the species as an oil-producing crop, as well as to investigate variations in oil characteristics, including sabinene levels, when all sources are grown at a common site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3acineole 3acoppicing 3aessential oils 3aleaves 3aoils 3aprogeny 3aprovenance 3asabinene 3atrees 3aQueensland 0a1, 8-cineole 0amallee 0aprovenances 0agenetic variation1 aMacdonell, P.

However, several diseases can affect farmed fish and it is imperative to find alternatives for chemotherapeutic treatments when disease outbreaks occur. Maintenance of health through nutrition is well-establish in modern animal farming, and amino acids (AA) are promising candidates as functional additives to improve fish health. Therefore, the goal of this research is to provide a better understanding of the influence of tryptophan supplementation on nutritional condition and immune mechanisms in fish. Triplicate groups of fish (13.3 ± 0.3g) previously fed with a fishmeal-based diet were either fed a control diet with an extreme formulation (0% fishmeal) but meeting the AA requirements (CTRL), or the SUP diet, formulated as the CTRL with an increase in tryptophan (TRP) content. After 2 and 13 weeks of feeding, head-kidney (HK), liver (L) and white skeletal muscle (WSM) were collected for gene expression, whereas plasma was suited for humoral immune parameters. A holistic approach using transcriptomic, humoral and zootechnical parameters was undertaken. The expression of 29–31 genes for WSM, L or HK confirms an effect due to the treatment across time. A two-way ANOVA analysis revealed that 15–24 genes varied significantly depending on the tissue, and the multivariate analysis by means of PLS-DA explained (R2) and predicted (Q2) with four components up to 93% and 78% of total variance, respectively. Component 1 (R2 = 50.06%) represented the time effects, whereas components 2 (24.36%) and 3 (13.89%) grouped fish on the basis of dietary treatment, at early sampling. The HK results in particular suggest that fish fed SUP diet displayed an immunostimulated state at 2 weeks. No major differences were observed in plasma humoral parameters, despite an increase in antiprotease and peroxidase activities after 13 weeks regardless of dietary treatment. These results suggest that tryptophan supplementation may improve the seabream immune status after 2 weeks. Hence, the use of functional feeds is especially relevant during a short-term feeding period before a predictable stressful event or disease outbreak, considering that these putative advantageous effects seem to disappear after a 13 weeks feeding period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSparus aurata 3aadditives 3aaquaculture 3adiet 3adisease outbreaks 3adrug therapy 3aenzyme activity 3afarmed fish 3afarming systems 3afeeds 3afish feeding 3afish health 3afish meal 3agene expression 3agenes 3aimmunology 3ajuveniles 3akidneys 3aliver 3amultivariate analysis 3anutritional intervention 3aperoxidase 3aseafoods 3askeletal muscle 3atranscriptomics 3atryptophan 3avariance 0aNutrition 0aGrowth 0aFunctional ingredients 0aAmino acids1 aMartos-Sitcha, Juan A.1 aReis, Bruno de Souza,1 aAzeredo, Rita1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2486-595X1 aFernandez-Boo, Sergio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2122-59731 aPérez-Sánchez, Jaume1 aCalduch-Giner, Josep Alvar1 aEngrola, Sofia1 aConceição, Luís E.C.,1 aDias, Jorge1 aSilva, Tomé S.1 aCostas, Benjamín1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3758-08490 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2019 Oct., v. 93 p.240-250dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2019.07.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245007600174300001600250520107300266592002801339650002301367650001301390650001501403650001701418650001701435650001401452650001401466650002401480650001701504650000901521650001701530650001301547650001701560653002301577653002501600653002401625653001401649653002201663700002001685700002401705700001901729700002301748700005901771700002901830700002001859700001601879700001901895700003201914700002501946700007401971773011002045856008302155852000902238655001202247IND60682301320221116163734.0200330e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068230132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2020.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArvanitakis, Marianna10aESPEN guideline on clinical nutrition in acute and chronic pancreatitis  ap. 612-631.  aBoth acute and chronic pancreatitis are frequent diseases of the pancreas, which, despite being of benign nature, are related to a significant risk of malnutrition and may require nutritional support. Acute necrotizing pancreatitis is encountered in 20% of patients with acute pancreatitis, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and may require artificial nutrition by enteral or parenteral route, as well as additional endoscopic, radiological or surgical interventions. Chronic pancreatitis represents a chronic inflammation of the pancreatic gland with development of fibrosis. Abdominal pain leading to decreased oral intake, as well as exocrine and endocrine failure are frequent complications of the disease. All of the above represent risk factors related to malnutrition. Therefore, patients with chronic pancreatitis should be considered at risk, screened and supplemented accordingly. Moreover, osteoporosis and increased facture risk should be acknowledged in patients with chronic pancreatitis, and preventive measures should be considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclinical nutrition 3afibrosis 3aguidelines 3ainflammation 3amalnutrition 3amorbidity 3amortality 3anutritional support 3aosteoporosis 3apain 3apancreatitis 3apatients 3arisk factors 0aAcute pancreatitis 0aChronic pancreatitis 0aPancreatic diseases 0aNutrition 0aMedical nutrition1 aOckenga, Johann1 aBezmarevic, Mihailo1 aGianotti, Luca1 aKrznarić, Željko1 aLobo, Dileep N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1187-57961 aLöser, C.q(Christian),1 aMadl, Christian1 aMeier, Remy1 aPhillips, Mary1 aRasmussen, Henrik Højgaard1 aVan Hooft, Jeanin E.1 aBischoff, S.

In the present study, the 5′ end of the partial VSG gene sequences (681bp) encoding N-terminal protein of RoTat 1.2 VSG (227 amino acid) was amplified, cloned into pET32a vector, and expressed in prokaryotic system. The fused His-tagged expressed VSG protein (43kDa) of the Trypanosoma evansi was characterized in SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using hyperimmune/immune sera raised against buffalo, dog, lion and leopard isolates of T. evansi. The expressed protein remained immunoreactive with all the sera combinations. The animals immunized with whole cell lysate or recombinant protein showed similar antibody reactions in ELISA and CATT (Card Agglutination Test for Trypanosomiasis). This study suggests the expressed recombinant truncated VSG is having its importance for its possible use in sero-diagnosis of surra.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanthera leo 3aPanthera pardus 3aTrypanosoma evansi 3aagglutination tests 3aamino acids 3aantibodies 3aantiserum 3abuffaloes 3adisease diagnosis 3adogs 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenetic vectors 3aglycoproteins 3aimmunoblotting 3anucleotide sequences 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3arecombinant proteins 3asurra 3avariant surface glycoproteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBuffaloes 2aCattle 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Protozoanxgenetics 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aEscherichia colixmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulationxphysiology 2aMembrane Glycoproteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtozoan Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRabbits 2aRats 2aTrypanosomaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTrypanosomiasisximmunologyxparasitologyxveterinary.1 aBalumahendiran, M.1 aBalamurugan, V.1 aRudramurthy, G.R.1 aPrabhudas, K.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2012 June 8, v. 187, no. 1-2 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.x0304-40177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2012.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03430naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245010400172300001600276520169400292592002801986650001502014650001702029650002902046650002802075650002602103650001302129650001202142650001702154650001202171650001702183650001302200650002102213650001102234650001802245650001902263650001302282650001502295653002902310653002502339653002702364653002502391700002002416700001702436700002002453700002202473700002302495700006202518700002502580700002302605700002302628773010502651856008702756852000902843655001202852IND60634817120221120150801.0190502e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063481712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.02.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJana, Tushar K.14aThe antibacterial and anticancer properties of zinc oxide coated iron oxide nanotextured composites  ap. 512-519.  aCore-shell α-Fe2O3–ZnO structures of different nanotextured morphology were synthesized through wet chemical routes using different solvents like ethanol, ethanolamine, water and acetaldehyde. Morphological tuning using different solvents resulted in the formation of different shapes, such as disc, spindle, rod and sphere (abbreviated as FZ-ND, FZ-NSP, FZ-NR and FZ-NS, respectively). Structural, morphological and compositional characterization of these nanoparticles (NPs) has been carried out. Antibacterial efficacy of the synthesized NPs was checked against Gram negative V. cholerae N16961 (VcN16961) and Gram positive S. aureus bacteria by recording optical density (OD) at different time points. Among the NPs tested, FZ-NSP was found to be the most effective against VcN16961, while FZ-NR showed maximum efficacy against S. aureus, implying the importance of nanotextured surface as well as the morphology in the manifestation of antibacterial activity. The kinetics of growth for both the bacteria has been modelled using logistic approach. Cytotoxicity was evaluated through MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay against human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7), human hepatocarcinoma cell line (HepG2) and against normal human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK-293). The lesser toxicity of α-Fe2O3–ZnO towards HEK-293 and the potent anticancer activity against MCF-7 and HepG2 cells underline its applicability as anticancer agent. With continued improvement of nanotechnology, this study may pave the way for designing and construction of various morphologically diverse, nanotextured materials with desired functional attributes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aacetaldehyde 3aantibacterial properties 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantineoplastic agents 3abacteria 3abreasts 3acytotoxicity 3aethanol 3aethanolamine 3ahepatoma 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3asolvents 3azinc oxide 0aα-Fe2O3–ZnO composite 0aNanotextured surface 0aAntibacterial activity 0aAnti-cancer property1 aJana, Swapan K.1 aKumar, Anoop1 aDe, Kalyanashis1 aMaiti, Ramaprasad1 aMandal, Amit Kumar1 aChatterjee, Tanaya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0615-93731 aChatterjee, Barun K.1 aChakrabarti, Pinak1 aChatterjee, Kuntal0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 May 01, v. 177 p.512-519dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.02.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003500132024001100167040001800178100002000196245014700216300001600363506017300379520100400552650002501556650002801581650002401609650001601633650001201649650001301661650001401674650001901688650003201707650003001739650001301769700001801782700001901800700002001819700002101839700001801860700001801878773009501896856011201991856004802103956026802151961000902419852000902428655001202437IND50068718120221214224717.0130812e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006871812DNAL7 a2526292aris7 a10113/572262hdl7 a10.1007/s12223-010-0046-12doi8 ans2605  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, R.

When co-cultured in anaerobic Bolton broth with the hyper-ammonia producing bacterium, Clostridium aminophilum, ammonia accumulation was greater and final growth of Campylobacter jejuni was reduced (CFU ≥ 1.4 log10/mL) compared to that obtained by pure culture controls. Co-culture with the less active ammonia-producing saccharolytic Prevotella albensis had no effect on final C. jejuni concentrations. When co-cultured similarly except with the addition of 10 μmol/L monensin, monensin-susceptible Cl. aminophilum was reduced by 2 to 4 log10 CFU/mL and concentrations of C. jejuni, which is insensitive to monensin, did not differ from its pure culture control. These results suggest that in the absence of added monensin, the hyper ammonia-producing Cl. aminophilum may be able to outcompete asaccharolytic C. jejuni for amino acid substrates and that this competitive ability was eliminated by addition on monensin. 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aClostridium aminophilum 3aPrevotella albensis 3aamino acids 3aammonia 3abacteria 3acoculture 3afood pathogens 3agas production (biological) 3ainterspecific competition 3amonensin1 aFlythe, M.

Static bomb combustion calorimetry and the Calvet microcalorimetry were the experimental techniques used to determine the standard (po=0.1MPa) molar enthalpies of formation, in the liquid phase, ΔfHmo(l), and of vaporization, ΔlgHmo, at T=298.15K, respectively, of the two liquid naphthalene derivatives. Those experimental values were used to derive the values of the experimental standard molar enthalpies of formation, in the gaseous phase, ΔfHmo(g), of 1-methoxynaphthalene, (−3.0±3.1)kJmol−1, and of 1-formylnaphthalene, (36.3±4.1)kJmol−1. High-level quantum chemical calculations at the composite G3(MP2)//B3LYP level were performed to estimate the values of the ΔfHmo(g) of the two compounds studied resulting in values in very good agreement with experimental ones. Natural bond orbital (NBO) calculations were also performed to determine more about the structure and reactivity of this class of compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalorimetry 3acombustion 3aenthalpy 3anaphthalene 3avolatilization 0a1-Naphthaledehyde 0a1-Methoxynaphthalene 0aIntramolecular hydrogen bonds 0aEnthalpy of formation 0aElectrostatic potential energy maps 0aFrontier orbitals1 aFreitas, Vera L.S.1 aRibeiro da Silva, Maria D.M.C.0 tChemosphere.g2014 July, v. 107 p.203-210dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.12.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245008300172300001400255520190500269592002802174650001902202650001902221650001502240650002302255650001302278650001502291650000902306650001002315650002302325650001702348650001802365650001602383650001402399650001302413653001502426653001002441653003702451653002402488653002602512700006202538700001702600700006502617773011002682856008202792852000902874655001202883IND60653813320221116155338.0190916e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065381332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2019.07.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGangele, Krishnakant10aUnraveling the evolutionary origin of ELR motif using fish CXC chemokine CXCL8  ap. 17-27.  aChemokines are chemotactic proteins involved in host defense through the migration of immune-regulatory cells to the site of infection. Interleukin-8 (CXCL8/IL8) is the most studied “ELR-CXC chemokine/neutrophil activating chemokine (NAC) that regulate neutrophil trafficking during infections and inflammation by binding to its cognate G-protein coupled receptors CXCR1/CXCR2. The “ELR” motif of NAC chemokines is essential for the CXCR1/CXCR2 receptor activation. In order to understand the evolutionary origin of “ELR” motif in the CXC chemokines, a thorough evolutionary study of CXCL8 gene from various fishes and primates was performed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the CXCL8 gene can be classified into four distinct lineages (CXCL8-L1a, CXCL8-L1b, CXCL8-L2, and CXCL8-L3), where CXCL8-L1a is the fastest evolving lineage and CXCL8-L3 is the slowest. Selection analysis suggested that The “ELR/DLR” motif containing branches (gadoid and coelacanth) are positively selected. The probable evolutionary trend of “ELR” motif suggested that this motif in ancestor CXCL8 is evolved from the GGR of Lamprey (Agnatha), followed by duplication giving rise to two main motifs in CXCL8 “NXH” in L3 lineage and “ELR/DLR” in L1a/L1b lineages. Although, structural analysis suggested that the overall topology of the CXCL8 proteins is similar, differences do exist at the individual structural elements among the members of different lineages. Functional distance analysis suggested that the CXCL8-L3 lineage is more distant compared to the CXCL8-L1a and L1b lineages from the inferred ancestor. Functional divergence analysis between different lineages suggested that most of the selected residues are important for receptor or glycosaminoglycan binding. Such a functional diversification can be attributed to the novel set of functions adopted by CXCL8 in various species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCXCR1 receptor 3aCXCR2 receptor 3aG-proteins 3aPetromyzontiformes 3aancestry 3achemotaxis 3afish 3agenes 3aglycosaminoglycans 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-8 3aneutrophils 3aphylogeny 3atopology 0aChemokines 0aCXCL8 0aNeutrophil activating chemokines 0aMolecular evolution 0aFunctional divergence1 aJamsandekar, Minal1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8678-93291 aMishra, Amit1 aPoluri, Krishna Mohan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3801-71340 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2019 Oct., v. 93 p.17-27dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2019.07.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245014300174300001600317520127300333592002801606650001201634650001301646650001201659650001301671650001201684650001001696650002301706650001001729650001101739650001101750651001401761773010801775856004801883852000901931655001201940IND50070615820221122070157.0131113e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007061582DNAL7 a10.1007/s13127-013-0134-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVossler, Favio Gerardo14aThe oligolecty status of a specialist bee of South American Prosopis (Fabaceae) supported by pollen analysis and floral visitation methods  ap. 513-519.  aDespite the nest pollen provisions in Western Argentina are composed only of Prosopis, the fact that the ground-nesting bee Eremapis parvula visits several floral hosts suggested that it is a generalist bee species. In the South American Dry Chaco forest, seven nest aggregations of E. parvula were found during three different spring periods. From 34 to 73 species of floral hosts were recorded around each nest aggregation. However, all nest pollen samples were composed of Prosopis pollen alone, as previously found in nests from Western Argentina. Thus, pollen analysis proved that E. parvula is a specialist bee of Prosopis. The “monolecty” and “narrow oligolecty” pollen specialization categories cannot be differentiated using pollen analysis alone. For this reason, a complementary floral visitation method was used. As several Prosopis species have been reported in floral records, the narrow oligolecty category for E. parvula is supported here. Considering that this exomalopsine is a multivoltine bee, and that flowers of some of the more than seven Prosopis species are always available during spring, synchronization between them in rainy periods is highly probable. Thus, it is unlikely that E. parvula has to forage on alternative pollen hosts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApoidea 3aProsopis 3aflowers 3aforaging 3aforests 3ahosts 3amultivoltine habit 3anests 3apollen 3aspring 3aArgentina0 tOrganisms, diversity, & evolution.g2013 Dec., v. 13, no. 4 p.513-519dSpringer-Verlagx1439-60927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13127-013-0134-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245013800164300001800302520145200320592002801772650001801800650002801818650002101846650001501867650001301882650001201895650002201907650001801929650002701947650001701974650001201991653001902003653001002022653002202032653002502054653001102079653001202090700001802102700005502120773013902175856007802314852000902392655001202401IND60594817620221118154219.0180524e20180221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059481762DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b159502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Geon-Hyoung10aImproved Ionic Diffusion through the Mesoporous Carbon Skin on Silicon Nanoparticles Embedded in Carbon for Ultrafast Lithium Storage  ap. 6235-6244.  aBecause of their combined effects of outstanding mechanical stability, high electrical conductivity, and high theoretical capacity, silicon (Si) nanoparticles embedded in carbon are a promising candidate as electrode material for practical utilization in Li-ion batteries (LIBs) to replace the conventional graphite. However, because of the poor ionic diffusion of electrode materials, the low-grade ultrafast cycling performance at high current densities remains a considerable challenge. In the present study, seeking to improve the ionic diffusion, we propose a novel design of mesoporous carbon skin on the Si nanoparticles embedded in carbon by hydrothermal reaction, poly(methyl methacrylate) coating process, and carbonization. The resultant electrode offers a high specific discharge capacity with excellent cycling stability (1140 mA h g–¹ at 100 mA g–¹ after 100 cycles), superb high-rate performance (969 mA h g–¹ at 2000 mA g–¹), and outstanding ultrafast cycling stability (532 mA h g–¹ at 2000 mA g–¹ after 500 cycles). The battery performances are surpassing the previously reported results for carbon and Si composite-based electrodes on LIBs. Therefore, this novel approach provides multiple benefits in terms of the effective accommodation of large volume expansions of the Si nanoparticles, a shorter Li-ion diffusion pathway, and stable electrochemical conditions from a faster ionic diffusion during cycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbonization 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agraphene 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3ananoparticles 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3aporous media 3asilicon 0aLi-ion battery 0aanode 0aultrafast cycling 0amesoporous structure 0acarbon 0asilicon1 aKim, Hyeonjin1 aAhn, Hyo-Jin1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5786-39370 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Feb. 21, v. 10, no. 7 p.6235-6244dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b159503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006300144245016400207300001800371520142000389592002801809650002301837650003701860650001601897650002101913650002101934650001701955650001001972650001901982650001802001650001402019650001002033650001302043650001402056650003302070650003702103653001402140653003202154653002002186653002102206653003402227700002002261700002002281700001802301700002102319700002102340700002002361700002202381700006002403773013902463856007802602852000902680655001202689IND60594817720180622000000.0180524e20180214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059481772DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b159732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIglesias, Daniel O.,1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1998-051810aGas-Phase Functionalization of Macroscopic Carbon Nanotube Fiber Assemblies: Reaction Control, Electrochemical Properties, and Use for Flexible Supercapacitors  ap. 5760-5770.  aThe assembly of aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into fibers (CNTFs) is a convenient approach to exploit and apply the unique physico–chemical properties of CNTs in many fields. CNT functionalization has been extensively used for its implementation into composites and devices. However, CNTF functionalization is still in its infancy because of the challenges associated with preservation of CNTF morphology. Here, we report a thorough study of the gas-phase functionalization of CNTF assemblies using ozone which was generated in situ from a UV source. In contrast with liquid-based oxidation methods, this gas-phase approach preserves CNTF morphology, while notably increasing its hydrophilicity. The functionalized material is thoroughly characterized by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Its newly acquired hydrophilicity enables CNTF electrochemical characterization in aqueous media, which was not possible for the pristine material. Through comparison of electrochemical measurements in aqueous electrolytes and ionic liquids, we decouple the effects of functionalization on pseudocapacitive reactions and quantum capacitance. The functionalized CNTF assembly is successfully used as an active material and a current collector in all-solid supercapacitor flexible devices with an ionic liquid-based polymer electrolyte.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acapacitance 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3agases 3ahydrophilicity 3aionic liquids 3aoxidation 3aozone 3apolymers 3apreserves 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aCNT fiber 0agas-phase functionalization 0aozone treatment 0aelectrochemistry 0aself-standing supercapacitors1 aSenokos, Evgeny1 aAlemán, Belén1 aCabana, Laura1 aNavío, Cristina1 aMarcilla, Rebeca1 aPrato, Maurizio1 aVilatela, Juan J.1 aMarchesan, Silvia1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6089-38730 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Feb. 14, v. 10, no. 6 p.5760-5770dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b159733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245013200178300001400310520135800324592002801682650002201710650001201732650001601744650001401760650001901774650001501793650001701808650001101825650001201836650001801848650001901866650002401885650003301909650001601942700002901958773008701987856008102074852000902155655001202164IND60575922320221121122301.0170728e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057592232DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-016-9778-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamli, Nur Aainaa Syahirah10aOptimization of Biomass Conversion to Levulinic Acid in Acidic Ionic Liquid and Upgrading of Levulinic Acid to Ethyl Levulinate  ap. 50-63.  aLevulinic acid (LA) is a versatile platform chemical that can be derived from biomass as an alternative to fossil fuel resources. Herein, the optimization of LA production from glucose and oil palm fronds (OPF) catalyzed by an acidic ionic liquid; 1-sulfonic acid-3-methyl imidazolium tetrachloroferrate ([SMIM][FeCl₄]) have been investigated. Response surface methodology based on Box-Behnken design was employed to optimize the LA yield and to examine the effect and interaction of reaction parameters on the LA production. The reaction parameters include reaction temperature, reaction time, feedstock loading, and catalyst loading. From the optimization study, the predicted mathematical models for LA production from glucose and OPF covered more than 90 % of the variability in the experimental data. At optimum conditions, 69.2 % of LA yield was obtained from glucose, while 24.8 % of LA yield was attained from OPF and registered 77.3 % of process efficiency. The recycled [SMIM][FeCl₄] gave sufficient performance for five successive cycles. Furthermore, the optimum LA produced from glucose and OPF can be directly converted to ethyl levulinate through esterification over the [SMIM][FeCl₄] catalyst. This study highlights the potential of [SMIM][FeCl₄] for biorefinery processing of renewable feedstocks at mild process conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3acatalysts 3aesterification 3afeedstocks 3afossil fuels 3afronds 3aglucose 3aionic liquids 3alevulinic acid 3amathematical models 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature1 aAmin, Nor Aishah Saidina0 tBioEnergy research.g2017 Mar., v. 10, no. 1 p.50-63dSpringer USx1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-016-9778-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005600149245011200205500001900317520175100336592002802087650001302115650001702128650001902145650002402164650003002188653003002218653002902248653001802277653001402295653000902309700005502318700005502373700002002428700005402448700001602502700001702518700001502535773011202550856008402662852000902746655001202755IND60720967620221122171843.0210226e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072096762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e014062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Maofang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0929-127314aThe use of Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)-mediated data in publications written in Chinese  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWith the development of biodiversity informatics, more and more data repositories have emerged, providing massive stores of open scientific data. The use of open data is increasingly valuable for scientific research and related decision making but little is known about which topics are addressed, especially in non-English publications. Further, how this data should be cited has been called into question. The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is the world’s largest and most widely-used open data access platform on the occurrence of species in nature. Here, we analyze the use of GBIF-mediated data in Chinese language publications. From 623 publications containing the word “GBIF”, we obtained 324 peer-reviewed publications. Among these publications, there were 237 journal papers, 17 doctoral theses, 66 master theses, and 4 conference papers. The publications came from 114 journals and 49 research institutes and universities. We found that the most common topics addressed by these publications were species distribution, climate change, biological invasion and medicinal plants. For data citation, multiple forms coexist. 295 publications (90% of publications) only cited the name of “GBIF” in the main text, without a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Among the 29 publications that cited GBIF in the references, 17 cited the GBIF website, 8 publications listed the URL of a species page in GBIF, and only 4 publications cited a DOI, which is what GBIF recommends. Based on a discussion on the use of GBIF-mediated data and the resulting data citation issues, this study makes three suggestions to improve data citation practice, which are applicable to data citation practice in other non-English publications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3aecological invasion 3ageographical distribution 0aBiodiversity conservation 0aBiodiversity informatics 0aData citation 0aFAIR data 0aGBIF1 aXu, Zheping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5858-23471 aHirsch, Tim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5015-58071 aAung, Thant Sin1 aXu, Wubing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6566-44521 aJi, Liqiang1 aQin, Haining1 aMa, Keping0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2021 Jan., v. 25 p.e01406-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e014063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02221naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245014400163300001600307520101800323592002801341650001401369650001601383650001001399650002201409650001001431650001201441650001301453650001001466650001201476650002301488650001401511650001201525651001901537700002301556700002001579700002001599773010101619856008201720852000901802655001201811IND4485180820221119190424.0161105e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448518082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10152-010-0220-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreire, A.

MATURE software was used to estimate morphological maturity, while gonadal analyses were conducted to estimate physiological maturity. The puberty moult took place at larger size in males (51.4Â mm of carapace length) than in females (33.8Â mm), while physiological maturity occurred at a similar size in males (38.4Â mm) and in females (33.4Â mm). Above 50Â mm, the proportion of red males increased in the population, indicating that functional maturity is also related to colour pattern. Small habitat and high local population density contributed to the high rate of cannibalism. The low diversity of food items, absence of predators of large crabs and high geographic isolation are the determinants of unique behavioural and biological characteristics observed in the G. grapsus population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGrapsidae 3acannibalism 3acolor 3acomputer software 3acrabs 3afemales 3ahabitats 3amales 3amolting 3apopulation density 3apredators 3apuberty 3aAtlantic Ocean1 aPinheiro, M.

Interestingly, by subjecting a drop of LCP solution to dry in a restricted geometry comprising two nearly parallel plates with a stationary upper plate and a movable lower plate that programmably traveled in a “stop-and-move” manner during the FESA process, photoswitchable LCP stripes were yielded, displaying two modes of deposition, namely, periodic primary stripes of large dimensions and regularly spaced secondary stripes of small dimensions situated between adjacent primary stripes (i.e., forming hierarchical LCP stripes). Notably, these hierarchical azobenzene moieties-containing stripes demonstrated sequential photoinduced reversible phase transition (i.e., photoswitching) due to the thickness difference between primary and secondary stripes. A UV light-induced expansion effect was observed on the LCP stripes. Clearly, such rapid creation of hierarchical stripes by FESA represents a robust means of organizing polymers, nanoparticles, colloids, DNA, etc. into complex yet ordered patterns over a large area in a simple and controllable manner for potential use in surface relief grating, photoactuators, photoswitchable devices, antifake labels, etc.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acolloids 3ageometry 3aliquid crystals 3amoieties 3ananoparticles 3aphase transition 3apolymers 0aflow-enabled self-assembly 0ahierarchical structure 0aazo-containing liquid crystalline polymer 0aphotoinduced phase transition 0aphotoexpansion effect1 aLi, Bo1 aHe, Ming1 aWang, Wei1 aWang, Tianjie1 aWang, Aurelia1 aYu, Jiwoo1 aWang, Zhonglin1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5530-03801 aHong, Suck Won1 aByun, Myunghwan1 aLiem, Sioe Liong,1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3374-99341 aYu, Haifeng1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0398-50551 aLin, Zhiqun1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3158-93400 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Feb. 07, v. 10, no. 5 p.4961-4970dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b160013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02058naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009000157300001600247520108200263592002801345650001501373650002301388650001401411650001101425650001801436650001601454700002001470700001701490700001601507700002001523773009401543856007401637852000901711655001201720IND60468485720221119161008.0151209e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046848572DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.278992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKu, Kang Hee10aTailoring block copolymer and polymer blend morphology using nanoparticle surfactants  ap. 228-237.  aCombining the functionality of nanoparticles (NPs) with the processability of polymers offers great promise for designing novel materials. In particular, NPs with tailored surface properties can effectively modify the interface between two distinct fluids and/or different polymer matrices which allows them to function as efficient surfactants. The efficiency of NP surfactants is strongly affected by their size and shape, which influences their adsorption energy to the interface, and the entropic contribution to the system. In this review, the assembly of size‐ and shape‐controlled inorganic NPs at the interface of block copolymers (BCPs) and polymer blends has been focused. First, we discuss the design of size‐ and shape‐controlled NP surfactants and we review the examples of NP surfactant‐driven BCPs and polymer blend morphologies. In addition, we review the recent investigations of the morphological transition of BCP emulsion particles induced by NP surfactants. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym.

In this work, a process simulation model is developed to model the reduction in ash content of loblolly logging residues using a combination of air classification and dilute-acid leaching. Various scenarios are considered, and it is found that costs associated with discarding high-ash material from air classification are substantial. The costs of material loss can be reduced by chemical leaching the high-ash fraction obtained from air classification. The optimal leaching condition is found to be approximately 0.1 wt% sulfuric acid at 24 °C. In example scenarios, total process costs in the range of $6–9﻿/dry tons of product are projected that result in a removal of 14, 62, 39, and 88 % of organics, total ash (inorganics), alkaline earth metals and phosphorus (AAEMS + P), and silicon, respectively. Sensitivity analyses indicate that costs associated with loss of organic material during processing (yield losses), brine disposal, and labor have the greatest potential to impact the total processing cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalkaline earth metals 3aash content 3abiomass 3acost analysis 3aenergy conversion 3afeedstocks 3alabor 3aleaching 3alogging 3aphosphorus 3asilicon 3asimulation models 3asulfuric acid 3awood chips1 aWestover, Tyler L.1 aCherry, Rob,1 aAston, John E.1 aLacey, Jeffrey A.1 aThompson, David N.0 tBioEnergy research.g2017 Mar., v. 10, no. 1 p.237-247dSpringer USx1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-016-9794-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009700156300002000253520122100273592002801494650001501522650001201537650002301549650001701572650002101589650002201610650002201632650001901654650001301673650002401686650001101710700001601721700001901737773014401756856007501900852000901975655001201984IND60778325420221118204223.0220525e20220524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077832542DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ta02294j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Yihan12aA nitridation route to construct high-activity interfaces toward alkaline hydrogen evolution  ap. 11205-11212.  aThe high cost and sluggish H₂O dissociation kinetics of Pt-based electrocatalysts urge the development of cost-effective and high-activity catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) via electronic structure engineering derived via interfacial doping. Herein, we report a nitridation route to prepare a hierarchical structured Ru/TiOₓNy nanobelt electrocatalyst through the thermal treatment of Ru/H₂Ti₂O₅ in ammonia. As-synthesized Ru/TiOₓNy shows high HER activity with a low overpotential of 16 mV at 10 mA cm⁻², a small Tafel slope of 42 mV dec⁻¹, and a high mass activity of 4.2 A mg⁻¹ at 100 mV in alkaline solution, superior to most previously reported noble-metal electrocatalysts. The characterization results imply that nitridation could modify the chemical environment and electronic structure at the interfaces of Ru/TiOₓNy, which would not only decrease the adsorption energy of hydrogen intermediates via reducing the content of oxygen vacancies, but would also improve electron transfer through Ru–N bonds. This work provides a meaningful strategy for the design and synthesis of cost-effective and high-activity electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy conversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aammonia 3acost effectiveness 3adissociation 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy conversion 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aoxygen1 aWang, Xunlu1 aWang, Jiacheng0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 May 24, v. 10, no. 20 p.11205-11212dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ta02294j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245011500157300001800272500002000290520157600310592002801886650002201914650001901936650001501955650001401970650001101984650001901995650002202014650001802036650001602054651001002070700002002080700001702100700001702117700001902134700001802153773013202171856007202303852000902375655001202384IND60587750520221120115228.0180102e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058775052DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.27022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qingwen10aControllability of Phosphorus Losses in Surface Runoff from Sloping Farmland Treated by Agricultural Practices  ap. 1704-1716.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPhosphorus (P) loss from arable sloping land due to water erosion causes off‐site environment pollution in the Three Gorges area in China. This study aims to estimate the effects of agricultural practices on the reduction of P losses during water erosion processes under natural precipitation conditions: contour culturing with organic matter addition (CT + OM), contour culturing with wheat straw mulching (CT + SM), contour culturing with straw mulching and organic matter addition (CT + OM + SM) and conventional downslope culturing framework as a control (CK). Results demonstrated that CT + OM + SM could viably diminish runoff, sediment yields and P losses from arable sloping land. Compared with CK, CT + OM, CT + SM and CT + OM + SM lessened the surface runoff depths by 19%, 34% and 50%, respectively. A high curve number value induced a notable runoff potential from the plot. The surface‐runoff‐related total P (TP) loads for CK with yearly measures of 1·56 kg ha⁻¹ were significantly higher than those for CT + OM, CT + SM and CT + OM + SM at 1·07, 0·77 and 0·51 kg ha⁻¹ (p < 0·05), respectively. With all things considered, the particulate P losses represented a significant division of TP losses, adding up to almost 80% in 2014 and 79% in 2015. The outcomes demonstrated that surface protection and organic matter addition are two of the greatest agricultural protection practices that lessen P losses in the surface runoff from sloping farmland by water erosion.

Analyses of soils from under Deschampsia antarctica sampled from three islands along a 2200 km climatic gradient indicated that those from sub-Antarctica had higher moisture, organic matter and carbon (C) concentrations, more depleted δ¹³C values, lower concentrations of the fungal biomarker ergosterol and higher concentrations of bacterial PLFA biomarkers and plant wax n-alkane biomarkers than those from maritime Antarctica. Shallow soils (2 cm depth) were wetter, and had higher concentrations of organic matter, ergosterol and bacterial PLFAs, than deeper soils (4 cm and 8 cm depths). Correlative analyses indicated that factors associated with climate change (increased soil moisture, C and organic matter concentrations, and depleted δ¹³C contents) are likely to give rise to increases in Gram negative bacteria, and decreases in Gram positive bacteria and fungi, in maritime Antarctic soils. Bomb-¹⁴C analyses indicated that sub-Antarctic soils at all depths contained significant amounts of modern ¹⁴C (C fixed from the atmosphere post c. 1955), whereas modern ¹⁴C was restricted to depths of 2 cm and 4 cm in maritime Antarctica. The oldest C (c. 1745 years BP) was present in the southernmost soil. The higher nitrogen (N) concentrations and δ¹⁵N values recorded in the southernmost soil were attributed to N inputs from bird guano. Based on these analyses, we conclude that 5–8 °C rises in air temperature, together with associated increases in precipitation, are likely to have substantial impacts on maritime Antarctic soils, but that, at the rates of climate warming predicted under moderate greenhouse gas emission scenarios, these impacts are likely to take at least a century to manifest themselves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDeschampsia antarctica 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aair temperature 3aalkanes 3aanimal manures 3abiomarkers 3abirds 3acarbon 14 3aergosterol 3afungi 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aislands 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aprediction 3aradiocarbon dating 3asoil water 3astable isotopes 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica 0aBiomarkers 0a13C 0a14C 0aClimate change 0a15N 0aSub- and maritime Antarctica1 aNewsham, K.K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9108-09361 aCox, F.1 aGarnett, M.H.1 aRobinson, C.H.1 aDungait, J.A.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9074-41740 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2020 Feb., v. 141 p.107682-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.1076823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03993naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012500171300001800296520209200314536033302406592002802739596001702767596001902784650002602803650002602829650001102855650001302866650002502879650001502904650002802919650001202947650002902959650001302988650001503001650001703016653005503033653002303088653002203111653002103133700001503154700001303169700001703182700001403199700001303213700001603226773013803242856008603380852000903466655001203475IND60778325520221118204229.0220525e20220403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077832552DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2021.20198472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Juanjuan10aCombining spectral and texture features of UAV hyperspectral images for leaf nitrogen content monitoring in winter wheat  ap. 2335-2356.  aThe unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image spectral information and texture feature (TF) information were fused to develop an improved model for winter wheat leaf nitrogen content (LNC) monitoring model to provide a reference for wheat nitrogen status monitoring and accurate management. The data of wheat LNC and UAV-hyperspectral imaging were simultaneously obtained at the main growth stages (jointing, booting, and filling stages) of various winter wheat varieties under various nitrogen fertilizer treatments. The correlation between the vegetation indexes (VIs) in combination of any two bands, the TFs, and LNC were systematically analyzed. Then, the optimal VIs and TFs without multicollinearity problems were screened using a variance inflation factor (VIF) to form a ‘graph–spectrum’ fusion index. Four machine learning methods, namely ridge regression (RR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector machine regression (SVR), and random forest (RF), were used to construct respective quantitative winter wheat LNC estimation models. The results revealed that the model for estimating LNC constructed using the ‘graph–spectrum’ information formed by eight parameters, including the normalized vegetation index NDVI (R ₅₇₈, R ₄₉₀), the difference vegetation index DVI (R ₈₃₀, R ₇₇₈), MEA₄₉₀, MEA₇₇₈, VAR₄₉₀, VAR₅₇₈, VAR₇₇₈, and HOM₅₇₈ as input and the RR algorithm, performed the best. It outperformed the models developed by the implementation of VIs and TFs as input. The coefficient of determination (R ²), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative percent deviation (RPD) of the calibration set were 0.84, 0.25, and 2.50, correspondingly, and those of the validation set were 0.87, 0.27, and 2.33, respectively. The model of winter wheat LNC constructed by fusing spectral and TF information considerably improved the prediction accuracy. The present research results provide a basis and reference for the application of UAV hyperspectral technology in wheat nitrogen nutrient monitoring.  aThis work was supported by grants from the Key Scientific and Technological Projects of Henan Province (192102110012), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0300609), and Henan Modern Agriculture (Wheat) Research System (S2010-01-G04); Henan Modern Agriculture (Wheat) Research System [S2010-01-G04]  aPublisher supplied data  a192102110012  a2016YFD0300609 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aleaf nitrogen content 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aprediction 3asupport vector machines 3atexture 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3avariance 3avegetation 3awinter wheat 0aUnmanned aerial vehicle hyperspectral imaging data 0aVegetation indexes 0aTextural features 0aMachine learning1 aCheng, Tao1 aShi, Lei1 aWang, Weiwei1 aNiu, Zhen1 aGuo, Wei1 aMa, Xinming0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2022 Apr. 03, v. 43, no. 7 p.2335-2356dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2021.20198473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013600169520128000305592002801585650003201613650001501645650001901660650001001679650001701689650001601706650002601722650002201748650002001770650001401790653004801804653002201852653002901874653002001903653000801923653001001931653001001941653000801951653000901959653000701968653000801975653001001983653000701993653001102000653000802011653001502019653000902034653000902043653001202052653001902064653001402083653000702097653000802104653000802112653000702120653000702127653001502134653001502149653001202164653000802176653000702184653000702191700001802198700001302216700001202229700001402241700001602255700001602271700001702287773009202304856008602396852000902482655001202491IND60676576420221123034135.0200210e20200301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067657642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2019.1205392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Yuanyuan10aMulti targeted cell membrane chromatography: A comprehensive method for screening the anaphylactoid components from complex samples  aAnaphylactoid reactions induced by drugs are serious and can be life-threatening, and screening the anaphylactoid ingredients especially in complex samples is challenging. Here, a multi targeted cell membrane chromatography method, based on the Mas-related G protein coupled receptor X2, Fc epsilon RI and H₁ receptors, online coupled with LC-MS system provides a comprehensive solution for screening the anaphylactoid components from complex samples. The validation including selectivity and suitability of this system has been evaluated, and it shows promising results. With optimized conditions, this method has been utilized to screen the anaphylactoid ingredients from Shenmai Injection. Ginsenoside Rb₁, ginsenoside Rb₂, ginsenoside Rc, ginsenoside Rd and 20(S)-ginsenoside Rg3 were identified as anaphylactoid components. The anaphylactoid effects of these five components were further verified by the in vitro sensitization assay, showing promising effects on some or all sensitization cells. In conclusion, the multi targeted cell membrane chromatography online coupled with LC-MS system developed throughout this study could be used to fully screen anaphylactoid components in complex samples. Moreover, it also provides new insights for drug quality control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aG-proteins 3acell membranes 3adrugs 3aginsenosides 3aingredients 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aquality control 3ascreening 0aMulti targeted cell membrane chromatography 0aShenmai injection 0aAnaphylactoid components 0aComplex samples 0aACN 0aANOVA 0aCCK-8 0aCMC 0aCMSP 0aCF 0aCIB 0ad4-HA 0aDH 0aFcεRI 0aH1R 0aH1R-HEK293 0aLAD2 0aMeOH 0aMRGPRX2 0aMRGPRX2-HEK293 0aNC-HEK293 0aQT 0aRb1 0aRb2 0aRc 0aRd 0a20-(S) Rg3 0a20-(R) Rg3 0aRBL-2H3 0aSMI 0aTE 0aTM1 aJia, Qianqian1 aSun, Wei1 aFu, Jia1 aLv, Yanni1 aHou, Yajing1 aWang, Cheng1 aHan, Shengli0 tTalanta.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 209 p.120539-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.1205393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009400168300001600262520131800278592002801596650001901624650001601643650001701659650002901676650002501705650001901730650001501749653001901764653001101783653001501794653001401809653001601823700002401839773011401863856005101977852000902028655001202037IND50075257520221118041303.0140410e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007525752DNAL7 a10.1080/1523908X.2011.5784032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtkinson, Rob10aUnderstanding sustainability policy: governance, knowledge and the search for integration  ap. 231-251.  aThe EU, through the Cardiff and the Gothenburg strategies, sought to counter what was seen as fragmented and uncoordinated environmental policy development by promoting a broad and integrated approach to sustainability. This article seeks to assess two recently implemented EU directives on environmental issues in light of this aim, namely the directives on Air Quality Management and Strategic Environmental Assessment. Drawing on theoretical foundations and empirical evidence from the EU FP6 project ‘Governance for Sustainability’, this article seeks to understand how policy integration is a matter of knowledge use, which is again related to the governance arrangements in which implementation takes place. Drawing on a total of 15 case studies in nine countries, the article finds that actual decision-making practice varies a lot albeit based on the same directives. In many cases, the directives were viewed as a sectoral ‘environmental tools’, and these cases were often dominated by expert knowledge being funnelled through relatively closed, hierarchical governance arrangements. In other cases, however, the directives were viewed as opportunities for politicians to cultivate a network mode of governance that ‘aspired’ to arguing and sometimes opened up for competing knowledge claims.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aair quality 3acase studies 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental policy 3aexpert opinion 3agovernance 0aSustainability 0apolicy 0agovernance 0aknowledge 0aintegration1 aKlausen, Jan Erling0 tJournal of environmental policy & planning.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 13, no. 3 p.231-251dRoutledgex1522-72007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1523908X.2011.578403  aDNAL 7aarticle03392naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006200152245021000214520171000424592002802134650001102162650000902173650002002182650001802202650002002220650002402240650001402264650001602278650001002294650001002304650001202314650003302326650001302359650001502372650001402387650001202401650001802413650001302431653001602444653001602460653003102476653001502507653000902522653001602531700002002547700001702567700002102584700002202605700001902627773009602646856008702742852000902829655001202838IND60750624720221118011910.0220205e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075062472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1085582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRehagel, Christina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1816-439110aDevelopment and application of a competitive enzyme immunoassay for the detection of penitrem A in fungal mycelium: Evidence for frequent occurrence of multiple indole-containing mycotoxins in mouldy foods  aThe present study aimed to develop a novel enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the tremorgenic mycotoxin, penitrem A (PTA). This competitive EIA, based on rabbit anti-PTA polyclonal antibodies and a PTA-bovine serum albumin conjugate, yielded a mean standard curve detection limit of 220 ng/mL. The PTA-EIA, together with two EIAs for paxilline (PAX) and ergoline alkaloids, were used to study the toxin profiles in culture of fungi isolated from some naturally infected food sample materials, including dairy products, citrus fruits, and walnuts. PTA was produced by eight out of 27 mycelium extracts from malt extract agar and Sabouraud glucose chloramphenicol selective agar (2–200 μg/mL). Ten isolates from all types of food were also positive in the PAX-EIA (0.004–4 μg/mL). The EIA for ergoline alkaloids yielded positive results (0.0002–0.4 μg/mL) in isolates from dairy products and from walnuts, but not from citrus fruits. Control analyses of selected fungal extracts by HPLC-MS/MS for PTA and PAX qualitatively confirmed the EIA results, poor quantitative agreement could be attributed to the presence of penitrems other than PTA, and to PAX analogues, respectively. Selected PTA-positive fungal isolates were subjected to sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region and the β-tubulin gene, and were identified as Penicillium polonicum and P. crustosum. In conclusion, Penicillium spp. capable to produce PTA, PAX, and ergoline alkaloids, either alone or in combination, appear to be quite common as contaminants on foods at the retail or production level. Some are capable to produce PTA in culture at high levels, which would have to be considered as toxic if present in food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aagar 3achloramphenicol 3aculture media 3adetection limit 3aenzyme immunoassays 3aergolines 3afood safety 3afungi 3agenes 3aglucose 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amycelium 3amycotoxins 3apaxilline 3arabbits 3aserum albumin 3atoxicity 0aPenicillium 0aTremorgenic 0aIndole-diterpene alkaloids 0aPenitrem A 0aFood 0aImmunoassay1 aAkineden, Ömer1 aGeisen, Rolf1 aCramer, Benedikt1 aPlötz, Madeleine1 aUsleber, Ewald0 tFood control.g2022 Feb., v. 132 p.108558-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1085583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011900161300001800280520128100298592002801579650002101607650002701628650002701655650002601682650002901708650001301737650001301750650001401763650001001777650001601787650001101803650001501814650001901829650001101848650002701859700002801886700001701914700001701931700002101948700002001969700002101989700002802010700001802038700002302056773009802079856007502177852000902252655001202261IND60576551220171214000000.0170804e20120529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057655122DNAL7 a10.1021/la30038382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaglietti, Angelo10aAntibacterial Activity of Glutathione-Coated Silver Nanoparticles against Gram Positive and Gram Negative Bacteria  ap. 8140-8148.  aIn the present paper, we study the mechanism of antibacterial activity of glutathione (GSH) coated silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) on model Gram negative and Gram positive bacterial strains. Interference in bacterial cell replication is observed for both cellular strains when exposed to GSH stabilized colloidal silver in solution, and microbicidal activity was studied when GSH coated Ag NPs are (i) dispersed in colloidal suspensions or (ii) grafted on thiol-functionalized glass surfaces. The obtained results confirm that the effect of dispersed GSH capped Ag NPs (GSH Ag NPs) on Escherichia coli is more intense because it can be associated with the penetration of the colloid into the cytoplasm, with the subsequent local interaction of silver with cell components causing damages to the cells. Conversely, for Staphylococcus aureus, since the thick peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall prevents the penetration of the NPs inside the cytoplasm, the antimicrobial effect is limited and seems related to the interaction with the bacterial surfaces. Experiments on GSH Ag NPs grafted on glass allowed us to elucidate more precisely the antibacterial mechanism, showing that the action is reduced because of GSH coating and the limitation of the translational freedom of NPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3acoatings 3acolloids 3acytoplasm 3aglass 3aglutathione 3amodels 3ananosilver 3apeptidoglycans 3asilver 3atranslation (genetics)1 aDiaz Fernandez, Yuri A.1 aAmato, Elvio1 aCucca, Lucia1 aDacarro, Giacomo1 aGrisoli, Pietro1 aNecchi, Vittorio1 aPallavicini, Piersandro1 aPasotti, Luca1 aPatrini, Maddalena0 tLangmuir.g2012 May 29, v. 28, no. 21 p.8140-8148dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla30038383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245011100160300001600271500001900287500002000306520159800326592002801924596004201952650001501994650002202009650000902031650001502040650002202055650001702077650001702094650001602111650001202127650001702139650001602156650001402172700002002186700002402206773012202230856007302352852000902425655001202434IND60731649520221119181601.0210321e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073164952DNAL7 a10.1111/een.129632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArriens, June V.10aPhenology of feeding preference in post‐diapause Baltimore checkerspot (Euphydryas phaeton) caterpillars  ap. 310-318.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a1. Host plant use has important life history impacts for caterpillars, and this can change throughout development. Although food quality is important for all caterpillar instars, previous work has found a decreased diet preference in late instars, possibly owing to greater intake requirements. 2. Baltimore checkerspot butterflies are highly specialised in their diet as pre‐diapause caterpillars but are less specialised post‐diapause. This study investigated phenological changes in Baltimore checkerspot caterpillar preference and performance on different post‐diapause host plants in the field and lab. 3. Caterpillar preference and performance in the lab on four post‐diapause host plants followed the same rank order. The highest ranked plant was their main host plant, followed by an alternative host used for oviposition in some populations, then a commonly observed post‐diapause‐only host, and finally a previously unrecorded post‐diapause host plant. 4. In contrast to lab results, field observations showed a decrease throughout the season in the use of the main host plant, turtlehead. 5. This study's findings suggest that necessity and food availability drive the post‐diapause Baltimore checkerspot caterpillar diet in the field more than preference. These results also highlight that, even in relatively well‐studied species, field and laboratory observations can yield conflicting results. In this case, the contrast is most likely due to the different constraints in lab versus field conditions, such as the costs of finding preferred plants in the field.  aPublisher supplied data  aRC‐2700cU.S. Department of Defense 3aEuphydryas 3aalternative hosts 3adiet 3aentomology 3afood availability 3afood choices 3afood quality 3ahost plants 3ainstars 3alife history 3aoviposition 3aphenology1 aBrown, Leone M.1 aCrone, Elizabeth E.0 tEcological entomology.g2021 Apr., v. 46, no. 2 p.310-318dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl7132x0307-69467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/een.129633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001300138245009600151300001800247500002000265520159300285592002801878650002401906650001701930650001301947650001601960650001401976650001601990650001802006650001102024650001202035650001502047650001702062650002202079650001702101650001802118650001202136651001002148700001602158700001602174700001702190700001502207700001402222700001202236700001502248773013202263856007202395852000902467655001202476IND60587750920221120101220.0180102e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058775092DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.26582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yi10aModelling Soil Detachment of Different Management Practices in the Red Soil Region of China  ap. 1496-1505.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSoil erosion from cropland is a primary cause of soil degradation in the hilly red soil region of China. Soil characteristics and the resistance of soil to erosion agents can be improved with appropriate management practices. In this study, hydraulic flume experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of five management practices [manure fertilizer (PM), straw mulch cover (PC), peanut–orange intercropping (PO), peanut–radish rotation (PR) and traditional farrow peanut (PF)] on soil detachment. Based on the results, three conservation management practices (PC, PM and PO) increased the resistance of soil to concentrated flow erosion. The rill erodibility of different treatments was ranked as follows: PC (0·001 s m⁻¹) < PM (0·004 s m⁻¹) < PO (0·007 s m⁻¹) < PF (0·01 s m⁻¹) < PR (0·027 s m⁻¹). The rill erodibility was affected by soil organic content, aggregate stability and bulk density. The soil detachment rate was closely correlated with the flow discharge and slope gradient, and power functions for these two factors were developed to evaluate soil detachment rates. Additionally, the shear stress, stream power and unit stream power were compared when estimating the soil detachment rate. The power functions of stream power and shear stress were equivalent, and both are recommended to predict detachment rates. Local soil conservation can benefit from the results of this study with improved predictions of erosion on croplands in the red soil region of China.

The assessment examines three facility designs, all producing corn ethanol and wet distiller’s grains and solubles as a co-product: a baseline facility with no cellulosic retrofit, a facility retrofitted with a small capacity for stover feedstock, and a facility retrofitted for a large capacity of stover feedstock. Corn grain is supplied by rail from the Midwest, while stover is sourced from in-state farms and delivered by truck. Two stover feedstock supply scenarios are considered, testing harvest rates at 25 or 40 % of stover mass. Allocation is required to separate impacts attributable to co-products. Additional scenarios are explored to assess the effect of co-product allocation methods on life cycle assessment results for the two fuel products, corn ethanol and stover ethanol. The assessment tracks greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy consumption, criteria air pollutants, and direct water consumption. The GHG intensity of corn ethanol produced from the three facility designs range between 61.3 and 68.9 g CO₂e/MJ, which includes 19.8 g CO₂e/MJ from indirect land use change for Midwestern corn grain. The GHG intensity of cellulosic ethanol varies from 44.1 to 109.2 g CO₂e/MJ, and 14.6 to 32.1 g CO₂e/MJ in the low and high stover capacity cases, respectively. Total energy input ranges between 0.60 and 0.71 MJ/MJ for corn ethanol and 0.13 to 2.29 MJ/MJ for stover ethanol. This variability is the result of the stover supply scenarios (a function of harvest rate) and co-product allocation decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3abioethanol 3aco-product allocation 3acoproducts 3acorn 3acorn stover 3aenergy 3aethanol 3afarms 3afeedstocks 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aland use change 3aCalifornia1 aKendall, Alissa0 tBioEnergy research.g2017 Mar., v. 10, no. 1 p.183-198dSpringer USx1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-016-9776-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006600144245006400210300001800274520167300292592002801965650003701993650001102030650001802041650001502059650001502074650001902089650002202108650001402130650001102144650001502155650001602170650001702186650001602203650002102219653001502240653002102255653001902276653003002295700001602325700005802341700006202399773013902461856007802600852000902678655001202687IND60594818420180622000000.0180524e20180221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059481842DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b160692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonteiro, Mariana C.

The latter is crucial for applications, for example, in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), where the most used dyes bind to the metal oxide surface through carboxylic acid terminations. To improve the surface reactivity, metal–phosphate bilayers of Ni or Co were synthesized on anatase TiO₂ compact oxide and nanotubes. In both cases, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results showed that the bilayers were successfully formed and that the phosphate layer works as an intermediate between TiO₂ and the other species. ToF-SIMS depth profiles of modified nanotubes showed that Ni and Co are present through the whole tube length and reduce in content after heat treatment, in agreement with XPS results. Phosphate groups, on the other hand, are more present in the tubes’ depth, and their content on the surface is reduced upon exposure to temperature. The reactivity of the modified surfaces toward carboxylic acid-terminated molecules, as stearic acid and Ru-based N719 dye, was evaluated. Contact angle measurements together with dye desorption experiments demonstrated that the Co–phosphate bilayers heat-treated at 300 °C resulted in the largest enhancement compared to the reference. Bilayer-modified compact anatase TiO₂ and anatase TiO₂ nanotubes were utilized as photoanodes in DSSCs. An increase in efficiency was observed for all modified electrodes with phosphate–Co treatment, leading to the highest JSC values and an efficiency improvement of 48%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acobalt 3acontact angle 3adesorption 3aelectrodes 3aheat treatment 3amass spectrometry 3ananotubes 3anickel 3aphosphates 3asolar cells 3astearic acid 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 0aphotoanode 0amodified anatase 0aTiO2 nanotubes 0ametal−phosphate bilayer1 aCha, Gihoon1 aSchmuki, Patrik1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9208-57711 aKillian, Manuela S.1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0892-46140 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Feb. 21, v. 10, no. 7 p.6661-6672dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b160693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011500171300001600286520174300302592002802045650002202073650001402095650001802109650001502127650001802142650001202160650002302172650001602195650002002211650002902231650002102260650000902281650001302290650001102303650001602314650001002330700002402340773008902364856008102453852000902534655001202543IND60575923220221121094750.0170728e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057592322DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-016-9790-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuchspies, Benedikt14aThe Influence of Co-product Handling Methodology on Greenhouse Gas Savings of Biofuels in the European Context  ap. 167-182.  aThe handling of multi-output systems presents a crucial aspect of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission calculation as well as the certification of biofuels, and finding a robust and applicable method that accounts for distinctive characteristics of and benefits generated by all products is a challenge. In this work, GHG emission savings of 11 biofuel production concepts are assessed and the implications of methodological assumptions are discussed by applying the methodology defined by the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), allocation based on physical parameters, two hybrid approaches, as well as six variants of substitution. GHG emission savings according to RED methodology range from 35 to 57 %. Sugar beet-based ethanol shows highest savings. Results reveal that GHG savings according to the RED methodology present, in sum, a relatively good approximation of emission savings occurring due to substitution effects under given assumptions. An introduction of credits for products that are barely or not considered by the RED methodology due to allocation based on the lower heating value (LHV), i.e. fertilizers and wet feed co-products, reduces the difference between RED results and results based on substitution. If displacement mechanisms are considered by substitution, sugar beet-based ethanol, ethanol production by wet milling of wheat and sunflower biodiesel result in highest emission savings under given assumptions if oil that needs to be supplied due to occurring displacement mechanisms stems from rapeseed. The implementation of a method that supports concepts with high emission saving potential, e.g. allocation based the lower heating value of dry material, could promote emission reductions from biofuel provision.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3abiodiesel 3acertification 3acoproducts 3aenergy policy 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afertilizers 3afuel production 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aoils 3arapeseed 3asugars 3awet milling 3awheat1 aKaltschmitt, Martin0 tBioEnergy research.g2017 Mar., v. 10, no. 1 p.167-182dSpringer USx1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-016-9790-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245012900166520103400295592002801329650002301357650001001380650001201390650001601402650002501418650001801443650002201461650001601483650001701499650001301516650002001529650002901549653001601578653002001594653001501614700001601629700002701645773010601672856008701778852000901865655001201874IND60750625020221118011904.0220124e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075062502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1258902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLo, Enlin10aDeciphering metabolic alterations in algae cultivated in spent media as means for enhancing algal biorefinery sustainability  aThe recycling of unfiltered spent media during cultivation of Chlorella vulgaris was studied using metabolomics in an effort to enhance water and nutrient sustainability and reduce operating costs in algal biorefineries. Cultivation in spent media resulted in reduced biomass and lipid productivity by 14% and 19%, respectively, compared to fresh media. The decrease was related to a detected lower nutrient uptake. Nevertheless, carbohydrate content (28% of dry cell weight) and α-linolenic acid content (27 % of fatty acids) were higher in spent media cultures than in fresh media. Metabolomics analysis of intracellular metabolites revealed downregulation of nitrogen assimilation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, structural lipids, and energy metabolism, but upregulation of stress mitigation and carbohydrate synthesis. No growth was supported by spent media during a second cultivation cycle and was likely due to the identified extracellular accumulation of humic acid and free fatty acids that acted as growth auto-inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aalgae 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3acarbohydrate content 3acarbohydrates 3aenergy metabolism 3ahumic acids 3ametabolomics 3anitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 0aSpent media 0aAuto-inhibitors 0aHumic acid1 aArora, Neha1 aPhilippidis, George P.0 tBioresource technology.g2021 Dec., v. 342 p.125890-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1258903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02189naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008500166300001600251520111700267592002801384650001701412650001901429650001501448650001301463650001801476650001701494651001501511653001301526653002501539653001501564653001501579653002001594653002801614773011301642856005101755852000901806655001201815IND50075258320221118041306.0140410e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007525832DNAL7 a10.1080/1523908X.2011.6112882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoss, Simon10aEco-City Governance: A Case Study of Treasure Island and Sonoma Mountain Village  ap. 331-348.  aIn recent years, there have been several dozen major ‘eco-city’ initiatives underway worldwide, primarily in response to global climate change and growing urbanization. Among these, two have been in the making since the early 2000s in California, USA, from where the eco-city movement originated over 20 years ago: Treasure Island, in San Francisco, and Sonoma Mountain Village, in Rohnert Park (Sonoma County). This article analyses these urban sustainability initiatives in terms of the emerging hybrid governance relations and interactions and how these inform the planning, co-ordination and implementation of the initiatives. Among the key governance aspects discussed are the partial privatization through elaborate public–private arrangements, the role of international partners in shaping the urban sustainability agenda and the project-based approach used to effect the initiatives. The findings suggest a prevailing mode of ‘governance at a distance’ and related innovation in governance mechanisms, which, in turn, impacts on how urban sustainability is conceptualized and put into practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3agovernance 3aplanning 3aprivatization 3aurbanization 3aCalifornia 0aEco-city 0aurban sustainability 0agovernance 0ainnovation 0aTreasure Island 0aSonoma Mountain Village0 tJournal of environmental policy & planning.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 13, no. 4 p.331-348dRoutledgex1522-72007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1523908X.2011.611288  aDNAL 7aarticle03442naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245016900204300001800373520188900391592002802280596008602308596005202394650001902446650001902465650000902484650000902493650001902502650001302521650002702534650001302561653001002574653000902584653003302593653004102626653002602667700002502693700006402718773014802782856008102930852000903011655001203020IND60775681820221120193651.0220427e20220221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077568182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.1c076652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Pingping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7259-474710aExtraction and Matrix Cleanup Method for Analyzing Novel Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Ether Acids and Other Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in Fruits and Vegetables  ap. 4792-4804.  aPer- and polyfluoroalkyl ether acids (PFEAs) are a subclass of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that are detected with increasing frequency in environmental matrices. Diet can be an important route of PFEA exposure, but the presence of PFEAs in food is poorly understood. Extraction methods for food samples exist for traditionally studied PFAS, but their suitability for PFEAs and other novel PFAS remains unknown. In this study, an extraction and matrix cleanup method was developed to quantify 45 PFAS, including 13 PFEAs, 3 perfluoroalkane sulfonamides, and 6 fluorotelomer carboxylic acids in 10 types of fruits and vegetables. Homogenized samples were extracted with basic methanol, and resulting extracts were diluted with water and cleaned up using solid-phase extraction with weak anion-exchange cartridges. The method was validated by performing spike–recovery experiments at spike levels of 1 ng/g in all 10 matrices and 0.1 ng/g in 2 matrices. For PFAS without a corresponding isotopically labeled internal standard (IS), adopting an IS with a similar chromatographic retention time generated the most accurate recoveries. Dependent upon the matrix, recoveries of 38–44 PFAS (including 10–13 PFEAs) fell within 50–150% for samples spiked at 1 ng/g. Recoveries of 40 and 38 PFAS in blueberries and corn, respectively, fell within 50–150% for samples spiked at 0.1 ng/g. Method quantification limits (MQLs) of PFAS in pure solvents were determined as the lowest calibration level with an accuracy between 70 and 130%. To compensate for matrix effects, a matrix factor was applied on the basis of the analyte response in different matrices relative to the pure solvent. The MQLs of 45 PFAS (including 13 PFEAs) in 10 matrices ranged from 0.025 to 0.25 ng/g. Overall, this method is capable of sensitively quantifying 45 PFAS in many fruits and vegetables.  aPublisher supplied data  aR839482cU.S. Environmental Protection Agencydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000139  aNAcNC Policy Collaboratorydhttps://doi.org/NA 3aanion exchange 3achromatography 3acorn 3adiet 3afood chemistry 3amethanol 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 0aPFEAs 0aPFAS 0amethod quantification limits 0aextraction and matrix cleanup method 0afruits and vegetables1 aDeStefano, Noelle J.1 aKnappe, Detlef R.

Increasing evidences indicate their role in biotic and abiotic stresses, and therefore, studying these proteins in a naturally stress-tolerant crop would provide further insights into the roles of this important protein family. Given this, the present study was performed in foxtail millet (Setaria italica), a model plant for studying biofuel, stress tolerance, and C₄ photosynthetic traits. The study identified 12 plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs), 11 tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs), 13 NOD26-like intrinsic proteins (NIPs), and 3 small basic intrinsic proteins (SIPs) in foxtail millet. The identified proteins and their corresponding genes were characterized using in silico approaches such as chromosomal localization, analysis of gene and protein properties, phylogenetic analysis, promoter analysis, and RNA-seq-derived expression profiling. The candidate genes identified through these analyses were studied for their expression in response to abiotic stresses (dehydration, salinity, and heat) as well as hormone treatments (abscisic acid, methyl jasmonate, and salicylic acid) in two contrasting cultivars of foxtail millet. The study showed that SiPIP3;1 and SiSIP1;1 were differentially expressed in both the cultivars in response to stress and hormone treatments. Overexpression of these genes in a heterologous yeast system also demonstrated that the transgenic cells were able to tolerate dehydration as well as salt stress which suggests the involvement of these proteins in the tolerance mechanism. Overall, the present study provides insights into structure and organization of the aquaporin gene family in foxtail millet and highlights the potential candidate genes for further functional characterizations.  aPublisher supplied data  aCore GrantcNational Institute of Plant Genome Research 3aC4 photosynthesis 3aSetaria italica 3aabscisic acid 3aaquaporins 3abiofuels 3abiotic stress 3achromosome mapping 3acultivars 3adesiccation (plant physiology) 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3aheat 3amethyl jasmonate 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3aplasma membrane 3asalicylic acid 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3atonoplast 3ayeasts1 aShweta, Shweta1 aMuthamilarasan, Mehanathan1 aRekhā Rāṇī,1 aPrasad, Manoj1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7589-63720 tFunctional & integrative genomics.g2019 July, v. 19, no. 4 p.587-596dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl61464x1438-793X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10142-018-00653-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245018300170300001600353520104900369592002801418650002301446650001801469650002201487650001301509650002501522650001401547650002801561650002101589650002801610650001401638650002001652650001601672650001401688650001401702650001301716650001701729650002001746653001101766653002301777653004101800653002701841700003601868700003101904773011201935856008202047852000902129655001202138IND60571163920221116210651.0190415e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057116392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2017.06.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVilcacundo, Rubén10aRelease of dipeptidyl peptidase IV, α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory peptides from quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) during in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion  ap. 531-539.  aAs diabetes is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in epidemic rates, continuous research is being done on development of foods with anti-diabetic activity. In this study, the influence of gastrointestinal digestion of quinoa protein to release peptides with anti-diabetic potential was investigated. Quinoa protein was subjected to an in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion and fractionated by ultrafiltration. Gastric and gastroduodenal digests and peptide fractions were evaluated for dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities. Peptides released during the duodenal phase showed the highest inhibitory effects. Three novel peptides derived from 11S seed storage globulin B were identified in the most active fraction by HPLC-MS/MS. These peptides showed ability to inhibit enzymes involved in incretin degradation and digestion of dietary carbohydrates. Therefore, quinoa proteins are promising ingredients of functional foods or nutraceutical applications for the control of diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChenopodium quinoa 3aalpha-amylase 3aalpha-glucosidase 3adiabetes 3adietary carbohydrate 3adigestion 3adipeptidyl-peptidase IV 3afunctional foods 3agastrointestinal system 3aglobulins 3aglycemic effect 3aingredients 3amorbidity 3amortality 3asecretin 3aseed storage 3aultrafiltration 0aQuinoa 0aBioactive peptides 0aSimulated gastrointestinal digestion 0aAnti-diabetic activity1 aMartinez-Villaluenga, Cristina,1 aHernandez-Ledesma, Blanca,0 tJournal of functional foods.g2017 Aug., v. 35 p.531-539dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2017.06.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002600171245008300197300001600280500002000296520140200316592002801718650002301746650001801769650001601787650001001803650001201813650000901825650002001834650001601854650001901870650003701889650002201926650001401948650001301962650001801975650002301993650003902016650005902055650003202114650002902146650001802175650002702193650002602220650002502246650003602271650003202307650001702339650002502356700001702381773011902398852000902517856008902526655001202615IND4394025120221122043822.0210415e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439402512DNAL7 a176885802pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2007.02131.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacRobbie, Enid A.

Both closure and the vacuolar efflux transient were inhibited by jasplakinolide but enhanced by latrunculin B. At 10 µm ABA prevention of mitogen‐activated protein (MAP) kinase activation by PD98059 partially inhibited closure and reduced the efflux transient. By contrast, latrunculin B inhibited the efflux transient at 0.1 µm ABA (involving internal Ca²⁺ release rather than Ca²⁺ influx). • The results suggest that 10 µm ABA activates Ca²⁺‐dependent vacuolar ion efflux via a Ca²⁺‐permeable influx channel which is maintained closed by interaction with F‐actin. A MAP kinase is also involved, in a chain similar to that postulated for Ca²⁺‐dependent gene expression in cold acclimation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCommelina communis 3aabscisic acid 3aacclimation 3aactin 3acalcium 3acold 3agene expression 3aguard cells 3amicrofilaments 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3astomatal movement 3atonoplast 3avacuoles 2aAbscisic Acid 2aActinsxmetabolism 2aArabidopsisxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aBridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclicxpharmacology. 2aDepsipeptidesxpharmacology 2aFlavonoidsxpharmacology 2aIon Transport 2aPlant Leavesxcytology 2aPotassiumxmetabolism 2aRubidiumxmetabolism 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology 2aThiazolidinesxpharmacology 2aTime Factors 2aVacuolesxmetabolism1 aKurup, Smita0 tnew phytologist.g2007 Sept., v. 175, no. 4 p.630-640dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2007.02131.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03584naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245011700178300001600295500001500311520235900326592002802685650001002713650001702723650001802740650001602758650001002774650001302784650001102797650001902808650001202827650001002839650002002849650001302869650001602882651001902898653001602917700002302933700002302956773010702979856005503086852000903141655001203150IND4473456120221117195139.0120727e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447345612DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0021-8790.2004.00863.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPOCOCK, MICHAEL J.

These commensal habitats offer potentially rich food resources but are also characterized by instability in time and space. We expected to demonstrate that animals in these habitats have high reproductive rates to counter high mortality rates and show flexibility in spatial organization. House mice (Mus musculus domesticus) are unusual because they are able to persist entirely in both commensal and nonâcommensal habitats, and so can provide a test of the distinctiveness of commensal populations. 2 We studied populations of commensal house mice on two neighbouring farms in North Yorkshire, UK, for 2Â years by captureâmarkârecapture using the robust design. A total of 568 house mice were captured, with a total of 1053 recaptures. Population size varied from nine to 93 individuals, estimated with closed population models. Apparent survival was surprisingly low (0Â·54 per month) and was best modelled as constant across age, sex and time. 3 In situ reproductive recruitment occurred throughout the study and was numerically more important than immigration. Immigration was important during only two intervals and was probably from untrappable areas within the study site. Breeding throughout the year allowed the population to persist despite low survival rates. The results suggested that births and deaths had more influence on the overall population dynamics than movement. 4 The population was divided into subgroups to represent the territorial, demic structure known to be present in commensal house mouse populations. Dispersal between subgroups within the population was limited, representing only 6Â·6% of recaptures. The low rates of dispersal suggested that house mice responded to their environment as consisting of aggregated patches of suitable habitat. 5 In comparison, nonâcommensal house mice have lower mortality, seasonal breeding, and individuals move more frequently and further than commensal house mice. 6 These differences illustrate the responses of house mice to the specific opportunities and demands of commensal habitats and demonstrate the importance of a flexible lifeâhistory strategy for animals exploiting these habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3afoods 3aMus musculus 3asurvival rate 3aparturition 3afarms 3abreeding 3amodels 3aspace and time 3amammals 3adeath 3apopulation size 3ahabitats 3aimmigration 3aUnited Kingdom 0arecruitment1 aSearle, Jeremy B.,1 aWHITE, PIRAN C.

The objectives are to evaluate techno-economically different blends ratios for different pulp mill capacities. Furthermore, the future methanol production potential in Sweden and overall system consequences of large-scale implementation of PO/BL co-gasification are also assessed.It is concluded that gasification of pure BL and PO/BL blends up to 50% results in significantly lower production costs than what can be achieved by gasification of unblended PO. Co-gasification with 20–50% oil addition would be the most advantageous solution based on IRR for integrated biofuel plants in small pulp mills (200kADt/y), whilst pure black liquor gasification (BLG) will be the most advantageous alternative for larger pulp mills. For pulp mill sizes between 300 and 600kADt/y, it is also concluded that a feasible methanol production can be achieved at a methanol market price below 100€/MWh, for production capacities ranging between 0.9 and 1.6TWh/y for pure BLG, and between 1.2 and 6.5TWh/y for PO/BL co-gasification. This study also shows that by introducing PO/BL co-gasification, fewer pulp mills would need to be converted to biofuel plants than with pure BLG, to meet a certain biofuel demand for a region. Due to the technical as well as organizational complexity of the integration this may prove beneficial, and could also potentially lower the total investment requirement to meet the total biofuel demand in the system. The main conclusion is that PO/BL co-gasification is a technically and economically attractive production route for production biomethanol.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3agasification 3amarket prices 3amethanol 3amixing 3aoils 3aproduction costs 3apulp 3apyrolysis 3awaste liquors 3aSweden 0aBlack liquor 0aPyrolysis oil 0aCo-gasification 0aMethanol 0aPulp mill1 aFurusjö, Erik1 aWetterlund, Elisabeth1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4597-40821 aLundgren, Joakim1 aLandälv, Ingvar0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2016 Feb. 15, v. 110 p.240-248dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2015.12.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03264naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008200166506010400248506007600352520173100428592002802159506003702187650002002224650002502244650002302269650002302292650002202315650001602337650001602353650001202369650001102381650001102392650001302403651001202416653001502428653002802443653001702471653001302488653001402501700001502515700001802530700001602548773012602564856008302690852000902773655001202782IND60776507320221207085006.0220531e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077650732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2022.1080042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNichols, R.N.10aRole of management in the long-term provision of floral resources on farmland  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFloral abundance and richness on farmland has been declining since the mid 1900 s. Agri-environment schemes (AES) can improve floral resource availability through establishment of flower-rich areas or careful management of areas set-aside to naturally regenerate on farmland. Ideal management regimes include sowing and re-sowing of seed mixes, regular cuts of growth, and removal of cuttings to optimise floral diversity. Our aim was to determine which areas and managements on farmland provided greatest floral resources for insect pollinators, and if these persisted over time. We surveyed 67 non-crop areas across eight farms in the south of England during 2014 and again in 2018, recording each flowering species present and the estimated floral abundance of each species. We then interviewed the farmers to determine management details and history for each surveyed area. Our results showed that floral abundance was initially greatest in sown Pollen & Nectar Strips and Florally Enhanced (FE) Grass Margins, but subsequently declined: from 1 to 5 years to 6–10 years for Pollen & Nectar Strips, and from 1 to 10 years to 11–20 years for FE Grass Margins. Additionally, only a handful of sown species known to be beneficial for insect pollinators persisted over time: Centaurea nigra, Lotus corniculatus, Trifolium pratense and Leucanthemum vulgare. It is vital that policy makers move forward with pollinator-targeting AES that can successfully support a variety of insects, including both pollinators and crop-pest predators. Species lists for AES seed mixes should include higher proportions of persistent perennial species, and a better support structure is needed in order to aid farmers with AES managements.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCentaurea nigra 3aLeucanthemum vulgare 3aLotus corniculatus 3aTrifolium pratense 3aagricultural land 3aagriculture 3aenvironment 3agrasses 3anectar 3apollen 3aresowing 3aEngland 0aWildflower 0aAgri-environment scheme 0aField margin 0aSeed mix 0aSet-aside1 aWood, T.J.1 aHolland, J.M.1 aGoulson, D.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 335 p.108004-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.1080043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001800147245011200165300001600277520146800293592002801761650001301789650001501802650001701817650001801834650001201852650001201864650003401876650002001910650001801930700001201948773007901960856008302039852000902122655001202131IND4451723820221122002153.0141111e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445172382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2010.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hong-fang14aThe effect of SEM preparation on pit membrane remnants in vessel element end-walls of primitive angiosperms  ap. 310-315.  aScanning electron microscope (SEM) is necessary to demonstrate presence or absence of pit membranes in possible perforations or the type of pit membrane remnants in perforations in vessel element end-walls of angiosperms, but it was unconfirmed and questionable whether pit membrane absence in pits was affected by the processing and handling before SEM observations. To solve this question, the secondary xylem of four woody species from primitive angiosperms, Illicium henryi Diels. (Illiciaceae), Schisandra rubriflora (Franch.) Rehd. et Wils. (Schisandraceae), Tetracentron sinensis Oliv. and Trochodendron aralioides Sieb. & Zucc. (Trochodendraceae) was chosen and the following techniques were used: (1) fresh materials were examined in low-vacuum with ESEM. (2) Air-dried materials were examined both in low- and high-vacuum with ESEM. (3) Fresh materials fixed in several different fixatives were observed in low-vacuum, respectively. (4) Smooth surface of the material by paraffin section methods was examined in high-vacuum. (5) Materials treated by Jeffrey's Fluid were observed in high-vacuum. Pit membranes and remnants in perforations of fresh material were little different from that of treated materials. Absence of the pit membrane in perforations (pits) in the end-wall was not attributed to the processing and handling. Information of pit membranes and remnants in perforations in end-wall based on the SEM observation might be validly claimed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIllicium 3aSchisandra 3aTetracentron 3aTrochodendron 3aalkanes 3aliquids 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asecondary xylem 3axylem vessels1 aRen, Yi0 tFlora.g2011 Apr., v. 206, no. 4 p.310-315dElsevier GmbHx0367-25307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2010.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03413naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002700156245011800183300001600301520201600317592002802333650001702361650002602378650001702404650003502421650001502456650001502471650001102486650001302497650000902510650000902519650000902528650002202537650001202559650001602571651001202587653001202599653001402611653001802625653002002643653001302663700001902676700002502695773011202720856009002832852000902922655001202931IND50065219520221117195245.0150427e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006521952DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1654-109X.2007.tb00509.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZechmeister, Harald G.10aSpatial distribution patterns of Rhynchostegium megapolitanum at the landscape scale –– an expanding species?  ap. 111-120.  aQuestion: Is Rhynchostegium megapolitanum an expanding species?Location: Viennese Basin (120––220 m a.s.l.), Austria.Methods: 121 dry grasslands, were investigated for the occurrence of R. megapolitanum. Nineteen environmental variables at 50 randomly selected sites, species composition at sites with and without R. megapolitanum and the spatial patterns of distribution of the species at the landscape scale were analysed. We compared actual distribution data of three rare species (Didymodon acutus, Pleurochaete squarrosa R. megapolitanum) and a common one (Brachythecium rutabulum) with the distribution obtained by vouchers that were collected between 1860 and 1940 in the investigated area. We calculated a GIS based model pattern and compared it with the actual distribution.Results: R. megapolitanum was detected in 28 of these sites, almost 50 %% of its populations produced sporophytes. We found significant differences between sites with and without R. megapolitanum with regard to grassland size, the percentage of silt and of sand in the soil. There were fewer occurrences of historic herbarium vouchers of R. megapolitanum than our current field survey discovered. The GIS based analyses of distribution patterns at the landscape scale showed a clustering of sites in which R. megapolitanum was present or absent. Simulations with a spatially realistic expansion model showed high similarities to the actual distribution of the species.Conclusions: All these analyses suggest that R. megapolitanum has been expanding in the investigated area.

The median lethal concentration (LC50) value and median effective concentration (EC50, i.e., the total adverse effects, including developmental defects and mortality) were calculated to be 2740 and 133μg/L, respectively, when cadmium was prepared in dilution water. The LC50 decreased to 266μg/L in a subsequent test one month later, thereby suggesting that the sensitivity of this fish to cadmium in the early life stage¹ was largely influenced by the quality of fertilized eggs, which is known to be dependent on the season. The mortality and total adverse effects showed a concentration-dependent relationship at dosages greater than 1000 or 10μg/L (p<0.05), respectively, at pro-larva stage (i.e., 144hpf) with dilution water. To compare the toxic effects of cadmium under field and experimental conditions, filtered river water was adopted as a solvent simultaneously compared with dilution water. No significant differences were observed in mortality rate, hatching rate and adverse effect prevalence between the two solvents. In comparison to previously published toxicity data for other fish, the pro-larva of soldatov's catfish were less sensitive than established test fish in the early life stage. Therefore, the environmental risks would be overestimated when considering only existing toxicity data for other test fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSilurus 3aadverse effects 3acadmium 3acatfish 3adevelopmental stages 3aegg quality 3aembryogenesis 3afield experimentation 3alethal concentration 50 3amortality 3ariver water 3atoxicity1 aCao, Hongbin1 aMeng, Yaobin1 aJin, Guanghai1 aZhu, Meilin0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2012 June 1, v. 80 p.258-265dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2012.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245019300173300001500366500001900381520112200400592002801522650002001550650001101570650001301581650001301594650001601607650001401623651001901637651001701656653002401673653002001697700002101717700001901738773011001757856008501867852000901952655001201961IND60695789520221122074407.0200519e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069578952DNAL7 a10.1080/03736687.2016.11455232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDirkse, Gerard M.10aRiccia boumanii Dirkse, Losada & M.Stech sp. nov.

These plants were assumed to belong to the South African endemic Riccia section Pilifer, but could not be assigned to a particular species in that section. In the interim they were named R. lamellosa (section Riccia), since R. lamellosa is the only European species with conspicuous white ventral scales. Molecular phylogenetic reconstructions based on trnL-F and ITS2 sequences confirmed that the respective Riccia plants belong to section Pilifer. The respective clade is clearly separated from the clades of R. lamellosa and R. elongata, the latter being morphologically most similar within section Pilifer. Based on the combined molecular and morphological evidence the Riccia plants from Canary Islands are described as a new species, R. boumanii, which represents the first species of section Pilifer outside South Africa. Based on revised herbarium specimens, R. boumanii occurs on five islands of the Canary Islands archipelago, namely El Hierro, Gran Canaria, La Gomera, La Palma, and Tenerife.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarchantiophyta 3aRiccia 3abryology 3aherbaria 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aCanary Islands 3aSouth Africa 0aMolecular phylogeny 0aSection Pilifer1 aLosada-Lima, Ana1 aStech, Michael0 tJournal of bryology.g2016 Apr. 2, v. 38, no. 2 p.94-102dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2030x1743-28207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03736687.2016.11455233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01488naa a2200229 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245004900172300001600221520072900237592002800966653003300994653001501027773011001042856008501152852000901237655001201246IND60688883120221120083204.0200417e20150818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068888312DNAL7 a10.1080/09614524.2015.10648612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSengupta, Mayuri10aObstacles to the use of indigenous knowledge  ap. 880-894.  aTribal communities are often viewed as living in harmony with nature, and their traditional knowledge is regarded as essential in the sustainable use of resources and central to their inclusion in the development process. This article studies the main obstacles to the use of indigenous knowledge among the Reang tribal community in Tripura (northeast India), and presents two main arguments. First, that there are inherent problems and tensions within the concept of indigenous knowledge which is not evenly shared across the community. Second, the essence of indigenous knowledge remains futile in circumstances where the Indian state categorises indigenous knowledge and its holders as “backward” and “primitive”.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAid – Development policies 0aSouth Asia0 tDevelopment in practice.g2015 Aug. 18, v. 25, no. 6 p.880-894dRoutledgewJournal:12201x1364-92137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09614524.2015.10648613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100002500155245008900180300001600269520144300285592002801728650001301756650001201769650001501781650001101796650001501807650001601822650001701838650002601855650004401881650003301925650001201958650001701970650001901987650001002006650001502016650001802031650001102049650001102060650002702071650003602098650000902134650002602143650002602169650002602195650002602221650001602247650004002263651001202303651001902315651001802334651001202352700002202364700001802386700002102404700002202425700003702447700002302484773010302507856003902610852000902649655001202658IND4477452520221118232459.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447745252DNAL7 a217512672pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.35472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgegbo, Olumuyiwa L.10aUrinary 1H‐NMR Metabonomics Study on Intervention Effects of Soya Milk in Africans  ap. 127-135.  aMetabonomics is an important tool in understanding the toxicological or therapeutic effects of interventions by analysing metabolic profiles and interpreting complex multi‐dimensional spectroscopic/spectrometric data using multivariate data analysis. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the metabolic changes following a short‐term 5 day soya milk intervention, and to investigate factors that influence soy‐phytoestrogen metabolism focused on Africans based in either UK or Nigeria. 1H‐NMR metabonomics was applied to analyse urine samples collected at four phases I–IV (pre, days 3 and 5, and post) of the soy‐intervention from African volunteers (n = 40 in total). Individual proton NMR spectra were visually and statistically assessed using multivariate analyses (MVA): principal component analysis (PCA) and (orthogonal‐) partial‐least square–discriminant analysis ((O‐) PLS‐DA). In addition, 22 endogenous metabolites were quantified using a Chenomx NMR suite. The results showed the levels of analysed endogenous metabolites (creatinine adjusted) present ranged from 4 µ m to 12 m m with large inter‐subject variances in acetate, acetone, lactate and trimethylamine. The MVA results showed high inter‐individuality and sampling variances based on PCA score plots, and demonstrated soy metabolism to be significantly influenced by location and gender by both PLS‐DA and O‐PLS‐DA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfricans 3aacetone 3acreatinine 3agender 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amultivariate analysis 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprincipal component analysis 3asoymilk 3atherapeutics 3atrimethylamine 3aurine 3avolunteers 2aBlack People. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLeast-Squares Analysis 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMale 2aMetabolomicsxmethods 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aPhytoestrogensxurine 2aPlant Extractsxurine 2aSex Factors 2aSoy Milkxmetabolismxpharmacology. 3aNigeria 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGreat Britain 0aNigeria1 aDissanyake, Wimal1 aCrowder, John1 aAsekun, Olayinka1 aFamiloni, Oluwole1 aBranford‐White, Christopher J.1 aAnnie Bligh, S.

The use of MNPs opens wide opportunities in diagnostics, drug and gene delivery, in vivo imaging, magnetic separation, and hyperthermia therapy, etc. Besides, their possible integration in sensors makes them an ideal essential element of innovative pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. Nowadays, MNPs-based electrochemical sensors have attracted great attention to pharmaceutical and biomedical applications owing to their high sensitivity, stability. Selectivity towards the target as well as their simplicity of manufacture. Therefore, this review focus on recent advances with cutting-edge approaches dealing with the synthesis, design, and advantageous analytical performance of MNPs in the electrochemical sensors utilized for pharmaceutical and biomedical applications between 2015 and 2020. The challenges existing in this research area and some potential strategies/future perspectives for the rational design of electrochemical sensors are also outlined.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiagnostic techniques 3adrugs 3aelectrochemistry 3afever 3agene transfer 3amagnetic separation 3amagnetism 3amanufacturing 3atherapeutics 0aMagnetic nanoparticles 0aElectrochemical sensor 0aPharmaceutical 0aBiomedical 0aBiomarkers diagnosis1 aZor, Erhan1 aOzcelikay, Goksu1 aOzkan, Sibel A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7494-30770 tTalanta.g2021 May 01, v. 226 p.122108-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1221083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245012300167300001600290520120300306592002801509650002601537650002201563650002901585650002101614650002201635650001101657650001501668650001201683650003001695650001901725651001001744653002901754653002301783653002301806700001801829700001701847700001501864700001301879700005801892773009401950856008402044852000902128655001202137IND60626519120221117062042.0190325e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062651912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2018.12.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dongyu10aMedium-to-long-term coupled strategies for energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reduction in Beijing (China)  ap. 350-360.  aChina's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are projected to peak by 2030 and China makes great efforts to reach the peak as soon as possible. As the ‘frontier’ of Chinese Reform and Opening-up, Beijing has set a goal in 13th Five-Year Plan that local GHG emissions will peak by 2020. This research analyzes the situations of socio-economic development and energy consumption in Beijing and establishes LEAP-Beijing model for the medium-to-long-term prediction of GHG emissions. The energy demand module in LEAP model has six branches, including civilian sector, agriculture, industry, construction industry, transportation and service sector. The analysis and evaluation of their potentials to cut emissions and the difficulties to implement can help Beijing determine the development priority and take right measures to develop a low-carbon society. Four scenarios are set in LEAP-Beijing model, including Business-As-Usual scenario (BAU), Low-Carbon scenario (LC), Enhanced Low-Carbon scenario (ELC) and Peak-Reaching scenario (PR). These scenarios are applied to analyze the total amount of GHG emissions in Beijing and how the peak-reaching time varies due to the impacts of different policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconstruction industry 3aenergy efficiency 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aprediction 3asociety 3asocioeconomic development 3atransportation 3aChina 0aGreenhouse gas emissions 0aEnergy consumption 0aLEAP-Beijing model1 aLiu, Gengyuan1 aChen, Caocao1 aZhang, Yan1 aHao, Yan1 aCasazza, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7579-32310 tEnergy policy.g2019 Apr., v. 127 p.350-360dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.12.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002600187245013600213300001600349506007600365520096500441536020301406592002801609506003701637650002101674650001201695650002001707650000901727650003101736650002301767651001201790653003201802653002101834700001701855700001701872773013201889856008002021852000902101655001202110IND60615659620221207102046.0181011e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061565962DNAL7 a10.1177/10406387177314912doi7 aPMC65041632pmcid7 a289061792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBell-Rogers, Patricia10aMulti-locus sequence types of Mycoplasma bovis isolated from Ontario, Canada in the past three decades have a temporal distribution  ap. 130-135.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA total of 217 Mycoplasma bovis isolates cultured from clinical cases in Ontario, Canada, over the past 30 y were selected to be characterized by a multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) method. Eleven housekeeping genes were evaluated for suitability for MLST; 2 loci that had been used in prior MLST schemes, dnaN and metS, along with hsp70 were chosen for further sequence analysis. The remaining loci—adk, efp, gmk, gyrB, polC, rpoB, tpiA, and uvrC genes—were not used because they had little to no sequence variation. The sequence data from the chosen loci (dnaN, hsp70, metS) generated 28 sequence types (STs), with the 3 loci having 15, 5, and 7 alleles, respectively. These molecular typing results revealed that the STs had a temporal distribution; over the course of 3 decades, some STs disappeared and new STs appeared. Recent isolates had a greater variety of STs, which may indicate that new strains are emerging more rapidly now than in the past.  aFunding This research was financially supported by the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA)–Animal Health Laboratory, Animal Health Strategic Investment (AHSI) program.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycoplasma bovis 3aalleles 3aessential genes 3aloci 3amultilocus sequence typing 3asequence diversity 3aOntario 0aMulti-locus sequence typing 0aMycoplasma bovis1 aParker, Lois1 aCai, Hugh Y.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 30, no. 1 p.130-135dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1943-49367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10406387177314913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02149naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245005400171300001600225500001900241520075800260592002801018650001401046650001201060650001701072650001301089650002201102650001001124650001401134650001901148650001601167650001201183650002101195651001001216653001101226653001701237653001201254653001401266653001501280653001101295653001501306653001101321700002001332700001901352700001301371700001601384700001401400773011101414856008501525852000901610655001201619IND60695789720221120215209.0200519e20160702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069578972DNAL7 a10.1080/03736687.2016.11455252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHodgetts, N.

Conservation bodies are active in trying to save the forest and promote its future as a national park. Very little is known about its bryophyte flora, and this short expedition was intended as a first step to remedy that situation. Survey work in March 2014 was targeted mainly at areas thought likely to be bryophyte-rich, notably swamp forest and upland evergreen forest. A total of 164 species was recorded, including about 58 new to Ghana and at least one new species. The importance of Atewa Forest for biodiversity in western Africa is reinforced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryophyta 3abauxite 3abiodiversity 3abryology 3aevergreen forests 3aflora 3ahighlands 3anational parks 3anew species 3asurveys 3atropical forests 3aGhana 0aAfrica 0aConservation 0aEcology 0aInventory 0aLiverworts 0aMosses 0aRainforest 0aSurvey1 aEssilfie, M.

This article examines the level of farmers’ access to rural radio in relation to gender and livelihoods. The study was conducted in Benin with 18 rural radio stations and 240 rice processors, using the sustainable livelihoods framework to examine the relationship between access to rural radio and livelihoods. Although the study cannot draw conclusions on causal relationships, rice processors who often listened to agricultural broadcasts had better social, financial, and human capital stocks compared to those who did not. Despite the efforts of 72% of the radio stations to link up with extension services, half of the rice processors rarely or never listened to agricultural broadcasts, because the timing of the broadcasts was inappropriate. Interactive radio sessions with farmers that involve government officials will need to address this if they are to become more effective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural extension 3agender 3ahuman capital 3aliteracy 3aradio 3arice 3aBenin 0aTechnology – Media 0aGender and diversity 0aEnvironment (built and natural) – Agriculture 0aSub-Saharan Africa1 aVodouhe, Davo Simplice1 aMele, Paul van,1 aAgboh-Noameshie, Afiavi Rita1 aLebailly, Philippe0 tDevelopment in practice.g2015 Oct. 3, v. 25, no. 7 p.1057-1066dRoutledgewJournal:12201x1364-92137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09614524.2015.10692613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02261naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245016600176300001600342500001900358520107300377592002801450650001301478650001701491650001301508650001101521653002101532653001701553653001601570653000801586653001401594653001601608653001301624653001601637700001701653773011101670856008501781852000901866655001201875IND60695789820221120215328.0200519e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069578982DNAL7 a10.1080/03736687.2016.11563552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKöckinger, Heribert10aBrachythecium funkii Schimp. and B. japygum (Głow.)

According to nuclear and chloroplast sequence data, the latter two taxa proved to be closely related to B. tommasinii and B. tenuicaule, whereas the affinities of B. cirrosum within Brachythecium are rather unclear. B. funkii is a coarser plant than B. cirrosum and also differs in shorter leaf acumens and much larger lamina cells. On the other hand, B. japygum (better known under the illegitimate name Eurhynchium histrio) can be distinguished from B. cirrosum in the prostrate and densely pinnate to subdendroid growth form, longer leaf acumens and wider lamina cells with lumens wider than walls. All three species also differ from each other in the morphology of the alar cell group. Despite their shared preference for calcareous rocks, the three species show marked differences in habitat requirements.  aPublisher supplied data 3abryology 3achloroplasts 3ahabitats 3aleaves 0aBrachytheciaceae 0aCirriphyllum 0aEurhynchium 0aITS 0aPhylogeny 0apsbT–psbH 0aTaxonomy 0atrnL–trnF1 aKučera, Jan0 tJournal of bryology.g2016 Oct. 1, v. 38, no. 4 p.267-285dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2030x1743-28207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03736687.2016.11563553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245012300205300001600328520146200344592002801806650002601834650001401860650001201874650001401886650001101900650002001911650001701931650001001948650001301958650002401971650001701995650001302012650002702025651001002052700002502062773011702087856008202204852000902286655001202295IND60647057620221116145001.0190615e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064705762DNAL7 a10.1007/s10228-019-00680-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkita, Yuichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8740-104710aAge, growth, and maturity of the Indian flathead Platycephalus indicus in the waters around Okinawa-jima Island, Japan  ap. 330-339.  aIndian flathead Platycephalus indicus (Platycephalidae) is an important fishery resource in tropical and subtropical waters. However, there have been few studies of its life history which is important for resource management because of taxonomic confusion. Here, we determine the age, growth, maturity, and spawning season of P. indicus from 351 specimens [21.7–76.9 cm total length (TL) for females; 19.6–61.9 cm TL for males] collected between August 2006 and August 2009 around Okinawa-jima Island, in southern Japan. Almost all specimens were caught by artisanal fishery. Age was determined by sectioning otoliths: the oldest specimens were seven years in both sexes. Parameters for von Bertalanffy growth functions were L∞ = 72.6, k = 0.48 and t₀ = -0.36 for females, and L∞ = 53.6, k = 0.68 and t₀ = -0.38 for males. Mean body size of females was larger than males at a given age, indicating females grow larger than males. The spawning season was estimated to be between January and October. The smallest and youngest mature female was 36.1 cm TL and 1.0 year old, while the smallest and youngest male was 22.9 cm TL and 0.4 years old. Moreover, the smallest mature male individual was smaller than the smallest female. Furthermore, we did not observe hermaphroditic gonads. Therefore, we consider that discrepancy in body size between sexes results from the difference in growth rate rather than sex change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlatycephalus indicus 3abody size 3afemales 3afisheries 3agonads 3ahermaphroditism 3alife history 3amales 3aotoliths 3aresource management 3asex reversal 3aspawning 3atraditional technology 3aJapan1 aTachihara, Katsunori0 tIchthyological research.g2019 July, v. 66, no. 3 p.330-339dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl4124684x1341-89987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10228-019-00680-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245013400165300001800299520121000317592002801527596009801555596009801653596009501751650002701846650002101873650001901894650001501913650001101928650001501939650001901954650000901973653001901982653002002001653002502021700001702046700001402063700001602077700001502093700001402108700005902122700001402181773014802195856008102343852000902424655001202433IND60775682620221121230335.0220427e20220413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077568262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.1c081992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chengcheng10aResistance Risk and Novel Resistance-Related Point Mutations in Target Protein PiORP1 of Fluoxapiprolin in Phytophthora infestans  ap. 4881-4888.  aFluoxapiprolin is a new oxysterol binding protein inhibitor (OSBPI), which showed excellent inhibitory activity to plant pathogenic oomycetes. Its resistance risk and mechanism in Phytophthora infestans are unclear. In the current study, the sensitivities of 103 P. infestans isolates to fluoxapiprolin were investigated, and a unimodal distribution with a mean EC₅₀ value of 0.00035 μg/mL was observed. Four types of resistant mutants, with a resistance factor from 14 to more than 1000, and point mutations S768I+N837I, S768I+L860I, S768I, and I877F in PiORP1, were acquired using fungicide adaption. The fitness of the mutants was similar to or lower than that of the corresponding parental isolate. Positive cross-resistance was detected between fluoxapiprolin and oxathiapiprolin. The point mutations were verified in P. sojae homologue positions using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system. Transformants containing S768I+N837I or S768I+L860I, showed high fluoxapiprolin resistance (RF > 1000). In conclusion, the risk of P. infestans resistance to fluoxapiprolin is moderate, and novel point mutation types S768I+N837I or S768I+L860I could cause high fluoxapiprolin resistance in P. infestans.  aPublisher supplied data  a31471791cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a31730075cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2020TD-035cThe Innovation Capability Support Plan of Shaanxi Provincedhttps://doi.org/NA 3aPhytophthora infestans 3across resistance 3afood chemistry 3afungicides 3agenome 3aoxysterols 3apoint mutation 3arisk 0afluoxapiprolin 0aresistance risk 0aresistance mechanism1 aLiu, Xiaofei1 aLiu, Zeqi1 aHu, Shiping1 aXue, Ziwei1 aFu, Yixin1 aMiao, Jianqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4683-69331 aLiu, Xili0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2022 Apr. 13, v. 70, no. 16 p.4881-4888dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c081993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01921naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245008900157300001600246520084100262592002801103650001901131650001701150650002201167650001301189650001501202650002001217650001501237650002301252700003101275700002001306700002801326700001601354773010501370856007501475852000901550655001201559IND60533380620171127000000.0160731e20150309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053338062DNAL7 a10.1021/bm501834m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHajiali, Hadi10aAlginate Nanofibrous Mats with Adjustable Degradation Rate for Regenerative Medicine  ap. 936-943.  aThe broad utilization of electrospun scaffolds of sodium alginate in tissue engineering is strongly limited by their high solubility in aqueous environments and by the difficulty to adjust their degradation dynamics. Here, an alternative strategy to enhance the stability and to control the degradability of alginate nanofibers is described by treating them with trifluoroacetic acid for specific time intervals. It is demonstrated that, by increasing the duration of the acid treatment procedure, a lower degradation rate of the resulting fibers in buffer solutions can be achieved. Furthermore, the produced mats are free from cytotoxic compounds and are highly biocompatible. The properties conferred to the alginate nanofibrous mats by the proposed method are extremely attractive in the production of innovative biomedical devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid treatment 3acytotoxicity 3amedical equipment 3amedicine 3ananofibers 3asodium alginate 3asolubility 3atissue engineering1 aHeredia-Guerrero, José

In this work, a novel method was developed for determination of ultra-low level ¹³⁵Cs and ¹³⁷Cs in seawater using triple-quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS/MS). Cesium was pre-concentrated from up to 45 L seawater samples using ammonium molybdophosphate (AMP) adsorption, following a selective leaching of cesium using Sr(OH)₂. The cesium was further purified from interfering elements using AMP-PAN and cation-exchange chromatography. Sr(OH)₂ leaching was found to be an effective approach for selective exchange of cesium from the AMP sorbent without dissolution, which avoids the problem of separation of huge amount of NH₄⁺ and MoO₄²⁻ in the following steps. The decontamination factors for barium and rubidium with the developed method were more than 4 × 10⁷ and 800, respectively. The separated ¹³⁵Cs and ¹³⁷Cs were measured using ICP-MS/MS by employing N₂O as reaction gas to further elimination of isobaric (i.e. ¹³⁵Ba and ¹³⁷Ba) and polyatomic ions interferences. A detection limit of 1.5 × 10⁻¹⁶ g L⁻¹ for ¹³⁵Cs in seawater was achieved. The concentrations of ¹³⁵Cs in seawater from Baltic Sea, Danish straits and Roskilde Fjord were determined using the developed method to identify the sources of ¹³⁵Cs, the water masses exchange in this region was investigated using ¹³⁵Cs and ¹³⁷Cs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aammonium 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abarium 3acation exchange chromatography 3acesium radioisotopes 3adecontamination 3adetection limit 3arubidium 3aseawater 3aseparation 3asorbents 3aBaltic Sea 0a135Cs/137Cs atomic Ratio 0aTracer 0aSelective leaching 0aWater masses exchange1 aHou, Xiaolin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4851-48581 aQiao, Jixin0 tTalanta.g2021 May 01, v. 226 p.122121-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1221213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03980naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100003100148245010100179300001600280520232900296592002802625650001802653650001202671650002602683650001102709650002302720650001502743650002002758650002602778650002502804650002702829650002102856650001502877650001802892650001202910650002002922650001402942650001802956650001302974650002102987650001903008650001903027650001203046650001303058650001503071650001303086651001303099700002403112700002203136700002503158700002103183773010503204856008403309852000903393655001203402IND4447626120221121000826.0141111e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444762612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2010.11.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcLaughlin, Jimq(Jim W.),10aBiogeochemical cycling and chemical fluxes in a managed northern forested wetland, Michigan, USA  ap. 649-661.  aForest harvesting and subsequent regeneration treatments may cause changes in soil and solution chemistry that adversely affect forest productivity and environmental quality. The objective of this study was to assess soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and base cation pools and fluxes, and to construct a hydrogen ion (H⁺) mass balance to identify major processes controlling acidity production and consumption 14 years following whole-tree harvesting and regeneration in a northern forested wetland with underlying mineral soils derived from calcareous glacial drift. Results for soil elemental and nutrient pools in the harvested/regenerated stand were compared to an adjacent non-harvested stand and a riparian zone. The riparian zone had the highest soil total C, total N, and exchangeable calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) pools; however, no difference in exchangeable potassium (K) was evident among stand types. Moreover, no differences between the harvested/regenerated and uncut stands were evident in any of the soil chemical pools. Net export of base cations was minimal and the H⁺ mass balance indicated that net cation exchange was not a significant process in H⁺ production or consumption in either the uncut or harvested/regenerated stands. The most striking differences in the H⁺ mass balance were (1) eight times the H⁺ consumption from sulfate (SO₄ ²⁻) reduction in the harvested/regenerated stand compared to that in the uncut condition and (2) nearly twice the H⁺ production due to N immobilization in the harvested/regenerated stand. However, both stand types were net H⁺ sinks and increases in H⁺ export due to whole-tree harvesting were not evident. The riparian zone was a net exporter of base cations. This finding was attributed to a combination of base cation exchange and carbonate mineral weathering; data suggested the importance of the latter. More research, however, is required to isolate the contributions of cation exchange and carbonate weathering on base cation export from the riparian zone. Stream chemistry was consistent with that of the riparian zone, indicating a strong linkage between the riparian zone stream chemistry, and whole-tree harvesting had no intermediate term (i.e., 14 years) effects on stream acidification in this managed northern wetland ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aacidity 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3acarbonate minerals 3acarbonates 3acation exchange 3aenvironmental quality 3aexchangeable calcium 3aexchangeable potassium 3aglacial deposits 3aharvesting 3ahydrogen ions 3alogging 3alowland forests 3amagnesium 3amineral soils 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3ariparian areas 3asoil nutrients 3astreams 3asulfates 3aweathering 3awetlands 3aMichigan1 aCalhoon, Emily B.W.1 aGale, Margaret R.1 aJurgensen, Martin F.1 aTrettin, Carl C.0 tForest ecology and management.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 261, no. 3 p.649-661dElsevier B.V.x0378-11277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2010.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03708naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245010800204500002200312520210900334592002802443650002102471650001502492650001502507650001602522650002102538650001502559650002202574650002502596650001402621650001102635650002602646650001902672650001302691650001602704650001402720650001302734650002302747650001602770653001402786653001402800653001502814653002502829653003402854653002302888700001802911700001602929700006302945773006803008856008103076852000903157655001203166IND60570851320221120100912.0170709s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057085132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2017.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibeiro, J.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6421-976310aElectrochemical detection of cardiac biomarker myoglobin using polyphenol as imprinted polymer receptor  aPre-press version  aAn electrochemical biosensor was developed by merging the features of Molecular Imprinting technique and Screen-Printed Electrode (SPE) for the simple and fast screening of cardiac biomarker myoglobin (Myo) in point-of-care (POC).The MIP artificial receptor for Myo was prepared by electrooxidative polymerization of phenol (Ph) on a AuSPE in the presence of Myo as template molecule. The choice of the most effective protein extraction procedure from the various extraction methods tested (mildly acidic/basic solutions, pure/mixed organic solvents, solutions containing surfactants and enzymatic digestion methods), and the optimization of the thickness of the polymer film was carefully undertaken in order to improve binding characteristics of Myo to the imprinted polymer receptor and increase the sensitivity of the MIP biosensor. The film thickness was optimized by adjusting scan rate and the number of cycles during cyclic voltammetric electropolymerization of Ph. The thickness of the polyphenol nanocoating of only few nanometres (∼4.4 nm), and similar to the protein diameter, brought in significant improvements in terms of sensor sensitivity.The binding affinity of MIP receptor film was estimated by fitting the experimental data to Freundlich isotherm and a ∼8 fold increase in the binding affinity of Myo to the imprinted polymer (KF = 0.119 ± 0.002 ng−1 mL) when compared to the non-imprinted polymer (KF = 0.015 ± 0.002 ng−1 mL) which demonstrated excellent (re)binding affinity for the imprinted protein.The incubation of the Myo MIP receptor modified electrode with increasing concentration of protein (from 0.001 ng mL−1 to 100 μg mL−1) resulted in a decrease of the ferro/ferricyanide redox current. LODs of 2.1 and 14 pg mL−1 were obtained from calibration curves built in neutral buffer and diluted artificial serum, respectively, using SWV technique, enabling the detection of the protein biomarker at clinically relevant levels.The prepared MIP biosensor was applied to the determination of Myo spiked serum samples with satisfactory results.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding capacity 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3afilms (materials) 3amolecular imprinting 3amyoglobin 3aphenol 3apoint-of-care systems 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3apolyphenols 3ascreening 3asolvents 3asorption isotherms 3asurfactants 0aBiosensor 0aMyoglobin 0aPolyphenol 0aMolecular imprinting 0aScreen-printed gold electrode 0aSynthetic receptor1 aPereira, C.M.1 aSilva, A.F.1 aSales, M.

In this context, we used digitised historical bryophyte distribution data along a 1021 m elevational gradient in Terceira Island (Azores) to determine how bryophyte species distribution varies with elevation and which spatial and climatic drivers contribute to this variation. We used ordinary least squares analysis to test for climatic and spatial data as explanatory variables for bryophyte richness and Mid-Domain Null simulations to assess the influence of spatial constraints on species distributions. Bryophyte richness follows a hump-shaped pattern, with mosses predominating in the first half of the gradient and liverworts in the second half. While moss richness did not correlate to any climatic variables and responded weakly to the presence of forest cover, liverwort presence was related to temperature, rainfall, humidity and the occurrence of native forest areas, suggesting that these plants are more sensitive to changes in their environment and can thus be used as better indicator species for climate change. Despite their inherent biases, our study shows that historically compiled data can be a valuable tool for preliminary assessment of macroecological patterns.  aPublisher supplied data  aM3.1.2/F/051/2011cFundo Regional para a Ciência e Tecnologiadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008382 3aBryophyta 3abryology 3aclimate change 3aforests 3ageographical distribution 3ahumidity 3aindicator species 3amosses and liverworts 3arain 3aspatial data 3atemperature 3aAzores 0aBryophytes 0aElevation 0aHistorical data 0aMid-domain effect 0aRichness drivers1 aBorges, Paulo A.

It was shown that the performance of the cell was enhanced by partial blockage of the flow channels in a parallel flow field. Since, channel indentation could increase oxygen content within the catalyst layer. It was observed that the influence of channel indentation in high current density regions was noticeable. Various types of blocks with profile shapes: square (SQ), semicircle (SC) and trapezoid (TR) were considered. Enhancements were compared with the no-dent (ND) called as the base case. The voltage to current relation was modeled using the Tafel equation. This provided the distribution of current density at a prescribed cell voltage. The computations were performed at 333K, 100,000Pa, water dew point temperature 313K, and 50% utilization within the range of 0.2–0.8V. It was predicted that the flow turns to be two-phase in high current density regions (say cell voltages less than 0.4V). To push the condensate out of the flow field, adequate pressure gradient were required. This prerequisite was already taken into account in this study. A parametric study considering the influences of dent heights and arrangements, exchange current density, fluid viscous resistance and rib sizes were considered providing enhancements over 25% in the net power. The present study gives a very helpful guideline for flow field manufactures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3adewpoint 3aelectric power 3aequations 3afuel cells 3aguidelines 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3awater vapor 0aCFD 0aChannel partial blockage (indentation) 0aFuel cells 0aPerformance enhancements 0aParametric study1 aKermani, M.J.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2016 Feb. 15, v. 110 p.356-366dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2015.12.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245015400163500002200317500001500339520113300354592002801487650001401515650001301529650002001542650002501562650001601587650001201603650001501615650001801630650001001648650002201658650001501680650001901695650001701714653000901731653002301740653002501763653001701788653001901805653003001824700001601854700001801870700001501888700001601903773006801919856008101987852000902068655001202077IND60570851420221120100826.0170709s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057085142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2017.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Yan-Xia10aNanomolar sensitive colorimetric assay for Mn2+ using cysteic acid-capped silver nanoparticles and theoretical investigation of its sensing mechanism  aPre-press version  a2019-12-06  aA new facile, rapid, sensitive and selective colorimetric assay is proposed for the determination of manganese ions (Mn2+) utilizing cysteic acid (CA)-capped silver nanoparticles (CA-AgNPs) as colorimetric probes. The CA-AgNPs were prepared by reducing AgNO3 with NaBH4 in the presence of CA as the capping ligand. The presence of Mn2+ induces the quick aggregation of CA-AgNPs, associated with notable color changes of the CA-AgNPs solution from yellow to dark green. The Mn2+ can form a coordinated structure with CA capping on the AgNPs and leads to formation of large particles aggregation. We also used density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the change of the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of the interactions between the CA-AgNPs and various metal ions, which shows that CA-AgNPs have high specificity for Mn2+. The high sensitivity and selectivity for Mn2+ were achieved and the detection limit is as low as 5 nM. Furthermore, the proposed method was successfully applied in detecting Mn2+ in a rat model of focal ischemia and the results indicate that our proposed method has great potential for practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3amanganese 3aischemia 3adetection limit 3aanalytical chemistry 3acolorimetry 3aligands 3ananosilver 3aanimal models 3acolor 3aGibbs free energy 3ametal ions 3asilver nitrate 3acysteic acid 0aions 0aColorimetric assay 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aCysteic acid 0aManganese ions 0aDensity functional theory1 aQu, Zhi-bei1 aWang, Qi-Xian1 aZhang, Min1 aShi, Guoyue0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2017.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245011500169300001800284500001100302520139200313592002801705650001601733650003001749650001601779650001701795650001801812650000901830650002001839650001901859650001901878650001401897650001301911650001801924700002501942700003501967700003102002700001702033700002002050700006702070700005902137773012402196856007402320852000902394655001202403IND60789109220221123004954.0220818e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078910922DNAL7 a10.1111/are.159762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Almeida, Eduarda Tayna10aMacrobrachium rosenbergii fed with essential oil from Lippia alba in the diet in low and high stocking density  ap. 4577-4587.  aREVIEW  aThis study aimed to examine the zootechnical performance, whole‐body composition, activity of digestive enzymes and histology of hepatopancreas of Macrobrachium rosenbergii fed diets incorporated with essential oil from Lippia alba (EOLA) in low (LSD ‐ 50 prawns m⁻²) and high (HSD ‐ 100 prawns m⁻²) stocking density. Three diets were formulated; each containing increasing levels of EOLA (0.00 [control], 0.5 and 1.0%) in triplicate for 70 days. Water quality, survival and growth did not differ between treatments. Crude protein was higher in prawns that received 0.5% EOLA in HSD than in LSD. The ethereal extract was higher in prawns in LSD than in HSD fed with EOLA. In addition, the ethereal extract was higher in animals fed diets with 1.0 than 0.0% EOLA in LSD. Prawns that received 0.0 and 1.0% EOLA, respectively, had significantly higher chymotrypsin and alkaline protease activity. In general, the activity of digestive enzymes increased in prawns fed with EOLA in HSD. Histological analyses of the hepatopancreas in all treatments proved to be healthy. In conclusion, the digestive enzymatic activity and crude protein were higher in HSD than in LSD, indicating that EOLA added to the diet is more critical for prawns reared in HSD. In addition, the intensive production of M. rosenbergii can be optimized in HSD (100 prawns m⁻²) with 1.0% EOLA in the diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLippia alba 3aMacrobrachium rosenbergii 3aaquaculture 3achymotrypsin 3acrude protein 3adiet 3aenzyme activity 3aessential oils 3ahepatopancreas 3ahistology 3aresearch 3awater quality1 aCorreia, Eudes Souza1 ado Nascimento, Carlos Henrique1 ade Souza Bezerra, Ranilson1 aCahu, Thiago1 aChung, Samantha1 aCopatti, Carlos Eduardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0114-03341 aRibeiro, Karina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7992-97170 tAquaculture research.g2022 Sept., v. 53, no. 13 p.4577-4587dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.159763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02261naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245010900168300001600277520104000293592002801333650002301361650001401384650002401398650001101422650002401433650001701457650001901474650002201493650001001515650002401525650001701549650001201566700002701578700002101605700001901626773012801645856008101773852000901854655001201863IND4469487720221117161345.0141112e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446948772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2011.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakkalbaşı, Emre10aEffects of packaging materials, storage conditions and variety on oxidative stability of shelled walnuts  ap. 203-209.  aThe effects of storage temperature, oxygen permeability of packaging material and variety on oxidative stability of vacuum-packaged walnut kernels were studied over a 12 months storage period. The oxidation experiments applied to two popular walnut varieties (Yalova-1 and Yalova-3) grown in Turkey. The peroxide values and hexanal contents of walnut samples significantly increased (p < 0.01) during storage at 30 °C. The highest hexanal content (4464.5–6406.9 μg/kg) were observed in Yalova-3 variety stored at 30 °C for 12 months in Polyamide/Polyethylene film pouches (oxygen permeability: 63.4 ± 0.4 mL/m²/24 h (23 °C)) with 90 μm total thickness. The effect of storage temperature and variety on lipid oxidation was found to be higher than the effect of oxygen permeability of the packaging material. It was concluded that for vacuum-packed walnut kernels in PA/PE film pouches having 63.4 ± 0.4 mL/m²/24 h (23 °C) oxygen permeability, 20 °C is sufficient to protect against oxidation for 12 months.  aPublisher supplied data 3alipid peroxidation 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3aoxygen 3apackaging materials 3apermeability 3aperoxide value 3apolyethylene film 3aseeds 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3awalnuts1 aYılmaz, Özay Menteş1 aJavidipour, Issa1 aArtık, Nevzat0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2012 Apr., v. 46, no. 1 p.203-209dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2011.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02072naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008500172300001600257500002900273520085600302592002801158650001401186650001701200650001801217650002301235650002101258650001101279650001801290653003301308653002701341653003201368653001101400653001401411700002701425700001901452773010901471856008501580852000901665655001201674IND60688884020221120073902.0200417e20151003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068888402DNAL7 a10.1080/09614524.2015.10732242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWetterberg, Anna10aFrom compliant to capable: balanced capacity development for local organisations  ap. 966-985.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aHow to strengthen local capacity through donor-funded projects remains opaque.

Some strengthened capacity, but improvements were concentrated in capabilities related to complying with donors’ requirements rather than capabilities enhancing performance.

Functional optical imaging techniques are advantageous to visualize the activation of these modules in sensory cortices with high spatial resolution. In this context, endogenous optical signals that arise from molecular mechanisms linked to neuroenergetics are valuable sources of contrast to record spatial maps of sensory stimuli over wide fields in the rodent brain. Here, we present two techniques based on changes of endogenous optical properties of the brain tissue during activation. First the intrinsic optical signals (IOS) are produced by a local alteration in red light reflectance due to: (i) absorption by changes in blood oxygenation level and blood volume (ii) photon scattering. The use of in vivo IOS to record spatial maps started in the mid 1980's with the observation of optical maps of whisker barrels in the rat and the orientation columns in the cat visual cortex1. IOS imaging of the surface of the rodent main olfactory bulb (OB) in response to odorants was later demonstrated by Larry Katz's group2. The second approach relies on flavoprotein autofluorescence signals (FAS) due to changes in the redox state of these mitochondrial metabolic intermediates. More precisely, the technique is based on the green fluorescence due to oxidized state of flavoproteins when the tissue is excited with blue light. Although such signals were probably among the first fluorescent molecules recorded for the study of brain activity by the pioneer studies of Britton Chances and colleagues3, it was not until recently that they have been used for mapping of brain activation in vivo. FAS imaging was first applied to the somatosensory cortex in rodents in response to hindpaw stimulation by Katsuei Shibuki's group4. The olfactory system is of central importance for the survival of the vast majority of living species because it allows efficient detection and identification of chemical substances in the environment (food, predators). The OB is the first relay of olfactory information processing in the brain. It receives afferent projections from the olfactory primary sensory neurons that detect volatile odorant molecules. Each sensory neuron expresses only one type of odorant receptor and neurons carrying the same type of receptor send their nerve processes to the same well-defined microregions of ˜100μm3 constituted of discrete neuropil, the olfactory glomerulus (Fig. 1). In the last decade, IOS imaging has fostered the functional exploration of the OB5, 6, 7 which has become one of the most studied sensory structures. The mapping of OB activity with FAS imaging has not been performed yet. Here, we show the successive steps of an efficient protocol for IOS and FAS imaging to map odor-evoked activities in the mouse OB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3ablood 3ablood volume 3ablue light 3acerebral cortex 3aflavoproteins 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3amice 3amitochondria 3anerve tissue 3aodor compounds 3aodorant receptors 3aolfactory bulb 3aoxidation 3aphotons 3apredators 3arats 3ared light 3areflectance 3asensory neurons1 aL'Heureux, Barbara1 aBendahmane, Mounir1 aRenaud, Rémi1 aMartin, Claire1 aPain, Frédéric1 aGurden, Hirac0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2011 Oct. 31, , no. 56 p.e3336-e3336dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/33363Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/3336/imaging-odor-evoked-activities-mouse-olfactory-bulb-using-optical  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245007900173300001200252520112100264592002801385650001801413650002001431650003101451650001801482650001301500650001601513650001201529650001301541650000901554650002601563650001301589650001701602653001001619653001701629653001001646700001601656700002501672700005601697773010801753856008601861852000901947655001201956IND60692566320221121024605.0200621e20200720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069256632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2020.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShandilya, Shruti10aNatural ligand-receptor mediated loading of siRNA in milk derived exosomes  ap. 1-9.  asiRNA based therapeutics have become the next frontier in molecular medicine. Though exosomes emerge as a promising drug delivery vehicle for siRNAs, significant hurdle remains in finding safe and effective loading methods. Traditional methods of loading exogenous siRNAs in exosomes are marked by certain limitations like siRNA aggregation, toxicity to the cells and their high experimental cost. As an electroporation and lipofection free approach, we show that the molecular conjugate of bovine lactoferrin with polyl-l-ysine electrostatically interacts with negatively charged siRNA, wherein lactoferrin as a ligand is captured by the GAPDH present in exosomes, loading siRNA in an effortless manner. This method exhibited transfection efficiency, colocalization percentage and colocalization threshold similar to electroporation. Furthermore, efficient uptake of exosomes loaded with siRNA via conjugate in recipient cells was observed. Our current study univocally establishes chemical free and non-mechanical method for the encapsulation and intercellular delivery of siRNA for wider therapeutic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug carriers 3aelectroporation 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aencapsulation 3aexosomes 3alactoferrin 3aligands 3amedicine 3amilk 3asmall interfering RNA 3atoxicity 3atransfection 0asiRNA 0aPoly-l-ysine 0aGAPDH1 aRani, Payal1 aOnteru, Suneel Kumar1 aSingh, Dheer1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2686-07300 tJournal of biotechnology.g2020 July 20, v. 318 p.1-9dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46789x0168-16567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2020.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245016400165520133500329592002801664650002501692650001601717650001301733650002001746650002601766650001701792650001301809653002101822653003901843653003101882653002601913653001801939700001601957700001601973700001701989700001402006700001402020700002002034700001802054700001602072700001502088700001502103700001602118700001602134700001502150773009102165856008602256852000902342655001202351IND60725869320221116163644.0220124e20210501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072586932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1221262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLugli, F.10aNear-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) and normalized difference image (NDI) data processing: An advanced method to map collagen in archaeological bones  aIn the present study, an innovative and highly efficient near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) method is proposed to provide spectral maps able to reveal collagen distribution in large-size bones, also offering semi-quantitative estimations. A recently introduced method for the construction of chemical maps, based on Normalized Difference Images (NDI), is declined in an innovative approach, through the exploitation of the NDI values computed for each pixel of the hyperspectral image to localize collagen and to extract information on its content by a direct comparison with known reference samples. The developed approach addresses an urgent issue of the analytical chemistry applied to bioarcheology researches, which rely on well-preserved collagen in bones to obtain key information on chronology, paleoecology and taxonomy. Indeed, the high demand for large-sample datasets and the consequent application of a wide variety of destructive analytical methods led to the considerable destruction of precious bone samples. NIR-HSI pre-screening allows researchers to properly select the sampling points for subsequent specific analyses, to minimize costs and time and to preserve integrity of archaeological bones (which are available in a very limited amount), providing further opportunities to understand our past.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aarchaeology 3acollagen 3adata collection 3ahyperspectral imagery 3apaleoecology 3ataxonomy 0aChemical mapping 0aNormalized difference images (NDI) 0aNear-infrared spectroscopy 0aHyperspectral imaging 0aAncient bones1 aSciutto, G.1 aOliveri, P.1 aMalegori, C.1 aPrati, S.1 aGatti, L.1 aSilvestrini, S.1 aRomandini, M.1 aCatelli, E.1 aCasale, M.1 aTalamo, S.1 aIacumin, P.1 aBenazzi, S.1 aMazzeo, R.0 tTalanta.g2021 May 01, v. 226 p.122126-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1221263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03320naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005500152245011600207300001600323520190100339592002802240650001302268650001202281650001202293650001902305650002002324650001502344650001102359650001302370650002902383650002002412650001502432650002702447650001102474653001502485653002602500653002602526653002802552700001602580700001702596700005302613773010102666856008602767852000902853655001202862IND60565500920221120060327.0170410e20160215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056550092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2015.12.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalloni, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2403-396910aPerformance analyses of a spark-ignition engine firing with gasoline–butanol blends at partial load operation  ap. 319-326.  aBiofuels seem to represent one of the most promising means for the limitation of the greenhouse gas emissions coming from traditional energy systems.In this paper, the performance of a “downsized” spark-ignition engine, fueled by gasoline and bio-butanol blends (20% and 40% butanol mass percentage), has been analyzed.In the first phase of this activity, the experimental tests have been carried out at operating points ranging from low to medium engine speed and load.The first investigations were aimed to assess the main differences among the different fuels in terms of output torque, thermal efficiency, combustion duration and optimal spark timing. In order to study the engine behavior in a wide range of fuel mixtures, these parameters have been evaluated for equivalence ratio values ranging from 1.25 to 0.83.The results obtained in this step show that both the engine torque and thermal efficiency slightly decrease (meanly about 4%) when the blend alcohol content increases. However, butanol increases the burning rate of lean mixtures and an interesting result is that the spark advance does not require adjustments when fueling changes from neat gasoline to bio-butanol/gasoline blends.Later, the pollutant emissions and the CO2 emissions, for both rich and lean mixtures of pure gasoline and gasoline bio-butanol blends, have been measured. In general, firing with alcohol blends, NOx and CO emissions remain quite the same, HC emissions slightly decrease while the CO2 emissions slightly increase.At the end, in order to reproduce the real world urban driving cycle, stoichiometric mixtures have been analyzed. In these conditions, the engine thermal efficiency, at given speed and torque, has been evaluated for each kind of fueling. The results obtained in these operating points have shown that the alcohol blend fueling performs an efficiency penalty less than 2 percent.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3aburning 3abutanol 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion 3aenergy 3agasoline 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3anitrogen oxides 3apollutants 3aspark ignition engines 3atorque 0aBiobutanol 0aSpark ignition engine 0aExperimental analysis 0aEngine map optimization1 aFontana, G.1 aStaccone, S.1 aScala, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3805-91820 tEnergy conversion and management.g2016 Feb. 15, v. 110 p.319-326dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2015.12.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01490naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245011400128300001400242500001900256520062200275592002800897650001100925650002300936650001800959650001200977650001800989700001801007700001901025773014701044852000901191655001201200IND60705221120221119042429.0201107e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070522112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarg, Sunil10aManagement of Groundwater Quality in Sodic Soils using Semi-analytical One-dimensional Solute Transport Model  ap. 52-55.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA semi-analytical one-dimensional solute transport model to manage and predict groundwater quality was tested for its application in Golewala, Punjab.

To assist managers in the semiconductor industry with economic and environmental management, this study executes DuPont analysis to examine economic impacts from the effective implementation of sustainability initiatives. We propose a two-stage process including economic development efficiency and environmental protection efficiency through the dynamic data envelopment analysis (DDEA) to reflect the characteristics of eco-efficiency. Through DuPont analysis, the main finding shows the potential improvement in firms’ return on equity (ROE) by efficiently utilizing assets to generate sales quickly.Relative to economic development efficiency, the firms show lower scores and higher standard deviations in the environmental protection ability, thus denoting a large gap in the level of environmental protection production technology. The findings in this study reveal that the financial foundations and sustainable development of industries should be improved simultaneously even though specific levels of semiconductor industrial eco-efficiency improvement vary among companies in Taiwan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3abusiness enterprises 3aeco-efficiency 3aeconomic impact 3aenvironmental protection 3aindustry 3aproduction technology 3asales 3asemiconductors 3astandard deviation 3asustainable development 3aTaiwan1 aLin, Sheng-Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3496-45801 aLu, Wen-Min0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2019 July, v. 191, no. 7 p.435-435dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-019-7598-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04101naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001700167245012900184300001600313500001500329520199900344592002802343650002602371650001102397650002102408650001802429650001402447650002102461650002002482650001702502650002502519650002102544650001202565650004402577650003902621650001402660650001702674650004502691650002602736650000902762650004302771650003302814650001302847650004302860650002602903650004002929650003802969650004103007650001703048653001303065700002103078700002103099700001603120700001703136700002503153700002103178700002003199700002403219773009103243856008403334852000903418655001203427IND4470745920221117174445.0141112e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447074592DNAL7 a223484602pmid7 a10.1016/j.nutres.2011.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamada, Kana10aRare sugar d-allose strongly induces thioredoxin-interacting protein and inhibits osteoclast differentiation in Raw264 cells  ap. 116-123.  a2019-12-06  aOxidative stress modulates the osteoclast differentiation via redox systems, and thioredoxin 1 (Trx) promotes the osteoclast formation by regulating the activity of transcription factors. The function of Trx is known to be regulated by its binding partner, thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP). We previously reported that the expression of TXNIP gene is strongly induced by a rare sugar d-allose. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that d-allose could inhibit the osteoclast differentiation by regulating the Trx function. We used a murine Raw264 cell line that differentiates to the osteoclast by the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) treatment. The effect of sugars was evaluated by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining. The expression and localization of TXNIP and Trx protein were examined by Western blotting and immunohistochemisty. The activity of the nuclear factor-κB, nuclear factor of activated T cells, and activator protein 1 transcription factors was measured by the luciferase reporter assay. The addition of d-allose (25 mmol/L) inhibited the osteoclast differentiation down to 9.53% ± 1.27% of a receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand–only treatment. During the osteoclast differentiation, a significant increase of TNXIP was observed by d-allose treatment. The immunohistochemical analysis showed that both Trx and TXNIP existed in the nucleus in preosteoclasts and osteoclasts. Overexpression of TXNIP by plasmid transfection also inhibited the osteoclast formation, indicating the functional importance of TXNIP for the osteoclast differentiation. Transcriptional activity of the activator protein 1, nuclear factor-κB, and nuclear factor of activated T cells, known to be modulated by Trx, were inhibited by d-allose. In conclusion, our data indicate that d-allose is a strong inhibitor of the osteoclast differentiation, and this effect could be caused by TXNIP induction and a resulting inhibition of the Trx function.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factors 3asugars 3aacid phosphatase 3aT-lymphocytes 3areceptors 3aWestern blotting 3agene expression 3atransfection 3acell differentiation 3aoxidative stress 2aAnimals 2aCarrier Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Differentiationxdrug effects 2aCell Line 2aCell Nucleus 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aGlucosexpharmacology 2aMice 2aOsteoclastsxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aOxidative Stressxphysiology 2aPlasmids 2aRANK Ligandxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aStaining and Labeling 2aThioredoxinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription Factorsxmetabolism 2aTranscription, Geneticxdrug effects 2aTransfection 0aproteins1 aNoguchi, Chisato1 aKamitori, Kazuyo1 aDong, Youyi1 aHirata, Yuko1 aHossain, Mohammad A.1 aTsukamoto, Ikuko1 aTokuda, Masaaki1 aYamaguchi, Fuminori0 tNutrition research.g2012 Feb., v. 32, no. 2 p.116-123dElsevier Inc.x0271-53177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2011.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245010500202300001800307520112900325592002801454596012401482650003801606650002001644650002101664650001301685650001901698650001901717650001201736650002201748650002201770650001501792650002001807653001701827653002601844653001901870653003301889653003101922700001601953700001901969700001701988773014802005856008102153852000902234655001202243IND60775683220221121220231.0220427e20220415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077568322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.2c001312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Yongwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4687-108510aPhytopathogens Increase the Preference of Insect Vectors to Volatiles Emitted by Healthy Host Plants  ap. 5262-5269.  aPhytopathogen infections not only affect the physiology of host plants but also the preference of insect vectors; these modifications may increase the spread of infection. For this, we determined the effects of “Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus” (CLas) infection on the preference of an insect vector (Diaphorina citri) for its uninfected or CLas-infected host (Citrus sinensis) and found that the infected vector preferred uninfected citrus, while the uninfected vector preferred infected citrus. We identified two compounds, (Z)-3 hexenyl and methyl salicylate, that were differentially abundant in the volatiles emitted by infected and uninfected citrus and two odorant-binding protein (OBP) genes differentially expressed between infected and uninfected vectors. The results of receptor–ligand binding assays indicated that CLas upregulated OBP A10 expression in the infected vector to target (Z)-3 hexenyl acetate emitted by uninfected citrus and induced citrus to emit more methyl salicylate for binding to OBP2 in the uninfected vector. Our results might be useful for the effective control of CLas infections.  aPublisher supplied data  aJAT201270cFujian Province Young and Middle-Aged Teachers Education and Scientific Research Projectdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aCandidatus Liberibacter asiaticus 3aCitrus sinensis 3aDiaphorina citri 3aacetates 3afood chemistry 3ainsect vectors 3aligands 3amethyl salicylate 3aodorant receptors 3aphysiology 3aplant pathogens 0acitrus plant 0ahuanglongbing disease 0aRNA sequencing 0aprincipal component analysis 0afluorescence binding assay1 aHuang, Jing1 aAkutse, Komivi1 aHou, Youming0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2022 Apr. 15, v. 70, no. 16 p.5262-5269dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.2c001313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03933naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002700175245005400202300001400256520231100270592002802581650002102609650001202630650001402642650001702656650001302673650002002686650001502706650002302721650001102744650001502755650003702770650001302807650001102820650005302831650001402884650001102898650001402909650001402923650002402937650003602961700002202997700002203019700001903041773014903060856006803209856008203277990002303359852000903382655001203391IND60643327120221118002619.0190510e20111116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064332712DNAL7 a10.3791/33372doi7 aPMC33086032pmcid7 a221269712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaber, Hildegonda P.H.10aSpheroid assay to measure tgf-β-induced invasion  ap. e3337.  aTGF-β has opposing roles in breast cancer progression by acting as a tumor suppressor in the initial phase, but stimulating invasion and metastasis at later stage1,2. Moreover, TGF-β is frequently overexpressed in breast cancer and its expression correlates with poor prognosis and metastasis 3,4. The mechanisms by which TGF-β induces invasion are not well understood. TGF-β elicits its cellular responses via TGF-β type II (TβRII) and type I (TβRI) receptors. Upon TGF-β-induced heteromeric complex formation, TβRII phosphorylates the TβRI. The activated TβRI initiates its intracellular canonical signaling pathway by phosphorylating receptor Smads (R-Smads), i.e. Smad2 and Smad3. These activated R-Smads form heteromeric complexes with Smad4, which accumulate in the nucleus and regulate the transcription of target genes5. In addition to the previously described Smad pathway, receptor activation results in activation of several other non-Smad signaling pathways, for example Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathways6. To study the role of TGF-β in different stages of breast cancer, we made use of the MCF10A cell system. This system consists of spontaneously immortalized MCF10A1 (M1) breast epithelial cells7, the H-RAS transformed M1-derivative MCF10AneoT (M2), which produces premalignant lesions in mice8, and the M2-derivative MCF10CA1a (M4), which was established from M2 xenografts and forms high grade carcinomas with the ability to metastasize to the lung9. This MCF10A series offers the possibility to study the responses of cells with different grades of malignancy that are not biased by a different genetic background. For the analysis of TGF-β-induced invasion, we generated homotypic MCF10A spheroid cell cultures embedded in a 3D collagen matrix in vitro (Fig 1). Such models closely resemble human tumors in vivo by establishing a gradient of oxygen and nutrients, resulting in active and invasive cells on the outside and quiescent or even necrotic cells in the inside of the spheroid10. Spheroid based assays have also been shown to better recapitulate drug resistance than monolayer cultures11. This MCF10 3D model system allowed us to investigate the impact of TGF-β signaling on the invasive properties of breast cells in different stages of malignancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3abreasts 3acarcinoma 3acell culture 3acollagen 3adrug resistance 3aepithelium 3agenetic background 3ahumans 3ametastasis 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amitogens 3amodels 3amothers against decapentaplegic homolog proteins 3anutrients 3aoxygen 3aprognosis 3areceptors 3asignal transduction 3atransforming growth factor beta1 aWiercinska, Eliza1 aDijke, Peter ten,1 avan Laar, Theo0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2011 Nov. 16, , no. 57 p.e3337-e3337dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/33373Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/3337/spheroid-assay-to-measure-tgf-induced-invasion  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03905naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245014800212300001400360520212500374592002802499650002302527650002502550650001902575650002102594650002402615650001702639650004302656650002302699650002602722650001402748653000802762653000802770653000802778653000802786653000802794653000802802653000902810653000802819653000702827653000802834653000802842653000802850653000802858653001302866653000902879653000802888653000802896653002802904653002902932653002302961653001802984653002403002700006003026773011003086856008603196852000903282655001203291IND60692566520221121024638.0200523e20200620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069256652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2020.04.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndris, Sebastian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1587-247X10aModeling of hydrophobic interaction chromatography for the separation of antibody-drug conjugates and its application towards quality by design  ap. 48-58.  aAntibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are hybrid molecules based on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with covalently attached cytotoxic small-molecule drugs. Due to their potential for targeted cancer therapy, they form part of the diversifying pipeline of various biopharmaceutical companies, in addition to currently seven commercial ADCs. With other new modalities, ADCs contribute to the increasing complexity of biopharmaceutical development in times of growing costs and competition. Another challenge is the implementation of quality by design (QbD), which receives a lot of attention. In order to answer these challenges, mechanistic models are gaining interest as tools for enhanced process understanding and efficient process development. The drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) is a critical quality attribute (CQA) of ADCs. After the conjugation reaction, the DAR can still be adjusted by including a hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) step. In this work, we developed a mechanistic model for the preparative separation of cysteine-engineered mAbs with different degrees of conjugation with a non-toxic surrogate drug. The model was successfully validated for varying load compositions with linear and optimized step gradient runs, applying conditions differing from the calibration runs. In two in silico studies, we then present scenarios for how the model can be applied profitably to ensure a more robust achievement of the target DAR and for the efficient characterization of the design space. For this, we also used the model in a linkage study with a kinetic reaction model developed by us previously. The combination of the two models effectively widens system boundaries over two adjacent process steps. We believe this work has great potential to help advance the incorporation of digital tools based on mechanistic models in ADC process development by illustrating their capabilities for efficient process development and increased robustness. Mechanistic models can support the implementation of QbD and eventually might be the basis for digital process twins able to represent multiple unit operations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopharmaceuticals 3abusiness enterprises 3acancer therapy 3achemical bonding 3acomputer simulation 3acytotoxicity 3ahydrophobic interaction chromatography 3amechanistic models 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aneoplasms 0aADC 0aASA 0aCQA 0aDAR 0aDBC 0aDHA 0aDMSO 0aHIC 0aIS 0aIPA 0amAb 0aNAC 0aQbD 0aRP-UHPLC 0aTCEP 0aTDM 0aTFA 0aChromatography modeling 0aAntibody- drug conjugate 0aProcess robustness 0aModel linkage 0aProcess development1 aHubbuch, Jürgen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6258-41260 tJournal of biotechnology.g2020 June 20, v. 317 p.48-58dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46789x0168-16567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2020.04.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245008500208300001600293500001500309520090200324592002801226650000901254650001101263650002501274650001501299650001201314650001301326653002101339653001501360653003201375653001801407653002301425700001301448700001701461700001801478700001501496700001701511773010101528856008601629852000901715655001201724IND60565501120221120043359.0170410e20160215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056550112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2015.12.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Peilun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0042-432710aNumerical investigation of PCM melting process in sleeve tube with internal fins  ap. 428-435.  a2019-12-06  aDue to the poor thermal conductivity of the Phase Change Materials (PCMs), heat transfer performance of Latent Thermal Energy Storage (LTES) systems is usually unsatisfactory.

Striking differences are observed in the species richness, number of clades and functional diversity of termite assemblage between different habitats. This study aim was to examine effect of human interference in the diversity of wood destroying termite in forest areas as well as managed and unmanaged plantations in South India. Termites attacking trees and wooden logs were collected from forest areas, managed plantations and unmanaged plantations. The termites collected were identified and compared for species abundance, richness and species diversity. Results show that the species composition and species diversity of the wood destroying termites vary according to the conditions. The species diversity measures revealed that there is a significance variation among the forest fauna and plantations. The forest areas have the highest species composition compared to plantations. Species richness is high forest areas. Even though the abundance of termites are more in unmanaged plantations, there is no significant difference related to species diversity among the managed and unmanaged plantations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIsoptera 3afauna 3aforests 3afunctional diversity 3ahabitats 3aland use 3aplantations 3aspecies diversity 3awood logs 3aIndia1 aSundararaj, R.0 tJournal of forestry research.g2013 June, v. 24, no. 2 p.361-364dSpringer-Verlagx1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-013-0361-x  aDNAL 7aarticle01339naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245006700128300001400195500001900209520051500228592002800743650002800771650002000799650001200819650001400831650001800845700001700863700001300880773014700893852000901040655001201049IND60705221420221119042325.0201107e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070522142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, K.P.10aDesign, Development and Evaluation of Barnyard Millet Dehuller  ap. 17-25.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBarnyard millet (Echinochloa frumentacea L.), is presently dehulled manually.

The results confirmed that sniffing OEO could reduce obesity caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) by reducing the levels of triglycerides (TGs), total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). In addition, the observation of liver tissue sections showed that sniffing OEO could reduce lipid accumulation in liver cells. Further analysis by western blot analysis showed that OEO treatment made the expression levels of acetyl–CoA carboxylase (ACC) and Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) down-regulated and the expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) up-regulated. These results indicate that the treatment of sniffing OEO could enhance the antioxidant capacity of mice and reduce liver damage caused by a high-fat diet. Furthermore, sniffing OEO could inhibit lipid synthesis and oxidative stress stimulated by a high-fat diet. Overall, OEO treatment had a certain protective effect on NAFLD-related diseases caused by a high-fat diet. Therefore, aromatherapy may be introduced as a treatment of long-term chronic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3aantioxidant activity 3acarnitine 3acytochrome P-450 3aessential oils 3afatty liver 3ahigh fat diet 3aliver 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3aobesity 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect1 aLi, Min1 aLi, Xiao1 aZhang, Na-Wei1 aHu, Hui-Yan1 aZhang, Lu-Lu1 aRen, Jing-Nan1 aFan, Gang1 aPan, Si-Yi0 tFood & function.g2022 Jan. 24, v. 13, no. 2 p.933-943dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo03793e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03673naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245008100166300001100247520245400258592002802712650001002740650001002750650002702760650001302787650001402800650001102814650002602825650002502851650001102876650001602887650001902903650001702922650001702939650001102956650002002967650001602987650001703003700003003020700002103050773010203071856004503173852000903218655001203227IND50064045720221119182725.0140227e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006404572DNAL7 a10.1186/2190-4715-25-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEbke, Klaus Peter10aImpact of heterophylly on the sensitivity of Myriophyllum aquaticum biotests  ap. 83.  aBACKGROUND: Parrot feather (Myriophyllum aquaticum) is an amphibious macrophyte with an inducible heterophylly. M. aquaticum plants adapted to the emersed state have leaves with a distinct cuticle and water repellent properties. In contrast M. aquaticum plants adapted to the submerged state have leaves typical for submerged hydrophytes with a strongly reduced cuticle. The aim of the study was to evaluate if this heterophylly of M. aquaticum affects the results of macrophyte biotests. Therefore, the two model substances atrazine and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were tested each with three M. aquaticum biotests, the only modified parameter being the adaptation time to submergence (0, 7, 28 days). RESULTS: Root length was the most sensitive growth endpoint regarding the test substances atrazine and 2,4-D. Biotests with plants adapted to the submerged state show three times more sensitive results (EC50₇d 142.2 μg/L, EC50₂₈d 154.5 μg/L) than biotests with plants without an adaptation phase (EC50₀d 458.8 μg/L) in case of atrazine and five times more sensitive results (EC50₂₈d 46.9 μg/L, EC50₀d 246.3 μg/L) in case of 2,4-D. Apart from the differences in sensitivity, the differently adapted M. aquaticum plants show a completely different growth behavior. The growth rates based on shoot length were nearly ten times higher in the biotests with not adapted M. aquaticum plants than in the biotests with plants 28 days adapted to submergence. Additional measurements of the quantum yield of PSII could demonstrate that rapid growth in length is not based on photosynthetic carbon assimilation. CONCLUSIONS: The heterophylly of M. aquaticum affects significantly the sensitivity of aquatic macrophyte biotests and should be taken into account in the development of a standardized test design. The 2,4-D results show the importance of an additional macrophyte biotest to the Lemna test, where the no observed effect concentration (NOEC) value is more than 30 times lower (7 μg/L) than the NOEC value of Lemna in the literature (270 μg/L). Furthermore, the growth rate endpoint in macrophyte biotests should not be misinterpreted. Rapid shoot elongation of amphibious macrophytes, which become submerged, is mainly caused by ethylene-triggered endogenous processes that are not connected to photosynthetic carbon assimilation and appear to be part of a stress reaction to avoid adverse environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aLemna 3aMyriophyllum aquaticum 3aatrazine 3abioassays 3acarbon 3aenvironmental factors 3aherbicide resistance 3aleaves 3amacrophytes 3aphotosystem II 3aplant growth 3aplant stress 3ashoots 3astress response 3asubmergence 3awater stress1 aFelten, Ch.q(Christian),1 aDören, László0 tEnvironmental sciences Europe.g2013 Dec., v. 25, no. 1 p.83-83dSpringer-Verlagx2190-47077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2190-4715-25-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02152naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245007600163300001800239520108000257592002801337650002501365650001201390650001201402650001201414650001601426650001401442650001401456650004401470650001801514650002001532650001301552650000901565700002201574773009801596856007501694852000901769655001201778IND60576548420221121230906.0170804e20120522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057654842DNAL7 a10.1021/la300885u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrindley, Amanda
J.10aEffect of Divalent Cations on DMPC/DHPC Bicelle Formation and Alignment  ap. 7788-7796.  aMany important classes of biomolecules require divalent cations for optimal activity, making these ions essential for biologically relevant structural studies. Bicelle mixtures composed of short-chain and long-chain lipids are often used in solution- and solid-state NMR structure determination; however, the phase diagrams of these useful orienting media and membrane mimetics are sensitive to other solution components. Therefore, we have investigated the effect of varying concentrations of four divalent cations, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Zn²⁺, and Cd²⁺, on cholesterol sulfate-stabilized DMPC/DHPC bicelles. We found that low concentrations of all the divalent ions are tolerated with minimal perturbation. At higher concentrations Zn²⁺ and Cd²⁺ disrupt the magnetically aligned phase while Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ produce more strongly oriented phases. This result indicates that divalent cations are not only required to maintain the biological activity of proteins and nucleic acids; they may also be used to manipulate the behavior of the magnetically aligned phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acations 3acholesterol 3amagnesium 3amagnetism 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anucleic acids 3aphysical phases 3aproteins 3azinc1 aMartin, Rachel W.0 tLangmuir.g2012 May 22, v. 28, no. 20 p.7788-7796dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla300885u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245006400173300001600237520101600253592002801269650001701297650002601314650001501340650001001355650002901365650002201394650002101416653003301437653003901470653002801509653003301537653002601570700002201596700002101618700002101639773009601660856008401756852000901840655001201849IND60605008820221118190132.0180720e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060500882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2015.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBizzarri, Federico10aMonitoring performance and efficiency of photovoltaic parks  ap. 314-321.  aAn approach allowing the on-target computation of efficiency and yield of large (hundreds of kW), grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) parks is presented. An efficiency metric is used to trigger alarms and to plan maintenance interventions. An accurate simulation model of the system, that is capable of taking into account all relevant environmental variables, has been used to precisely determine the expected baseline performances. Measured and simulated power together with string current data are constantly updated and monitored and then processed by using a novel figure of merit (FOM), to define aggregate efficiency indices both at the overall park level and at single string level. Aggregate indices on strings narrow down the search for sub-performing elements and allow the determination, possibly in one day, of whether the entire PV system or one of its components is not performing as expected. A workflow based on this approach is introduced along with some case studies attesting its effectiveness.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aenvironmental factors 3amonitoring 3aparks 3arenewable energy sources 3asimulation models 3asolar collectors 0aPhotovoltaic park efficiency 0aPhotovoltaic park figures of merit 0aPhotovoltaic park model 0aPhotovoltaic park simulation 0aElectro-thermal model1 aBrambilla, Angelo1 aCaretta, Lorenzo1 aGuardiani, Carlo0 tRenewable energy.g2015 June, v. 78 p.314-321dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2015.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245013300160300001600293520090200309592002801211650001501239650001501254650000901269650001301278650001101291650001301302650002301315650002601338650001501364650001201379650001201391650001201403650001101415650000901426650001101435650001201446650001001458650001301468650001401481650000901495651001101504700002101515773012501536856007201661852000901733655001201742IND60547737520221121023728.0190513e20160725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054773752DNAL7 a10.5586/am.10752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaźmierska, Edyta10aContribution to the lichen biota of the Stawy Milickie nature reserve and its adjacent area (Lower Silesia, southwestern Poland)  ap. am.1075.  aThe paper presents the results of lichenological investigations conducted in the eastern part of the Stawy Milickie nature reserve and its buffer zone (Barycz Valley, southwestern Poland). The study area is a famous waterfowl refuge, consisting of several fishpond complexes, together with adjacent forests, meadows, and villages. In total 72 lichen taxa were recorded, growing on bark and branches of trees and shrubs, stumps, wood, soil, and anthropogenic rock substrates (mortar, concrete, bricks, etc.). Six species, namely Evernia prunastri, Flavoparmelia caperata, Hypogymnia tubulosa, Parmelina tiliacea, Physconia distorta, and Pleurosticta acetabulum, are threatened in Poland. As represented by single young thalli, they indicate the recent improvement of environmental conditions.

Methods and Results: The antibacterial and FRS activities of Sonoran propolis were determined by the broth microdilution method and the DPPH (1,1âdiphenylâ2âpicrylhydracyl) assay, respectively. Propolis samples had antibacterial activity against only Gramâpositive bacteria. The UP sample showed the highest antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus [minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) 100âÎ¼gâmlâ1] in a concentrationâdependent manner (UPâ>âCPâ>âPAP). Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), a UP propolis constituent, had very high growthâinhibitory activity towards Gramâpositive bacteria, particularly against S. aureus (MIC 0Â·1âmmolâlâ1). To our knowledge, this is the first study showing a strong antibacterial activity of CAPE against S. aureus. Additionally, propolis CP exhibited high FRS activity (86%âÂ±â0Â·3 at 100âÎ¼gâmlâ1) comparable with those of the reference antioxidants vitamin C (87Â·4%âÂ±â1Â·7 at 70âÎ¼molâlâ1) and BHT (66Â·07%âÂ±â0Â·76 at 140âÎ¼molâlâ1). The propolis compounds CAPE and rutin showed high FRS activity (90Â·4%âÂ±â0Â·2 and 88Â·5%âÂ±â0Â·8 at 70âÎ¼molâlâ1, respectively). Conclusions: Sonoran propolis UP and CAPE had strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus. In addition, propolis CP showed potent FRS activity comparable with those of vitamin C and BHT. Significance and Impact of the study: The strong antibacterial and antioxidant properties of Sonoran propolis and some of its constituents support further studies on the clinical applications of this natural bee product against S. aureus and several oxidative damageârelated diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApoidea 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3acaffeic acid 3aclinical trials 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apropolis 3arutin 3aMexico 3aSonoran Desert1 aNavarro, M.1 aAcosta, A.1 aAngulo, A.1 aDominguez, Z.1 aRobles, R.1 aRoblesâZepeda, R.1 aLugo, E.1 aGoycoolea, F.M.1 aVelazquez, E.F.1 aAstiazaran, H.1 aHernandez, J.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2007 Nov., v. 103, no. 5 p.1747-1756dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2007.03409.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003600151245010400187520159300291592002801884650001201912650001701924650001801941650001701959650001201976650002601988650001302014650003302027650001502060650001602075651001302091653002502104653002202129653001502151700002902166700003102195700003402226700002902260773010402289856008602393852000902479655001202488IND60750621920221118012017.0211009e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075062192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.1064172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Sally Deborah Pereira10aLandscape analysis in a municipality in the arc of deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest  aThe fight for the conservation of the Amazon region is anything but recent. Despite being one of the highest biodiversity assets in the world, it has undergone intense transformations of the landscape since the beginning of the anthropic “invasion” occupation. Changes in land use and occupation are observed for the municipality of Dom Eliseu, located in the zone characterized as the Arc of Deforestation. Given this premise, we designed this study to provide a quantitative understanding of forest fragmentation in the municipality of Dom Eliseu – PA. For this, cloud-free images from the TM (Landsat 5) and OLI (Landsat 8) sensors for 2008 and 2018 were used, respectively, for supervised classification of land use and land cover to identify the forest areas in the study area. The areas of each fragment were quantified and grouped into size classes, considering as very small (<5 ha), small (5–10 ha), medium (10–100 ha), and large (> 100 ha) fragments. The indexes used were area, edge, density and size, shape, and central. In total, 33,171 forest fragments were found in 2008, reduced to 32,385 in 2018, representing 42.71% of the forest cover area under study. Quantitative characterizations were made with groups of area indexes density and size, shape, and central area, the latter obtained for the distance of 100 m under edge effect. The area mapping infers that the forest fragments in the area are mainly found by very small fragments, smaller than 5 ha, indicating a high degree of forest fragmentation in this landscape during the two years under study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3abiodiversity 3adeforestation 3aedge effects 3aforests 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aland use 3aland use and land cover maps 3alandscapes 3aoccupations 3aAmazonia 0aForest fragmentation 0aLandscape metrics 0aDom Eliseu1 ados Santos, Suane Bastos1 aPereira, Paulo Cezar Gomes1 ada Silva Melo, Marcio Roberto1 aEugenio, Fernando Coelho0 tEcological engineering.g2021 Dec., v. 173 p.106417-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.1064173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245007000173520208000243592002802323650001202351650001502363650001602378650001102394650000902405650002002414650001202434650001202446650001102458650002202469650001902491650002402510653000902534653001002543653002702553653002102580653001402601653000902615653001502624773011102639856008202750852000902832655001202841IND60676573620221120055027.0200210e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067657362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2019.1115182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanhellemont, Quinten10aAutomated water surface temperature retrieval from Landsat 8/TIRS  aSatellite remote sensing of Land and Water Surface Temperature (L/WST) has many applications in studies of terrestrial and aquatic ecology. Retrieval of L/WST requires a well calibrated radiometer and an accurate atmospheric correction. In the present study, the performance of the Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS) on board Landsat 8 is evaluated for the retrieval of L/WST. libRadtran is used to retrieve atmospheric correction parameters based on atmospheric profiles of relative humidity and temperature from three global atmospheric models. Performance of single band retrievals is compared to typical MODTRAN results from the Atmospheric Correction Parameter Calculator (ACPC) and a split-window approach. A multi-temporal land masking method using imagery from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on board Landsat 8 is demonstrated, and is used to automatically classify imagery in the matchup dataset in three classes of cloud cover. Two sources of in situ data covering the Belgian Coastal Zone (BCZ) are used for validation of the L/WST product: (1) fixed locations in the Flemish Banks measurement network and (2) underway data from regular RV Belgica campaigns. In the present study the single band methods outperformed the split-window approach, and consistent retrievals are found for the MODTRAN and libRadtran simulations. Typical single band surface temperature retrievals in quasi cloud-free conditions have Root Mean Squared Differences (RMSD) of 0.7 K and 1 K for Bands 10 and 11 with low bias, depending on the method and atmospheric profile source. For imagery with scattered clouds, RMSD values increase to 1 K and 2 K respectively with an approximately 0.5 K cold bias, likely caused by cloud proximity. The calibration efforts combined into Collection 1 allows for accurate absolute surface temperature retrievals from B10 on Landsat 8/TIRS for homogeneous targets with known emissivity, such as liquid water. The method is adapted to global processing and can be used for Land Surface Temperature retrieval with a suitable source of emissivity data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aautomation 3acloud cover 3acoasts 3acold 3adata collection 3aecology 3aliquids 3amodels 3arelative humidity 3aremote sensing 3asurface temperature 0aLand 0aWater 0aAtmospheric correction 0aThermal infrared 0aLandsat 8 0aTIRS 0alibRadtran0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Feb., v. 237 p.111518-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.1115183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03444naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245014900204300001800353520128000371592002801651650002501679650002301704650001901727650001701746650000901763700005901772700001401831700001301845700001901858700005701877700001401934700002401948700005801972700001802030700001402048700001602062700001702078700005902095700001802154700005902172700001502231700005402246700001602300700005402316700005302370700001502423700001602438700001402454700001602468700001402484700005202498700001302550700001702563700001602580773012902596856008402725852000902809655001202818IND60743219320221119023212.0210707e20210624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074321932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c046252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGroves, K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9207-639210aReference Protocol to Assess Analytical Performance of Higher Order Structural Analysis Measurements: Results from an Interlaboratory Comparison  ap. 9041-9048.  aMeasurements of protein higher order structure (HOS) provide important information on stability, potency, efficacy, immunogenicity, and biosimilarity of biopharmaceuticals, with a significant number of techniques and methods available to perform these measurements. The comparison of the analytical performance of HOS methods and the standardization of the results is, however, not a trivial task, due to the lack of reference protocols and reference measurement procedures. Here, we developed a protocol to structurally alter and compare samples of somatropin, a recombinant biotherapeutic, and describe the results obtained by using a number of techniques, methods and in different laboratories. This, with the final aim to provide tools and generate a pool of data to compare and benchmark analytical platforms and define method sensitivity to structural changes. Changes in somatropin HOS, induced by the presence of zinc at increasing concentrations, were observed, both globally and at more localized resolution, across many of the methods utilized in this study and with different sensitivities, suggesting the suitability of the protocol to improve understanding of inter- and cross-platform measurement comparability and assess analytical performance as appropriate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiopharmaceuticals 3aimmunogenicity 3asomatotropin 3azinc1 aAshcroft, A.

To investigate the lubrication characteristics of the BS mucilage, a novel measuring system is designed, and an ultralow friction coefficient about 0.005 between the mucilage and glass surface has been obtained. It is found that the ultralow friction is closely related to the structure of mucilage and water molecules in the mucilage. The microstructure analysis indicates that the mucilage surrounding BS forms a kind of polysaccharide gel with many nanosheets. A possible lubrication mechanism is proposed that the formation of hydration layers among these polymer nanosheets with plenty of bonded water molecules causes the ultralow friction. The excellent lubrication property has a potential application for reducing the friction between a glossy pill coated with such layer of mucilage and people’s throats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrasenia schreberi 3aaquatic plants 3afriction 3agels 3aglass 3alubrication 3amicrostructure 3amucilages 3ananosheets 3apolymers1 aLiu, Yuhong1 aLuo, Jianbin1 aLiu, Pengxiao1 aZhang, Chenhui0 tLangmuir.g2012 May 22, v. 28, no. 20 p.7797-7802dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla300957v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245013000183300001600313520154900329592002801878650002501906650002001931650001801951650002601969650001801995650001502013650001802028650002302046650002302069650002202092650005102114650004802165650004702213650004802260700002102308700002202329700002002351700002302371773008302394856004802477852000902525655001202534IND50068750620221118233547.0130824e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006875062DNAL7 a237790012pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-013-1913-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, Yuji10aRedundant function of two Arabidopsis COPII components, AtSec24B and AtSec24C, is essential for male and female gametogenesis  ap. 561-575.  aAnterograde vesicle transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus is the start of protein transport through the secretory pathway, in which the transport is mediated by coat protein complex II (COPII)-coated vesicles. Therefore, most proteins synthesized on the endoplasmic reticulum are loaded as cargo into COPII vesicles. The COPII is composed of the small GTPase Sar1 and two types of protein complexes (Sec23/24 and Sec13/31). Of these five COPII components, Sec24 is thought to recognize cargo that is incorporated into COPII vesicles by directly interacting with the cargo. The Arabidopsis genome encodes three types of Sec24 homologs (AtSec24A, AtSec24B, and AtSec24C). The subcellular dynamics and function of AtSec24A have been characterized. The intracellular distributions and functions of other AtSec24 proteins are not known, and the functional differences among the three AtSec24s remain unclear. Here, we found that all three AtSec24s were expressed in similar parts of the plant body and showed the same subcellular localization pattern. AtSec24B knockout plant, but not AtSec24C knockdown plant, showed mild male sterility with reduction of pollen germination. Significant decrease of AtSec24B and AtSec24C expression affected male and female gametogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our results suggested that the redundant function of AtSec24B and AtSec24C is crucial for the development of plant reproductive cells. We propose that the COPII transport is involved in male and female gametogenesis in planta.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aGolgi apparatus 3acoat proteins 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agametogenesis 3agerm cells 3aplant anatomy 3aplant reproduction 3apollen germination 3aprotein transport 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCOP-Coated Vesiclesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGametogenesis, Plantxgeneticsxphysiology.1 aNishimura, Kohji1 aKawamukai, Makoto1 aOshima, Akinobu1 aNakagawa, Tsuyoshi0 tPlanta.g2013 Sept., v. 238, no. 3 p.561-575dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-013-1913-1  aDNAL 7aarticle01223naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010100155300001800256520029900274592002800573650001100601650001400612650001300626650001700639650001200656700001400668700001500682773014100697856007400838852000900912655001200921IND60668911720221121153807.0190920e20130528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066891172DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta11360d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, N.

Despite increasing efforts have been taken to develop methodology for measuring MMP-14 expression, there is a lack of tools capable of monitoring the MMP-14 dynamic activity with high temporal and spatial resolution in living cells and animals. Here, we describe the design of Gaussia luciferase (Gluc)-based membrane-bound biosensor for efficient visualization of MMP-14 activity. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) induced significant luciferase changes in the biosensor-transfected lung cancer cells. Deletion of the transmembrane domain in the mutant biosensor or treatment with an MMP-14 inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), relieved the EGF-induced luciferase activation, suggesting that MMP-14 functions at the cell surface to result in luciferase changes. Moreover, utilizing this biosensor, the bioluminescence signals activated by MMP-14 enabled clear visualization of MMP-14-positive lung tumors in animal models. Our results indicated this biosensor is an effective probe for quantitatively monitoring proteolytic activities in live cells and mouse models. These findings offer the general design of biosensors as an adaptable tool for studying various membrane-anchored proteases in biological models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3abioluminescence 3abiosensors 3acell movement 3aepidermal growth factor 3aextracellular matrix 3aluciferase 3alung neoplasms 3alungs 3ametastasis 3amice 3amutants 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis1 aChen, Yan1 aWang, Wuping1 aZhang, Jipeng1 aJiang, Tao1 aLu, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6004-92420 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 June 11, v. 93, no. 25 p.8739-8745dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c051893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01900naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009000171300001600261520067500277592002800952650001200980650001100992650001901003650002501022650001401047650001501061650001501076650001001091650001801101650001401119651001201133653001501145653001201160653002001172653001801192700002501210700002901235700002201264773012001286856005101406852000901457655001201466IND50075254020221118041132.0140410e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007525402DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2012.7094672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConefrey, Thomas14aThe impact of a carbon tax on economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions in Ireland  ap. 934-952.  aThis paper analyses the medium-term effects of a carbon tax on growth and CO₂ emissions in Ireland, a small open economy. We find that a double dividend exists if the carbon tax revenue is recycled through reduced income taxes. If the revenue is recycled by giving a lump-sum transfer to households, a double dividend is unlikely. We also determine that a greater incidence of the carbon tax falls on capital than on labour. When combined with a decrease in income tax, there is a clear shift of the tax burden from labour to capital. Finally, most of the effect on the economy is due to changes in the competitiveness of the manufacturing and market services sectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aeconomic development 3aemissions 3ahouseholds 3aincome tax 3alabor 3amanufacturing 3arecycling 3aIreland 0acarbon tax 0aIreland 0adouble dividend 0atax incidence1 aFitz Gerald, John D.1 aMalaguzzi Valeri, Laura,1 aTol, Richard S.J.0 tJournal of environmental planning and management.g2013 Sept. 1, v. 56, no. 7 p.934-952dRoutledgex1360-05597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2012.709467  aDNAL 7aarticle04114naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245014600184300001600330520215900346592002802505650001302533650001402546650002002560650001802580650001702598650003002615650001502645650001602660650002002676650003102696650001002727650002102737650002402758650002602782650001902808650003502827650001402862650002502876650002002901650002902921650002702950650001202977650002602989650002703015650008003042650003303122650000903155650002403164650004303188650002703231700002003258700001903278700001803297773011603315856004803431852000903479655001203488IND50065453820221119182904.0130423e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006545382DNAL7 a235195602pmid7 a10.1007/s11626-013-9593-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPriya, Shivam10aDysregulation of pathways involved in the processing of cancer and microenvironment information in MCA + TPA transformed C3H/10T1/2 cells  ap. 295-305.  aThe two-stage cell transformation assay is an in vitro model cell culture system to identify the ability of chemicals to act as initiators or promoters of cell transformation and also to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of chemically induced morphological and neoplastic cell transformation. The global gene expression profiles of 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA) + 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-transformed C3H/10T1/2 cells are not known. Therefore, we have investigated the global transcriptional profile of MCA + TPA-transformed C3H10T1/2 cells using an 8 × 60 k probe microarray. The study revealed a differential regulation of pathways and gene expressions. Multifold dysregulation was seen in pathways of cancer, phagosomal activity, and tumor cell microenvironment information processing systems, notably the neuroactive ligand–receptor interaction, actin cytoskeleton regulation, tight junction, axon guidance, and cell adhesion molecules. The genes FGF1, EIF4E1B, MAGI1, and GRIA3 showed upregulation; these encoded the pluripotent fibroblast growth factor, the translation initiation factor, the tight junction scaffolding protein, and the antiapoptotic as well as the enhancer of proliferation and migration, respectively. The genes CXCL7/CXCL5/CXCL12, H2DMB1, and HSPA1A showed downregulation; these encoded the chemotactic agent protein, the protein involved in MHC class II antigen processing/presentation or participating in cell adhesion/phagosomal activity/autoimmune disorder, and the chaperone protein stabilizing the existing as well as newly translated cytosolic/organelle proteins against aggregation, respectively. By loss or gain of function, these dysregulated genes apparently seem to reprogram cells for apoptosis or proliferation and support their transformation into the tumor cell phenotype. The observed molecular changes can be seen as molecular signatures of transformed cells and can be of use as objective evidences to C3H/10T1/2 cell transformation assay in investigations on the carcinogenic potential of chemicals and their mechanism of actions using in vitro carcinogenesis method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3aapoptosis 3acarcinogenicity 3acell adhesion 3acell culture 3acell transformation assay 3achemotaxis 3afibroblasts 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ain vitro studies 3amechanism of action 3amicroarray technology 3amicrofilaments 3aneoplastic cell transformation 3aphenotype 3ascaffolding proteins 3atight junctions 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics) 2aAnimals 2aCarcinogensxtoxicity 2aCell Line, Transformed 2aCell Transformation, Neoplasticxchemically inducedxmetabolismxpathology. 2aMethylcholanthrenextoxicity 2aMice 2aSignal Transduction 2aTetradecanoylphorbol Acetatextoxicity 2aTumor Microenvironment1 aNigam, Akanksha1 aBajpai, Preeti1 aKumar, Sushil0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2013 Apr., v. 49, no. 4 p.295-305dSpringer-Verlagx1071-26907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11626-013-9593-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245009300178300001600271520146500287592002801752650001101780650000901791650001501800651001101815653002501826653002101851653002401872653004801896653002801944700001701972700002901989700002802018773009602046856008402142852000902226655001202235IND60605009320221118190211.0180720e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060500932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2015.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrasco-Díaz, Magdiel13aAn assessment of wind power potential along the coast of Tamaulipas, northeastern Mexico  ap. 295-305.  aHerein, we present an assessment of wind power potential along the coast of Tamaulipas, northeastern Mexico. We propose a method to characterize wind variability and to estimate wind potential in coastal areas where appropriate meteorological measurements may not be available. A gridded reanalysis wind product (BMW-CERSAT), which provides data of zonal and meridional components of wind with a resolution of 1/4° (∼25 km) from years 2004–2009, is used as the reference wind field after a statistical comparison to near-surface observations. Mean wind intensity field at 50-m height and its corresponding mean power density are modeled by using the Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program (WAsP). The wind power potential of the southern half of Tamaulipas State is classified as poor (200–300 W m⁻²), becoming marginal in some areas near the coast. Only the northern half of the State is classified with moderate potential (400–500 W m⁻²), while the lagoon zone has good potential. Estimates, however, could be 30–50% higher if wind observations are measured at a higher frequency. Results show that the wind potential along Tamaulipas is lower than that suggested by the official prevailing eolic-potential map in Mexico. We conclude that even if the assessment presented in this work is preliminary, it gives a realistic approximation of wind as a promising renewable source for electric generation along the coast of Tamaulipas.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3awind 3awind power 3aMexico 0aWind power potential 0aTamaulipas State 0aNortheastern Mexico 0aWind Atlas Analysis and Application Program 0aReanalysis wind product1 aRivas, David1 aOrozco-Contreras, Manuel1 aSánchez-Montante, Orzo0 tRenewable energy.g2015 June, v. 78 p.295-305dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2015.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245012400179300001600303520158300319592002801902650001401930650001301944650003001957650001301987650001502000650002802015650001402043650002202057650001202079650001302091650001602104650001602120650002602136650001602162650002202178650001002200650001402210650001602224650001202240700002602252700002702278700002802305700003302333773012402366856008102490852000902571655001202580IND60468483920170825000000.0151209e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046848392DNAL7 a10.1007/s40415-015-0191-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Cruz Maciel, Jean Rafael10aMorpho-anatomical characteristics conferring drought tolerance in roots of sugar cane genotypes (Saccharum L., Poaceae)  ap. 951-960.  aSugar cane is a major product of Brazilian agriculture, providing about R$ 56 billion of exports per year. Morphological and anatomical analyses enable the identification of plants, whose genotype is still unknown, and increase our knowledge of organs adaptations, such as roots, to different environment conditions. This study aimed to describe the morpho-anatomy of roots of six sugar cane genotypes. Plants were obtained by insertion of stalks in 3L containers filled with coconut fiber substrate. They were held for 7 days in a germination chamber (BOD MA 403) under a 16-h photoperiod with a light intensity of 38 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ and a constant temperature of 35 °C. Daily irrigation was performed, keeping the substrate close to saturation. After this period, plants were transferred to a greenhouse and grew under approximately 116 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ of light intensity at 30 °C and 80 % relative humidity, during 45 days of daily irrigation. For anatomical characterization, 20 roots from stalks and tillers of five plants per genotype were fixed in FAA 50 % and preserved in alcohol 70 %. For each root, the median region was selected for freehand-sectioning, using a razor blade. The results confirmed that anatomical features might be useful for cultivar identification. RB867515 cultivar showed roots with anatomical features that provide drought resistance, including a reduced number of cortical layers. The roots of SP801816 cultivar had more cortical layers and protoxylem poles in stalks and tillers, indicating a reduced drought resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharum 3aalcohols 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3acoconuts 3acontainers 3acultivar identification 3acultivars 3adrought tolerance 3aexports 3agenotype 3agermination 3agreenhouses 3airrigation scheduling 3aphotoperiod 3arelative humidity 3aroots 3asugarcane 3atemperature 3atillers1 ade Oliveira, Danielle1 aFadin, Dauri Aparecido1 adas Graças Sajo, Maria1 aPedroso-de-Moraes, Cristiano0 tRevista brasileira de botânica.g2015 Dec., v. 38, no. 4 p.951-960dSpringer International Publishingx0100-84047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40415-015-0191-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005200144245015900196300001800355520138100373592002801754650003701782650001301819650001801832650002501850650002201875650001601897650002201913650001901935650001901954650001501973650001401988650001202002650002102014650002602035653001802061653002402079653002102103653002702124653001602151700001602167700001802183700001302201700001502214773013902229856007802368852000902446655001202455IND60594816220221118154227.0180524e20180207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059481622DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b156382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Yong1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4089-435810aDredged-Sediment-Promoted Synthesis of Boron-Nitride-Based Floating Photocatalyst with Photodegradation of Neutral Red under Ultraviolet-Light Irradiation  ap. 4640-4651.  aA novel floating photocatalyst (BN-DS-7) has been successfully synthesized by calcining the mixture of boron nitride (BN) and dredged sediment (DS) with a specific mass ratio (3:7) at 1100 °C for a half hour. BN is synthesized for the first time using an oxygen-limited method, which consists of a nanoplate ∼30 nm in size and has a bandgap at 3.94 eV. The as-synthesized BN can degrade NR under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation. For BN-DS-7, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis suggests that BN mainly interacts with DS through the strong coordination between these N atoms in BN and these Si and Al atoms in DS. This leads to BN-DS-7 having good compression strength (∼9 MPa). Thermogravimetric analysis for BN shows that a few BN (∼13%) synthesized via an oxygen-limited method will pyrolyze at 1100 °C and the released gas can be sealed in the inside of DS at 1100 °C, resulting in that BN-DS-7 can float on the water surface. Photodegradation results show that BN-DS-7 can degrade 84% of NR (20 mg/L) under UV-light irradiation for 5 h, and the active species are •OH and photoinduced hole. Total organic carbon analysis for NR solution before and after photodegradation show that ∼70% of NR has been mineralized into inorganic carbons. This work is helpful to develop a new type of BN-based floating material and enlarge the application field of DS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaluminum 3aboron nitride 3acompression strength 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airradiation 3amaterials science 3aorganic carbon 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3asediments 3asilicon 3athermogravimetry 3aultraviolet radiation 0aboron nitride 0aoxygen-limit method 0adredged sediment 0afloating photocatalyst 0aNeutral Red1 aWang, Ruxia1 aWang, Peifang1 aRao, Lei1 aWang, Chao0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Feb. 07, v. 10, no. 5 p.4640-4651dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b156383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01814naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245013200177300001800309520066500327592002800992650002201020650002401042650000801066650002201074650001701096651001601113653003701129653001601166653001501182653002401197653002601221700002301247773012201270856005101392852000901443655001201452IND50075254320221118041226.0140410e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007525432DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2012.7150832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Herten, Marlous L.10aDialogues of the deaf in Dutch eel management policy.

Although stakeholders in the Netherlands agree, also upon the need for action, for a long time no concrete measures were decided upon. Drastic protection measures were only taken 70 years after the first warning signs and 11 years after explicit advice by ICES. Our argumentative discourse analysis shows that ‘dialogue of the deaf’ among discourse coalitions explains the deadlocked policy process. Argumentative discourse analysis not only contributes to a better understanding of knowledge utilisation in controversial fish stock management, but also to conflict resolution in this field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnguilla anguilla 3aconflict management 3aeel 3aissues and policy 3astakeholders 3aNetherlands 0aEuropean eel [Anguilla anguilla] 0acontroversy 0adiscourses 0aadvocacy coalitions 0aknowledge utilisation1 aRunhaar, Hens A.C.0 tJournal of environmental planning and management.g2013 Sept. 1, v. 56, no. 7 p.1002-1020dRoutledgex1360-05597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2012.715083  aDNAL 7aarticle01483naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245010500162300001800267520034800285592002800633650001400661650000900675650002200684650001500706650001600721650001700737650000900754700001900763700002400782700002000806700001700826700002100843700002000864773014200884856007401026852000901100655001201109IND60668912220221121124058.0190920e20130611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066891222DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta11380a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFavereau, Ludovic10aDiketopyrrolopyrrole-zinc porphyrin, a tuned panchromatic association for dye-sensitized solar cells  ap. 7572-7575.  aAiming at collecting a maximum amount of energy with one panchromatic sensitizer, three novel dyes based on zinc porphyrin and diketopyrrolopyrrole units have been synthesized.

However, the utilization of lignin is very limited and almost exclusively used for combustion to generate heat and power. Considering the abundance, low cost, and environmentally benign nature of lignin, as well as its unique molecular structure, the use of lignin-derived materials to construct high-performance rechargeable batteries to meet the massive demand for rechargeable batteries has attracted worldwide attention as an emerging research frontier. This review systematically summarizes the recent advances in lignin-derived materials and their applications in rechargeable batteries. The basic physical and chemical properties of lignin are first introduced. Subsequently, recent advances in lignin-derived electrode materials, including porous carbon and lignin carbon fibers, as well as lignin-derived binders, separators, and electrolytes, are discussed. Finally, perspectives on the further development of advanced lignin-derived materials for rechargeable batteries are presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3achemical structure 3acombustion 3aelectrodes 3agreen chemistry 3aheat 3alignin1 aZhao, Chang-Xin1 aLi, Bo-Quan1 aYuan, Tong-Qi1 aZhang, Qiang0 tGreen chemistry.g2022 Jan. 24, v. 24, no. 2 p.565-584dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1gc02872c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014400169520159800313592002801911650002901939650001501968650002001983650001902003650001402022650001502036650001502051650001102066650000902077650001902086650001102105650001002116650002002126650001502146650001502161650001302176650002902189650001502218651001002233653001302243653001802256653001002274653001702284653003002301700006102331700001902392700002002411700002202431700002102453700002002474700002202494773011102516856008202627852000902709655001202718IND60676574320221120054924.0200210e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067657432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2019.1115442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJordan, Teresa E.10aSurface materials and landforms as controls on InSAR permanent and transient responses to precipitation events in a hyperarid desert, Chile  aGround-based monitoring and remote sensing of extreme rain events in the hyperarid Atacama Desert, Chile, reveal a complex relationship between precipitation, soil types and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) coherence. These integrated analyses allow examination of temporal and spatial variations of the soil moisture response between locations dominated by sulfate soils and those with immature, silicate-mineral soils. The radar dataset captures at least four separate rain events within the 2015–2017 timeframe, two of which were regionally devastating. The lack of vegetation in this region allows us to discriminate between contributions to the InSAR coherence from permanent changes of the landscape (e.g., erosion or deposition) and transient changes associated with soil moisture variability. The spatial distribution and character of the transient InSAR response depends strongly on soil type, and is remarkably repeatable between rain events. The areas that experienced permanent changes included river channels, steep slopes, playas, and sites of anthropogenic activity, such as roads, mines, or telescope construction. Ground-based observations of soil moisture after each event also exhibit a strong dependence on soil type. The observations presented here demonstrate how InSAR data can constrain variations in soil moisture with high spatial resolution over large regions, complementing the higher-sensitivity but sparser field sites and enabling discrimination of inter-event variability and analysis of longer-term changes in soil mineralogy in arid regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarid zones 3adata collection 3ainterferometry 3alandforms 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3aplayas 3arain 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3aroads 3asoil mineralogy 3asoil types 3asoil water 3asulfates 3asynthetic aperture radar 3avegetation 3aChile 0aSentinel 0aSoil moisture 0aSoils 0aActive radar 0aInterferometric coherence1 aLohman, Rowena B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7240-31651 aTapia, Lorenzo1 aPfeiffer, Marco1 aScott, Chelsea P.1 aAmundson, Ronald1 aGodfrey, L.

Our measurements have shown elevated levels of inorganic nutrients, with soluble reactive phosphorus reaching into 30 μg/L. Curiously, those elevated levels of nutrients combined with unexpectedly high nitrogen to phosphorus (N:P) ratio and low planktonic primary productivity. We attribute those phenomena to suspended solids acting as a selective sink for phosphorus while preventing effective photosynthesis in planktonic algae. At the same time, the potential for nitrogen removal is limited by abundant oxygen present in the water. This combination of low light, selective phosphorus removal, and high oxygen levels suggest that the Guadalupe River is likely to effectively export nitrogen, but not phosphorus into the estuary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aestuaries 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aphotosynthesis 3aplankton 3apollution 3aprimary productivity 3areactive phosphorus 3arivers 3aTexas1 aClements, Teresa Le Sage1 aSobolev, Dmitri0 tJournal of coastal conservation.g2020 Aug., v. 24, no. 4 p.46-46dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000609x1400-03507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11852-020-00765-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03297naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010300166300001600269520179300285592002802078650001802106650001602124650001302140650001002153650003502163650001202198650001702210650003002227650002802257650000902285650001002294650002102304650001702325650002002342650001402362650001102376650001202387650002102399650001802420650001202438700001802450700001502468700001502483700001602498700001802514700002102532773012402553856008102677852000902758655001202767IND60468484020170825000000.0151209e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046848402DNAL7 a10.1007/s40415-015-0190-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng Jinping,10aPhysiological characteristics of seed reserve utilization during the early seedling growth in rice  ap. 751-759.  aSeed reserve utilization is an important characteristic of seed quality. In this study, the rice varieties Jiucaiqing (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica) and IR26 (Oryza sativa ssp. indica) and their recombinant inbred lines were used to determine the physiological and genetic control of seed reserve utilization during the early seedling growth. Seedling dry weight and weight of mobilized seed reserve increased with seed germination, while seed reserve utilization efficiency decreased after the first rise. The early seedling growth is firstly determined by the mobilization of storage reserve followed by the conversion efficiency of utilized seed reserve into seedling tissues. The major soluble sugars in grains were fructose and glucose, while fructose in shoots and roots. Glucose content in grains and fructose in shoots and roots slightly decreased after the first rise with seed germination, while fructose content in grains increased and sucrose content in grains, shoots, and roots changed slightly. Seed reserve utilization was significantly and positively correlated with sugar contents. Amylase activity significantly associated with seed reserve utilization increased with seed germination, while there was a slight change in sucrose synthase activity. Each of the three α-amylase (OsAmy3B, OsAmy3C, and OsAmy3E) and sucrose synthase (OsSus2, OsSus3, and OsSus4) genes might be involved in seed reserve utilization. Two and seven quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified for amylase and sucrose synthase activity, respectively, in which four were novel QTLs. The identified amylase and sucrose synthase genes/QTLs might be applicable to improve seed reserve utilization during the early seedling growth in rice by the transgenic and marker-assisted selection approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-amylase 3acorrelation 3afructose 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3aglucose 3ainbred lines 3amarker-assisted selection 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice 3aroots 3aseed germination 3aseed quality 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asucrose 3asucrose synthase 3asugar content 3atissues1 aCheng, Xinxin1 aWang, Ling1 aHe, Yongqi1 aAn, Chuanfu1 aWang, Zhoufei1 aZhang, Hongsheng0 tRevista brasileira de botânica.g2015 Dec., v. 38, no. 4 p.751-759dSpringer International Publishingx0100-84047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40415-015-0190-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03434naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001600156245012900172300001800301520150500319592002801824650002801852650002501880650002301905650001701928650002501945650001601970650001701986650001402003650002602017650001202043650005002055650003902105650005602144650004102200650004502241650002602286650002402312650004802336653001402384653001402398653002602412653001702438653001902455653002402474700002302498700001702521700001702538700003002555700001802585700002402603773013302627852000902760856007502769655001202844IND4468269020160905000000.0160905e20130410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446826902DNAL7 a235477982pmid7 a10.1021/jf400515g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Chunhui10aAntioxidant and Metabolite Profiling of North American and Neotropical Blueberries Using LC-TOF-MS and Multivariate Analyses  ap. 3548-3559.  aThere are many neotropical blueberries, and recent studies have shown that some have even stronger antioxidant activity than the well-known edible North American blueberries. Antioxidant marker compounds were predicted by applying multivariate statistics to data from LC-TOF-MS analysis and antioxidant assays of 3 North American blueberry species (Vaccinium corymbosum, Vaccinium angustifolium, and a defined mixture of Vaccinium virgatum with V. corymbosum) and 12 neotropical blueberry species (Anthopterus wardii, Cavendishia grandifolia, Cavendishia isernii, Ceratostema silvicola, Disterigma rimbachii, Macleania coccoloboides, Macleania cordifolia, Macleania rupestris, Satyria boliviana, Sphyrospermum buxifolium, Sphyrospermum cordifolium, and Sphyrospermum ellipticum). Fourteen antioxidant markers were detected, and 12 of these, including 7 anthocyanins, 3 flavonols, 1 hydroxycinnamic acid, and 1 iridoid glycoside, were identified. This application of multivariate analysis to bioactivity and mass data can be used for identification of pharmacologically active natural products and may help to determine which neotropical blueberry species will be prioritized for agricultural development. Also, the compositional differences between North American and neotropical blueberries were determined by chemometric analysis, and 44 marker compounds including 16 anthocyanins, 15 flavonoids, 7 hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, 5 triterpene glycosides, and 1 iridoid glycoside were identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVaccinium angustifolium 3aVaccinium corymbosum 3aVaccinium virgatum 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3ablueberries 3achemometrics 3aflavonols 3amultivariate analysis 3atropics 2aAntioxidantsxchemical synthesisxmetabolism. 2aBiomarkersxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aBlueberry Plantsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFruitxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 0aEricaceae 0ablueberry 0amultivariate analysis 0achemometrics 0airon chelation 0aantioxidant markers1 aDastmalchi, Keyvan1 aFlores, Gema1 aWu, Shi-Biao1 aPedraza-Peñalosa, Paola,1 aLong, Chunlin1 aKennelly, Edward J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2013 Apr. 10, v. 61, no. 14 p.3548-3559dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf400515g3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02958naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010700168300001600275520143100291592002801722650002901750650001301779650001301792650001601805650000901821650001101830650003801841650001701879650001001896650003501906650002301941650001901964650001901983650002402002650003302026650001802059650002202077650002002099700002302119700001702142700002102159700001802180700001802198700002202216773012402238856008102362852000902443655001202452IND60468484120170825000000.0151209e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046848412DNAL7 a10.1007/s40415-015-0195-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLudmerszki, Edit10aS-methylmethionine contributes to enhanced defense against Maize dwarf mosaic virus infection in maize  ap. 771-782.  aThe beneficial and protective effects of S-methylmethionine (SMM) were investigated in Maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV) infected maize (Zea mays L.). Response reactions and alterations in the physiological state of the plants were monitored by following changes in the values of chlorophyll a fluorescence and chlorophyll content, and differences in the expression patterns of the stress-related genes S-adenosylmethionine synthase (SAMS) and the 14-3-3-like protein gene G-box factor 14-6 (GF14-6). Infection was validated using the ELISA technique. A pronounced decrease in the red to far-red chlorophyll a fluorescence ratio, indicative of chlorophyll content, was observed in infected plants, which was tempered by SMM pretreatment. A noticeable decrease in the photochemical quenching of photosystem II and the thermal dissipation of the antennae was observed, together with a notable increase in other non-photochemical energy dissipation parameters in response to MDMV infection. SMM treatment enhanced blue fluorescence in both uninfected and MDMV-infected plants (probably due to the production of protective phenolic compounds), while infection characteristically increased green fluorescence emission. SMM treatment was found to elevate the rate of gene expressions of SAMS and GF14-6. The results suggest that SMM pretreatment enhances the stress response reactions that protect maize plants against MDMV infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaize dwarf mosaic virus 3aZea mays 3aantennae 3achlorophyll 3acorn 3aenergy 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afluorescence 3agenes 3amethionine adenosyltransferase 3aphenolic compounds 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosystem II 3aphysiological state 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant viruses 3aprotective effect 3astress response1 aAlmási, Asztéria1 aRácz, Ilona1 aSzigeti, Zoltán1 aSolti, Ádám1 aOláh, Csilla1 aRudnóy, Szabolcs0 tRevista brasileira de botânica.g2015 Dec., v. 38, no. 4 p.771-782dSpringer International Publishingx0100-84047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40415-015-0195-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245007600156300001800232520116000250592002801410650001801438650001701456650002501473650001201498650001901510650001801529650001801547650002101565650001601586650001601602650001601618650001201634650002101646650000801667650001401675650000901689650001601698650002501714650001601739650001001755773013501765856007301900852000901973655001201982IND60547738520221120125811.0160903e20160621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054773852DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.35012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBulut, Gizem10aMedicinal and wild food plants of Marmara Island (Balikesir – Turkey)  ap. asbp.3501.  aMedicinal and wild food plants have always played an important role in people’s lives especially in rural areas. Similar situation can be said for islands due to the reason of them being isolated from mainland. This paper reports an ethnobotanical investigations performed in 2009 and 2014 to determine medicinal and wild food plants of Marmara Island. A total of 30 individuals were interviewed (19 men, 11 women). Totally, 22 plants are recorded as used as traditional folk medicine for the region, and nine of these are also used as a source of wild food. Furthermore, 18 taxa are wild sources of nutrition for the area. The plants most commonly used in the region as medicinal remedies were Salvia fruticosa, Hypericum perforatum, Ficus carica, and Mentha spicata. Plants are mostly used for the treatment of abdominal pain, the common cold, and haemorrhoids. The species most commonly used for food are: Salvia fruticosa, Arbutus unedo, Rhus coriaria, and Rubus sanctus. This ethnobotanical study conducted in this island will enable the traditional use of wild plants both as food sources and herbal remedies to be passed on to future generations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArbutus unedo 3aFicus carica 3aHypericum perforatum 3aMarmara 3aMentha spicata 3aRhus coriaria 3aRubus sanctus 3aSalvia fruticosa 3acommon cold 3aethnobotany 3afood plants 3aislands 3amedicinal plants 3amen 3anutrition 3apain 3arural areas 3atraditional medicine 3awild plants 3awomen0 tActa Societatis Botanicorum Poloniae.g2016 June 21, v. 85, no. 2 p.asbp.3501-asbp.3501dPolish Botanical Societyx2083-94807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5586/asbp.35013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04099naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002200156245007500178300001800253520212000271592002802391650000902419650001202428650002402440650000902464650002702473650001002500650001102510650001102521650001302532650001402545650002202559650001402581650001402595650002102609650001702630650001002647650001302657650000902670650001302679650001002692650001002702650001202712650001602724650001202740650002102752650002102773650001702794650001102811650001902822650002802841650001402869650001402883650004202897650001002939653002102949653000902970653001002979653001002989653001702999653000903016653000903025700001803034700002003052700001903072700002103091773013303112852000903245856007503254655001203329IND4468269120221119224832.0160905e20130417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446826912DNAL7 a234888742pmid7 a10.1021/jf303768e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatkins, Peter J.10aSheepmeat Flavor and the Effect of Different Feeding Systems: A Review  ap. 3561-3579.  aLamb has a unique flavor, distinct from other popular red meats. Although flavor underpins lamb’s popularity, it can also be an impediment to consumer acceptance. Lack of familiarity with sheepmeat flavor itself can be a barrier for some consumers, and undesirable feed-induced flavors may also compromise acceptability. Against the backdrop of climate uncertainty and unpredictable rainfall patterns, sheep producers are turning to alternatives to traditional grazing pasture systems. Historically, pasture has been the predominant feed system for lamb production in Australia and around the world. It is for this reason that there has been a focus on “pastoral” flavor in sheep meat. Pasture-associated flavors may be accepted as “normal” by consumers accustomed to meat from pasture-fed sheep; however, these flavors may be unfamiliar to consumers of meat produced from grain-fed and other feed systems. Over the past few decades, studies examining the impacts of different feeds on lamb meat quality have yielded variable consumer responses ranging from “no effect” to “unacceptable”, illustrating the diverse and sometimes inconsistent impacts of different forages on sheepmeat flavor. Despite considerable research, there is no consensus on which volatiles are essential for desirable lamb aroma and how they differ compared to other red meats, for example, beef. In contrast, comparatively little work has focused specifically on the nonvolatile taste components of lamb flavor. Diet also affects the amount of intramuscular fat and its fatty acid composition in the meat, which has a direct effect on meat juiciness and texture as well as flavor, and its release during eating. The effect of diet is far from simple and much still needs to be learned. An integrated approach that encompasses all input variables is required to better understand the impact of the feed and related systems on sheepmeat flavor. This review brings together recent research findings and proposes some novel approaches to gain insights into the relationship between animal diet, genetics, and sheepmeat quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3aclimate 3aconsumer acceptance 3adiet 3afatty acid composition 3afeeds 3aflavor 3aforage 3agenetics 3aingestion 3aintramuscular fat 3ajuiciness 3alamb meat 3ameat composition 3ameat quality 3aodors 3apastures 3arain 3ared meat 3asheep 3ataste 3atexture 3auncertainty 2aAnimals 2aDietxveterinary 2aFood Preferences 2aFood Quality 2aHumans 2aMeatxanalysis 2aMeat Productsxanalysis 2aOdorants. 2aSensation 2aSheep, Domesticxgrowth & development 2aTaste 0asheepmeat flavor 0alamb 0aaroma 0ataste 0aolfactometry 0adiet 0afeed1 aFrank, Damian1 aSingh, Tanoj

The objective of the present study was to analyse the effect of wheat replacement with different levels (15–35 g/100g) of mesquite flour (from Prosopis alba pods) on the leavening performance of dough, the nutritional and technological quality of bread and bread staling.Farinograph assays were applied to obtain optimum water amounts and development times. The addition of mesquite led to less stable dough with respect to control wheat dough. Fermentation assays showed higher fermentation times and lower maximum volumes. High levels of mesquite led to lower specific volumes of breads and a more compact and darker crumb, with smaller alveolus size, higher firmness and lesser resilience and cohesiveness. Breads were considerably improved in fibre content (6–9 g/100g). During storage, hardness and chewiness increased while cohesiveness and resilience decreased in all formulations. Nevertheless, textural changes were attenuated in composite breads in comparison with wheat bread. X-ray difractometry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) also indicated less retrogradation in these products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProsopis alba 3aX-radiation 3abreadmaking 3abreadmaking quality 3abreads 3achewiness 3acohesion 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adough 3afermentation 3afiber content 3afirmness 3ahardness 3aminerals 3apods 3aretrogradation 3asemiarid zones 3asugars 3atrees 3awheat 3awheat flour 0aMesquite flour 0aProsopis alba 0aWheat flour 0aBreadmaking 0aTexture1 aPuppo, María C.1 aFerrero, Cristina0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2016 Jan., v. 65 p.1008-1016dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2015.09.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245006700172300001800239520123000257592002801487650001301515650001701528650001501545650001101560650001001571650002101581650002101602650001001623650001301633650001301646650001601659650001201675650001401687650001901701651001001720653002401730653002101754653001901775653001901794653001301813653002501826773012101851856005101972852000902023655001202032IND50075254720221118041153.0140410e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007525472DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2012.7091802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiorillo, Damiano10aHousehold waste recycling: national survey evidence from Italy  ap. 1125-1151.  aThe paper analyses the determinants of household recycling in Italy, with particular emphasis on social behaviours. The econometric analysis is based on two waves – 1998 and 2000 – of the Multipurpose Household Survey conducted annually by the Italian Central Statistics Office. In Italy, household recycling was substantially voluntary in the years from 1998 to 2000-with no monetary incentives or pecuniary sanctions. Five different materials are investigated: paper, glass, plastic, aluminium and food waste. The results of the probit regressions suggest that membership in non-profit associations, church attendance, the habit of talking politics and reading newspapers are significantly correlated with household recycling behaviour; while gender, age, education and household income play the biggest role. The findings also show that the presence of recycling bins for waste improves household recycling behaviour for all materials, whereas the difficulty of reaching recycling bins adversely affects household recycling outcomes. Household judgements on waste disposal charges have no effect on the recycling effort. Residency in southern Italy is associated with the lowest probability of recycling all materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aeconometrics 3afood waste 3agender 3aglass 3ahousehold income 3anational surveys 3apaper 3aplastics 3apolitics 3aprobability 3areading 3arecycling 3awaste disposal 3aItaly 0ahousehold recycling 0asocial behaviour 0asocial capital 0arecycling bins 0aflat fee 0astatistical matching0 tJournal of environmental planning and management.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 56, no. 8 p.1125-1151dRoutledgex1360-05597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2012.709180  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245015800159300001800317520120400335592002801539650001301567650002201580650002001602650001501622650001501637650001101652650002201663650001401685650001401699650001001713650003701723700002001760700002001780700003801800700002101838773013501859856007301994852000902067655001202076IND60547738620221120125853.0160903e20160613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054773862DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.34952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBzdyk, Roman M.10aArum-type of arbuscular mycorrhizae, dark septate endophytes and Olpidium spp. in fine roots of container-grown seedlings of Sorbus torminalis (Rosaceae)  ap. asbp.3495.  aThe aim of this study was to determine the mycorrhizal status of nursery seedlings of the wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis), which belongs to the Rosaceae family. Its mycorrhizal associations are still fragmentarily known, and data from the few existing studies indicate that it forms ectomycorrhizal symbiosis (ECM). We analyzed the degree of mycorrhizal colonization of thirty 2-year-old container-grown S. torminalis nursery seedlings, which belonged to three single-tree progenies. The roots were dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM), with the morphology of the Arum-type containing arbuscules, vesicles and hyphae; however, no ECM structures were found. The degree of root colonization of the analyzed seedlings by AM fungi was 83.6% and did not differ significantly between the three single-tree progenies. In addition to AM, structures of dark septate endophytes (0.7%) and sporangia of Olpidium spp. (1.1%) were found in wild service tree roots. In agreement with previous studies, we confirmed arbuscular mycorrhizae for S. torminalis. Moreover, this is the first report that roots of this Sorbus species show the Arum-type morphology of AM and are associated with Olpidium species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOlpidium 3aSorbus torminalis 3aectomycorrhizae 3aendophytes 3afine roots 3ahyphae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aseedlings 3asporangia 3atrees 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aKöhler, Josef,1 aOlchowik, Jacek1 aAleksandrowicz-Trzcińska, Marta,1 aKirisits, Thomas0 tActa Societatis Botanicorum Poloniae.g2016 June 13, v. 85, no. 2 p.asbp.3495-asbp.3495dPolish Botanical Societyx2083-94807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5586/asbp.34953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03584naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245017600168300001600344520129300360592002801653650001901681650002301700650001701723650001101740650001901751650001601770650001701786650001401803650001101817650001501828650001201843650002001855650001601875650001101891650001601902650002301918650001701941650001601958653002601974653001702000653002402017653001702041653001702058653003902075653003902114653004002153653005202193653005502245653004902300653004902349653005202398653005202450653004702502700003402549700002402583700001802607700002002625700002102645700002102666773012102687856008102808852000902889655001202898IND60524952820221117191815.0190318e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052495282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2015.09.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGórnaś, Paweł14aThe impact of different baking conditions on the stability of the extractable polyphenols in muffins enriched by strawberry, sour cherry, raspberry or black currant pomace  ap. 946-953.  aThe stability of polyphenols in muffins, enriched with strawberry, black currant, raspberry and sour cherry pomace (50 g/kg), baked in a conventional and halogen oven, at three different temperatures (140, 180 and 220 °C), was studied. The most unstable compounds were anthocyanins (36–97% lost), in contrast the flavonol glycosides were the most stable (0–21% lost). Over 100% recovery was observed for neochlorogenic acid and ellagic acid (95–120% and 341–823%, respectively). The increase of free ellagic acid content in muffins enriched with strawberry or raspberry was positively correlated with the baking time (r = 0.879 and r = 0.944, respectively) and was the result of thermal hydrolysis of ellagitannins and ellagic acid glycosides. The highest temperature combined with a short baking time had the best effect on the preservation of polyphenols, however, since the polyphenol composition can be expected to vary in different fruits, each case should be considered separately, in order to achieve the most favorable nutritional effect of baked products enriched with fruit pomace. The sensory evaluation showed that muffins enriched with 50 g/kg of fruit pomace were competitive with control muffins, with the added benefit of having a higher nutritional value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus cerasus 3aRubus occidentalis 3aanthocyanins 3abaking 3ablack currants 3acorrelation 3aellagic acid 3aflavonols 3afruits 3ahydrolysis 3amuffins 3anutritive value 3apolyphenols 3apomace 3araspberries 3asensory evaluation 3astrawberries 3atemperature 0aPolyphenols stability 0aEllagic acid 0aFlavonol glycosides 0aAnthocyanins 0aFruit pomace 0aα-Tocopherol (PubChem CID: 14985) 0aγ-Tocopherol (PubChem CID: 92729) 0aellagic acid (PubChem CID: 5281855) 0adelphinidin-3-O-glucoside (PubChem CID: 443650) 0adelphinidin-3-O-rutinoside (PubChem CID: 44256887) 0acyanidin-3-O-glucoside (PubChem CID: 441667) 0acyanidin-3-O-rutinoside (PubChem CID: 29232) 0amyricetin-3-O-glucoside (PubChem CID: 22841567) 0amyricetin-3-O-rutinoside (PubChem CID:44259428) 0aneochlorogenic acid (PubChem CID: 5280633)1 aJuhņeviča-Radenkova, Karina1 aRadenkovs, Vitalijs1 aMišina, Inga1 aPugajeva, Iveta1 aSoliven, Arianne1 aSegliņa, Dalija0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2016 Jan., v. 65 p.946-953dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2015.09.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002800137245010900165300001800274500002000292520100300312592002801315650001801343650001501361650002401376650002001400650002201420650001901442650001401461650002501475650001901500650004001519650001301559650001101572650001801583650001101601651001501612651001801627700002301645700002801668700002601696700002201722700002101744773009901765856007101864852000901935655001201944IND60569961920221118134632.0170626e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056996192DNAL7 a10.1890/02-05492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchlesinger, William H.10aCommunity composition and photosynthesis by photoautotrophs under quartz pebbles, southern mojave desert  ap. 3222-3231.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe used 16s rDNA sequences to identify novel species of cyanobacteria beneath translucent quartz pebbles in the desert pavement on an alluvial piedmont of the Coxcomb Mountains in the southern Mojave Desert, California, USA. Transmission of light, as measured with an integrating sphere, was about 0.08% beneath the thickest pieces of quartz (25 mm) harboring these hypolithic autotrophs. The photosynthetic rate ranged from 0.1 to 1.0 μmol·m⁻²·s⁻¹ in the linear range of its response to light (PAR of 0–50 μmol·m⁻²·s⁻¹), over which the apparent quantum‐use efficiency was 0.019. Light‐saturated rates of 1.7–2.7 μmol·m⁻²·s⁻¹ were recorded at light intensities of 200–400 μmol·m⁻²·s⁻¹. The hypolithic community had an upper thermal tolerance of >90°C in laboratory conditions. The quartz pebbles confer a modest greenhouse effect that may be important for photosynthetic activity during cool, wet, wintertime periods that prevail in the Mojave Desert.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aautotrophs 3acommunity structure 3adesert pavement 3agreenhouse effect 3aheat tolerance 3amountains 3anucleotide sequences 3aphotosynthesis 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3apiedmont 3aquartz 3aribosomal DNA 3awinter 3aCalifornia 3aMojave Desert1 aPippen, Jeffrey S.1 aWallenstein, Matthew D.1 aHofmockel, Kirsten S.1 aKlepeis, Debra M.1 aMahall, Bruce E.0 tEcology.g2003 Dec., v. 84, no. 12 p.3222-3231dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-05493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014800167300001600315520134700331592002801678650002101706650001301727650001901740650002501759650001001784650001901794650001801813650000901831650001901840650001601859650002101875650004301896650001501939700002301954700001801977700002201995773009902017856008102116852000902197655001202206IND60129887320221123031502.0150503e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012988732DNAL7 a10.1007/s00441-014-2099-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmyth, David C.10aOncostatin M regulates osteogenic differentiation of murine adipose-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells through a PKCdelta-dependent mechanism  ap. 309-319.  aOncostatin M (OSM) is an IL-6/LIF family cytokine that influences mesenchymal progenitor differentiation; however, the mechanisms of this activity have not been fully elucidated. Using uncommitted murine adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal progenitors, we have examined mechanisms of OSM-induced osteogenesis. Murine OSM (mOSM) induced osteogenic differentiation to a greater degree than interleukin (IL)-6 and other members of the gp130 cytokine family, promoting extracellular matrix mineralization as indicated by Alizarin Red S staining. mOSM also increased expression of osteogenesis-associated gene products BMP4, BMP7, Runx-2, and osteocalcin as assessed by immunoblotting and real-time quantitative PCR. Additionally, protein kinase C (PKC) delta activity was upregulated in response to OSM stimulation, and to a greater degree than IL-6. Knockdown of PKCdelta expression by use of RNA interference (RNAi) reduced OSM-mediated osteogenic differentiation and decreased expression of Runx-2. These findings suggest that OSM differentially promotes osteogenesis in non-committed mesenchymal progenitors relative to other gp130 cytokines. This activity correlates with selective activation of PKCdelta in OSM-treated cells, indicating that OSM-induced osteogenesis and upregulation of osteogenic gene products require activity of PKCdelta.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aalizarin 3abone formation 3aextracellular matrix 3agenes 3aimmunoblotting 3ainterleukin-6 3amice 3amineralization 3aosteocalcin 3aprotein kinase C 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3astem cells1 aTakenaka, Shunsuke1 aYeung, Celine1 aRichards, Carl D.0 tCell and tissue research.g2015 May, v. 360, no. 2 p.309-319dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-014-2099-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245012400162300001600286520127300302592002801575650002201603650002801625650001401653650001801667650001701685650001601702650001101718650001401729650001201743650001701755650001901772650001301791650000901804650001901813650001801832650002801850650001701878650001101895653001801906653002801924653003701952653001301989653001402002653001102016653001602027653003102043700002202074700001602096700002202112700002002134700002102154700001902175773012102194856008002315852000902395655001202404IND60560865820221119172219.0170111e20170111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056086582DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b133522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, Abhijit10aCancer Cell Specific Delivery of Photosystem I Through Integrin Targeted Liposome Shows Significant Anticancer Activity  ap. 176-188.  aMany anticancer drugs are developed for the treatment of cancer from natural sources. Photosystem I (PSI), a protein complex present in the chloroplast, is involved in photosynthesis and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant. Here, we used the ROS generation property of PSI for cancer therapy. We show that PSI can enter into different kinds of cancer cell like human lung carcinoma (A549) and mouse melanoma (B16F10) cell lines and generate ROS inside the cells. It inhibits the proliferation of cancer cell and causes apoptotic death of cancer cells. We also show that PSI induces apoptosis through mitochondria-dependent internal pathway, induces caspase3, causes DNA fragmentation, and arrests cell cycle at SubG0 phase. We also prepared, using C₁₆-LDV lipopeptide [C16 long chain attached on the N-terminal of the tripeptide containing amino acids leucine (L), aspartic acid (D), and valine (V) abbreviated as NH₂-LDV-COOH], α₄β₁ integrin targeted liposomal formulation of PSI, which specifically kills the cancer cell without affecting normal cells, and it is found to be more potent compared to clinically used drug doxorubicin. Finally, we found that LDV liposomal formulation of PSI inhibits the growth of tumor in C57BL/6J mice model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3aaspartic acid 3achloroplasts 3adoxorubicin 3ahumans 3aintegrins 3aleucine 3alipopeptides 3alung neoplasms 3amelanoma 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3aphotosystem I 3areactive oxygen species 3atherapeutics 3avaline 0aphotosystem I 0areactive oxygen species 0amitochondrial membrane potential 0acaspase3 0aapoptosis 0acancer 0alipopeptide 0aintegrin targeted delivery1 aMohapatra, Saswat1 aDas, Gaurav1 aJana, Batakrishna1 aGhosh, Subhajit1 aBhunia, Debmalya1 aGhosh, Surajit0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Jan. 11, v. 9, no. 1 p.176-188dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b133523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245008500209300001600294506007600310520105700386592002801443506003701471650003101508650001001539650001701549650003301566650002201599650002201621650001601643650002001659650002901679650003001708700002401738700002801762700002101790700002001811773012401831856007901955852000902034655001202043IND60300723320221207061102.0150703e20120803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030072332DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12235602doi7 aPMC35182982pmcid7 a227006572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNargund, Amrita M.10aMitochondrial Import Efficiency of ATFS-1 Regulates Mitochondrial UPR Activation  ap. 587-590.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInitiating Mitochondrial Repair The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) mediates the up-regulation of nuclear encoded mitochondrial chaperone genes in response to mitochondrial dysfunction. How mitochondrial dysfunction is communicated to the nucleus is unclear, but requires the transcription factor, ATFS-1. Nargund et al. (p. 587, published online 14 June) found that the key point of regulation in UPRmt signaling is mitochondrial protein import efficiency of ATFS-1. In addition to a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), ATFS-1 has a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) that is necessary for UPRmt repression. ATFS-1 is normally imported efficiently into mitochondria and degraded by the Lon protease. However, in the presence of stress, some ATFS-1 fails to be imported into mitochondria and is trafficked to the nucleus. The juxtaposition of a C-terminal NLS to an N-terminal MTS in a transcriptional activator thus couples unfolded protein load in the mitochondrial matrix to a rectifying transcriptional response in the nucleus.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amitochondria 3anuclear localization signals 3aprotein transport 3aprotein unfolding 3aproteinases 3atransactivators 3atranscription (genetics) 3aunfolded protein response1 aPellegrino, Mark W.1 aFiorese, Christopher J.1 aBaker, Brooke M.1 aHaynes, Cole M.0 tScience.g2012 Aug. 3, v. 337, no. 6094 p.587-590dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12235603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014400168520140400312592002801716650001501744650001501759650001001774650001001784650001301794650002001807650002001827650002701847650001501874650003301889650002301922650001201945650001901957653002501976653001802001653002502019653002102044653002602065700003502091700006502126700006702191773012202258856008102380852000902461655001202470IND60677512920221117032816.0200221e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067751292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1088762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIndriani, Sylvia10aQuality characteristics of protein-enriched brown rice flour and cake affected by Bombay locust (Patanga succincta L.) powder fortification  aProtein-enriched brown rice flours were developed by fortification of defatted Bombay locust powder (BL) at different levels (10, 20, 30%). The physicochemical characteristics of the mixed flours were then investigated. The application of resulting mixed flour on preparing protein-enriched cake was also studied. The chemical composition, water activity, color as well as rheological property of the resulting mixed flours were varied at different levels of BL added. The protein content of resulting mixed flours was effectively improved, especially at 30% replacement provided almost 4-fold increased (11–42%), compared with control (BRF without BL fortification) (p ≤ 0.05). Protein-enriched cakes prepared using the mixed flours, showed the differences in their physicochemical properties, texture profiles, chemical composition and sensory characteristics, which were influenced by BL fortification level. The 20% replacement of brown rice flour by BL (20-MF) provided a protein-enriched cake (20.8% of protein) with liking score ranged from 7.0 to 7.4 for all attributes tested, indicating the good acceptability. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the 20-MF cake revealed that it had a denser structure with the less porosity than the control. Therefore, BL might be a promising alternative protein source for developing protein-enriched flour and baked product, particularly cakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNomadacris 3abrown rice 3acakes 3acolor 3aporosity 3aprotein content 3aprotein sources 3arheological properties 3arice flour 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asensory properties 3atexture 3awater activity 0aPatanga succincta L. 0aEdible insect 0aBombay locust powder 0aBrown rice flour 0aProtein-enriched cake1 aBin Ab Karim, Muhammad Shahrim1 aNalinanon, Sitthipong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1047-02601 aKarnjanapratum, Supatra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1349-40330 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Feb., v. 119 p.108876-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1088763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03274naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245013700210300001600347506007600363520167500439592002802114506003702142650001102179650001402190650001602204650001102220650002102231650001202252650001502264650001402279650001302293650001402306650002202320650001402342650000902356700001802365700002502383700002302408700003202431700001502463700001502478700001802493700002302511700002102534773009902555856008102654852000902735655001202744IND60129887420221207081900.0150503e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012988742DNAL7 a10.1007/s00441-014-2100-92doi7 aPMC45444902pmcid7 a256760042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukuda, Hiromitsu10aPodocin is translocated to cytoplasm in puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis rats and in poor-prognosis patients with IgA nephropathy  ap. 391-400.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPodocytes serve as the final barrier to urinary protein loss through a highly specialized structure called a slit membrane and maintain foot process and glomerular basement membranes. Podocyte injury results in progressive glomerular damage and accelerates sclerotic changes, although the exact mechanism of podocyte injury is still obscure. We focus on the staining gap (podocin gap) defined as the staining difference between podocin and synaptopodin, which are normally located in the foot process. In puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis rats, the podocin gap is significantly increased (p < 0.05) and podocin is translocated to the cytoplasm on days 7 and 14 but not on day 28. Surprisingly, the gap is also significantly increased (p < 0.05) in human kidney biopsy specimens of poor-prognosis IgA nephropathy patients. This suggests that the podocin gap could be a useful marker for classifying the prognosis of IgA nephropathy and indicating the translocation of podocin to the cytoplasm. Next, we find more evidence of podocin trafficking in podocytes where podocin merges with Rab5 in puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis rats at day 14. In immunoelectron microscopy, the podocin positive area was significantly translocated from the foot process areas to the cytoplasm (p< 0.05) on days 7 and 14 in puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis rats. Interestingly, podocin is also translocated to the cytoplasm in poor-prognosis human IgA nephropathy. In this paper, we demonstrate that the translocation of podocin by endocytosis could be a key traffic event of critical podocyte injury and that the podocin gap could indicate the prognosis of IgA nephropathy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiopsy 3acytoplasm 3aendocytosis 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin A 3akidneys 3amicroscopy 3anephrosis 3apatients 3aprognosis 3aprotein depletion 3apuromycin 3arats1 aHidaka, Teruo1 aTakagi-Akiba, Miyuki1 aIchimura, Koichiro1 aTrejo, Juan Alejandro Oliva1 aSasaki, Yu1 aWang, Juan1 aSakai, Tatsuo1 aAsanuma, Katsuhiko1 aTomino, Yasuhiko0 tCell and tissue research.g2015 May, v. 360, no. 2 p.391-400dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-014-2100-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009500164500002200259520147800281592002801759650002101787650001901808650001201827650001601839650001201855650001001867650000901877650001401886650002301900650002201923650001501945653003601960653004801996653000902044653002202053653001902075700002002094700001402114700001502128700001402143773009702157856008202254852000902336655001202345IND60563646920221119212130.0170713s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056364692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.02.0982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Guofeng10aInvolvement of WNK1-mediated potassium channels in the sexual dimorphism of blood pressure  aPre-press version  aPotassium homeostasis plays an essential role in the control of blood pressure. It is unknown, however, whether potassium balance is involved in the gender-associated blood pressure differences. We therefore investigated the possible mechanism of sexual dimorphism in blood pressure regulation by measuring the blood pressure, plasma potassium, renal actions of potassium channels and upstream regulator in male and female mice. Here we found that female mice exhibited lower blood pressure and higher plasma K+ level as compared to male littermates. Western blot analyses of mouse kidney extract revealed a significant decrease in renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK) channel expression, while large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channel and Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) as well as the upstream regulator with-no-lysine kinase 1 (WNK1) enhanced in female mice under normal condition. Surprisingly, both dietary K+ loading and K+ depletion eliminated the differences in plasma K+ and blood pressure between females and males, and the differences of renal K+ channels and WNK1 also attenuated in both groups of mice. These findings indicated the existence of a close correlation between K+ homeostasis and sex-associated blood pressure. Moreover, the differential regulation of ROMK, BK-α and NKCC2 between female and male mice, at least, were partly mediated via WNK1 pathway, which may contribute to the sexual dimorphism of plasma K+ and blood pressure control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3ablood pressure 3afemales 3ahomeostasis 3akidneys 3amales 3amice 3apotassium 3apotassium channels 3asexual dimorphism 3asymporters 0aRenal outer medullary potassium 0aLarge-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel 0aWNK1 0aGender difference 0aBlood pressure1 aCheng, Mengting1 aWang, Wei1 aZhao, Rong1 aLiu, Zhen0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.02.0983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02167naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002500186245006200211300001600273506007600289520062100365592002800986506003701014650000801051650003201059650001801091650002201109650002001131650001701151650001101168700001701179700002001196700001701216700002701233700001501260700002201275700003101297700002101328700001701349700002001366700002101386700001801407700002401425773012401449856007901573852000901652655001201661IND60300723420221207061057.0150703e20120803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030072342DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12187162doi7 aPMC36261102pmcid7 a228594892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakraborty, Anirban10aOpening and Closing of the Bacterial RNA Polymerase Clamp  ap. 591-595.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aClamping Down Crystal structures of RNA polymerase show that a “clamp” region which surrounds the DNA binding site can adopt conformations ranging from a closed to an open state.

In this study, we exposed three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus to produced water (PW), i.e. wastewater from offshore petroleum production. PW contains substances such as alkylphenols (APs) and aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) known to induce toxicant stress and endocrine disruption in a variety of organisms. Following exposure to PW, a standardized confinement treatment was applied as a second stressor (PW-stress), testing how fish already under stress from the pollutant would respond to an additional stressor. The endpoint for analysis was a combination of blood levels of cortisol and glucose, in addition to transcribed levels of a set of genes related to toxicant stress, endocrine disruption and general stress. The findings of this study indicate that low doses of PW do not induce vitellogenin in immature female stickleback, but do cause an upregulation of cytochrome (CYP1A) and UDP-glucuronsyltransferase (UDP-GT), two biomarkers related to toxicant stress. However, when the second stressor was applied, both genes were downregulated, indicating that the confinement exposure had a suppressive effect on the expression of toxicant biomarkers (CYP1A and UDP-GT). Further, two of the stress related genes, heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and stress-induced phosphoprotein (STIP), were upregulated in both PW- and PW-stress-treatment, but not in the water control confinement treatment, indicating that PW posed as a larger stress-factor than confinement for these genes. The confinement stressor caused an increased level of glucose in both control and PW-treated fish, indicating hyperglycemia, a commonly reported stress response in fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGasterosteus aculeatus 3aacute exposure 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3acortisol 3afemales 3afish 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglucose 3aheat shock proteins 3ahyperglycemia 3apetroleum 3aphosphoproteins 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3astress response 3avitellogenin 3awastewater 0aAhR 0aARNT 0aBT 0aCYP 0aEF 0aGAPDH 0aGR 0aHSP 0aHPI 0aPLA 0aPW 0aRIA 0artPCR 0aSULT 0aSTIP 0aUDP-GT 0aVTG 0aCYP1A 0aBiomarkers 0aOil pollution 0aPAH 0aCortisol 0aGlucose1 aTaugbøl, Annette0 tComparative Biochemistry and Physiology, Part C.g2013 Sept., v. 158 p.173-180dElsevier Inc.x1532-04567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpc.2013.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245014900157300001600306520149200322592002801814650002201842650001601864650001501880650001501895650002001910650001201930650001101942650001201953650002301965650001501988650001402003650002502017650001802042650002602060650001602086650001502102650000802117650001902125650001702144650001202161650001502173651001002188700002202198700001902220700002002239700002202259773011702281856007302398852000902471655001202480IND60132275720221121041335.0150505e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013227572DNAL7 a10.1111/gfs.120892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMganga, K.

However, desertification characterized by vegetation degradation and soil erosion is a major threat to the sustainability of land‐based production systems. Native rangeland forage species Cenchrus ciliaris L. (Buffel grass/African foxtail grass), Eragrostis superba Peyr. (Maasai love grass) and Enteropogon macrostachyus (Hochst. Ex A. Rich.) Monro ex Benth. (Bush rye grass) have been used to combat desertification. The objectives of the study were to identify the best‐suited native grass species to combat desertification in a semi‐arid environment in Kenya and to identify the preferred grass species among the agropastoralists in the area. Percentage basal cover, plant densities and frequencies of the three grasses in pure stands and mixtures were estimated. Grass species preferences were through household survey and focus group discussion. Results showed a significant difference (P < 0·05) in plant densities and cover estimates: E. macrostachyus was ranked first; C. ciliaris and E. superba were ranked second and third respectively. The agropastoral farmers, however, preferred E. superba followed by C. ciliaris and E. macrostachyus, a reverse trend. These results suggest that the choice of grass species to combat desertification is influenced more by its contribution as a source of forage for livestock than its contribution for rehabilitation purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenchrus ciliaris 3aEnteropogon 3aEragrostis 3aarid lands 3adesertification 3afarmers 3aforage 3agrasses 3aindigenous species 3alivelihood 3alivestock 3alivestock production 3aplant density 3aproduction technology 3apure stands 3arangelands 3arye 3asemiarid zones 3asoil erosion 3asurveys 3avegetation 3aKenya1 aMusimba, N.

TLR ligands combine with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) expressed on the DC surface and induce DC maturation. The potential effect of three types of TLR ligands (Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) spores, polyinosinic–polycytidylic acid and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides) on chicken bone marrow-derived DCs (chBM-DCs) maturation was studied. The chBM-DCs cultured in presence of recombinant chicken granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin (IL)-4 displayed the typical morphology of DCs after 7 days of culture. These immature chBM-DCs up-regulated the expression of MHC-II and of the putative CD11c, but had yet low to moderate levels of the CD40 and CD86 co-stimulatory molecules. After stimulation by the TLR ligands, the chBM-DCs displayed a more mature morphologic phenotype, significantly increased the CD40 and CD86 cell surface expression levels and gained the ability to stimulate proliferation of naive T cells in the allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction, compared to the immature chBM-DCs. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that all three TLR ligands were strong stimuli for driving chBM-DCs maturation in vitro, with B. subtilis spores being the most efficient.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aT-lymphocytes 3achickens 3adendritic cells 3agranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 3aimmune response 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3apolyinosinic-polycytidylic acid 3areceptors 3aspores 2aAnimals 2aBacillus subtilisxphysiology 2aBone Marrow Cellsxphysiology 2aChickensximmunology 2aDendritic Cellsxphysiology 2aGranulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factorxpharmacology 2aInterleukin-4xpharmacology 2aLigands 2aLymphocyte Activation 2aOligodeoxyribonucleotidesxpharmacology 2aPoly I-Cxpharmacology 2aSpleenxcytology 2aSpores, Bacterialxphysiology 2aToll-Like Receptorsxphysiology 0aBone marrow 0aChicken 0aDendritic cells 0aTLR ligands1 aFu, Jia1 aKang, Haihong1 aLin, Jian1 aYu, Qinghua1 aYang, Qian0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 155, no. 3 p.205-210dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2013.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002500137245009600162300001800258500002000276520113900296592002801435650002401463650001001487650001101497650001001508650001301518650001101531650002301542650001801565651001101583700003401594700002801628700002101656700001901677700002001696773009901716856007101815852000901886655001201895IND60569962120221118140319.0170626e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056996212DNAL7 a10.1890/02-06022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPettorelli, Nathalie10aAge and density modify the effects of habitat quality on survival and movements of roe deer  ap. 3307-3316.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe analyzed spatial variations in movements and survival in a roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) population (Chizé, western France) by using recent developments of multistate capture–mark–recapture modeling in order to estimate transition and survival probabilities of individuals living in three habitats of contrasting quality. Irrespective of both population density and sex, habitat quality did not influence survivorship of prime‐age or senescent roe deer. Likewise, habitat quality did not influence fawn survival at low density. On the other hand, fawn survival at high density was 20% higher in the resource‐rich hornbeam‐dominant coppices than in the other poorer habitats. We found, as expected, that fawns were mobile, whereas adults of both sexes were highly sedentary. Movements of roe deer among habitats were markedly influenced by habitat quality. Transition probabilities of individuals from the rich hornbeam coppices toward other habitats were lower than transition probabilities of individuals from the poor beech stand or from the medium‐quality maple dominant coppices toward the rich hornbeam coppices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapreolus capreolus 3aFagus 3aadults 3afawns 3ahabitats 3amodels 3apopulation density 3asurvival rate 3aFrance1 aGaillard, Jean-Michel,d1946-1 aDuncan, Patrick Sheane,1 aMaillard, Daniel1 aVan Laere, Guy1 aDelorme, Daniel0 tEcology.g2003 Dec., v. 84, no. 12 p.3307-3316dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-06023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04302naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003300153245011900186300001400305520331500319592002803634650001303662650002003675650002603695650000903721650001203730650001103742650001403753650001403767651001303781773008603794856008703880852000903967655001203976IND60112032220221119205509.0141110e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011203222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurphy, J. B.q(J. Brendan),10aAppinite suites: A record of the role of water in the genesis, transport, emplacement and crystallization of magma  ap. 35-59.  aThe appinite suite of rocks offers a unique opportunity to study the effect of water on the generation, emplacement and crystallization history of mafic to felsic magma. The suite consists of a group of coeval plutonic and/or hypabyssal rocks, ranging from ultramafic to felsic in composition in which hornblende is the dominant mafic mineral, and typically occurs both as large prismatic phenocrysts and in the finer grained matrix. The suite is also characterized by abundant evidence for mixing and mingling between diverse magma types and variable degrees of contamination by host rock. Field observations corroborate experimental and theoretical studies that the hornblende stability field expands at the expense of olivine and pyroxene with increasing pH₂O in the magma. Textures characteristic of appinites are consistent with rapid growth and with experimental evidence for the reduced viscosity of melts allowing efficient migration of ions to the sites of mineral growth. The appinite suite was originally defined in the Paleozoic Caledonide orogen in Scotland, where it occurs as a number of small shallow crustal bodies that were emplaced after the cessation of subduction and in the immediate aftermath of terrane collision and closure of the Iapetus Ocean. The mafic component is thought to have been triggered by asthenospheric upwelling following stab break-off, and magmas produced have both juvenile and sub-continental lithospheric mantle components. Its compositions have affinities with shoshonites. The felsic components include large batholiths that were probably derived by fractional crystallization. Other appinite suites share some, but not all of these characteristics. Appinite suites apparently range in age from Neo-Archean to Recent, and occur at all crustal levels, at depths of up to 40km. In addition to shoshonites, appinite suites share some similar geochemical features with high-Mg andesites, sanukitoids and adakites. Some common tectonic traits include a tendency to form soon after the cessation of subduction, and the important role of deep crustal faults as conduits for magmas of various compositions to rise towards the surface. These conduits provide the setting for magmas of diverse composition to mix and mingle. Neo-Archean appinites, and their genetic relationship with abundant coeval sanukitoids, have been interpreted as evidence for the existence of some form of plate tectonics at that time. Melting may be triggered by asthenospheric upwelling caused either by slab breakoff (e.g. after terrane or continental collision) or by the generation of a slab window (e.g. where a ridge collides with a subduction zone). Mafic magma may contain a juvenile component, but Nd isotopic data suggest the additional involvement of a sub-continental lithospheric mantle that, in many instances, was previously metasomatized by fluids and magma and was underplated by mafic complexes during subduction. The composition of the mafic magma may vary from one suite to another. In several suites, the mafic magmas have more traditional calc alkalic or tholeiitic affinities and do not share the shoshonitic characteristics of the type area. In addition, in several appinite complexes, felsic magma was formed by crustal anatexis, rather than fractional crystallization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aandesite 3acrystallization 3agenetic relationships 3aions 3amelting 3amixing 3atectonics 3aviscosity 3aScotland0 tEarth-science reviews.g2013 Apr., v. 119 p.35-59dElsevier B.V.x0012-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245011900159300002000278520149900298592002801797650004401825650001401869650002501883650001601908650001401924650001001938650002301948650003901971650001302010650001602023650001802039650001902057650002002076650001402096650001402110650001202124650001902136650003302155653002602188653002302214653001902237653002202256653002702278700001402305700001902319700001702338700001402355700001202369700005402381773014202435856007802577852000902655655001202664IND60679477020221119064942.0191228e20191126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067947702DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b179042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yang10aBiomimetic Color-Changing Hierarchical and Gradient Hydrogel Actuators Based on Salt-Induced Microphase Separation  ap. 48428-48436.  aThere have been more challenges for hydrogel actuators to meet the combined requirement of discoloration, complex deformation, and simple preparation. Structural coloration is widely used to fabricate discolored hydrogel via microrearrangement of photonic crystals in the hydrogel framework. However, precise regulation is usually required. Besides, the macro-optical properties are unstable. Herein, we develop a hierarchical and gradient hydrogel actuator with complex deformation and color-changing functions using an electrophoresis method. A simple but effective strategy is presented for fabrication of hierarchical hydrogel composed of homopolymers and copolymers via salt-induced microphase separation during the polymerization of the N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) and [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride (DMC). Meanwhile a gradient distribution of DMC is also formed during the polymerization due to migration of DMC under electric field. The hierarchical and gradient structures are characterized by confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM), small-angle X-ray scattering measurement (SAXS), temperature-variable Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), etc. The discoloration mechanism is proposed. The as-prepared hydrogel can undergo fast and complex thermo-triggered deformation and discoloration. Bionic movements of discoloration flowering and information encryption are successfully demonstrated, promising great potential in the application of biomimetic materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactuators 3abiomimetic materials 3abiomimetics 3achlorides 3acolor 3acomposite polymers 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3acrystals 3adeformation 3adiscoloration 3aelectric field 3aelectrophoresis 3aflowering 3ahydrogels 3aphotons 3apolymerization 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 0amicrophase separation 0agradient structure 0acolor-changing 0ahydrogel actuator 0atemperature-responsive1 aTian, Fei1 aWang, Xionglei1 aXu, Pingping1 aAn, Wenli1 aHu, Yan1 aXu, Shimei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2217-23350 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Nov. 26, v. 11, no. 51 p.48428-48436dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b179043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04070naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245005200175300001300227520267700240592002802917650002002945650002002965650001202985650001002997650001203007650001903019650001303038650001103051650000903062650002303071650001403094650001503108650001903123650001403142651001703156651001203173651001703185651002503202700002203227700001803249700002203267700002203289700001603311700002003327700002503347773008403372856008703456852000903543655001203552IND60112032320221119205516.0141110e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011203232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarzanti, Eduardo10aProvenance and recycling of Arabian desert sand  ap. 1-19.  aThis study seeks to determine the ultimate origin of aeolian sand in Arabian deserts by high-resolution petrographic and heavy-mineral techniques combined with zircon U–Pb geochronology. Point-counting is used here as the sole method by which unbiased volume percentages of heavy minerals can be obtained. A comprehensive analysis of river and wadi sands from the Red Sea to the Bitlis-Zagros orogen allowed us to characterize all potential sediment sources, and thus to quantitatively constrain provenance of Arabian dune fields. Two main types of aeolian sand can be distinguished. Quartzose sands with very poor heavy-mineral suites including zircon occupy most of the region comprising the Great Nafud and Rub' al-Khali Sand Seas, and are largely recycled from thick Lower Palaeozoic quartzarenites with very minor first-cycle contributions from Precambrian basement, Mesozoic carbonate rocks, or Neogene basalts. Instead, carbonaticlastic sands with richer lithic and heavy-mineral populations characterize coastal dunes bordering the Arabian Gulf from the Jafurah Sand Sea of Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates. The similarity with detritus carried by the axial Tigris–Euphrates system and by transverse rivers draining carbonate rocks of the Zagros indicates that Arabian coastal dunes largely consist of far-travelled sand, deposited on the exposed floor of the Gulf during Pleistocene lowstands and blown inland by dominant Shamal northerly winds. A dataset of detrital zircon U–Pb ages measured on twelve dune samples and two Lower Palaeozoic sandstones yielded fourteen identical age spectra. The age distributions all show a major Neoproterozoic peak corresponding to the Pan-African magmatic and tectonic events by which the Arabian Shield was assembled, with minor late Palaeoproterozoic and Neoarchean peaks. A similar U–Pb signature characterizes also Jafurah dune sands, suggesting that zircons are dominantly derived from interior Arabia, possibly deflated from the Wadi al-Batin fossil alluvial fan or even from Mesozoic sandstones of the Arabian margin accreted to the Cenozoic Zagros orogen. Due to extensive recycling and the fact that zircon is so resistant to weathering and erosion, the U–Pb age signatures are much less powerful a tracer of sedimentary provenance than framework petrography and heavy minerals. Actualistic provenance studies of dune fields at subcontinental scale shed light on the generation and homogenization of aeolian sand, and allow us to trace complex pathways of multistep sediment transport, thus providing crucial independent information for accurate palaeogeographic and palaeoclimatic reconstructions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbonate rocks 3adata collection 3adeserts 3adunes 3afossils 3ahomogenization 3aminerals 3arivers 3asand 3asediment transport 3atectonics 3aweathering 3awind direction 3azirconium 3aPersian Gulf 3aRed Sea 3aSaudi Arabia 3aUnited Arab Emirates1 aVermeesch, Pieter1 aAndò, Sergio1 aVezzoli, Giovanni1 aValagussa, Manuel1 aAllen, Kate1 aKadi, Khalid A.1 aAl-Juboury, Ali I.A.0 tEarth-science reviews.g2013 May, v. 120 p.1-19dElsevier B.V.x0012-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03577naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245013800173300001400311520173900325592002802064650001602092650001202108650002402120650001502144650001302159650002602172650001402198650002202212650002302234650002202257650002102279650001402300650002602314650000902340650001002349650002102359651001002380651001002390653001502400653002502415653001802440653002202458653001702480653002302497653001802520653002002538653001602558653001302574653002402587700002202611700001902633700002402652700003202676700002302708700002402731773009402755856008102849852000902930655001202939IND60698719920221118053951.0200615e20181221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069871992DNAL7 a10.3897/neobiota.41.299652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartín-Forés, Irene10aVariation in phenology and overall performance traits can help to explain the plant invasion process amongst Mediterranean ecosystems  ap. 67-89.  aPlant traits such as phenological development, growth rate, stress tolerance and seeds production may play an important role in the process of acclimatisation to new environments for introduced plants. Experiments that distinguish phenotypic plasticity from ecotypic differentiation would allow an understanding of the role of plant traits in the invasion process. We quantified the variation in phenological and overall performance traits associated with the invasion process for three herbaceous species native to Spain and invasive to Chile (Trifoliumglomeratum, Hypochaerisglabra and Leontodonsaxatilis). We grew plants from native and exotic populations along rainfall gradients in outdoor common gardens, located in the native and the introduced ranges and measured plant survival, phenology (days to flowering), biomass and seed output. Days to flowering was positively correlated with precipitation of the origin population for T.glomeratum and the native populations of H.glabra, but this pattern was not adaptive, as it was not associated with an increase in performance traits of these species. Phenology may instead reflect ecotypic differentiation to the environmental conditions of the original populations. Comparison between ranges (i.e. performance in both common gardens) was only possible for L.saxatilis. This species showed little variation in phenology and both native and exotic populations had higher fitness in the introduced range. This suggests that plasticity enhances invasiveness through increased propagule pressure in the novel environment. Our findings highlight the utility of common garden experiments in examining patterns of phenological and performance traits that relate to species invasiveness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3abiomass 3aecological invasion 3aecosystems 3aecotypes 3aenvironmental factors 3aflowering 3aherbaceous plants 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3aphenology 3aphenotypic plasticity 3arain 3aseeds 3astress tolerance 3aChile 3aSpain 0aAsteraceae 0abiological invasions 0acommon garden 0aHypochaerisglabra 0ainvasiveness 0aLeontodonsaxatilis 0aprecipitation 0arange expansion 0aseed output 0asurvival 0aTrifoliumglomeratum1 aCasado, Miguel A.1 aCastro, Isabel1 aPozo, Alejandro del1 aMolina-Montenegro, Marco A.1 aiguel, José M. de1 acosta-Gallo, Belén0 tNeoBiota.g2018 Dec. 21, v. 41 p.67-89dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2193x1314-24887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.41.299653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014200162520099100304592002801295650001601323650001501339650002301354650001001377650002201387650001701409650001301426650001901439650002501458650001401483650000901497650002201506650002901528653001801557653003301575653001001608653001501618653003001633700001501663700001301678700001701691700001701708700001701725700002101742700001901763700001401782773009801796856008201894852000901976655001201985IND60726844820221120183855.0220830e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072684482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1191272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lei10aNucleotide variation in histone H2BL drives crossalk of histone modification and promotes tumour cell proliferation by upregulating c-Myc  aGene mutations play important roles in tumour development. In this study, we identified a functional histone H2B mutation H2BL-T11C, causing an amino acid variation from Leu to Pro (L3P, H2BL-L3P). Cells overexpressing H2BL-L3P showed stronger proliferation, colony formation, tumourigenic abilities, and a different cell cycle distribution. Meanwhile, the c-Myc expression was elevated as evident by RNA-seq. We further revealed that an H2BK5ac-H2BK120ubi crosstalk which regulates gene transcription. Moreover, EdU staining demonstrated an important role of c-Myc in accelerating cell cycle progression through the G1/S checkpoint, while treatment with 10058-F4, an inhibitor of the c-Myc/MAX interaction, alleviated the abnormal cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution in vitro and partially inhibited tumour growth in vivo. The mutation of amino acid L3P is associated with tumour progression, suggesting patients carrying this SNP may have higher risk of tumour development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahistone code 3ahistones 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasm progression 3aneoplasms 3arisk 3asequence analysis 3atranscription (genetics) 0aH2BL/H2BL-L3P 0aH2BK5ac-H2BK120ubi crosstalk 0ac-Myc 0aCell cycle 0aTumour cell proliferation1 aZhang, Wei1 aSun, Jin1 aLiu, Kui-nan1 aGan, Zhi-xue1 aLiu, Yu-zhou1 aChang, Jian-feng1 aYang, Xiao-mei1 aSun, Feng0 tLife sciences.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 271 p.119127-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1191273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008200168300001400250520189100264592002802155650002202183650001102205650002402216650001402240650002602254650001202280650001502292650001302307650002202320650001702342700002002359700001802379700001502397700002302412773013702435856008302572852000902655655001202664IND60542767720221122044109.0190405e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054276772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2014.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Mil, H.G.J.12aA complex system approach to address world challenges in food and agriculture  ap. 20-32.  aThe quality and amount of the world food supply is crucial to the well-being of every human on the planet in the basic sense that we need food to live. It also has a profound impact on world economy, international trade, and global political stability. The choice of land used for agriculture, and the livestock and plants raised on the land, will impact the sustainable use of global resources. On a global scale, there are communities where insufficient food causes nutritional deficiencies, and at the same time, there are other communities eating too much food leading to obesity. Both conditions have accompanying diseases with associated financial consequences.The above issues relate to various scales, from local to global, and to a range of scientific disciplines. Moreover, their various elements are part of an interdependent, continuously changing, and adaptive system. This implies that the response of a combination of individual elements cannot usually be inferred from the response of each individual element or subsystem. This makes the identification of an appropriate intervention to change one or more elements a complex problem.We propose that a complex system approach should be used to address the global challenges of the agriculture and food system. The complex system approach accounts for the needs of stakeholders and policymakers in the agriculture and food system, and helps to determine which research programs will enable stakeholders to better anticipate and respond to emerging developments in the world. Moreover, the approach will enable them to determine effective intervention strategies to simultaneously optimise and safeguard their interests and the interests of the environment. The approach is formulated in terms of a roadmap of procedures. It encompasses an array of methods utilised in an integrative multi-scale and inter-disciplinary way.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood supply chain 3ahumans 3ainternational trade 3alivestock 3anutrient deficiencies 3aobesity 3aovereating 3apolitics 3aresearch programs 3astakeholders1 aFoegeding, E.A.1 aWindhab, E.J.1 aPerrot, N.1 avan der Linden, E.0 tTrends in food science & technology.g2014 Nov., v. 40, no. 1 p.20-32dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2014.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013200170300001600302520145700318592002801775650001301803650001101816650001301827650003601840650001501876650001601891650001501907650001201922650001301934650001201947650001101959650002001970650001601990650001602006653001002022653002802032653003902060653002202099653004002121700005302161773011602214856008602330852000902416655001202425IND60615712020221120222123.0181012e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061571202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2018.09.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Guobin10aThree-dimensional multi-phase simulation of PEMFC at high current density utilizing Eulerian-Eulerian model and two-fluid model  ap. 409-421.  aA 3D (three-dimensional) multi-phase model of PEMFC (proton exchange membrane fuel cell) is developed, in which the Eulerian-Eulerian model is utilized to solve the gas and liquid two-phase flow in channels, while the two-fluid model is adopted in porous electrodes. Hence, the surface tension, wall adhesion and drag force in channels are all included. Besides, the gravity effects in the whole PEMFC are also taken into consideration. It is found that the water vapor concentration in cathode channel at high inlet humidity (e.g. 1.0) will be much higher than the saturation concentration if neglecting the water vapor condensation. In addition, the liquid water condensed from vapor in channel is mainly blown to side walls, rather than only exist on the bottom surface. The effect of water condensation and evaporation in channel is found to be lower than that in porous electrodes because of the much higher gas velocity in channel. Besides, the partial low temperature is likely to cause local liquid water accumulation in both anode and cathode channels and porous electrodes. Meanwhile, the wave-like channel is found to be able to remove the liquid water effectively due to the enhanced convection effect. Meanwhile, the simulation results in this study show that the serpentine flow field is much more beneficial to the liquid water removal and reactant gas distribution than parallel flow field, which results in the much higher performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aanodes 3acathodes 3acondensation (phase transition) 3aconvection 3aevaporation 3afuel cells 3agravity 3ahumidity 3aliquids 3amodels 3asurface tension 3atemperature 3awater vapor 0aPEMFC 0aEulerian-Eulerian model 0aWater condensation and evaporation 0aWave-like channel 0aParallel and serpentine flow fields1 aJiao, Kui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1296-13300 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 176 p.409-421dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.09.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008000171300001800251520175100269592002802020596008402048596008702132596004402219650002902263650002402292650001502316650001202331650002202343650001002365650001402375650002202389651001402411700002002425700002202445700006002467773013402527856008102661852000902742655001202751IND60614163520221118011246.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061416352DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-018-1745-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiuffo, Mariana C.10aResponse of native and non-native ruderals to natural and human disturbance  ap. 2915-2925.  aThe ruderal strategy is widely shared among non-native plants, providing a general explanation for the commonly observed positive effects of disturbance on invasions. How native ruderals respond to disturbance and how their abundance compares to that of non-native ruderals remains, however, poorly understood. Similarly, little is known about the role that disturbance type plays in the coexistence between native and non-native ruderals. We proposed that natural disturbance favors native over non-native ruderals, whereas novel anthropogenic disturbance favors non-natives over natives. To assess our general hypothesis, we conducted extensive field samplings in which we measured relative abundance, richness, and diversity of native and non-native ruderals in sites with natural and anthropogenic disturbance in central Argentina, a system where the ruderal strategy is common to a large number of native and non-native species. We found that natives dominated ruderal communities growing in recently burned grasslands, whereas non-natives dominated in roadsides. Additionally, the richness and diversity of native ruderal species were much greater than those of non-natives in sites with fire and in sites with grazing, but species richness and diversity did not differ between groups in roadsides. Because vegetation evolved with fire in our system and, in contrast, the construction and maintenance of roads is recent in it, these results support our hypothesis. Our work indicates that the ruderal strategy does not seem to suffice to explain why disturbance facilitates invasions. According to our data, species origin interacts with disturbance type to determine dominance in communities with coexisting native and non-native ruderals.  aPublisher supplied data  aPICT PIDRI 2007 0287cAgencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica  aPIP 114 201101 00206cConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas  aCN219cUniversidad Nacional de La Pampa 3aanthropogenic activities 3aecological invasion 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3aintroduced plants 3aroads 3aroadsides 3aspecies diversity 3aArgentina1 aCock, Marina C.1 aPrina, Aníbal O.1 aHierro, José L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6678-61870 tBiological invasions.g2018 Oct., v. 20, no. 10 p.2915-2925dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-018-1745-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011100168300001300279520158500292592002801877650001101905650001701916650002201933650002101955650002101976650001301997650001102010650001502021650002202036650001602058650001702074650001002091653002702101653001502128653001502143653002302158653002002181700002602201700001602227773009202243856008102335852000902416655001202425IND60698720120221120074149.0200615e20190206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069872012DNAL7 a10.3897/neobiota.42.307972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanetta, F. Dane10aIdentifying thresholds and ceilings in plant community recovery for optimal management of widespread weeds  ap. 1-18.  aA substantial body of work underlies the theory and practice of early intervention in the management of invasive alien plants, but less attention has been paid to the strategic management of widespread weeds, especially in the context of natural asset recovery. The assumption lingers amongst some researchers and land managers that removing weeds will automatically lead to positive biodiversity outcomes, with the more weed removed, the better the outcome. However, this is often not the case, particularly for long-established weed species whose dominance has created impoverished communities with little capacity for passive recovery. A common result may be wasted investment in weed control and, in the extreme, net negative impacts upon asset values. We present a conceptual model for the management of weed-impacted assets, plus guidance for its application, with a view to improving asset recovery practice. Weed removal should be calibrated by asset recovery, which may mean not seeking to completely remove a weed at a given spatial scale. Our model focusses on weed removal that is enough to initiate asset recovery, but not more than is necessary to promote maximum expression of asset resilience, particularly in the context of secondary invasions. Optimal management efficiency will involve a proportional allocation of resources to control, monitoring and revegetation activities that is appropriate to the stage of asset recovery, as well as a willingness to revise a management goal if the original one cannot be achieved within existing constraints on resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3abiodiversity 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3aland restoration 3amanagers 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aplant communities 3aresearchers 3aweed control 3aweeds 0anatural asset recovery 0aresilience 0aresistance 0asecondary invasion 0aweed management1 aO’Loughlin, Luke S.1 aGooden, Ben0 tNeoBiota.g2019 Feb. 6, v. 42 p.1-18dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2193x1314-24887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.42.307973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03521naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245017100175500001900346520167200365592002802037650002502065650000902090650002302099650002002122650000902142650001602151650001402167650001402181650002702195650002302222650001402245650002302259650000902282650001202291650001702303650002802320650000902348650002502357650002502382650001602407653001702423653001502440653001902455653002102474653001502495700002102510700002702531700002302558700002402581700002102605700001802626700002802644700002202672773012102694856008302815852000902898655001202907IND60697140620221120175948.0200809e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069714062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpc.2020.1088032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaldissera, Matheus D.10aDietary ochratoxin A (OTA) decreases growth performance and impairs muscle antioxidant system and meat fatty acid profiles in juvenile tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPlant-based ingredients are successfully replacing fishmeal in fish feeds. However, this practice increases the risk of feed contamination by mycotoxins that reduce production and heath associated with oxidative damage. The aim of this study was to determine whether feed contaminated with environmentally relevant concentrations of ochratoxin A (OTA) causes muscle oxidative damage in tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum), and to determine whether this feed impairs fatty acid profiles in fish meat. Final mean weight, weight gain, daily weight gain, feed efficiency, and specific growth rate were significantly lower in fish fed 1.6 and 2.4 mg OTA/kg compared to those fed basal diet, while feed conversion was significantly higher in these same groups compared to the basal group. Levels of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation in muscle were significantly higher in fish fed 1.6 and 2.4 mg OTA/kg compared to those in the basal group. Likewise, muscle superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities were significantly higher in fish fed 1.6 and 2.4 mg OTA/kg then in those fed basal feed. The total content of saturated fatty acids was significantly higher, and total content of polyunsaturated fatty acids was significantly lower in fish fed 2.4 mg OTA/kg compared to those fed basal feed. Taken together, the data suggest that OTA-contaminated feed induces oxidative damage and disturbs enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant responses in tambaqui meat. The perturbations of fatty acid profiles in fish meat appears to mediated by oxidative damage, representing negative impact on fish health and presenting concerns for consumers of fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColossoma macropomum 3adiet 3afeed contamination 3afeed conversion 3afish 3afish health 3afish meal 3afish meat 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agrowth performance 3ajuveniles 3alipid peroxidation 3ameat 3amuscles 3aochratoxin A 3areactive oxygen species 3arisk 3aspecific growth rate 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aweight gain 0aFish quality 0aMycotoxins 0aFish consumers 0aOxidative damage 0aToxicology1 aSouza, Carine F.1 ada Silva, Jefferson A.1 aBarroso, Danilo C.1 aGlória, Eduardo M.1 aMesadri, Juliana1 aWagner, Roger1 aBaldisserotto, Bernardo1 aVal, Adalberto L.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2020 Oct., v. 236 p.108803-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12414x1532-04567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpc.2020.1088033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245006200165300001800227520124500245592002801490650002201518650001701540650002601557650001101583650002301594650001301617700002201630700005801652773013601710856008001846852000901926655001201935IND60605563420221123032542.0180721e20180116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060556342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b118002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiswas, Mithun10aMetadynamics Enhanced Markov Modeling of Protein Dynamics  ap. 5508-5514.  aEnhanced sampling techniques represent a versatile approach to account for rare conformational transitions in biomolecules. A particularly promising strategy is to combine massive parallel computing of short molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories (to sample the free energy landscape of the system) with Markov state modeling (to rebuild the kinetics from the sampled data). To obtain well-distributed initial structures for the short trajectories, it is proposed to employ metadynamics MD, which quickly sweeps through the entire free energy landscape of interest. Being only used to generate initial conformations, the implementation of metadynamics can be simple and fast. The conformational dynamics of helical peptide Aib₉ is adopted to discuss various technical issues of the approach, including metadynamics settings, minimal number and length of short MD trajectories, and the validation of the resulting Markov models. Using metadynamics to launch some thousands of nanosecond trajectories, several Markov state models are constructed that reveal that previous unbiased MD simulations of in total 16 μs length cannot provide correct equilibrium populations or qualitative features of the pathway distribution of the short peptide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aMarkov chain 3abiochemical compounds 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3asampling1 aLickert, Benjamin1 aStock, Gerhard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3302-30440 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Jan. 16, v. 122, no. 21 p.5508-5514dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b118003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01889naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245009000207300001600297520072600313592002801039650001501067650002601082650001801108650001601126650001001142650002001152650001801172700002301190700005801213700006301271773012501334856008301459852000901542655001201551IND60542768020221120215141.0190405e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054276802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2014.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarriner, Keith1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6742-481510aDevelopments in nanoparticles for use in biosensors to assess food safety and quality  ap. 183-199.  aThe following will provide an overview on how advances in nanoparticle technology have contributed towards developing biosensors to screen for safety and quality markers associated with foods.

However, there is no evidence of Ka on metabolic disorder in former studies. This study investigated the effects of Ka on glycolipid metabolism and explored the underlying mechanisms of action in vivo and vitro. The mouse model of glycolipid metabolism disorder was induced by high-fat diet (HFD). The effects of Ka were evaluated on bodyweight, lipid metabolism and glucose metabolism. Hypolipidemic effect was examined by blood sample analysis. The hypoglycemic effect was detected by several indicators, like blood glucose, serum insulin, HOMA index and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTT). The signaling pathways of lipid metabolism (PPARγ/LXRα/ABCA1) and glucose metabolism (PPARγ/PI3K/AKT) were evaluated using Real-Time PCR and Western blot. The primary culture of hepatocyte was prepared to confirm the target of Ka by co-culturing with PPARγ agonist or inhibitor. The HFD mice developed obesity, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. Administration of Ka at a dose of 10 mg/kg.BW for 16 weeks effectively attenuated these changes. Further studies revealed the hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic effects of Ka depended on the activation of PPARγ/LXRα/ABCA1 and PPARγ/PI3K/AKT pathways, respectively. The primary hepatocyte test, co-cultured with PPARγ agonists or inhibitors, further confirmed the above signaling pathway and key protein. These results suggested that Ka played an important role in improving glycolipid metabolism disorder. These favorable effects were causally associated with anti-obesity. The underlying mechanisms might have to do with the activation of the PPARγ and its downstream signaling pathway. Our study helped to understand the pharmacological actions of Ka, and played a role for Ka in the effective treatment of obesity, diabetes, nonalcoholic hepatitis and other metabolic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTagetes erecta 3aWestern blotting 3aactive ingredients 3aagonists 3aantioxidants 3ablood glucose 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acoculture 3adiabetes 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3aglycemic effect 3aglycolipids 3ahepatitis 3ahigh fat diet 3ahyperglycemia 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alipemic effect 3alipid metabolism 3amice 3aobesity 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 0aKaempferide 0aGlycolipid metabolism 0aObesity 0aPPARγ1 aZeng, Qingfu1 aTang, Ting1 aWei, Yunjie1 aPu, Peng0 tLife sciences.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 270 p.119133-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1191333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002400159245006600183300001600249500000900265520105300274592002801327650001201355650002301367650002101390650001301411650002101424650001401445650001501459650001901474650001401493650000901507650000901516650000901525650001301534650001501547651001001562700002101572700002101593700002501614773020601639856009401845852000901939655001201948IND60666441420221120132419.0191028e198001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066644142DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1980.00472425000900010034x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSorensen, Darwin L.10aDetermining the Lime Requirement for the Blackbird Mine Spoil  ap. 162-166.  aepub  aThe production of acid from oxidation of pyritic inclusions in mineral mine spoil prevents the revegetation of the overburden and the amelioration of secondary environmental damage due to erosion and/or leaching of this toxic (soluble heavy metal-bearing) material. A total lime requirement must be determined and met in order to control existing acidity and to prevent reacidification as oxidation of pyritic materials in the mine spoil continues. The total lime requirement consists of the summation of the amount of ground limestone needed to neutralize the acidity present due to the buffer capacity of the soil, the acidity generated from complete oxidation of the sulfide-sulfur in the fine, highly reactive fraction (fine sand, silt, and clay-size particles) of the soil, and the oxidation of sulfide-sulfur exposed by weathering of larger size material.

However, the role played by ADAM10 in pituitary adenomas is currently unknown, and what factors orchestrate the activation of ADAM10 in this kind of tumor is also unclear. Here, we found that SRC kinase is an ADAM10‐interacting partner and that SRC kinase activity is required for this interaction. As a new positive regulator promoting the shedding activity of ADAM10, SRC could compete with calmodulin 1 (CALM1) for ADAM10 binding in a mutually exclusive manner. Strikingly, the interaction between ADAM10 and CALM1 is regulated by SRC activity. Furthermore, we proved that the cytoplasmic region of ADAM10 is required for the shedding activity of ADAM10 upon SRC activation. As a proof‐of‐concept, we discovered that the combination of ADAM10 and SRC inhibitors can inhibit cell proliferation and migration to a great extent. Thus, our findings shed light on a novel therapeutic strategy to block the tumorigenesis and migration of pituitary adenoma.  aPublisher supplied data  a81372716cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81672491cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aadenoma 3acalmodulin 3acarcinogenesis 3acell proliferation 3ametalloproteinases 3atherapeutics1 aPan, Yuan1 aHu, Guohan1 aSun, Wei1 aJiang, Lei1 aWang, Peng1 aDing, Xuehua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7117-03280 tFEBS journal.g2020 Jan., v. 287, no. 1 p.190-204dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.150263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02134naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245008500164300001800249520105000267592002801317650001501345650001101360650001101371650002401382650001801406653001701424653002701441653002001468653003301488700001801521700002001539700001801559700001701577773007301594856008401667852000901751655001201760IND60562709020221117224524.0170719e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056270902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.06.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Xin10aMulti-objective optimization of wind turbine blades using lifting surface method  ap. 1111-1121.  aThis paper describes a multi-objective optimization method for the design of horizontal axis wind turbines using the lifting surface method as the performance prediction model. The aerodynamic code for the design method is based on the lifting surface method with a prescribed wake model for the description of the wake. A multi-objective optimization algorithm approach is employed for the optimization of wind turbine blades with 3D stacking line (swept leaned blades). The (NSGA II) Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II is used to facilitate the multi-objective optimization and to find the global optima of high-dimensional problems. The scope of the optimization method is to achieve the best trade off of the following objectives: maximum of annual energy production and minimum of blade loads including thrust and blade rood flap-wise moment. To illustrate how the optimization of the blade is carried out the procedure is applied to NREL Phase VI rotor. The result shows the optimization models can provide more efficient designs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenergy 3amodels 3asystem optimization 3awind turbines 0aWind turbine 0aLifting surface method 0aFree wake model 0aMulti-objective optimization1 aChen, Jin'ge,1 aZhu, Xiao-Cheng1 aLiu, Peng-Yin1 aDu, Zhao-Hui0 tEnergy.g2015 Oct., v. 90 p.1111-1121dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.06.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01966naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245006500158300001800223520093100241592002801172650001501200650001501215650001401230650001501244650001701259650001101276650001101287650003001298700002001328700002701348700002101375700001701396773010701413856007501520852000901595655001201604IND60532718820221118001044.0160728e20120409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053271882DNAL7 a10.1021/bm201771m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrelma, Hannes10aCMC-Modified Cellulose Biointerface for Antibody Conjugation  ap. 1051-1058.  aIn this Article, we present a new strategy for preparing an antihemoglobin biointerface on cellulose. The preparation method is based on functionalization of the cellulose surface by the irreversible adsorption of CMC, followed by covalent linking of antibodies to CMC. This would provide the means for affordable and stable cellulose-based biointerfaces for immunoassays. The preparation and characterization of the biointerface were studied on Langmuir–Schaefer cellulose model surfaces in real time using the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation and surface plasmon resonance techniques. The stable attachment of antihemoglobin to adsorbed CMC was achieved, and a linear calibration of hemoglobin was obtained. CMC modification was also observed to prevent nonspecific protein adsorption. The antihemoglobin-CMC surface regenerated well, enabling repeated immunodetection cycles of hemoglobin on the same surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aantibodies 3acellulose 3ahemoglobin 3aimmunoassays 3amodels 3aquartz 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aTeerinen, Tuija1 aJohansson, Leena-Sisko1 aHolappa, Susanna1 aLaine, Janne0 tBiomacromolecules.g2012 Apr. 09, v. 13, no. 4 p.1051-1058dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm201771m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04042naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006500147245012100212300001600333520178000349536056202129592002802691596016402719650001602883650001902899650001102918650001102929650001502940650001402955650001702969650001002986650002002996650000903016650001403025650001603039653001403055653002403069653001503093653002303108700002603131700002003157700006003177700005603237700002103293700001803314773011303332856008203445852000903527655001203536IND60789331520221119074755.0220819e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078933152DNAL7 a10.1177/002367722110729772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiedesel, Ann-Kristin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7901-126810aBurrowing behaviour of rats: Strain differences and applicability as well-being parameter after intracranial surgery  ap. 356-369.  aIn mice, burrowing is considered a species-typical parameter for assessing well-being, while this is less clear in rats. This exploratory study evaluated burrowing behaviour in three rat strains during training and in the direct postoperative phase after complex intracranial surgery in different neuroscience rat models established at Hannover Medical School or Aachen University Hospital. Male Crl:CD (SD; n = 18), BDIX/UlmHanZtm (BDIX; n = 8) and RjHan:WI (Wistar; n = 35) rats were individually trained to burrow gravel out of a tube on four consecutive days. Thereafter, BDIX rats were subjected to intracranial injection of BT4Ca cells and tumour resection (rat glioma model), SD rats to injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or vehicle (rat Parkinson’s disease model) and Wistar rats to endovascular perforation or sham surgery (rat subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) model). Burrowing was retested on the day after surgery. During training, BDIX rats burrowed large amounts (mean of 2370 g on the fourth day), while SD and Wistar rats burrowed less gravel (means of 846 and 520 g, respectively). Burrowing increased significantly during training only in Wistar rats. Complex surgery, that is, tumour resection (BDIX), 6-OHDA injection (SD) and endovascular perforation or sham surgery for SAH (Wistar) significantly reduced burrowing and body weight, while simple stereotactic injection of tumour cells or vehicle did not affect burrowing. Despite the training, burrowing differed between the strains. In the direct postoperative phase, burrowing was reduced after complex surgery, indicating reduced well-being. Reduced burrowing was accompanied with postoperative weight loss, a validated and recognised quantitative measure for severity assessment.  aFunding The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This study was funded by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft – DFG, grant number SCHW1176/7-1, SCHW1176/7-2 to KS, LI588/5-1, LI 588/5-2 to UL, and TO542/5-1, TO542/6-1 to RT) as part of the German research unit ‘Severity assessment in animal based research’ FOR 2591.

Modeling potential invasion of an introduced organism becomes a critical tool for early management of damaging species, such as kudzu bug, Megacopta cribraria (F.) (Hemiptera:Heteroptera:Plataspidae). Since it was first found in the United States in 2009, kudzu bug has spread rapidly, economically impacted agricultural production, and became a household pest. To better predict the potential invasion of kudzu bug in North and South America, we used the species distribution models Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Production (GARP) and Maximum Entropy (Maxent). We used the D metric to test for niche equivalency and similarity between native and invaded populations of kudzu bug. We found that kudzu bugs currently occupied unequal environmental space between the two ranges. Therefore, distribution models using GARP and Maxent were constructed using occurrences in both native and invaded ranges. Area under the curve (AUC), true skill statistics (TSS), and omission rate (OR) were used to evaluate and compare the models. Results indicated both models had good performance, but Maxent (AUC = 0.971, TSS = 0.946, OR = 0.019) performed better than GARP (AUC = 0.922, TSS = 0.860, OR = 0.037). This research confirmed the effectiveness of using occurrence data in both ranges to predict potential invasions. Kudzu bugs prefer warm (annual mean temperature around 15 °C) and humid (annual mean precipitation around 1300 mm) regions. Distribution models generated by both methods indicated similar regions with high invasion risk. Management programs that include quarantine and prevention measures are suggested for these regions to avoid outbreaks of kudzu bug.  aPublisher supplied data  a201500090025cChina Scholarship Council 3aMegacopta cribraria 3aalgorithms 3abiogeography 3aecological invasion 3aecosystems 3ahuman health 3amodels 3aprediction 3aquarantine 3arisk 3atemperature 3aSouth America 3aUnited States1 aTran, Liem1 aWashington-Allen, Robert1 aWiggins, Gregory1 aStewart, Scott1 aVogt, James1 aGrant, Jerome0 tBiological invasions.g2018 Oct., v. 20, no. 10 p.2899-2913dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-018-1743-y3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02077naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245011100180300001600291520094200307592002801249653001001277653001201287653002201299653000801321653001201329653002101341653001101362653001301373653002801386653000801414653001801422653002601440700002401466773011801490856008601608852000901694655001201703IND60602571120221120195835.0180711e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060257112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2014.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuangtrakoon, Natthawut10aDevelopment and performance of steam ejector refrigeration system operated in real application in Thailand  ap. 142-152.  aThis paper presents the design and construction of a prototype steam ejector refrigeration system which can be operated under the actual condition of Thai environment, which is rather hot and humid. The prototype refrigerator was designed to produce a cooling capacity of approximately 3 kW. Water was selected to be used as the working fluid. The steam boiler used was a vertical fire tube type and it was designed to be used with LPG compact gas burner. The condenser was cooled by water obtained from a conventional cooling tower. The prototype refrigerator was used to produce chilled water which was used to cool a small tested room. It was observed that the room temperature of 24.2 °C was obtained at the cooling load of 3000 W. The cooling water was supplied to the condenser at about 30 °C. The COP obtained was 0.45. This prototype refrigerator is proven to be practical and can be used in actual environment of Thailand.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSteam 0aEjector 0aJet refrigeration 0aCFD 0aChiller 0aAir-conditioning 0aVapeur 0aEjecteur 0aRéfrigération par jet 0aCFD 0aRefroidisseur 0aConditionnement d'air1 aAphornratana, Satha0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2014 Dec., v. 48 p.142-152dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2014.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010000157300001800257520114200275592002801417650004401445650002501489650001601514650001901530650001001549650001101559650001301570650001701583650001701600650001801617650001101635650001901646650001901665650002601684650001901710650001301729650001101742650001501753650001601768650002301784700002001807700002201827700001801849700001901867700002201886773010701908856007502015852000902090655001202099IND60532718920171127000000.0160728e20120409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053271892DNAL7 a10.1021/bm201776r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoyer, Birgit10aBiomimetically Mineralized Salmon Collagen Scaffolds for Application in Bone Tissue Engineering  ap. 1059-1066.  aBiomimetic mineralization of collagen is an advantageous method to obtain resorbable collagen/hydroxy-apatite composites for application in bone regeneration. In this report, established procedures for mineralization of bovine collagen were adapted to a new promising source of collagen from salmon skin challenged by the low denaturation temperature. Therefore, in the first instance, variation of temperature, collagen concentration, and ionic strength was performed to reveal optimized parameters for fibrillation and simultaneous mineralization of salmon collagen. Porous scaffolds from mineralized salmon collagen were prepared by controlled freeze-drying and chemical cross-linking. FT-IR analysis demonstrated the mineral phase formed during the preparation process to be hydroxyapatite. The scaffolds exhibited interconnecting porosity, were sufficiently stable under cyclic compression, and showed elastic mechanical properties. Human mesenchymal stem cells were able to adhere to the scaffolds, cell number increased during cultivation, and osteogenic differentiation was demonstrated in terms of alkaline phosphatase activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abiomimetics 3abone formation 3abones 3acattle 3acollagen 3acrosslinking 3adenaturation 3afreeze drying 3ahumans 3ahydroxyapatite 3aionic strength 3amechanical properties 3amineralization 3aporosity 3asalmon 3astem cells 3atemperature 3atissue engineering1 aBernhardt, Anne1 aHeinemann, Sascha1 aStachel, Ines1 aMeyer, Michael1 aGelinsky, Michael0 tBiomacromolecules.g2012 Apr. 09, v. 13, no. 4 p.1059-1066dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm201776r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03538naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002200181245016100203300001600364500001900380500002000399506007600419520191900495592002802414596006402442506003702506650002202543650001702565650002702582650001402609650002302623650001402646650001302660650001002673650001202683650001502695700006202710700002002772700001902792700005902811773011502870856007402985852000903059655001203068IND60681340820221207122307.0200115e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068134082DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.149972doi7 aPMC69447582pmcid7 a313029382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaciak, Adrian R.10aStructural and biochemical consequences of pyridoxine‐dependent epilepsy mutations that target the aldehyde binding site of aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH7A1  ap. 173-189.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn humans, certain mutations in the gene encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase 7A1 are associated with pyridoxine‐dependent epilepsy (PDE). Understanding the impact of PDE‐causing mutations on the structure and activity of ALDH7A1 could allow for the prediction of symptom‐severity and aid the development of patient‐specific medical treatments. Herein, we investigate the biochemical and structural consequences of PDE missense mutations targeting residues in the aldehyde substrate binding site: N167S, P169S, A171V, G174V, and W175G. All but G174V could be purified for biochemical and X‐ray crystallographic analysis. W175G has a relatively mild kinetic defect, exhibiting a fivefold decrease in kcₐₜ with no change in Kₘ. P169S and N167S have moderate defects, characterized by catalytic efficiencies of 20‐ and 100‐times lower than wild‐type, respectively. A171V has a profound functional defect, with catalytic efficiency 2000‐times lower than wild‐type. The crystal structures of the variants are the first for any PDE‐associated mutant of ALDH7A1. The structures show that missense mutations that decrease the steric bulk of the side chain tend to create a cavity in the active site. The protein responds by relaxing into the vacant space, and this structural perturbation appears to cause misalignment of the aldehyde substrate in W175G and N167S. The P169S structure is nearly identical to that of the wild‐type enzyme; however, analysis of B‐factors suggests the catalytic defect may result from altered protein dynamics. The A171V structure suggests that the potential for steric clash with Val171 prevents Glu121 from ion pairing with the amino group of the aldehyde substrate.

A disc-shaped porous Ni metal catalyst, namely Al[0.1]/Ni, was prepared by a simple method and a compact MCR (micro-channel reactor) equipped with a catalyst plate was designed for the CCR. CO2 and H2 concentrations of 98.68% and 0.46%, respectively, were achieved at an operating temperature of 400 °C, GHSV (gas-hourly space velocity) of 50,000 h−1 and a H2/O2 ratio (R/O) of 2 in the unit module. In the case of the MCR, a sheet of the Ni metal catalyst was easily installed along with the other metal plates and the concentration of CO2 in the retentate gas increased up to 96.7%. The differences in temperatures measured before and after the CCR were 31 °C at the product outlet and 19 °C at the N2 outlet in the MCR. The disc-shaped porous metal catalyst and MCR configuration used in this study exhibit potential advantages, such as high thermal transfer resulting in improved energy recovery rate, simple catalyst preparation, and easy installation of the catalyst in the MCR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3acatalysts 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aenergy recovery 3ahydrogen 3anickel 3atemperature 0aCatalytic combustion 0aCO2 enrichment 0aCO2/H2 membrane 0aMetal catalyst 0aMicro-channel reactor1 aPark, J.

The Pesticide Toxicity Index (PTI) was used to estimate the potential chronic and acute toxicity to three taxonomic groups – fish, cladocerans, and benthic invertebrates. For invertebrates (either cladocerans, benthic invertebrates, or both), the maximum PTI score exceeded the predicted acute toxicity screening level at 18 of the 72 sites (25%) at some point during WY 2013–2017. The predicted toxicity of a single pesticide compound was found to overwhelm the toxicity of other pesticides in the mixtures after concentrations were toxicity weighted. For this study, about 71%, 72%, and 92% of the Fish-, Cladoceran-, and Benthic Invertebrate-PTI scores, respectively, had one pesticide compound primarily contributing to sample potential toxicity (>50%).There were 17 (13 insecticides, 2 herbicides, 1 fungicide, and 1 synergist) of the 221 pesticide compounds analyzed that were the primary drivers of potential toxicity in each water sample in which the PTI and TUmax (toxic unit score for the pesticide that makes the single largest contribution to the PTI) scores were above predicted chronic (>0.1) or acute (>1) toxicity levels for one of the three taxa. For cladocerans and benthic invertebrates, the drivers of predicted chronic (>0.1) and acute (>1) PTIs were mostly insecticides. For cladocerans, the pesticide compounds driving the PTI scores were bifenthrin, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dichlorvos, dicrotophos, diflubenzuron, flubendiamide, and tebupirimfos. For benthic invertebrates, atrazine (an herbicide), as well as the insecticides – bifenthrin, carbaryl, carbofuran, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dichlorvos, fipronil, imidacloprid, and methamidophos – were the drivers of predicted toxicity. For fish, there were three pesticide types that contributed the most to predicted chronic (>0.1) PTIs – acetochlor, an herbicide; carbendazim, a fungicide degradate; and piperonylbutoxide, a synergist.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladocera 3aUnited States Geological Survey 3aacetochlor 3aacute toxicity 3aatrazine 3abifenthrin 3acarbaryl 3acarbendazim 3acarbofuran 3achlorpyrifos 3adiazinon 3adichlorvos 3adicrotophos 3adiflubenzuron 3aenvironment 3afipronil 3afish 3aflubendiamide 3afungicides 3aimidacloprid 3aland use 3amethamidophos 3atebupirimfos 3awater quality 0aALB 0aEC50 0aLC50 0aMCR 0aMSQA 0aNWALT 0aNAWQA 0aNWIS 0aNWQN 0aPTI 0aSAS 0aTU 0aTUmax 0aUSEPA 0aUSGS 0aWY 0aPesticide toxicity 0aSurface water 0aAquatic health 0aScreening assessment 0aStressor 0aPesticide toxicity index1 aShoda, Megan E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5343-97171 aStackpoole, Sarah,1 aStone, Wesley W.0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Nov. 25, v. 745 p.141285-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1412853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010000165300001400265520178900279592002802068650002502096650002502121650002202146650002202168650002102190650001602211653001802227653002502245653002502270653002602295653002202321653002002343700001802363773009402381856008102475852000902556655001202565IND60698720820221121222906.0200615e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069872082DNAL7 a10.3897/neobiota.43.301222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartz, Robert10aAssessing the environmental impacts of invasive alien plants: a review of assessment approaches  ap. 69-99.  aAssessing the impacts of alien plant species is a major task in invasion science and vitally important for supporting invasion-related policies. Since 1993, a range of assessment approaches have been developed to support decisions on the introduction or management of alien species. Here we review the extent to which assessments (27 approaches) appraised the following: (i) different types of environmental impacts, (ii) context dependence of environmental impacts, (iii) prospects for successful management, and (iv) transparency of assessment methods and criteria, underlying values and terminology. While nearly all approaches covered environmental effects, changes in genetic diversity and the incorporation of relevant impact parameters were less likely to be included. Many approaches considered context dependence by incorporating information about the actual or potential range of alien species. However, only a few went further and identified which resources of conservation concern might be affected by specific alien plant species. Only some approaches acknowledged underlying values by distinguishing negative from positive impacts or by considering the conservation value of affected resources. Several approaches directly addressed the feasibility of management, whereas relevant factors such as availability of suitable management methods were rarely considered. Finally, underlying values were rarely disclosed, and definitions of value-laden or controversial terms were often lacking. We conclude that despite important progress in assessing the manifold facets of invasion impacts, opportunities remain for further developing impact assessment approaches. These changes can improve assessment results and their acceptance in invasion-related environmental policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental policy 3agenetic variation 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3aterminology 0aAlien species 0abiological invasions 0aenvironmental damage 0aenvironmental impacts 0aimpact assessment 0arisk assessment1 aKowarik, Ingo0 tNeoBiota.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 43 p.69-99dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2193x1314-24887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.43.301223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01853naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245011100207300001300318520066300331592002800994650002001022650001101042650001801053650001601071650002001087650001101107650001801118650002001136650002601156700002101182700002201203700001601225700002401241773012201265856008301387852000901470655001201479IND60542768820221120194302.0190405e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054276882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2014.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardoso, Carlos1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7273-067610aBioaccessibility assessment methodologies and their consequences for the risk–benefit evaluation of food  ap. 5-23.  aThe in vitro techniques provide deeper insight into the phenomena underlying bioaccessibility.

However, a consensus on the definition of cost-effectiveness does not yet exist in the literature. For some authors, cost-effectiveness refers to the minimisation of RES-E generation costs, but others define it as the minimisation of the costs of RES-E support. This paper compares the two main interpretations of this concept using a mathematical model. The optimisation problems of both approaches are formally stated, the corresponding optimality conditions are obtained, the optimal solutions of both approaches are compared and some rent transfer mechanisms from consumers to producers are proposed. It is shown that the minimisation of generation costs does not imply that consumer costs are minimised, and that the minimisation of consumer costs does not imply that generation costs are minimised. In addition, two types of mechanisms of transfer of rents from consumers to producers which lead to the same optimal solution for both approaches are proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3aelectricity 3amathematical models 3arenewable energy sources 0aRenewable electricity 0aCost-effectiveness 0aEquimarginality1 aRío, Pablo del,0 tEnergy.g2015 Oct., v. 90 p.286-298dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.06.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002000159245011200179300001600291500000900307520126000316592002801576650001201604650001501616650001301631650001101644650001201655650001201667650001201679650001401691650001301705650001801718650000701736650001401743650001101757650000901768650001201777650001101789650001201800650001301812650001301825650001501838650002601853651001801879700001801897700002001915773020701935856009402142852000902236655001202245IND60666442220221120144039.0191028e198710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066644222DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1987.00472425001600040016x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLawrence, G.

Stream chemistry was monitored along an elevational gradient for approximately 1 yr prior to and 2 yr following the treatment in both the experimental watershed and an adjacent reference watershed. Whole-tree harvesting initially resulted in a large increase in stream NO⁻₃ and basic cation (Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Na⁺, and K⁺) concentrations and a decrease in stream sulfate concentrations. A decrease in pH and increase in Al concentrations followed. Elevational trends in stream chemistry were qualitatively similar before and after the cut, although the absolute concentrations of solutes changed markedly. These responses are explained by increased soil nitrification coupled with decreased vegetative uptake following the whole-tree harvest. Acidity generated by nitrification facilitated the mobilization of basic cations and increased anion adsorption. When NO⁻₃ production exceeded the release of basic cations, stream pH declined and Al concentrations increased. Aluminum was released in an entirely inorganic form resulting in potentially toxic concentrations in streamwater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3aautumn 3acalcium 3acations 3aforests 3amagnesium 3anitrates 3anitrification 3apH 3apotassium 3asodium 3asoil 3asolutes 3aspring 3astreams 3asulfates 3atoxicity 3awatersheds 3awhole tree harvesting 3aNew Hampshire1 aFuller, R.

What is concerning is that surviving bacteria, due to co-selection factors, may also have increased resistance to common antibiotics. This would pose a public health risk as it could link resistant bacteria in the natural environment to human population. Here, we investigated the relationship between chlorine- and antibiotic-resistances by harvesting 148 surviving bacteria from chlorinated drinking-water systems and compared their susceptibilities against chlorine disinfectants and antibiotics. Twenty-two genera were isolated, including members of Paenibacillus, Burkholderia, Escherichia, Sphingomonas and Dermacoccus species. Weak (but significant) correlations were found between chlorine-tolerance and minimum inhibitory concentrations against the antibiotics tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole and amoxicillin, but not against ciprofloxacin; this suggest that chlorine-tolerant bacteria are more likely to also be antibiotic resistant. Further, antibiotic-resistant bacteria survived longer than antibiotic-sensitive organisms when exposed to free chlorine in a contact-time assay; however, there were little differences in susceptibility when exposed to monochloramine. Irrespective of antibiotic-resistance, spore-forming bacteria had higher tolerance against disinfection compounds. The presence of chlorine-resistant bacteria surviving in drinking-water systems may carry additional risk of antibiotic resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderia 3aDermacoccus 3aEscherichia 3aPaenibacillus 3aSphingomonas 3aamoxicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3achlorination 3achlorine 3aciprofloxacin 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3aharvesting 3ahuman population 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apublic health 3arisk 3aspore-forming bacteria 3asulfamethoxazole 3atap water 0aSusceptibility 0aAntimicrobial-resistant bacteria 0aDisinfectant-resistance 0aDrinking-water 0aARB 0aAntibiotic-resistant bacteria 0aARG 0aAntibiotic resistance genes 0aPBS 0aPhosphate buffer saline 0aDPD 0aN,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine 0aPCR 0aPolymerase chain reaction 0aDNA 0aDeoxyribonucleic acid1 aBeattie, Tara K.1 aKnapp, Charles W.0 tChemosphere.g2016 June, v. 152 p.132-141dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.02.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03732naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100007000153245008800223500001900311520210800330592002802438650000802466650002502474650002602499650001102525650001802536650001602554650001302570650001102583650001602594650002502610650002502635650001002660650002402670650001502694650001302709650001302722650001502735650001402750650001402764650001102778650001402789653001902803653001902822653002002841653001102861700006602872700003602938773011902974856008803093852000903181655001203190IND60705504820221117023140.0201023e20201210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070550482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1412872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalandrakis, Anastasios A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8327-497610aUse of silver nanoparticles to counter fungicide-resistance in Monilinia fructicola  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe potential of Ag-NPs to suppress Monilia fructicola isolates and to broaden the effectiveness of fungicides to overcome resistance was tested in vitro and in vivo. Twenty-three M. fructicola isolates were subjected to fungitoxicity screening with a number of fungicides in vitro, which resulted in the detection of 18 isolates resistant to benzimidazoles (BEN-R) thiophanare methyl (TM) and carbendazim (CARB). DNA sequencing revealed the E198A resistance mutation in the β-tubulin gene, target site of the benzimidazole fungicides in all resistant isolates. Ag-NPs effectively suppressed mycelial growth in both sensitive (BENS) and resistant isolates. The combination of Ag-NPs with TM led to a significantly enhanced fungitoxic effect compared to the individual treatments regardless resistant phenotype (BEN-R/S) both in vitro and when applied on apple fruit. The above observed additive/synergistic action is probably associated with an enhanced Ag-NPs activity/availability as indicated by the positive correlation between Ag-NPs and TM + Ag-NPs treatments. No correlation was found between AgNO₃ and Ag-NPs suggesting that difference(s) exist in the fungitoxic mechanism of action between nanoparticles and their ionic counterparts. Synergy observed between Ag-NPs and the oxidative phosphorylation-uncoupler fluazinam (FM) against both resistance phenotypes indicates a possible role of energy (ATP) metabolism in the mode of action of Ag-NPs. Additionally, the role of released silver ions on the fungitoxic action of Ag-NPs against M. fructicola was found to be limited because the combination with NaCl revealed a synergistic rather than the antagonistic effect that would be expected from silver ion binding with chlorine ions. The results of this study suggested that Ag-NPs can be effectively used against M. fructicola and when used in combination with conventional fungicides they could provide the means for countering benzimidazole resistance and at the same time reduce the environmental impact of synthetic fungicides by reducing doses needed for the control of the pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aMonilinia fructicola 3aantifungal properties 3aapples 3abenzimidazole 3acarbendazim 3achlorine 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental impact 3afungicide resistance 3agenes 3amechanism of action 3ametabolism 3amutation 3amycelium 3ananosilver 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3asilver 3asynergism 0aBenzimidazoles 0aNanofungicides 0aPlant pathogens 0aAg-NPs1 aKavroulakis, Nektarios1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7770-30601 aChrysikopoulos, Constantinos V.0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Dec. 10, v. 747 p.141287-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1412873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006000152245016400212300001400376520136800390592002801758650002001786650001901806650002201825650000901847650002401856650001501880650002101895650001701916650001601933650003001949653000901979653003001988653001402018653002202032653001102054700005802065700002602123700005702149700005802206700001502264773011402279856008702393852000902480655001202489IND60615713120221122230332.0181127e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061571312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2018.09.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLekbir, Abdelhak1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9250-410710aImproved energy conversion performance of a novel design of concentrated photovoltaic system combined with thermoelectric generator with advance cooling system  ap. 19-29.  aMost of the incident solar energy on a PV panel is converted into waste heat. This consequently reduces the efficiency of PV system. Therefore, if certain portion of this waste heat can be utilized adding a thermoelectric generator (TEG) in the PV panel endowed by an efficient cooling system, the output performance of the system can be improved significantly. In this study, a new configuration of nanofluid-based PV/T-TEG hybrid system with cooling channel is proposed to convert certain portion of waste heat to electrical energy in order to improve the overall efficiency of hybrid system. Thus, the nanofluid acts as a coolant and absorbs the heat from the back side of TEG module raising its gradient of temperature, as well as the overall performance of the system. Through a numerical modelling approach, performance of the proposed innovative design has been investigated and compared with the conventional solar-harvesting technology systems. At the optimum value of solar concentration C, and maximum operating temperature of 35°C, the obtained results reveal that the electrical energy in NCPV/T-TEG configuration has been found higher by 10%, 47.7% and 49.5% against NCPV/T, CPV and CPV/TEG-HS systems, respectively. Overall, the proposed design of NCPV/T-TEG hybrid system has potential for further development in high-concentration solar systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling systems 3aelectric power 3aenergy conversion 3aheat 3amathematical models 3ananofluids 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3atemperature 3athermoelectric generators 0aPV/T 0aThermoelectric conversion 0aNanofluid 0aEnergy conversion 0aExergy1 aHassani, Samir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8960-32911 aAb Ghani, Mohd Ruddin1 aGan, Chin Kim1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7295-47251 aMekhilef, Saad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8544-89951 aSaidur, R.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 177 p.19-29dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.09.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245008300161300001800244520211900262592002802381650001902409650001502428650001002443650001102453650001702464650001202481650001402493650001402507650002302521700005302544773013602597856008002733852000902813655001202822IND60605564220221123043058.0180721e20180108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060556422DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b118402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Kun10aExploring the Underlying Mechanisms of the Xenopus laevis Embryonic Cell Cycle  ap. 5487-5499.  aThe cell cycle is an indispensable process in proliferation and development. Despite significant efforts, global quantification and physical understanding are still challenging. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of the Xenopus laevis embryonic cell cycle by quantifying the underlying landscape and flux. We uncovered the Mexican hat landscape of the Xenopus laevis embryonic cell cycle with several local basins and barriers on the oscillation path. The local basins characterize the different phases of the Xenopus laevis embryonic cell cycle, and the local barriers represent the checkpoints. The checkpoint mechanism of the cell cycle is revealed by the landscape basins and barriers. While landscape shape determines the stabilities of the states on the oscillation path, the curl flux force determines the stability of the cell cycle flow. Replication is fundamental for biology of living cells. We quantify the input energy (through the entropy production) as the thermodynamic requirement for initiation and sustainability of single cell life (cell cycle). Furthermore, we also quantify curl flux originated from the input energy as the dynamical requirement for the emergence of a new stable phase (cell cycle). This can provide a new quantitative insight for the origin of single cell life. In fact, the curl flux originated from the energy input or nutrition supply determines the speed and guarantees the progression of the cell cycle. The speed of the cell cycle is a hallmark of cancer. We characterized the quality of the cell cycle by the coherence time and found it is supported by the flux and energy cost. We are also able to quantify the degree of time irreversibility by the cross correlation function forward and backward in time from the stochastic traces in the simulation or experiments, providing a way for the quantification of the time irreversibility and the flux. Through global sensitivity analysis upon landscape and flux, we can identify the key elements for controlling the cell cycle speed. This can help to design an effective strategy for drug discovery against cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXenopus laevis 3acell cycle 3adrugs 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aentropy 3aneoplasms 3anutrition 3aphysical chemistry1 aWang, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2841-49130 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Jan. 08, v. 122, no. 21 p.5487-5499dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b118403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01692naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245011000164300001800274520052400292592002800816650002200844650001600866650002700882650002300909650001300932650001200945650001300957650001300970650001400983700002100997700001701018700001901035700001601054700001901070773013401089856007401223852000901297655001201306IND60628778820221119192854.0190131e20190129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062877882DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc09937e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakraborty, Sourav10aAryl-platform-based tetrapodal 2-iodo-imidazolium as an excellent halogen bond receptor in aqueous medium  ap. 1506-1509.  aAn acyclic tetrapodal receptor (L⁴⁺-I)(4PF₆)⁴⁻ comprised of four 2-iodo-imidazolium motifs showed moderate to strong binding of halides through halogen bonding interactions in organic and aqueous media, with these binding levels established by performing isothermal titration calorimetry studies.

For this reason, separate equations are used to estimate rain intensity of convective and stratiform rain types. Here, we investigate whether incorporating synoptic scale meteorology could yield further QPE improvements. Depending on large-scale weather types, variability in cloud condensation nuclei and the humidity content may lead to variation in rain microstructure. In a case study for Bavaria, we measured rain microstructure at ten locations with laser-based disdrometers, covering a combined 18,600 h of rain in a period of 36 months. Rain was classified on a temporal scale of one minute into convective and stratiform based on a machine learning model. Large-scale wind direction classes were on a daily scale to represent the synoptic weather types. Significant variations in rain microstructure parameters were evident not only for rain types, but also for wind direction classes. The main contrast was observed between westerly and easterly circulations, with the latter characterized by smaller average size of drops and a higher average concentration. This led to substantial variation in the parameters of the radar rain intensity retrieval equation Z–R. The effect of wind direction on Z–R parameters was more pronounced for stratiform than convective rain types. We conclude that building separate Z–R retrieval equations for regional wind direction classes should improve radar-based QPE, especially for stratiform rain events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3acase studies 3aequations 3aestimation 3ahumidity 3alead 3ameteorology 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3aradar 3arain 3arain intensity 3aremote sensing 3avariability 3awind direction 3aGermany1 aBech, Joan 1 aEstrella, Nicole 1 aHamann, Andreas 1 aMenzel, Annette 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Oct. 31, v. 12, no. 21dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs122135723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245016000175300001400335520149600349592002801845650002101873650001501894650001601909650001901925650002001944650003801964650001702002650003502019650001402054650000902068650002402077650001402101650001402115650000702129650001302136650001702149650001702166650001602183650001902199653004102218653001902259653001702278653001502295653003402310700001702344700002102361700001402382773008902396856008902485852000902574655001202583IND60606385020221119030050.0180725e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060638502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.02.0902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, Kien Tiek10aPhenyl-functionalized magnetic palm-based powdered activated carbon for the effective removal of selected pharmaceutical and endocrine-disruptive compounds  ap. 71-80.  aTriethoxyphenylsilane (TEPS)-functionalized magnetic palm-based powdered activated carbon (MPPAC-TEPS) was prepared and characterized using various spectroscopic methods, and then tested for the removal of bisphenol A, carbamazepine, ibuprofen and clofibric acid. Magnetite film on MPPAC-TEPS was homogeneously coated on the outer surface of palm-based powdered activated carbon (PPAC) through a hydrothermal co-precipitation technique. Followed by silanization of phenyl-functionalized organosilane on MPPAC's magnetic film. As results, micro/mesopore surface area and volume increased without significant pore clogging and iron (Fe) dissolution under the acidic conditions was greatly decreased. The unique structural and chemical features of MPPAC-TEPS were found to be the main reasons for the enhanced adsorption rates and removal capacities of POPs. The presence of electrolytes and different pH values greatly affected the sorption efficiencies. The dominant sorption mechanism of POPs by MPPAC-TEPS was determined to be π–π interaction (physisorption), based on thermodynamic (ΔG°) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Thermal regeneration at a low temperature (350 °C) was an effective method to desorb the retained POPs and enabled to reactivate MPPAC-TEPS with sustained sorption rates and capacities, whereas PPAC was largely exhausted. As a new type of sorbent for POPs, MPPAC-TEPS has operational advantages, such as magnetic separation and stable regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3abisphenol A 3aclofibric acid 3acoprecipitation 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aelectrolytes 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aibuprofen 3airon 3amagnetic separation 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3apH 3asorbents 3aspectroscopy 3asurface area 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 0aPalm-based powdered activated carbon 0aMagnetite film 0aOrganosilane 0aAdsorption 0aPersistent organic pollutants1 aYoon, Yeomin1 aSnyder, Shane A.1 aJang, Min0 tChemosphere.g2016 June, v. 152 p.71-80dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.02.0903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01984naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245006200164300001800226520104000244592002801284650001501312650001201327650002401339650001501363650001501378650002301393650002101416650000901437773013401446856008101580852000901661655001201670IND60614164720221118011457.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061416472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-018-1752-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSagoff, Mark10aInvasive species denialism: a reply to Ricciardi and Ryan  ap. 2723-2729.  aThis paper offers a defense against ad hominem aspersions cast in this journal by Ricciardi and Ryan (Biol Invasions 20(3):549–553, 2018) who allege that several articles I wrote represent “invasive species denialism” and “science denialism.” I summarize the arguments found in those articles. They are (1) science cannot define ecological “harm” and thus cannot measure its risk; (2) invasion biologists rely on tautologies, i.e., definitions of concepts like “biodiversity” and “ecosystem intactness,” that exclude exotic species; (3) no empirical evidence shows that introduced plants have been significant causes of extinction; (4) biologists cannot tell by observing a species whether it is native or a naturalized alien; and (5) debates over the meanings and measurements of key concepts in invasion biology have passed the point of diminishing returns.

In Missouri, where less than 1% the historical prairie remains, prairies are being reconstructed from agricultural or wooded land. Invertebrates are often assumed to colonise reconstructions if native vegetation returns; however, the limited mobility of many invertebrates, the isolation of many tallgrass remnants, and the difficulty in establishing prairie plants raise serious questions as to whether invertebrate communities on reconstructed prairies are and will be equivalent to those found on remnant prairies. Grasshoppers (Acrididae) display a range of dispersal capabilities and may be valuable for assessing the success of prairie restoration for invertebrates. Our first objective was to compare grasshopper communities on reconstructed and remnant prairies and, if differences existed, identify species or functional groups associated with each habitat type. The second objective was to evaluate the effect of time because prairie reconstruction on grasshopper communities to determine if communities on reconstructions are converging with communities on remnants. Our results suggest that prairie reconstructions in Missouri do not support the same communities of grasshoppers as prairie remnants. Grasshopper diversity was generally greater on remnants. Many species had not colonised nearby reconstructions. Communities on prairie reconstructions were characterised by a few long‐winged, generalist species that are typically successful in agroecosystems. Further investigation into the habitat disparities driving low grasshopper diversity on reconstructions could help restore the grasshopper community of reconstructions.  aPublisher supplied data  cMissouri Department of Conservation  cPrairie Biotic Research  cPrairie Fork Charitable Endowment Trust 3aAcrididae 3aagroecosystems 3agrasshoppers 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3ainvertebrates 3atallgrass prairies 3aMissouri1 aWebb, Elisabeth B.1 aFinke, Deborah L.0 tInsect conservation and diversity.g2020 Jan., v. 13, no. 1 p.23-35dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:J000000087x1752-458X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/icad.123653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03785naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245016400169300001400333506002800347506004300375520172300418592002802141596004502169506003702214650002702251650002702278650001002305650001902315650002302334650003002357650002602387650000902413650001202422650001502434650001002449650001802459650002102477650001102498650002702509650002002536650001502556650001202571650001602583650002002599651001402619651001802633651002602651651001702677651001802694653001602712653002602728653001802754653002602772653002302798700001902821700002302840700001802863773009402881856008102975903002203056961001203078852000903090655001203099IND60698721220221207135046.0200615e20190404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069872122DNAL7 a10.3897/neobiota.44.304022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD.

We tested a biological control agent in North America that has successfully controlled S.noctilio in Oceania, South Africa, and South America. Deladenussiricidicola nematodes feed on the symbiotic white rot fungus Amylostereumareolatum and can switch to being parasitic on S.noctilio. When parasitic, the Kamona nematode strain can sterilise the eggs of S.noctilio females. However, in North America, a different strain of D.siricidicola (NA), presumably introduced along with the woodwasp, parasitises but does not sterilise S.noctilio. We tested the sterilising Kamona biological control strain of D.siricidicola against S.noctilio in North America. Interactions between the biological control strain and the NA strain could include competitive exclusion, co-infection within hosts or hybridisation. We reared D.siricidicola Kamona on an A.areolatum strain native to North America (IGS-BE) and another strain (IGS-BDF) used commercially to mass-produce the nematode in Australia. We inoculated Kamona reared on either strain of A.areolatum into logs infested with S.noctilio larvae and compared parasitism rates against control logs. Individual nematodes were isolated from S.noctilio hemocoels and from sterilised eggs and were genotyped with eight microsatellite loci. A high rate of parasitisation of S.noctilio by D.siricidicolaNA was found for all treatments and we found evidence of both co-infection and hybridisation. Surprisingly, sterilisation rates were not related to the rates of parasitisation by D.siricidicola Kamona.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAmylostereum areolatum 3aDeladenus siricidicola 3aPinus 3aSirex noctilio 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acompetitive exclusion 3aeggs 3afemales 3agenotyping 3ahosts 3ahybridization 3ainvasive species 3alarvae 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amixed infection 3aparasitism 3arearing 3asterilizing 3awhite-rot fungi 3aAustralia 3aNorth America 3aPacific Ocean Islands 3aSouth Africa 3aSouth America 0acoinfection 0aDeladenussiricidicola 0aSirexnoctilio 0aAmylostereumareolatum 0aparasitic nematode1 aHavill, Nathan1 aA.L.

Manool is the most abundant micro-metabolite found in Salvia officinalis essential oils and extracts. We therefore decided to evaluate the cytotoxic, genotoxic and antigenotoxic potential of manool in Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (V79) and human hepatoma cells (HepG2). Cytotoxicity was assessed by the colony-forming assay in V79 cells and toxic effects were observed at concentrations of up to 8.0μg/mL. The micronucleus test was used to evaluate the genotoxicity and antigenotoxicity of manool in V79 and HepG2 cells at concentrations of 0.5–6.0μg/mL and 0.5–8.0μg/mL, respectively. For evaluation of antigenotoxicity, the concentrations of manool were combined with methyl methanesulfonate (MMS, 44μg/mL). The results showed a significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei in cultures of both cell lines treated with the highest concentration tested, demonstrating a genotoxic effect. On the other hand, manool exhibited a protective effect against chromosome damage induced by MMS in HepG2 cells, but not in V79 cells. These data suggest that some manool metabolite may be responsible for the antigenotoxic effect observed in HepG2 cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese hamsters 3aSalvia officinalis 3aanti-infective agents 3aantioxidants 3achromosomes 3acondiments 3acytotoxicity 3aditerpenoids 3aessential oils 3afibroblasts 3agenotoxicity 3ahepatoma 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3amethyl methanesulfonate 3aprotective effect 3asage 3atoxicology 3aMediterranean region 0aManool 0aSalvia officinalis 0aV79 cells 0aHepG2 cells 0aGenotoxicity 0aAntigenotoxicity1 aOliveira, Pollyanna Francielli de1 aMunari, Carla Carolina1 aCosta, Gizela Faleiros Dias1 aMoreira, Monique Rodrigues1 aVeneziani, Rodrigo Cassio Sola1 aTavares, Denise Crispim0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2014 Oct., v. 72 p.8-12dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2014.06.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03253naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006300140245015900203300001400362500002000376520185500396592002802251650002402279650001802303650001402321650001302335650001902348650001202367650001902379650001602398650001102414650001402425650001102439650001902450651001602469700002302485700001902508700001902527700002402546700002102570773013302591856007402724852000902798655001202807IND60681341820221121172647.0200115e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068134182DNAL7 a10.1111/icad.123762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerasoli, Francesco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9712-914714aThe role of climate and biotic factors in shaping current distributions and potential future shifts of European Neocrepidodera (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae)  ap. 47-62.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Western Paleartic species of Neocrepidodera Heikertinger (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Galerucinae: Alticini) mostly occur in medium and high elevation ecosystems particularly sensitive to climate change. Here, using ensemble projections from state‐of‐the‐art habitat suitability modelling techniques, we investigated how climate change and associated changes in host availability may affect the persistence of three pairs of closely related Neocrepidodera taxa. Modelled niches and suitability patterns reflected the current distributions of the targeted taxa. Neocrepidodera ligurica occupies a small portion of the broader environmental niche of N. melanostoma, and its narrow geographical range makes this species particularly vulnerable to potential loss of suitable habitats in Western Alps. Neocrepidodera cyanescens cyanescens and N. cyanescens concolor were found to occupy separate niches, but the non‐significance of the niche similarity test suggested their divergence being probably due to allopatric processes. Neocrepidodera corpulenta and N. rhaetica showed partially overlapping niches, coherently with their co‐occurrence in Western Alps. Most of the targeted taxa were predicted to potentially lose large portions of currently suitable areas in the forthcoming decades. Notwithstanding the candidate host plants did not emerge as most important predictors, except Aconitum lycoctonum for N. cyanescens concolor, a clear reduction of potential insect‐plant co‐occurrence areas resulted for most future scenarios. Climate was confirmed to noticeably affect the distribution of the targeted taxa, among which N. ligurica, N. cyanescens concolor, N. corpulenta and N. rhaetica may need specific prioritisation measures in the future decades, claiming for further attention on mountainous entomofauna in a warming world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAconitum lycoctonum 3aChrysomelidae 3aallopatry 3aaltitude 3abiotic factors 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ahost plants 3amodels 3amountains 3aniches 3aprioritization 3aAlps region1 aThuiller, Wilfried1 aGuéguen, Maya1 aRenaud, Julien1 aD'Alessandro, Paola1 aBiondi, Maurizio0 tInsect conservation and diversity.g2020 Jan., v. 13, no. 1 p.47-62dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000087x1752-458X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/icad.123763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001600159245012100175300001600296500000900312520185400321592002802175650002302203650002102226650001302247650002302260650002502283650000902308650001602317650001402333650001602347650001902363650001202382650001202394650001502406650000902421650001102430650001402441650000902455700001902464700001902483773020702502856009402709852000902803655001202812IND60666442820221120163508.0191028e198401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066644282DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1984.00472425001300010019x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHall, J.

The no-tillage systems consisted of corn planted into corn stover residue and into “living mulches” of birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus) and crownvetch (Coronilla varia L.). The no-tillage systems reduced runoff, erosion, and herbicide movement. For example, runoff from conventional tillage ranged from 5.5 to 22% of the runoff-producing rainfall. Soil loss from the same system ranged from 4.4 to 32.2 Mg/ha. On the other hand, runoff from the no-tillage systems ranged from 0.07 to 2.5% of the runoff-producing rainfall, while soil losses ranged from 0 to 1.1 Mg/ha. Transport of cyanazine in water runoff and entrained sediment from tilled areas totaled 257.0, 16.0, and 32.7 g/ha for the respective growing seasons, which represented 5.71, 0.73, and 1.48% of the amount applied yearly [4.5 kg active ingredient (ai)/ha—1977; 2.2 kg ai/ha—1978, 1979]. In the same years, cyanazine losses from no-tillage areas were 6.5–33.7 g/ha, 0.1–1.8 g/ha, and 1.6–3.3 g/ha at similarly applied rates. Collectively, these represented losses ranging from < 0.01 to 0.75% of sprayed levels. Using conventional tillage as a reference treatment, untilled surfaces reduced runoff from 86.3 to 98.7%, soil losses from 96.7 to 100%, and cyanazine losses from 84.9 to 99.4% over the three growing seasons. In general, the “living mulch” surfaces were more effective in retarding erosion than the corn stover residue surfaces. Corn grain yields were not significantly reduced by “living mulches” when adequate legume suppression was obtained with herbicide treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLotus corniculatus 3aSecurigera varia 3aZea mays 3aactive ingredients 3aconventional tillage 3acorn 3acorn stover 3acyanazine 3agrain yield 3agrowing season 3alegumes 3amulches 3ano-tillage 3arain 3arunoff 3asediments 3asoil1 aHartwig, N.

The as-prepared samples were calcined in tube furnace at high elevated temperature (700, 800 and 900 °C) for 1 h. Among the TiO₂ modified samples, ZST10-700 showed higher charge separation as demonstrated from surface photovoltage spectroscopy, photoluminance and electrochemical curve. Surface morphology, crystallinity, optical property and different functional groups in the samples were determined with SEM, EDX, XRD, UV–Vis DRS and FTIR, respectively. Interestingly, 72% and 58% photocatalytic degradation efficiencies were achieved with optimized ZST10-700 for 2,4-DCP and BPA, respectively. In comparison, the pure ZS-700 only showed 36% and 29% photocatalytic degradation efficiencies, respectively. The improved photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of the optimized ZST10-700 are mainly due to improved charge separation and prolonged charge lifetime. It was further verified that by increasing calcination temperature, the photocatalytic activity decreased, and this is attributed to the formation of photo-inactive phases like Zn₂SnO₄ and ZnTiO₃. We believe that this work will provide an effective strategy to construct ternary heterojunction for the elimination of pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dichlorophenol 3abisphenol A 3acoprecipitation 3acrystal structure 3aelectrochemistry 3aenvironment 3afurnaces 3ananocomposites 3aphotocatalysis 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 0aTiO2 modification 0aHoneycomb structure 0aImproved charge separation 0aCalcination 0aTernary heterojunction1 aUllah, Hameed1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6669-66191 aZada, Amir1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3670-44081 aMuhammad, Wisal1 aAli, Sharafat1 aShaheen, Shabana1 aAlamgir, Muhammad Khalid1 aAnsar, Muhammad Zaka1 aKhan, Zaheen Ullah1 aBilal, Hazrat1 aYap, Pow-Seng0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 746 p.141291-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1412913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245015800174300001400332520150500346592002801851650002901879650001101908650000801919650002301927650002601950650002201976650002101998650001402019650001302033650001602046650001102062650002202073653001702095653001702112653002302129653002502152653001602177700002002193773009402213856008102307852000902388655001202397IND60698721320221120191608.0200615e20190405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069872132DNAL7 a10.3897/neobiota.44.318402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomero-Blanco, Alberto10aTolerance assessment of the aquatic invasive snail Potamopyrgusantipodarum to different post-dispersive conditions: implications for its invasive success  ap. 57-73.  aThe New Zealand mudsnail (NZMS) Potamopyrgusantipodarum (Gray, 1843) (Tateidae, Mollusca) is a successful invasive species able to alter the functioning of the invaded ecosystems. However, to arrive and establish in new aquatic ecosystems, this snail must survive to the overland translocation through aerial exposure and must tolerate the new physical and chemical conditions of the recipient ecosystem. In this study, we simulated different conditions for the NZMS invasion by combining two air exposure treatments (0 and 20 h) with different physical and chemical conditions of the rehydration water (low and normal water temperatures and normal and high water conductivities). Mortality, behavior and neonate production were compared across treatments. Air exposure caused a high percentage of mortality but survivors tolerated the subsequent abiotic conditions. Low temperatures and high conductivities altered the behavior of adult snails, increasing significantly their reaction time (i.e. time to start normal movement). This may have negative consequences for the survival of this species under natural conditions. Finally, these conditions did not affect significantly the production of neonates. These results supported that the surviving NZMS to a brief period of air exposure possess the ability to acclimate to contrasting abiotic conditions with a potential establishment of new populations and that survivors can reproduce in different abiotic conditions after an air exposure period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPotamopyrgus antipodarum 3aadults 3aair 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aexposure duration 3ainvasive species 3amortality 3aneonates 3arehydration 3asnails 3awater temperature 0aAir exposure 0aconductivity 0aneonate production 0aNew Zealand mudsnail 0atemperature1 aAlonso, Alvaro,0 tNeoBiota.g2019 Apr. 05, v. 44 p.57-73dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2193x1314-24887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.44.318403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01938naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245010000166300001500266520074500281592002801026653002001054653003201074653003301106653001801139653001801157653002301175653003701198653003901235653002201274653002501296700002201321700002101343773011701364856008601481852000901567655001201576IND60602572320221120195839.0180711e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060257232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2014.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Han12aA numerical investigation of flow boiling of non-azeotropic and near-azeotropic binary mixtures  ap. 99-109.  aThe flow and heat transfer characteristics of binary refrigerant mixtures in a heated horizontal tube were investigated numerically. The pressure drop, temperature profile, and heat transfer coefficient for non-azeotropic and near-azeotropic mixtures of different bulk compositions were obtained. It is found that the non-linear physical properties of the mixtures strongly affect the pressure drop characteristics. Both the fluid properties and mass transfer resistance are responsible for the heat transfer characteristics. The mass transfer resistance has a more significant influence on the nucleate boiling than the convective evaporation for non-azeotropic mixtures, while the resistance can be neglected for near-azeotropic mixtures.  aPublisher supplied data 0aNumerical model 0aNon-azeotropic refrigerants 0aNear-azeotropic refrigerants 0aPressure drop 0aHeat transfer 0aModèle numérique 0aFrigorigènes non azéotropiques 0aFrigorigènes quasi-azéotropiques 0aChute de pression 0aTransfert de chaleur1 aFernandino, Maria1 aDorao, Carlos A.0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2015 Jan., v. 49 p.99-109dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2014.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04085naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245010400155300001800259500002000277520239600297592002802693650002202721650001402743650002602757650002802783650001602811650001202827650001602839650001802855650002202873650002602895650001902921650001402940650001502954650001402969650001102983650001102994650001303005650001403018650001903032650002003051650001703071650001203088650001503100650002403115650002603139650001403165650001203179700002003191700002203211700002103233700001803254700002003272773009903292856007103391852000903462655001203471IND60569959320221118134614.0170626e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056995932DNAL7 a10.1890/02-05312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClose, Dugald10aPhotoinhibition: a link between effects of the environment on eucalypt leaf chemistry and herbivory  ap. 2952-2966.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe investigated effects of light and nutrients on whole plant growth, ecophysiology, and leaf chemistry of Eucalyptus nitens seedlings, and the effect of these characteristics on herbivory by common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) and red‐bellied pademelons (Thylogale billardierii). We compared results of the response of plant secondary chemistry to changes in environmental conditions against two contrasting hypotheses: (1) the carbon:nutrient balance hypothesis (CNBH) and (2) the photoinhibition hypothesis. Nutrient and light levels affected relative growth rate and leaf area ratio of seedlings. Electron transport rates and optimum photochemical efficiencies indicated different rates of carbon fixation between treatments, consistent with levels of chlorophyll and xanthophyll pigments. Nonphotochemical quenching and xanthophylls per unit chlorophyll were negatively correlated with total chlorophyll content. Consistent with the photoinhibition hypothesis, levels of leaf phenolics (flavonols, hydrolyzable tannins, and sideroxylonals) per unit chlorophyll were also negatively correlated with total chlorophyll content. In contrast, phenolic levels on a dry‐mass basis were not consistent with predictions of the CNBH; they were better explained as a response to severity of photoinhibition than by reallocation of resources from growth to defense. Total essential oil and cineole levels were positively correlated with nitrogen levels, but there was an interaction in their response to nutrients and light. Thus, levels of essential oils were not well predicted by the CNBH. Sideroxylonal and cineole levels were not correlated, and we hypothesize that different processes and requirements drive their production. Intake of seedlings by possums and pademelons was not directly negatively correlated with levels of hydrolyzable tannins, sideroxylonals, or essential oils. An interaction of the costs of these compounds against benefits of nitrogen levels may explain patterns in intake. We suggest that, while environmentally induced levels of carbon‐based plant secondary metabolites have consequences for herbivory, photoinhibition may drive the adjustment of levels of leaf phenolics in response to variation in light and nutrients. This contrasts with the view that these adjustments represent a trade‐off in resource allocation between growth and defense.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus nitens 3aThylogale 3aTrichosurus vulpecula 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3achlorophyll 3acineole 3acorrelation 3aecophysiology 3aelectron transfer 3aenvironmental factors 3aessential oils 3aflavonols 3aherbivores 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3alutein 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphotochemistry 3aphotoinhibition 3aplant growth 3apossums 3aprediction 3aresource allocation 3asecondary metabolites 3aseedlings 3atannins1 aMcArthur, Clare1 aPaterson, Stephen1 aFitzgerald, Hugh1 aWalsh, Andrew1 aKincade, Tamara0 tEcology.g2003 Nov., v. 84, no. 11 p.2952-2966dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-05313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245008700161300001600248520109400264592002801358650002901386650001901415650001701434650001501451650002301466650002201489650001701511650002201528650003701550650001601587650001501603653002501618653001701643653004401660653002401704653002401728653001701752700001701769700002201786700001801808700001801826773012101844856008001965852000902045655001202054IND60560863120221119172224.0170111e20170111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056086312DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b128592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhorai, Arup10aHighly Luminescent WS2 Quantum Dots/ZnO Heterojunctions for Light Emitting Devices  ap. 558-565.  aSonication induced vertical fragmentation of two-dimensional (2D) WS₂ nanosheets into highly luminescent, monodispered, zero-dimensional (0D) quantum dots (QDs) is reported. The formation of 0D structures from 2D sheets and their surface/microstructure characterization are revealed from their microscopic and spectroscopic investigations. Size dependent optical properties of WS₂ nanostructures have been explored by UV–vis absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Interestingly, it is observed that, below a critical dimension (∼2 nm), comparable to the Bohr exciton radius, the tiny nanocrystals exhibit strong emission. Finally, the electroluminescence characteristics are demonstrated for the first time, by forming a heterojunction of stabilizer free WS₂ QDs and ZnO thin films. The signature of white light emission in the light emitting device is attributed to the adequate intermixing of emission characteristics of WS₂ QDs and ZnO. The observation of white electroluminescence may pave the way to fabricate prototype futuristic efficient light emitting devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3amicrostructure 3ananocrystals 3ananosheets 3aoptical properties 3aphotoluminescence 3aquantum dots 3aspectral analysis 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awhite light 3azinc oxide 0atungsten sulfide WS2 0ananocrystals 0atransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) 0aelectroluminescence 0aquantum confinement 0aquantum dots1 aBayan, Sayan1 aGogurla, Narendar1 aMidya, Anupam1 aRay, Samit K.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Jan. 11, v. 9, no. 1 p.558-565dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b128593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02052naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245017700171300001600348520105600364592002801420650001901448650002101467650001201488650001101500650001501511650001001526700002001536773009801556856008701654852000901741655001201750IND60112028020221118005545.0141110e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011202802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2012.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, Don R.10aFluid saturation and volatile partitioning between melts and hydrous fluids in crustal magmatic systems: The contribution of experimental measurements and solubility models  ap. 298-324.  aThis work reviews the experimental constraints on the concentrations of volatiles that can be expected in melts found in the crust and the saturation of such melts with a separate fluid phase. After presenting evidence for volatile concentrations in magmatic source regions in the crust and upper mantle and discussing volatile concentrations in magmatic systems, experimental results on the solubility and partitioning of H₂O, CO₂, S, Cl, F and a few other minor volatiles at pressures up to 800MPa are summarized. Many of the important models used to predict the solubility and partitioning of these volatiles are then introduced and two models, both easily available for use, are compared against experimental data. Finally, a model of isothermal, closed system ascent of a granitic composition magma with water, carbon dioxide and chlorine is presented to illustrate the evolution of volatiles in a crustal magmatic system and to demonstrate how this evolution may affect the formation of ore deposits and the vesiculation of ascending magmas.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorine dioxide 3amelting 3amodels 3asolubility 3awater1 aAlletti, Marina0 tEarth-science reviews.g2012 Sept., v. 114, no. 3-4 p.298-324dElsevier B.V.x0012-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2012.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03419naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100003700137245008400174300001800258500002000276520223900296592002802535650002602563650002602589650001802615650001502633650001802648650002202666650001602688650001102704650001202715650001902727650001702746650001202763650001502775651001502790700002502805773009902830856007102929852000903000655001203009IND60569959420221118134638.0170626e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056995942DNAL7 a10.1890/02-00922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStewart, H.

The relationships among morphology, water flow, and photosynthesis were examined for five algal species representing three functional forms of marine macroalgae at Santa Catalina Island, California, USA. The relationship between surface area/volume ratio (SA/V) and rates of biomass‐specific net photosynthesis (NP) across functional‐form groups was examined to test the hypothesis that NP is related positively to SA/V. The rate of NP increased with increasing SA/V across functional groups. This relationship then was examined within a functional group for two species, Dictyopteris undulata and Zonaria farlowii, which are morphologically variable among sites. Flow measurements and morphometric analysis of thalli of D. undulata and Z. farlowii at two wave‐exposed and two wave‐protected sites indicated that intraspecific morphological variation corresponded to variation in wave exposure. A field experiment that manipulated rates of flow in situ resulted in morphological changes in D. undulata and Z. farlowii, indicating that water motion was responsible for the observed morphological plasticity. To examine the interaction between morphology and water flow on algal physiology, NP was estimated for morphotypes of D. undulata and Z. farlowii from wave‐exposed and wave‐protected sites. At saturating photon flux densities, NP was affected significantly by flow speed, particularly for morphotypes from the wave‐protected site. For these morphotypes, increased flow speeds resulted in sustained, then decreased NP as flow speeds exceeded 17 cm/s, suggesting that water flow may affect NP at low flow speeds by mitigating mass transfer limitation and at high flow speeds by changing light interception and flow within the compacted thallus. The plasticity of morphologies and the interaction of these morphotypes with flow may represent a trade‐off between maximizing NP and reducing the susceptibility of the thallus to mechanical damage and/or dislodgement by hydrodynamic forces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDictyopteris undulata 3afield experimentation 3ahydrodynamics 3amacroalgae 3amass transfer 3amechanical damage 3amorphometry 3amorphs 3aphotons 3aphotosynthesis 3asurface area 3athallus 3awater flow 3aCalifornia1 aCarpenter, Robert C.0 tEcology.g2003 Nov., v. 84, no. 11 p.2999-3012dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-00923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245006600167300001600233500001900249500000900268520133100277592002801608650001901636650001301655650001701668650001101685650001301696650001901709650001001728651001701738700002401755700002601779773013301805856008001938852000902018655001202027IND60663689520221117222955.0191122e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066368952DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2013.03762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaile, Teketel A.10aCanola Genotypes and Harvest Methods Affect Seedbank Addition  ap. 236-242.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aSeed loss in canola [Brassica napus L., B. rapa L., and B. juncea (L.) Czern. & Coss.], which includes seed shatter and seeds in unopened dropped pods, leads to yield reductions and seed dispersal into the soil seedbank. The volunteer canola can then become a weed in the subsequent crops and cause yield losses. The objective of this study was to evaluate canola genotypes, harvest methods, and commercial pod sealant products to reduce canola seedbank addition. Field trials were conducted at Saskatoon, SK, Canada, in 2010 and 2011. The effect of harvest methods (untreated direct harvested [DH], Pod Ceal treated DH, Pod-Stik-treated DH, and windrowed) on seed loss in four B. napus genotypes (5440, 45H26, 5020, 4362), and a canola quality B. juncea (8571) were evaluated. Results showed that there were differences in seedbank addition among the canola genotypes in each year. The B. napus Genotypes 5440 and 45H26 were found to have lesser seedbank addition than other genotypes. Neither of the two pod sealant products reduced seed loss in canola. The windrowed canola had higher seedbank addition than the DH canola. This study indicated that direct harvesting can be a viable option for canola in western Canada and canola seedbank addition could be minimized by growing genotypes with improved shattering tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aagronomy 3aburied seeds 3acanola 3asealants 3aseed dispersal 3aweeds 3aSaskatchewan1 aHolzapfel, Chris B.1 aShirtliffe, Steven J.0 tAgronomy journal.g2014 Jan., v. 106, no. 1 p.236-242dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2013.03763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01241naa a2200229 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245006100161300001600222520047800238592002800716650001600744700002700760773012400787856007900911852000900990655001200999IND60300721920221120174219.0150703e20120803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030072192DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12217902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFender, Rob10aStellar-Mass Black Holes and Ultraluminous X-ray Sources  ap. 540-544.  aWe review the likely population, observational properties, and broad implications of stellar-mass black holes and ultraluminous x-ray sources.

To confirm dog neutrophils can form NETs, neutrophils were isolated from healthy dogs, and stimulated in vitro with 2μM, 8μM, 31μM, and 125μM platelet activating factor (PAF) or 0.03μM, 0.1μM, 0.4μM, 1.6μM and 6.4μM phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). Extracellular DNA was measured using the cell impermeable dye Sytox Green every hour for 4h. At 4h, extracellular DNA was significantly greater than non-stimulated cells at concentrations ≥31μM and ≥0.1μM for PAF and PMA, respectively. Cells stimulated with 31.25μM PAF reached maximal fluorescence by 1h, whereas maximal fluorescence was not achieved until 2h for cells stimulated with 0.1μM PMA. Immunofluorescent imaging using DAPI and anti-elastase antibody confirmed that extracellular DNA is released as NETs.As NETs have been implicated in thrombosis, nucleosomes, a marker correlated with NET formation, were measured in the serum of dogs with the thrombotic disorder primary immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) (n=7) and healthy controls (n=20) using a commercially available ELISA. NETs were significantly higher in IMHA cases than controls (median 0.12 and 0.90, respectively, p=0.01), but there were large positive interferences associated with hemolysis and icterus.In summary, the study is the first to describe NET generation by canine neutrophils and provides preliminary evidence that a marker associated with NETs is elevated in IMHA. However, this apparent elevation must be interpreted with caution due to the effect of interference, emphasizing the need for a more specific and robust assay for NETs in clinical samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 3aDNA 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3adogs 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afluorescence 3ahemolysis 3ahemolytic anemia 3aimage analysis 3aneutrophils 3anucleosomes 3aplatelet-activating factor 3athrombosis 3awebs 0aDog 0aNeutrophil extracellular trap 0aNET 0aNucleosome 0aImmune-mediated hemolytic anemia 0aDAPI 0aNETs 0aIMHA 0aPAF 0aPMA 0aRPMI1 aKimura, Kayoko1 aGray, Robert1 aLueth, Paul1 aBellaire, Bryan1 aLeVine, Dana0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 168, no. 3-4 p.262-268dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245011900164300002000283520144900303592002801752650001501780650002001795650001701815653002501832653003301857653002701890653002801917653002501945700001701970700001901987700005602006700001702062700001402079700001402093700001602107700001202123700001702135700001802152773014202170856007802312852000902390655001202399IND60679474120200331000000.0191228e20191127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067947412DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b168652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shouheng10aUltrahigh Frequency and Anti-Interference Optical-Mode Resonance with Biquadratic Coupled FeCoB/Ru/FeCoB Trilayers  ap. 48230-48238.  aMicrowave soft magnetic films (SMFs) are the key materials to effectively miniaturize and multifunctionalize the microwave electromagnetic components and devices. However, currently, single-layer SMFs encounter a frequency bottleneck at around 10 GHz. The ferromagnet/nonmagnetic spacer/ferromagnet sandwiched films with strong interlayer exchange coupling are possible solutions to break through that frequency limitation because they exhibit ultrahigh optical-mode (OM) resonance frequency fᵣᴼ up to 50 GHz, while the tiny permeability and the limited thickness are their own obstacles to overcome. In this study, biquadratic coupled FeCoB₂₅ₙₘ/Ru₀.₂₅ₙₘ/FeCoB₂₅ₙₘ sandwiched films with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy were deposited by a composition gradient sputtering method. Pure OM resonance with self-bias fᵣᴼ up to 18.21 GHz and a relative permeability μᵣᴼ as high as 169 at the cut-off frequency was achieved. Moreover, both the fᵣᴼ and μᵣᴼ remain unchanged in the magnetic field range of 0–80 Oe, indicating a strong anti-interference capability to small interference field. These results demonstrate that the biquadratic coupled OM resonance can solve the current frequency bottleneck of microwave SMFs by providing ultrahigh resonance frequency while maintaining considerable permeability, thus leading to potential applications of OM resonance in Ku-band microwave magnetic components.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3amagnetic fields 3apermeability 0abiquadratic coupling 0ainterlayer exchange coupling 0aoptical mode resonance 0aferromagnetic resonance 0amicrowave components1 aLin, Jianxin1 aMiao, Guo-Xing1 aLi, Shandong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8105-76121 aZhao, Guoxia1 aWang, Xia1 aLi, Qiang1 aCao, Derang1 aXu, Jie1 aYan, Shishen1 aLu, Yueguang,0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Nov. 27, v. 11, no. 51 p.48230-48238dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b168653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01483naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245011700153300001800270520034500288592002800633650002300661650001300684650001900697650001900716650001300735650002100748650001300769650001400782650001600796700001500812700001700827700001300844700001400857700001500871773012900886856007301015852000901088655001201097IND60658210420221123005830.0190816e20080415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065821042DNAL7 a10.1039/b719110c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Shuxin10aNew responsive property of poly(ε-caprolactone) as the thermal switch from superhydrophobic to superhydrophilic  ap. 2025-2027.  aA reversible switch between superhydrophobicity at low temperature and superhydrophilicity at high temperature was fabricated by coating poly(ε-caprolactone) on a rough substrate, which resulted from the combination of the different adaptability of the polymer chain upon crystalline/amorphous phase transition and the optimized roughness.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3acoatings 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alactones 3aphase transition 3apolymers 3aroughness 3atemperature1 aCao, Xinyu1 aSong, Yanlin1 aLi, Chao1 aXie, Ping1 aJiang, Lei0 tChemical communications.g2008 Apr. 15, , no. 17 p.2025-2027dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b719110c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01717naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001900161245006500180300001600245500000900261520066300270592002800933650002100961650002600982650001701008650001401025650001501039650002401054650001201078700001901090700001801109773014701127856009601274852000901370655001201379IND60668503420221120160355.0191125e196305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066850342DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1963.03615995002700030014x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorey, John C.10aMiscible Displacement in Saturated and Unsaturated Sandstone  ap. 258-262.  aepub  aA description of soil water movement is more complete if the nature of the pore structure is known.

Many controversial reports are available on the use of aspartame as it releases methanol as one of its metabolite during metabolism. The present study proposed to investigate whether chronic aspartame (75Â mg/kg) administration could release methanol and induce oxidative stress in the rat brain. To mimic the human methanol metabolism, methotrexate (MTX)-treated rats were included to study the aspartame effects. Wistar strain male albino rats were administered with aspartame orally and studied along with controls and MTX-treated controls. The blood methanol level was estimated, the animal was sacrificed and the free radical changes were observed in brain discrete regions by assessing the scavenging enzymes, reduced glutathione, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein thiol levels. It was observed that there was a significant increase in LPO levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, GPx levels and CAT activity with a significant decrease in GSH and protein thiol. Moreover, the increases in some of these enzymes were region specific. Chronic exposure of aspartame resulted in detectable methanol in blood. Methanol per se and its metabolites may be responsible for the generation of oxidative stress in brain regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbino 3aaspartame 3ablood 3abrain 3achronic exposure 3aglutathione 3ahumans 3alipid peroxidation 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amethanol 3amethotrexate 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athiols1 aRathinasamy, Sheeladevi0 tJournal of biosciences.g2012 Sept., v. 37, no. 4 p.679-688dSpringer-Verlagx0250-59917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12038-012-9236-0  aDNAL 7aarticle04435naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245012200169300001400291520305400305592002803359650002403387650003003411650001003441650001603451650001303467650001703480650001303497650001603510650001303526650001503539650001603554650002003570650002003590650002203610650001503632650001903647650001303666650001503679650002303694651001103717700001503728700001903743773009503762856008703857852000903944655001203953IND60112028420221118005531.0141110e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011202842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2012.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaetens, W.10aHow effective are soil conservation techniques in reducing plot runoff and soil loss in Europe and the Mediterranean?  ap. 21-36.  aThe effects of soil and water conservation techniques (SWCTs) on annual runoff (Rₐ), runoff coefficients (RCₐ) and annual soil loss (SLₐ) at the plot scale have been extensively tested on field runoff plots in Europe and the Mediterranean. Nevertheless, a comprehensive overview of these effects and the factors controlling the effectiveness of SWCTs is lacking. Especially the effectiveness of SWCT in reducing Rₐ is poorly understood. Therefore, an extensive literature review is presented that compiles the results of 101 earlier studies. In each of these studies, Rₐ and SLₐ was measured on field runoff plots where various SWCTs were tested. In total, 353 runoff plots (corresponding to 2093 plot-years of data) for 103 plot-measuring stations throughout Europe and the Mediterranean were considered. SWCTs include (1) crop and vegetation management (i.e. cover crops, mulching, grass buffer strips, strip cropping and exclosure), (2) soil management (i.e. no-tillage, reduced tillage, contour tillage, deep tillage, drainage and soil amendment) and (3) mechanical methods (i.e. terraces, contour bunds and geotextiles). Comparison of the frequency distributions of SLₐ rates on cropland without and with the application of SWCTs shows that the exceedance probability of tolerable SLₐ rates is ca. 20% lower when SWCT are applied. However, no notable effect of SWCTs on the frequency distribution of RCₐ is observed. For 224 runoff plots (corresponding to 1567 plot-year data), SWCT effectiveness in reducing Rₐ and/or SLₐ could be directly calculated by comparing measured Rₐ and/or SLₐ with values measured on a reference plot with conventional management. Crop and vegetation management techniques (i.e. buffer strips, mulching and cover crops) and mechanical techniques (i.e. geotextiles, contour bunds and terraces) are generally more effective than soil management techniques (i.e. no-tillage, reduced tillage and contour tillage). Despite being generally less effective, no-tillage, reduced tillage and contour tillage have received substantially more attention in the literature than the other SWCTs. Soil and water conservation techniques are generally less effective in reducing Rₐ than in reducing SLₐ, which is an important consideration in areas where water is a key resource and in regions susceptible to flooding. Furthermore, all SWCTs show a more consistent and effective reduction of both Rₐ and SLₐ with increasing Rₐ and SLₐ magnitude, which is attributed to the reduced influence of measurement uncertainties. Although some significantly negative correlations between SWCT effectiveness and plot slope length, slope gradient or annual precipitation were found, the importance of these factors in explaining the observed variability in effectiveness seems limited. Time-series analyses of Rₐ during multiple years of SWCT application strongly indicate that no-tillage and conservation tillage become less effective in reducing Rₐ over time. Such an effect is not observed for SLₐ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural runoff 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abunds 3acover crops 3acropland 3adeep tillage 3adrainage 3ageotextiles 3amulching 3ano-tillage 3aprobability 3areduced tillage 3asoil amendments 3asoil conservation 3asoil water 3astrip cropping 3aterraces 3avegetation 3awater conservation 3aEurope1 aPoesen, J.1 aVanmaercke, M.0 tEarth-science reviews.g2012 Oct., v. 115, no. 1-2 p.21-36dElsevier B.V.x0012-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2012.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04074naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005300144245018000197300001800377520196500395592002802360650002902388650001402417650001702431650002202448650001402470650001302484650001602497650001702513650002102530650000902551650000902560650001602569650001802585650001502603650001802618650001102636650002002647650001302667650001402680650001902694650002302713650001702736650002502753653001402778653002302792653001902815700005702834700005702891700006402948700005303012700001703065700001403082700005203096700005803148773015403206856007903360852000903439655001203448IND60677510420221117032143.0200121e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067751042DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2019-173182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4590-236110aShort communication: Effects of a physiologically relevant concentration of aflatoxin B1 with or without sequestering agents on in vitro rumen fermentation of a dairy cow diet  ap. 1559-1565.  aAflatoxin is a potent carcinogen commonly found in animal feeds that can impair rumen fermentation at high concentrations; however, its effects at physiologically relevant concentrations are unknown. This study examined the effects of aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁), with or without bentonite clay (CL) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product (SCFP)–based sequestering agents on in vitro rumen fermentation and digestibility of a dairy cow TMR. Corn silage-based TMR (0.5 g, 17.3% crude protein and 1.67 Mcal/kg of net energy for lactation) was incubated in a rumen fluid-buffer inoculum (1:2 ratio; 50 mL) with the following treatments: (1) no additives (control); (2) control + 0.75 µg/L AFB₁ (T); (3) T + 80 mg/L sodium bentonite clay (CL; Astra-Ben-20, Prince Agri Products Inc., Quincy, IL); or (4) CL + 14 mg/L SCFP (CL+SCFP; Diamond V, Cedar Rapids, IA). Ruminal fluid was collected 3 h after the morning feeding from 3 cannulated cows fed the same TMR, and rumen fluid from individual cows was used to prepare separate inocula. Each treatment was incubated in duplicate at 39°C for 0, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h in each of 3 runs. Adding T reduced total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration after 4 and 8 h and molar proportion of propionate after 4 and 24 h of incubation relative to control. Adding sequestering agents (CL and CL+SCFP) with T did not affect total VFA concentration after 4 or 8 h, but increased total VFA after 16 h and tended to increase molar proportion of propionate after 24 h compared with T. At 24 h, T had lower DM digestibility and higher NH₃-N concentration compared with the control. Thus, AFB₁, even at very low concentration (0.75 µg/L), had detrimental effects on rumen fermentation and subsequently DM digestibility of the TMR. Adding sequestering agents did not prevent negative effects of T on rumen fermentation within 8 h of incubation; however, sequestering agents were effective after 16 h of incubation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aadditives 3aaflatoxin B1 3aammonium nitrogen 3abentonite 3acannulas 3acarcinogens 3acattle feeds 3achelating agents 3aclay 3acorn 3acorn silage 3acrude protein 3adairy cows 3adigestibility 3aenergy 3afermented foods 3ainoculum 3alactation 3apropionic acid 3arumen fermentation 3arumen fluids 3avolatile fatty acids 0aaflatoxin 0asequestering agent 0abentonite clay1 aOgunade, I.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3875-61561 aArriola, K.G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6032-81881 aPech-Cervantes, A.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4709-90981 aKim, D.H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0756-84191 aLi, Xunjing,1 aXue, Y.L.1 aVyas, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7657-02671 aAdesogan, A.T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1020-75260 tJournal of dairy science.g2020 Feb., v. 103, no. 2 p.1559-1565dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-173183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01361naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001600161245010500177300001600282500000900298520040700307592002800714650001700742650003700759650001800796700001600814773014800830856009600978852000901074655001201083IND60668503520221120160300.0191125e198207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066850352DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1982.03615995004600040042x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, R.

In this study, the levels of total Hg were measured in organs, tissues, and spines of 50 individuals of Brandt’s hedgehog collected in Iran in 2019. The Hg median levels in kidneys, liver, muscle, and spines were 156, 47, 47, and 20 ng/g dry weight, respectively. The results showed a significant positive correlation between the levels of Hg in kidneys and liver (r = 0.519; p < 0.01) and in spines and muscle (r = 0.337, p < 0.01) and kidneys (r = 0.309, p < 0.05). Significant differences (p < 0.05) in Hg levels in organs and tissues were also observed depending on the sex, weight, length, and age of the individuals. In addition, the median levels of total Hg in kidneys of Brandt’s hedgehogs from an agricultural ecotype (median 190 ± 65) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those collected from a forest ecotype (median 126 ± 50), suggesting that the habitat could have a significant impact on animal contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParaechinus 3aanimals 3abioaccumulation 3aecotypes 3aexposure assessment 3aforests 3ahabitats 3ahuman health 3aliver 3amercury 3amuscles 3apollution 3aresearch 3atoxicity 3aIran1 aPoma, Giulia1 aBarghi, Mandana0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Aug., v. 29, no. 37 p.56502-56510dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19926-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03720naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002200169245013000191300001600321520160100337592002801938650001601966650003501982650002102017650001402038650002102052650002102073650001802094650002602112650001202138650003702150650002102187650001202208650001402220650001102234650003602245650001202281650002502293650001702318650005302335650002602388650001102414650003602425650003402461650003202495650000902527650002702536650003302563650001202596650004502608653001102653653001402664653000802678653001002686653001202696700001902708700002602727700001802753700003202771773013702803856008502940852000903025655001203034IND50068876520221118002928.0190318e20130915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006887652DNAL7 a238864462pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2013.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViñuales, Carmen10aInterleukin-1beta reduces galactose transport in intestinal epithelial cells in a NF-kB and protein kinase C-dependent manner  ap. 171-181.  aInterleukins (IL), aside from their role in the regulation of the immune cascade, they have also been shown to modulate intestinal transport function. IL-1β is a potent inflammatory cytokine involved in many important cellular functions. The aim of this work was to study the in vitro effect of IL-1β on d-galactose transport across intestinal epithelia in rabbit jejunum and Caco-2 cells. The results showed that d-galactose intestinal absorption was diminished in IL-1β treated jejunum rabbits without affecting the Na+, K+-ATPase activity. The presence of IL-1 cell-surface receptors was confirmed by addition to tissue of a specific IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). The cytokine did not inhibit either the uptake of d-galactose nor modified the sodium-glucose transport (SGLT1) protein levels in the brush border membrane vesicles, suggesting an indirect IL effect. The IL-inhibition was significantly reversed in the presence of inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The proteasome selective inhibitor completely abolished the IL-effect. Furthermore, the cytokine inhibition on galactose transport related to NF-kB activation was also confirmed in Caco-2 cells. In summary, the direct addition of IL-1β to intestinal epithelia inhibits d-galactose transport by a possible reduction in the SGLT1 activity. This event may be mediated by several transduction pathways activated during the inflammatory processes related to several protein kinases and nuclear factor, NF-kB. The IL-effect is independent of hormonal milieu and nervous stimuli.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3abrush border membrane vesicles 3aepithelial cells 3agalactose 3ahuman cell lines 3ain vitro studies 3ainterleukin-1 3aintestinal absorption 3ajejunum 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aprotein kinase C 3arabbits 3areceptors 3asodium 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 2aAnimals 2aBiological Transport 2aCaco-2 Cells 2aCyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinasesxphysiology 2aGalactosexmetabolism 2aHumans 2aInterleukin-1betaxpharmacology 2aIntestinal Mucosaxmetabolism 2aMAP Kinase Signaling System 2aMale 2aNF-kappa Bxphysiology 2aProtein Kinase Cxphysiology 2aRabbits 2aSodium-Glucose Transporter 1xphysiology 0aIL-1β 0aGalactose 0aGut 0aNF-kB 0aKinases1 aGascón, Sonia1 aBarranquero, Cristina1 aOsada, Jesús1 aRodríguez-Yoldi, Ma Jesús0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 155, no. 3 p.171-181dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2013.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245007000178300001500248520196400263592002802227650001202255650001102267650002402278650001002302650000902312650000902321650001402330650002202344650001402366700001902380773009602399856008702495852000902582655001202591IND60112028720221118005518.0141110e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011202872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2012.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avon Eynatten, Hilmar10aAssessing the sediment factory: The role of single grain analysis  ap. 97-120.  aType and amount of sediment generation are intimately connected to tectonic and climatic processes active at the earth's surface today as well as throughout the geologic past. Detrital single grains (sand to very coarse silt sized) from well-dated sedimentary formations serve as mineral tracers in sedimentary systems and record the sediment-forming processes. In this review, a selection of individual methods available to extract petrogenetic and chronological information from detrital mineral grains is compiled. Emphasis is placed on techniques, concepts, and their possibilities and shortcomings in defining the type and geologic history of source rocks, as well as the rates and relative proportions at which sediments are being eroded and delivered to basins. Statistical issues intrinsically coupled to the interpretation of detrital single-grain distributions are highlighted, as well as new emerging techniques. These include geochronology of phases like e.g. titanite, monazite, or rutile to overcome the common restriction to apatite or zircon bearing lithologies, as well as any kind of double or triple dating to extract both high-T and low-T thermochronological information from the very same detrital grains. Mineral pairs are especially suited to quantify the relative contributions of well-defined source rocks or areas to the sediment when the two phases (i) occur in contrasting rock types, (ii) are relatively stable under sedimentary conditions, and (iii) allow for extracting significant and detailed information on source rock petrology and chronology. In general, however, multi-method approaches are the only way to overcome ambiguous information from the sedimentary record. In combination with either independent information on sediment flux or erosion rates derived from single-grain thermochronology, the sediment-forming processes as well as their controlling mechanisms and overall geologic settings can be properly assessed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapatite 3abasins 3ainformation sources 3arocks 3asand 3asilt 3atectonics 3atracer techniques 3azirconium1 aDunkl, István0 tEarth-science reviews.g2012 Oct., v. 115, no. 1-2 p.97-120dElsevier B.V.x0012-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2012.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01875naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002900161245007400190300001600264500000900280520091500289592002801204650001101232650002401243650001201267650001701279650001501296650000901311773014801320856009601468852000901564655001201573IND60668503720221120160401.0191125e197503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066850372DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1975.03615995003900020041x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aL'Annunziata, Michael F.14aThe Origin and Transformations of the Soil Inositol Phosphate Isomers  ap. 377-379.  aepub  aThe two present viewpoints which exist as to the origin and transformations of the soil inositol phosphates are discussed. Arguments are presented in favor of the first viewpoint which considers the direct microbial synthesis of the soil d-chiro-, scyllo- and neo-inositol hexaphosphates by reactions which do not involve epimerization. Considerable evidence is presented which indicates that a likely mechanism of synthesis of the soil d-chiro-, scyllo- and neo-inositol hexaphosphates is via an epimerization of myo-inositol or its hexaphosphate. Studies with ¹⁴C-labeled myo-inositol and myo-inositol hexaphosphate are suggested to prove the microbial transformations which these compounds undergo in soils. Simultaneous studies with ¹⁴C-labeled carbon and ³²P-labeled phosphate are also suggested to determine the fate in soils of each carbon and phosphorus atom of soil myo-inositol hexaphosphate.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3ainositol phosphates 3aisomers 3amyo-inositol 3aphosphorus 3asoil0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1975 Mar., v. 39, no. 2 p.377-379dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1975.03615995003900020041x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03943naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245012200200300001800322520189500340592002802235650004802263650002802311650002802339650002602367650002802393650004502421650002702466650001802493650001002511650001602521650001402537650003102551650002102582650001902603650001902622650001902641650002202660650001802682650002002700650001802720650002002738650001702758650001502775650002402790650001102814650002302825650002502848650004402873650003602917650003202953700005702985700005703042773015403099856007903253852000903332655001203341IND60677510620221117031948.0200121e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067751062DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2019-173562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhn, Sung-Il1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8229-642010aEffect of dietary probiotics on colon length in an inflammatory bowel disease–induced murine model: A meta-analysis  ap. 1807-1819.  aWe investigated the effect of probiotic supplementation on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by meta-analysis. We included 30 studies to assess the effect of probiotic administration. We estimated the effect size using standardized mean difference, and we evaluated the statistical heterogeneity of the effect size using Cochran's Q test, followed by meta-ANOVA and meta-regression analysis to explain the heterogeneity of the effect size using a mixed-effects model. We conducted Egger's linear regression test to evaluate publication bias. Among the factors evaluated, colon length and myeloperoxidase showed the greatest Q statistic and I² index, respectively. Colon length, transforming growth factor-β, IL-10, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione showed positive effect sizes in the fixed- and random-effects models. The others (spleen weight, tumor necrosis factor α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, IFN-γ, disease activity index, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, nitric oxide, myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde, histological score, and macroscopic inflammatory score) showed negative effect sizes in the fixed- and random-effects models. Probiotics showed a significant effect on all investigated factors, except IL-10. In meta-ANOVA and meta-regression analysis, Lactobacillus paracasei was the most effective probiotic for colon length. Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus fermentum, and a mixture of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Saccharomyces boulardii (LC + SB) were effective for colon length, tumor necrosis factor α, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, and disease activity index. Lactobacillus rhamnosus was most effective for IL-10 and IFN-γ. Dietary probiotics are effective in improving the symptoms of IBD. Although the results of this meta-analysis had some limitations due to a lack of animal experiments, they will be meaningful to people with IBD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 3aLactobacillus fermentum 3aLactobacillus paracasei 3aLactobacillus reuteri 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae var. cerevisiae 3aanimal experimentation 3aanimal models 3acolon 3aglutathione 3ahistology 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-17 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3amalondialdehyde 3ameta-analysis 3amyeloperoxidase 3anitric oxide 3aprobiotics 3aregression analysis 3aspleen 3astatistical models 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3atransforming growth factor beta 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aCho, Sangbuem1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5637-96921 aChoi, Nag-Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0145-89050 tJournal of dairy science.g2020 Feb., v. 103, no. 2 p.1807-1819dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-173563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010800159300001600267520184200283592002802125650001302153650002202166650001502188650001702203650001102220650001102231650002202242700002602264700002302290773009002313856007302403852000902476655001202485IND60340798420221120080039.0150808e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034079842DNAL7 a10.1111/oik.023542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeymour, Mathew10aDendritic network structure and dispersal affect temporal dynamics of diversity and species persistence  ap. 908-916.  aLandscape connectivity structure, specifically the dendritic network structure of rivers, is expected to influence community diversity dynamics by altering dispersal patterns, and subsequently the unfolding of species interactions. However, previous comparative and experimental work on dendritic metacommunities has studied diversity mostly from an equilibrium perspective. Here we investigated the effect of dendritic versus linear network structure on local (α‐diversity), among (β‐diversity) and total (γ‐diversity) temporal species community diversity dynamics. Using a combination of microcosm experiments, which allowed for active dispersal of 14 protists and a rotifer species, and numerical analyses, we demonstrate the general importance of spatial network configuration and basic life history tradeoffs as driving factors of different diversity patterns in linear and dendritic systems. We experimentally found that community diversity patterns were shaped by the interaction of dispersal within the networks and local species interactions. Specifically, α‐diversity remained higher in dendritic networks over time, especially at highly connected sites. β‐diversity was initially greater in linear networks, due to increased dispersal limitation, but became more similar to β‐diversity in dendritic networks over time. Comparing the experimental results with a neutral metacommunity model we found that dispersal and network connectivity alone may, to a large extent, explain α‐ and β‐diversity dynamics. However, additional mechanisms, such as variation in carrying capacity and competition–colonization tradeoffs, were needed in the model to capture the detailed temporal diversity dynamics of the experiments, such as a general decline in γ‐diversity and long‐term dynamics in α‐diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRotifera 3acarrying capacity 3alandscapes 3alife history 3amodels 3arivers 3aspecies diversity1 aFronhofer, Emanuel A.1 aAltermatt, Florian0 tOikos.g2015 July, v. 124, no. 7 p.908-916dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0030-12997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.023543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006700150245013700217300001600354520142800370592002801798650001701826650001701843650002201860650002901882650001801911650001401929651002201943653001501965653002001980653001702000653001702017653001702034700003202051700003002083700002502113773010802138856008402246852000902330655001202339IND60605451120221123004441.0180721e20150310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060545112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2014.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaena Preysler, Javier,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6373-828610aRecycling in abundance: Re-use and recycling processes in the Lower and Middle Paleolithic contexts of the central Iberian Peninsula  ap. 142-154.  aThe central region of the Iberian Peninsula is dominated by Mesozoic and Palaeogene sedimentary deposits in which geochemical processes have provided a wide range of siliceous outcrops. In this context, raw material has been exploited since the Middle Pleistocene, notably at Acheulian and Mousterian sites. Several fieldwork projects have been embarked upon in the last 20 years with a view to studying the human occupation of this area. As a result, several archaeological sites have been found. Of these sites, Cañaveral, Berrocales and Ahijones have provided a significant amount of lithic evidence, which is currently being studied.In this paper, we present a conceptual discussion of the terms used to understand production levels inside the assemblage, as well as an insight into the reuse and recycling processes detected in the workshop/quarrying sites, that could be considered as evidence for raw material abundance. This approach takes into account a diachronical analysis of the Chaines operatoires in Acheulian, and particularly Mousterian sites. As a preliminary hypothesis, the presence of recycling or reuse in these areas of abundance could be due to social or economic reasons. The changes that occurred during the Lower and Middle Paleolithic introduce important developments in social participation in the flint knapping activities and strategies that could contribute towards explaining its presence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMesozoic era 3ageochemistry 3ahuman settlements 3aparticipation (behavior) 3araw materials 3arecycling 3aIberian Peninsula 0aMousterian 0aFlint quarrying 0aFlint mining 0aNeanderthals 0aHammerstones1 aNieto-Márquez, Irene Ortiz1 aNavas, Concepción Torres1 aCueto, Sergio Bárez0 tQuaternary international.g2015 Mar. 10, v. 361 p.142-154dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2014.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03748naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245005500169300001600224500001500240520191200255592002802167650002602195650002202221650001202243650000902255650001902264650001502283650002402298650002602322650003802348650001202386650001902398650001702417650002202434650001502456650001002471650001402481650001902495650002202514650001102536650001402547650002302561650002302584650005202607650003402659650001902693650002402712653003202736653002102768653002702789653001702816653001402833700002002847700002402867700001802891773010902909856008303018852000903101655001203110IND60535159120221119141648.0190411e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053515912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2013.07.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanyon, Sasha R.10aBovine viral diarrhoea: Pathogenesis and diagnosis  ap. 201-209.  a2019-12-06  aBovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is the most prevalent infectious disease of cattle. It causes financial losses from a variety of clinical manifestations and is the subject of a number of mitigation and eradication schemes around the world. The pathogenesis of BVDV infection is complex, with infection pre- and post-gestation leading to different outcomes. Infection of the dam during gestation results in fetal infection, which may lead to embryonic death, teratogenic effects or the birth of persistently infected (PI) calves. PI animals shed BVDV in their excretions and secretions throughout life and are the primary route of transmission of the virus. These animals can usually be readily detected by virus or viral antigen detection assays (RT-PCR, ELISA), except in the immediate post-natal period where colostral antibodies may mask virus presence. PI calves in utero (the ‘Trojan cow’ scenario) currently defy detection with available diagnostic tests, although dams carrying PI calves have been shown to have higher antibody levels than seropositive cows carrying non-PI calves.Acute infection with BVDV results in transient viraemia prior to seroconversion and can lead to reproductive dysfunction and immunosuppression leading to an increased incidence of secondary disease. Antibody assays readily detect virus exposure at the individual level and can also be used in pooled samples (serum and milk) to determine herd exposure or immunity. Diagnostic tests can be used to diagnose clinical cases, establish disease prevalence in groups and detect apparently normal but persistently infected animals. This review outlines the pathogenesis and pathology of BVD viral infection and uses this knowledge to select the best diagnostic tests for clinical diagnosis, monitoring, control and eradication efforts. Test methods, types of samples and problems areas of BVDV diagnosis are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiagnostic techniques 3aimmunosuppression 3aviremia 3acows 3aseroprevalence 3aantibodies 3afinancial economics 3abovine viral diarrhea 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aviruses 3aseroconversion 3apathogenesis 3aantigen detection 3amonitoring 3aherds 3apregnancy 3ateratogenicity 3apostpartum period 3acalves 3aexcretion 3avirus transmission 3adisease prevalence 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3aviral antigens 3aembryonic mortality 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus 0aDiagnostic tests 0aBovine viral diarrhoea 0aPathogenesis 0aDiagnosis1 aHill, Fraser I.1 aReichel, Michael P.1 aBrownlie, Joe0 tveterinary journal.g2014 Feb., v. 199, no. 2 p.201-209dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2013.07.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02230naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002100094024002900115024001100144040001800155100002300173245009700196300001600293500002000309506017300329520068300502592002801185650002201213650002401235650002001259650001001279650001201289650001201301651001301313700002101326700001901347773014301366856011201509856007601621956010101697961001301798852000901811655001201820IND50068025920221119054317.0200115e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006802592DNAL7 a10113/569952hdl7 a10.1093/ajae/aas0192doi8 ans2355  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirwan, Barrett E.10aAggregate and Farm‐Level Productivity Growth in Tobacco: Before and After the Quota Buyout  ap. 838-853.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aWe examine the distortionary effects of agricultural policy on farm productivity by examining the response of U.S. tobacco farmers’ productivity to the quota buyout of 2004.

We find that the aggregate productivity of Kentucky tobacco farms grew 44% between 2002 and 2007. The elimination of quota rental costs and reallocation of resources, including entry and exit, accounted for most of the post‐buyout productivity growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aagricultural policy 3acrop production 3afarms 3agrowers 3atobacco 3aKentucky1 aUchida, Shinsuke1 aWhite, T.

Within this objective, colostrum research has been a priority due to continued opportunities to improve this area on US dairy farms. Research has focused on heating colostrum to reduce bacterial populations and pathogens while increasing IgG absorption. Research also identified other proteins that are reduced when heating colostrum. Studies indicated an apparent upper limit to IgG absorption from colostrum fed to calves. Additional studies have shed light on absorption of IgG from colostrum replacers and evaluated the use of lactoferrin and sodium bicarbonate in both maternal colostrum and colostrum replacers. Milk replacer formulation, feeding strategies, and the effect of calfhood nutrition on future performance have also been researched. Finally, water quality and its effect on calves and heifers have been studied.

The hyperluminous x-ray source HLX-1 in the spiral galaxy ESO 243-49 is the best candidate to host a black hole of intermediate mass. Webb et al. (p. 554, published online 5 July) now report the detection of transient radio emission from this source, which may represent a jet ejection event. The radio flares indicate a mass that is consistent with that of an intermediate mass black hole. Jets have been seen to emanate from both supermassive and stellar-mass black holes. Intermediate mass black holes thus seem to behave like other black holes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3amass 3aradio 3aradio waves 3asolar radiation1 aCseh, David1 aLenc, Emil1 aGodet, Olivier1 aBarret, Didier1 aCorbel, Stephane1 aFarrell, Séan,1 aFender, Robert1 aGehrels, Neil1 aHeywood, D.

Sampling was performed according to the recommendations of the IGCP 259 (“International Geochemical Mapping”). Significant chemical contents variations were found even within the same volcano-stratigraphic unit, inherited from the parent rock composition under the semi-arid climate of the island. The chemical heterogeneity of topsoils within the same geological unit, particularly in the Upper Unit, was evidenced by a multivariate statistical analysis. Some differences found can be related with the geographical location/underlying basement. High contents of Mn, Co, Ga, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Tb, Ta, W, Th and U were observed in soils related to carbonatites and phonolites. REE and W can be used to trace outcrops of extrusive carbonatites. In general iron is strongly oxidized occurring in the silicates structure as well as in hematite, oxidized magnetite and maghemite. The global iron oxidation degree, the fraction of Fe3+ in silicates and the fraction of nanosized oxides, which are higher in topsoils of the older units, may be an indicator of weathering degree. As, Br and Sb contents were also found to increase with weathering. Topsoils developed on extrusive carbonatites are clearly distinguished due to the absence of Fe2+ in the silicate phases and the remarkable predominance of low oxidized magnetite.  aPublisher supplied data 3amanganese 3ahematite 3aantimony 3acobalt 3abromine 3amaghemite 3aweathering 3airon 3asemiarid zones 3aparent rock 3atopsoil 3aoxidation 3amultivariate analysis 3aneutron activation analysis 3abarium 3amagnetite 3asilicates 3aspectroscopy 3aCape Verde 0aTrace elements 0aoxides 0aBrava Island (Cape Verde) 0aINAA 0aCarbonatites 0aMössbauer spectroscopy 0aTopsoils1 aPrudêncio, M.I.1 aWaerenborgh, J.C.1 aRocha, F.1 aFerreira da Silva, E.1 aDias, M.I.1 aMadeira, J.1 aVieira, B.J.C.1 aMarques, J.G.0 tCatena.g2016 Dec., v. 147 p.522-535dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2016.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01340naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245010100161300001800262520036100280592002800641650001300669650001400682650002300696650002300719650003100742650002000773650001300793650000900806773012900815856007300944852000901017655001201026IND60658211220221123010006.0190816e20080226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065821122DNAL7 a10.1039/b719249e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConnon, Stephen J.10aAsymmetric catalysis with bifunctional cinchona alkaloid-based urea and thiourea organocatalysts  ap. 2499-2510.  aCinchona alkaloid derivatives modified to include a (thio)urea component have emerged in the last three years as readily accessible, robust and tunable bifunctional organocatalysts for a range of synthetically useful transformations.

The aims of this study were to provide a quantitative estimate of the carbon footprint of selected oilseed crops grown on the semiarid northern Great Plains and to determine the effects of N fertilization and environments on the carbon footprint. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five oilseed crops, Brassica napus canola, Brassica rapa canola, Brassica juncea canola, B. juncea mustard, and Sinapis alba mustard, were grown under the N rates of 0, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250Â kgÂ NÂ haâ1 at eight environsites (locationâÃâyear combinations) in Saskatchewan, Canada. Straw and root decomposition and various production inputs were used to calculate greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprints. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Emissions from the production, transportation, storage, and delivery of N fertilizer to farm gates accounted for 42% of the total greenhouse gas emissions, and the direct and indirect emission from the application of N fertilizer in oilseed production added another 31% to the total emission. Emissions from N fertilization were nine times the emission from the use of pesticides and 11 times that of farming operations. Straw and root decomposition emitted 120Â kgÂ CO2eqÂ haâ1, contributing 10% to the total emission. Carbon footprint increased slightly as N rates increased from 0 to 50Â kgÂ NÂ haâ1, but as N rates increased from 50 to 250Â kgÂ NÂ haâ1, carbon footprint increased substantially for all five oilseed crops evaluated. Oilseeds grown at the humid Melfort site emitted 1,355Â kgÂ CO2eqÂ haâ1, 30% greater than emissions at the drier sites of Scott and Swift Current. Oilseeds grown at Melfort had their carbon footprint of 0.52Â kgÂ CO2eqÂ kgâ1 of oilseed, 45% greater than that at Scott (0.45Â kgÂ CO2eqÂ kgâ1 of oilseed), and 25% greater than that at Swift Current (0.45Â kgÂ CO2eqÂ kgâ1 of oilseed). CONCLUSIONS: Carbon footprint of oilseeds was a function of the rate of N fertilizer, and the intensity of the functionality varied between environments. Key to lower carbon footprint in oilseeds is to improve N management practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica juncea 3aBrassica napus 3aBrassica rapa 3aSinapis alba 3acanola 3acarbon footprint 3afarming systems 3afertilizer rates 3agood agricultural practices 3agrain products 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aoilseed crops 3apesticides 3astraw 3atransportation 3aSaskatchewan1 aLiang, Chang1 aHuang, Gaobao1 aMalhi, Sukhdev S.1 aBrandt, Stewart A.1 aKatepa-Mupondwa, Felicitas0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2012 Jan., v. 17, no. 1 p.58-68dSpringer-Verlagx0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-011-0337-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245006700169300001600236500000900252520139900261592002801660650001601688650002001704650001701724650001601741650001301757650002001770650001101790650001201801700002101813700002301834773013601857856008201993852000902075655001202084IND60668504220221120100840.0191228e200005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066850422DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2000.643836x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarrido, Fernando10aMethod for In Situ Field Calibration of Fiber Optic Miniprobes  ap. 836-842.  aepub  aA fiber optic miniprobe (FOMP) system, based on remote fluorometry, has been recently developed for in situ real-time measurement of solute transport processes in soil. In order for the FOMP output light intensity measurements to be converted to fluorescent tracer concentration, an in situ calibration is necessary for each probe. The conventional calibration method consists of leaching the entire soil unit of interest with several pore volumes of tracer solution for each calibration step. The steady signal measured by the probes at each step is then related to tracer concentration. This procedure works well for typical laboratory soil columns but is impractical for fiber optic calibration in longer soil columns or field conditions because of the large amount of time and tracer required. As a result, a “point” calibration method has been developed that consists of injecting standard solutions directly into the small soil volume surrounding the measurement tip of the probe. Comparisons of the conventional leaching method with the injection calibration techniques confirmed the new procedures work well in both silica sand and clay loam soil columns. As a result, the new calibration technique was tested in a heterogeneous field soil and provided a simple and accurate approach to calibrating FOMPs for in situ real-time measurement of solute transport processes in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalibration 3aclay loam soils 3afiber optics 3afluorometry 3aleaching 3alight intensity 3aquartz 3asolutes1 aGhodrati, Masoud1 aCampbell, Chris G.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2000 May, v. 64, no. 3 p.836-842dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2000.643836x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005400144245010100198300002000299520116000319592002801479650001401507650001401521650001301535650001101548650001301559653002301572653002301595653002901618653002301647653002301670700006101693700001501754700001501769700001601784700001901800700001401819700001301833700001601846700005601862773014201918856007802060852000902138655001202147IND60679474920221119064934.0191228e20191204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067947492DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b173432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhou1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0516-881710aFast Digital Patterning of Surface Topography toward Three-Dimensional Shape-Changing Structures  ap. 48412-48418.  aExiting strategies for 3D shape-changing structures are constrained by either the complicated fabrication process or the harsh demands of active materials. Facile preparation of 3D shape-changing structures with an extremely simple approach based on the elastomeric polymer still remains a challenging topic. Here, we report a fast digital patterning of surface topography of a single-layer elastomeric polymer toward 3D shape-changing structures. The surface topography features digitally engraved grooves by a laser engraver on a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) sheet, which is surface oxidized by the UV-ozone treatment. The resulting engraved PDMS sheets exhibit programmable shape-changing behaviors to form various 3D structures under the action of organic solvent. Experimental and numerical studies reveal the fundamental aspects of surface topography-guided 3D shape-changing structures. Demonstrations of this concept in developing various complex 3D shape-changing structures illustrate the simplicity and effectiveness of our approach, thereby creating engineering opportunities in a wide range of applications such as actuators and soft robots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactuators 3aoxidation 3apolymers 3arobots 3asolvents 0asurface topography 0adigital patterning 0ashape-changing structure 0asolvent-responsive 0aUV-ozone treatment1 aLinghu, Changhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1659-80731 aYu, Kaixin1 aZhu, Jinye1 aLuo, Hongyu1 aQian, Chenghao1 aChen, Yin1 aDu, Yipu1 aZhang, Shun1 aSong, Jizhou1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2821-94290 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Dec. 04, v. 11, no. 51 p.48412-48418dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b173433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03663naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245008400160300001800244500002000262500001500282520224500297592002802542650002302570650001702593650001102610650001602621650002902637650001302666650002402679650001502703650002202718650001302740650002402753650001002777650001102787650001002798650002002808650001502828651001202843651001102855653001002866700002202876700002602898700002102924700002102945773009902966856007103065852000903136655001203145IND60569960220221118140401.0170626e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056996022DNAL7 a10.1890/02-06632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTremblay, Isabelle10aVariation in blue tit breeding performance across gradients in habitat richness  ap. 3033-3043.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aFood supply is widely considered to be a major factor in determining life history traits and reproductive performance of birds. However, large spatial and temporal variation in natural available food supply is not always paralleled by proportional changes in energy demand by breeding birds. This necessarily results in variation in the supply–demand ratio and the amount of food available per unit mass of nestling. Because reproductive performance should respond to increases in available supply as a saturation curve, reaching a plateau above a certain threshold of food supply, we predict that variation in supply should change the intensity of selection on reproductive traits. We first tested this prediction using long‐term data on nestling growth and survival in Blue Tits (Parus caeruleus) breeding over a gradient of habitat richness in Corsica, France. This long‐term data analysis evaluates the effect of variation in food supply available to breeding tits using three surrogate variables: interannual variation in peak caterpillar abundance (caterpillar frass fall), offset between breeding date and peak caterpillar abundance, and natural variation in clutch size. We also used an experimental brood size manipulation (±3 chicks) to test the effect of varying brood demand on nestling growth. Results of the long‐term data analysis show that all three variables affect fledging mass and fledging success in poor habitats, while only fledging mass is affected by variation in offset in rich habitats. Moreover, mean annual fledging success and fledging mass is strongly affected by annual variation in peak caterpillar abundance at low levels of abundance, but these effects disappear when food becomes abundant (saturation threshold level of 373 and 560 mg frass·m⁻²·d⁻¹ for fledging success and fledging mass, respectively). Brood size manipulations confirm these results. In rich habitats, breeding birds can raise three extra chicks without any apparent effects on chick growth, while in poor habitats, chick growth is significantly reduced with brood enlargement. Our study shows that although food limitation can play an important role, it may not always be the primary force shaping life history traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemporal variation 3alife history 3aenergy 3aclutch size 3areproductive performance 3abreeding 3aCyanistes caeruleus 3afledglings 3afood availability 3ahabitats 3areproductive traits 3afrass 3achicks 3aParus 3abreeding season 3aprediction 3aCorsica 3aFrance 0abirds1 aThomas, Donald W.1 aLambrechts, Marcel M.1 aBlondel, Jacques1 aPerret, Philippe0 tEcology.g2003 Nov., v. 84, no. 11 p.3033-3043dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-06633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03469naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015600168300001600324500001500340520179600355592002802151650003102179650001802210650002002228650001802248650002502266650001502291650001702306650000902323650002302332650002202355650001802377651001002395653002102405653001302426653002902439653004602468653001802514653002402532700001402556700005602570700001502626700001802641700001502659700001502674700001502689700001302704700001702717773008702734856008502821852000902906655001202915IND60557075220221116142009.0190403e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055707522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2016.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Shulan10aNonlinear responses of soil nitrous oxide emission to multi-level nitrogen enrichment in a temperate needle-broadleaved mixed forest in Northeast China  ap. 556-563.  a2019-12-06  aThe responses of nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from forest soils to increasing atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition are controversial. In this study, our objectives were to explore the response curves of soil N2O flux to multi-level N inputs, as well as to examine the key factors dominating the changes in soil N2O emission caused by N enrichment in the temperate needle-broadleaved mixed forest, Northeast China. The study consists of nine levels of urea addition (0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140kgNha−1yr−1) with 4 replicates for each treatment. Soil N2O fluxes were monitored weekly using the static chamber and gas chromatograph technique. NH4+-N, NO3−-N, total dissolved N (TDN), dissolved organic N (DON), and auxiliary variables (soil temperate and moisture in 0–10cm depth) were measured at the same frequency to examine the regulation of soil N2O flux. The results showed that high rates of urea inputs (>60kgNha−1yr−1) significantly increased soil NO3−-N concentrations in litter layer and mineral layer (0–10cm depth) by 120–180% and 56.4–84.6%, respectively. Soil N2O flux increased exponentially with increase in the rates of urea addition by 194% to 334% for the 60 to 140kgNha−1yr−1 treatments relative to the control. The critical level of N input for the significant alternation of soil N accumulation and N2O emission was approximately 70kgNha−1yr−1. The changes in soil N2O flux elicited by N addition were positively related to those of soil NO3−-N and soil moisture contents. These results suggest that exogenous N input at the rate below the critical load will not significantly promote soil N2O emission over the short term, which is favorable to carbon sequestration of the temperate needle-broadleaved mixed forest, Northeast China.  aPublisher supplied data 3adissolved organic nitrogen 3acritical load 3atemperate soils 3amixed forests 3acarbon sequestration 3asoil water 3aforest soils 3aurea 3agas chromatography 3aammonium nitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3aChina 0aSoil dissolved N 0anitrogen 0aAtmospheric N deposition 0aTemperate needle-broadleaved mixed forest 0aSoil N2O flux 0aNonlinear responses1 aWang, Lei1 aFang, Huajun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4033-94821 aYu, Guirui1 aYang, Xueming1 aLi, Xiaoyu1 aSi, Gaoyue1 aGeng, Jing1 aHe, Shun1 aYu, Guangxia0 tCatena.g2016 Dec., v. 147 p.556-563dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2016.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003500139245013400174300001600308520160200324592002801926650001601954650002001970650002501990650001502015650002202030650003102052650001002083650002102093650001202114650001802126650001102144650001502155650001402170650001502184650001902199650004302218650002002261650001902281650001002300700002002310700002402330700002402354773010602378856007302484852000902557655001202566IND60340799020221122152356.0150808e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034079902DNAL7 a10.1111/ppl.123102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández‐Pérez, Francisco14aThe suppression of AtPrx52 affects fibers but not xylem lignification in Arabidopsis by altering the proportion of syringyl units  ap. 395-406.  aLignins result from the oxidative polymerization of three hydroxycinnamyl (p‐coumaryl, coniferyl and sinapyl) alcohols in a reaction mediated by peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.7) and laccases (EC 1.10.3.2), yielding H, G and S units, respectively. Although both acidic and basic peroxidases can oxidize p‐coumaryl and coniferyl alcohol, only basic peroxidases are able to oxidize sinapyl alcohol. The AtPrx52 from Arabidopsis is a basic peroxidase that has been reported to be highly homologous to the basic peroxidase of Zinnia elegans, the only peroxidase which has been unequivocally linked to lignin formation. Here, we show how the suppression of AtPrx52 causes a change in lignin composition, mainly at the level of stem interfascicular fibers. Quantification of lignins in two different atprx52 knock‐out mutants revealed a decrease of lignin amount compared with wild type. The S/G ratio, obtained by both nitrobenzene oxidation and thioacidolysis, indicated a decrease in S units in the atprx52 mutants. As deduced from Wiesner and mainly Mäule staining, this reduction in S unit content appears to be restricted to the interfascicular fibers. Moreover, quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis in atprx52 plants showed a general downregulation of genes involved in lignin biosynthetic pathway, as well as genes related to secondary cell wall. On the other hand, other routes from phenylpropanoid metabolism were induced. Taken together, our results indicate that AtPrx52 is involved in the synthesis of S units in interfascicular fibers at late stages of the lignification process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aZinnia violacea 3abiochemical pathways 3acell walls 3aconiferyl alcohol 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aknockout mutants 3alaccase 3alignification 3alignin 3ametabolism 3aoxidation 3aperoxidase 3apolymerization 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asinapyl alcohol 3athioacidolysis 3axylem1 aPomar, Federico1 aPedreño, María A.1 aNovo‐Uzal, Esther0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2015 July, v. 154, no. 3 p.395-406dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.123103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03799naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092024002200135024001900157040001800176100002200194245011100216300001600327506007600343520133200419592002801751506003701779650002601816650001001842650001601852650001301868650002201881650001201903650002601915650001401941651001101955651000901966651001201975700002201987700002002009700002102029700002202050700002302072700001902095700002602114700002402140700002202164700002302186700002302209700001802232700001602250700002102266700001402287700001802301700001802319700002002337700001702357700001502374700002202389700001802411700001802429700002202447700002202469700001902491700001902510700001902529700001802548700002002566700002302586700002202609700001802631700002602649700002002675700002202695700002002717700002402737773008602761856008902847852000902936655001202945IND4492518720221207074640.0150809e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449251872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2011.11.0052doi7 aPMC32940512pmcid7 a221195842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCeesay, Serign J.10aSahel, savana, riverine and urban malaria in West Africa: Similar control policies with different outcomes  ap. 166-174.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe study sites for the West African ICEMR are in three countries (The Gambia, Senegal, Mali) and are located within 750km of each other. In addition, the National Malaria Control Programmes of these countries have virtually identical policies: (1) Artemisinin Combination Therapies (ACTs) for the treatment of symptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infection, (2) Long-Lasting Insecticide-treated bed Nets (LLINs) to reduce the Entomololgic Inoculation Rate (EIR), and (3) sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine for the Intermittent Preventive Treatment of malaria during pregnancy (IPTp). However, the prevalence of P. falciparum malaria and the status of malaria control vary markedly across the four sites with differences in the duration of the transmission season (from 4–5 to 10–11 months), the intensity of transmission (with EIRs from unmeasurably low to 4–5 per person per month), multiplicity of infection (from a mean of 1.0 to means of 2–5) and the status of malaria control (from areas which have virtually no control to areas that are at the threshold of malaria elimination). The most important priority is the need to obtain comparable data on the population-based prevalence, incidence and transmission of malaria before new candidate interventions or combinations of interventions are introduced for malaria control.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aSahel 3aartemisinin 3abed nets 3aissues and policy 3amalaria 3apesticide application 3apregnancy 3aGambia 3aMali 3aSenegal1 aBojang, Kalifa A.1 aNwakanma, Davis1 aConway, David J.1 aKoita, Ousmane A.1 aDoumbia, Seydou O.1 aNdiaye, Daouda1 aCoulibaly, Tinzana F.1 aDiakité, Mahamadou1 aTraoré, Sekou F.1 aCoulibaly, Mamadou1 aNdiaye, Jean-Louis1 aSarr, Ousmane1 aGaye, Oumar1 aKonate, Lassana,1 aSy, Ngayo1 aFaye, Babacar1 aFaye, Ousmane1 aSogoba, Nafomon1 aJawara, Musa1 aDao, Adama1 aPoudiougou, Belco1 aDiawara, Sory1 aOkebe, Joseph1 aSangaré, Lansana1 aAbubakar, Ismaela1 aSissako, Aliou1 aDiarra, Ayouba1 aKeita, Moussa,1 aKandeh, Balla1 aLong, Carole A.1 aFairhurst, Rick M.1 aDuraisingh, Manoj1 aPerry, Robert1 aMuskavitch, Marc A.T.1 aValim, Clarissa1 aVolkman, Sarah K.1 aWirth, Dyann F.1 aKrogstad, Donald J.0 tActa tropica.g2012 Mar., v. 121, no. 3 p.166-174dElsevier B.V.x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2011.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011200164300002000276500001100296520199500307592002802302596005902330596006602389650001602455650002302471650001702494650002502511650001602536650001702552650001402569650001302583650001102596650001402607650001502621650001802636650001702654651001002671651001802681700001902699700001702718700001402735700001802749700001302767700001502780700001902795700001702814700001802831700001402849700001402863773015502877856008303032852000903115655001203124IND60788438720221119053457.0220813e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078843872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-21226-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhikun12aA review of spatiotemporal patterns of neonicotinoid insecticides in water, sediment, and soil across China  ap. 55336-55347.  aReview  aNeonicotinoid insecticides (NNIs) have been widely used to control insect pests, while their environmental residues and associated hazardous impacts on human and ecosystem health have attracted increasing attention worldwide. In this study, we examined the current levels and associated spatial and temporal patterns of NNIs in multiple environmental media across China. Concentrations of NNIs in surface water, sediment, and soil were in the range of 9.94–755 ng·L⁻¹, 0.07–8.30 ng·g⁻¹ DW, and 0.009–356 ng·g⁻¹ DW, respectively. The high levels of NNIs in surface water, such as in Yangtze River (755 ng·L⁻¹), North River (539 ng·L⁻¹), Nandu River (519 ng·L⁻¹), and Minjiang River (514 ng·L⁻¹), were dominated by imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and acetamiprid due to their extensive use. The levels of NNIs in sediments were relatively low, and the highest concentration (8.30 ng·g⁻¹ DW) was observed in Dongguan ditch. Sediment–water exchange calculated from fugacity fraction indicated that NNIs in sediment can be released back into the water due to their high solubility and low KOW. Soils from agricultural zones contained the largest residual NNIs, with imidacloprid concentrations in cultivated soil reaching 119 ng·g⁻¹ DW. The calculated leaching potential showed that clothianidin has the highest migration potential to deep soil or groundwater. The monitored data of NNIs presented a decreasing trend from 2016 to 2018, which might be caused by the implementation of relevant control policies for NNI applications. The high levels of NNIs mainly occurred in southern China due to frequent agricultural activities and warm and humid meteorological conditions. The results from this study improve our understanding of the pollution levels and environmental behavior of NNIs in different environmental media across China and provide new knowledge that is needed for making future control policies for NNIs production and application.  aPublisher supplied data  a51779047cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aE2018007cNatural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province 3aacetamiprid 3aagricultural soils 3aclothianidin 3aenvironmental health 3agroundwater 3aimidacloprid 3apollution 3aresearch 3arivers 3asediments 3asolubility 3asurface water 3athiamethoxam 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aZhang, Leiming1 aZhang, Zulin1 aAn, Lihui1 aHough, Rupert1 aHu, Peng1 aLi, Yi-Fan1 aZhang, Fuxiang1 aWang, Shuang1 aZhao, Yunqing1 aKe, Yuxin1 aCui, Song0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Aug., v. 29, no. 37 p.55336-55347dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-21226-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03518naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245009500170300001600265520235200281592002802633650001302661650001402674650001502688650002202703650001202725650002202737650002402759650001102783650002502794650000902819650000702828650001402835650001302849650001302862650001602875700002602891773009502917856008703012852000903099655001203108IND60112029520221118005510.0141110e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011202952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2012.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWood, Rachel10aEscalation and ecological selectively of mineralogy in the Cambrian Radiation of skeletons  ap. 249-261.  aAssembly of the necessary biochemical machinery for biomineralisation long-predated the appearance and rapid diversification of metazoan skeletons in the late Ediacaran to Middle Cambrian (~550–520million years ago (Ma)), and the independent acquisition of skeletons of differing mineralogies suggests a trigger that conferred selective advantage to possession of a skeleton even though this involved physiological cost. The cost–benefit ratio of biomineralisation has changed over geological time, varying not only with the availability of precursor ions in seawater, but also with evolutionary innovations, as the energy required to produce a skeleton will change as a function of community ecology, particularly with increases in predation pressure. Here, we demonstrate that during the Cambrian Radiation the choice of biomineral was controlled by an interaction between changing seawater chemistry and evolving ecology. The record also reveals the successive skeletonisation of groups with increasing levels of activity from the Ediacaran to Middle Cambrian. The oldest (~550–540Ma) biomineralised organisms were sessile, and preferentially formed low-cost, simple, skeletons of either high-Mg calcite coincident with high mMg:Ca and/or low pCO₂ (aragonite seas), or phosphate during with a well-documented phosphogenic event. More elaborate, but tough and protective, aragonitic skeletons appeared from ~540Ma, dominantly in motile benthos (mostly stem- and crown-group Lophotrochozoa). The first low-Mg calcite skeletons of novel organic-rich composite materials (e.g. trilobites) did not appear until the late early Cambrian (~526Ma), coincident with the first onset of low mMg:Ca and/or high pCO₂ (calcite seas). Active, bentho-pelagic predatory groups (vertebrates, chaetognaths, some arthropods) appearing mainly in the late early Cambrian preferentially possessed phosphatic skeletons, which were more stable at the low pH ranges of extracellular fluids associated with intense activity and high-energy ecologies. These trends suggest that the increasing physiological cost of biomineralisation in successively more demanding metabolisms was offset by the increased chance of survival conferred by a protective skeleton, so indicating a driver of escalating community ecology, in particular an increase in predation pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnimalia 3aaragonite 3aarthropods 3abenthic organisms 3acalcite 3acommunity ecology 3acomposite materials 3aenergy 3aextracellular fluids 3aions 3apH 3apredation 3aseawater 3askeleton 3avertebrates1 aZhuravlev, Andrey Yu.0 tEarth-science reviews.g2012 Dec., v. 115, no. 4 p.249-261dElsevier B.V.x0012-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2012.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012400161300001600285520156000301592002801861650001901889650001101908650001401919650002201933650001201955650001401967650001201981650001901993650002402012650001102036650001702047700002102064700002402085700002502109700003202134700002202166773010602188856007302294852000902367655001202376IND60340799120221122092829.0150808e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034079912DNAL7 a10.1111/ppl.123212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSawicki, Mélodie10aDistinct regulation in inflorescence carbohydrate metabolism according to grapevine cultivars during floral development  ap. 447-467.  aCarbohydrate metabolism is important in plant sexual reproduction because sugar contents are determining factors for both flower initiation and floral organ development. In woody plants, flowering represents the most energy‐consuming step crucial to reproductive success. Nevertheless, in these species, the photosynthesis performed by flowers supplies the carbon required for reproduction. In grapevine (Vitis vinifera), the inflorescence has a specific status because this organ imports carbohydrates at the same time as it exports photoassimilates. In this study, fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism were monitored by analyzing gas exchanges, photosynthetic electron transport capacity, carbohydrate contents and some activities of carbohydrate metabolism enzymes, in the inflorescences of Pinot noir and Gewurztraminer, two cultivars with a different sensitivity to coulure phenomenon. Our results showed that photosynthetic activity and carbohydrate metabolism are clearly different and differently regulated during the floral development in the two cultivars. Indeed, the regulation of the linear electron flow and the cyclic electron flow is not similar. Moreover, the regulation of PSII activity, with a higher Y(NPQ)/Y(NO) ratio in Gewurztraminer, can be correlated with the higher protection of the photosynthetic chain and consequently with the higher yield under optimal conditions of this cultivar. At least, our results showed a higher photosynthetic activity and a better protection of PSI in Pinot noir during the floral development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3acarbon 3acultivars 3aelectron transfer 3aenzymes 3aflowering 3aflowers 3aphotosystem II 3asexual reproduction 3asugars 3awoody plants1 aJacquens, Lucile1 aBaillieul, Fabienne1 aClément, Christophe1 aVaillant‐Gaveau, Nathalie1 aJacquard, Cédric0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2015 July, v. 154, no. 3 p.447-467dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.123213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01136naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245006400154300001800218520025600236592002800492650001400520650002300534700001700557700002300574700002200597700001800619773012800637856007200765852000900837655001200846IND60658211520221123005847.0190816e20080307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065821152DNAL7 a10.1039/b719304a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNg, Ka-Yuen10aAnion induced and inhibited circumrotation of a [2]catenane  ap. 1281-1283.  aThe first example of a catenane capable of performing circumrotation via an anion switching methodology is described; of particular interest is a conformational locking mechanism which results from chloride coordination in the catenane binding cavity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatenanes 3achemical reactions1 aFelix, Vitor1 aSantos, Sérgio M.1 aRees, Nicholas H.1 aBeer, Paul D.0 tChemical communications.g2008 Mar. 7, , no. 11 p.1281-1283dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b719304a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005300151245014000204520167900344592002802023650001302051650003002064650002202094650002702116650001502143650001102158650002302169650001902192650001202211650002102223650001102244650001402255650002902269650001102298650001702309651001002326653001502336653003302351653002202384653002002406700001702426700001902443700001602462773010502478856008602583852000902669655001202678IND60677511320221117032436.0200318e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067751132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.1243942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7708-338010aTopographic controls on ecosystem evapotranspiration and net primary productivity under climate warming in the Taihang Mountains, China  aTopography is a key control of mountain ecosystems and the corresponding ecohydrological processes in mountain environments. This study examines the influence of topography on variations in mountain ecohydrology under climate warming in the Taihang Mountains in China. The BioGeochemicalCycles (BIOME–BGC) ecosystem model was modified and used to evaluate ecosystem evapotranspiration (ET) and net primary productivity (NPP) for deciduous broadleaf trees, shrubs and grass at different elevation gradients and examine the changes in these variables under a 3 °C–warming scenario with no precipitation changes. The results showed that the ET and NPP of deciduous broadleaf trees and shrubs increased with elevation below 1500 m and decreased with elevation above 1500 m. The NPP and ET of deciduous broadleaf trees and shrubs decreased in response to warming below 1500 m, and increased above 1500 m. For grass, the ET and NPP slightly decreased with greater elevation and increased under climate warming. Combined with the influence of precipitation on ET and NPP, the response to warming can be explained as follows: deciduous broadleaf trees are under water stress in low–middle elevation and under energy stress in high elevation. Shrubs were influenced by water conditions with an optimal precipitation of 600 mm at low–middle elevation and under energy stress in high elevation. Grass was under energy stress at all elevations. The results of this study are important for identifying topographic and climate change impacts on mountain ecosystem and can provide support for planning and management of future ecosystem restoration in the Taihang Mountains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abroadleaved trees 3aecological restoration 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3aevapotranspiration 3aglobal warming 3agrasses 3ahydrologic cycle 3amodels 3amountains 3anet primary productivity 3ashrubs 3awater stress 3aChina 0aTopography 0aEcosystem evapotranspiration 0aTaihang Mountains 0aClimate warming1 aJia, Yangwen1 aZhan, Chesheng1 aXu, Weihong0 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 Feb., v. 581 p.124394-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.1243943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245017000174300002000344500001100364520160900375592002801984650001902012650001202031650001802043650001702061650002802078650002802106650001802134650001402152650001302166650000902179650001202188700002202200700002802222700002002250700001702270700001602287773015502303856008302458852000902541655001202550IND60788438920221119053731.0220813e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078843892DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-21213-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPourfadakari, Sudabeh10aEvaluation of occurrence of organic, inorganic, and microbial contaminants in bottled drinking water and comparison with international guidelines: a worldwide review  ap. 55400-55414.  aReview  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of inorganic and organic substances as well as microbial contaminants in bottled drinking water on a global scale. The findings were compared to WHO guidelines, EPA standards, European Union (EU) directive, and standards drafted by International Bottled Water Association (IBWA). Our review showed that 46% of studies focused on the organic contaminants, 25% on physicochemical parameters, 12% on trace elements, 7% on the microbial quality, and 10% on microplastics (MPs) and radionuclides elements. Overall, from the 54 studies focusing on organic contaminants (OCs) compounds, 11% of studies had higher OCs concentrations than the standard permissible limit. According to the obtained results from this review, several OCs, inorganic contaminants (IOCs), including CHCl₃, CHBrCl₂, DEHP, benzene, styrene, Ba, As, Hg, pb, Ag, F, NO₃, and SO₄ in bottled drinking water of some countries were higher than the international guidelines values that may cause risks for human health in a long period of time. Furthermore, some problematic contaminants with known or unknown health effects such as EDCs, DBP, AA, MPs, and some radionuclides (⁴⁰K and ²²²Rn) lack maximum permissible values in bottled drinking water as stipulated by international guidelines. The risk index (HI) for OCs and IOCs (CHBrCl₂, Ba, As, and Hg) was higher than 1 in adults and children, and the value of HI for CHCl₃ in children was more than 1. Thus, further studies are required to have a better understanding of all contaminants levels in bottled drinking water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abenzene 3abottled water 3ahuman health 3amicrobial contamination 3amicrobiological quality 3amicroplastics 3apollution 3aresearch 3arisk 3astyrene1 aDobaradaran, Sina1 aDe-la-Torre, Gabriel E.1 aMohammadi, Azam1 aSaeedi, Reza1 aSpitz, Jorg0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Aug., v. 29, no. 37 p.55400-55414dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-21213-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01251naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245012700159300001800286520016800304592002800472650001100500650001100511650002300522650001300545650001600558700002500574700002600599700002900625700002800654700002100682773012900703856007200832852000900904655001200913IND60658211620221123005913.0190816e20080312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065821162DNAL7 a10.1039/b719309b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVardelle, Emilie10aCyclisation/fluorination of nitrogen containing dienes in superacid HF–SbF₅: a new route to 3- and 4-fluoropiperidines  ap. 1473-1475.  aVarious N,N-diallylic amines and amides were rapidly converted to fluorinated piperidines after a novel cyclisation/fluorination reaction in superacid HF–SbF₅.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamides 3aamines 3achemical reactions 3anitrogen 3apiperidines1 aGamba-Sanchez, Diego1 aMartin-Mingot, Agnès1 aJouannetaud, Marie-Paule1 aThibaudeau, Sébastien,1 aMarrot, Jérôme0 tChemical communications.g2008 Mar. 12, , no. 12 p.1473-1475dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b719309b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245010900164300001800273520172100291592002802012650001802040650002502058650001402083650001402097650001902111650001202130650000902142650001102151650001502162650001402177650001302191650001802204650002202222650001802244650001002262700001902272700002802291700002102319700001702340700002302357700001902380700002002399700002502419700003102444773012902475856007402604852000902678655001202687IND60648092920221118015124.0190626e20190625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064809292DNAL7 a10.1039/c9bm00661c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aop 't Veld, Roel C.10aMonitoring ¹¹¹In-labelled polyisocyanopeptide (PIC) hydrogel wound dressings in full-thickness wounds  ap. 3041-3050.  aWounds often result in scarring, prolonged morbidity, and loss of function. New interactive and modifiable hydrogel wound dressings are being developed for these injuries. Polyisocyanopeptide (PIC) gel is a promising thermosensitive hydrogel having several characteristics that can facilitate wound repair, including ease of application/removal and strain-stiffening properties that mimic extracellular matrix components. However, it is unknown whether the PIC gel remains in the wound for a clinically relevant time period. Therefore, PIC polymers were functionalized with a DTPA group allowing labelling with Indium-111 (¹¹¹In). Following application of this radiolabelled gel to splinted and non-splinted murine full-thickness skin wounds the signal was monitored using SPECT/CT imaging for 7 days. The SPECT signal from the PIC gel was highly stable and covered the complete wound area. Non-bound ¹¹¹In-EDTA was rapidly cleared via the kidneys to the urine. The impact of PIC gels on wound repair was further studied visually and histologically. Radiolabelled PIC gel was observed to move both over and under the skin, while histological analysis demonstrated that part of the gel became encapsulated within the wound repair tissue, but did not delay wound closure or otherwise impair wound healing. This work illustrates for the first time the use of ¹¹¹In-labelled PIC gels for diagnostic and monitoring purposes and describes the use of PIC in the (non-)splinted murine skin wound model. It was found that PIC gels remained in splinted and non-splinted full-thickness skin wounds during wound repair. This warrants the continuation of developing the PIC gel into a clinically advanced wound dressing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aencapsulation 3aextracellular matrix 3ahistology 3ahydrogels 3aimage analysis 3akidneys 3amice 3amodels 3amonitoring 3amorbidity 3apolymers 3aradiolabeling 3athermosensitivity 3atissue repair 3aurine1 aJoosten, Lieke1 avan den Boomen, Onno I.1 aBoerman, Otto C.1 aKouwer, Paul1 aMiddelkoop, Esther1 aRowan, Alan E.1 aJansen, John A.1 aWalboomers, X.

To explore the possibility of using baculoviruses as biological control agents instead of chemical pesticides, in a previous study we characterized a number of S. litura nucleopolyhedrovirus (SpltNPV) isolates from Pakistan. We found significant differences in speed of kill, an important property of a biological control agent. Here we set out to understand the genetic basis of these differences in speed of kill, by comparing the genome of the fast-killing SpltNPV-Pak-TAX1 isolate with that of the slow-killing SpltNPV-Pak-BNG isolate. These two isolates and the SpltNPV-G2 reference strain from China were deep sequenced with Illumina. As expected, the two Pakistani isolates were closely related with >99% sequence identity, whereas the Chinese isolate was more distantly related. We identified two loci that may be associated with the fast action of the SpltNPV-Pak-TAX1 isolate. First, an analysis of rates of synonymous and non-synonymous mutations identified neutral to positive selection on open reading frame (ORF) 122, encoding a viral fibroblast growth factor (vFGF) that is known to affect virulence in other baculoviruses. Second, the homologous repeat region hr17, a putative enhancer of transcription and origin of replication, is absent in SpltNPV-Pak-TAX1 suggesting it may also affect virulence. Additionally, we found there is little genetic variation within both Pakistani isolates, and we identified four genes under positive selection in both isolates that may have played a role in adaptation of SpltNPV to conditions in Central Asia. Our results contribute to the understanding of the enhanced activity of SpltNPV-Pak-TAX1, and may help to select better SpltNPV isolates for the control of S. litura in Pakistan and elsewhere.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSpodoptera litura 3aSpodoptera litura nucleopolyhedrovirus 3abiological control agents 3acotton 3acrops 3afibroblast growth factors 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ainsect control 3ainsect pests 3aloci 3amutation 3aopen reading frames 3areplication origin 3avirulence 3aCentral Asia 3aChina 3aPakistan1 aAli, Ghulam 1 avan Strien, Elisabeth  A.1 aSchijlen, Elio  G.

Clumping, a characteristic of foliage distribution, is one of the important aspects of canopy structure and significantly influences light penetration through the canopy. Airborne full-waveform LiDAR data contains large amounts of structural information, and presents a powerful avenue for providing detailed foliage distribution information over large areas. In this study, we present a method for describing physical canopy clumping structure for individual trees that can resolve fine scale variations in foliage clumping. We first utilize K-means clustering algorithm to extract structure found within full-waveform LiDAR data. Then we use representative traits for each data cluster to classify them into their natural groups. Based on these traits, we draw conclusions about physical representations of each group and identify groups as containing clumps in vegetation ranging from spares to dense. We formulate a clumping index multiplier based on cluster traits that inform relative degrees of vegetation clumping at the sub-canopy scale. We use the clumping index multiplier to introduce heterogeneity to a modeled plot level clumping index and generate a vertical clumping index profile for a forested plot. This study demonstrates that large amounts of canopy structural information can be extracted from waveform LiDAR data. The fine resolution canopy clumping structure found by the method described in this work can be used as valuable input for ecological models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acanopy 3aecological models 3aleaves 3alidar 3amultipliers 3aremote sensing 3atrees 3avegetation 0aWaveform LiDAR 0aCanopy clumping 0aVegetation structure1 aKumar, Praveen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4787-03080 tRemote sensing of environment.g2019 Oct., v. 232 p.111281-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.1112813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245007900172300001400251520103500265592002801300650000801328650002001336650001401356650001601370650001301386650001901399650001101418650002401429650002001453650001301473650001501486650001901501650001801520650001001538650001501548653001501563653001701578653002201595653003901617700003201656700002201688700002101710700002201731773010901753856008701862852000901949655001201958IND60601885720221116150830.0190318e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060188572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2017.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGili, Renato D.10aPhysical characterization and fluidization design parameters of wheat germ  ap. 29-37.  aWheat germ is the embryo of de wheat seed, it contains a high tocopherol and protein content, and high quality proteins and fatty acids. Also, wheat germ has a considerable enzymatic activity that limits its shelf life. The aims of the study were to physically and sorptionally characterize wheat germ particles, select the more convenient model to describe the relationship between moisture content and water activity of wheat germ and to determine their design parameters of thermal fluidization process with air. The principal axes of the particle were measured by image analysis, and their dimensions and geometric parameters were calculated. Four isotherm models were fitted to experimental data. GAB model was the more accurate to explain the experimental data. The fixed bed density and the void fraction were measured. The fluid-dynamic studies permitted to determine laminar (277.46 ± 17.48) and turbulent (7.79 ± 0.69) coefficients of the Ergun equation and the minimum fluidization velocity (0.35 ± 0.02 m/s).  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aenzyme activity 3aequations 3afatty acids 3ageometry 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3aphysical properties 3aprotein content 3aproteins 3ashelf life 3awater activity 3awater content 3awheat 3awheat germ 0aWheat germ 0aFluidization 0aSorption isotherm 0aPhysical particle characterization1 aTorrez Irigoyen, R.

An Empirical Study of Water Utilities in Portugal  ap. 1757-1772.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWhat factors influence the voluntary adoption of Water Safety Plans (WSPs) by water utilities? EU Directive 2015/1787, October 6th, on water quality for human consumption, mandates the implementation of a risk assessment process for all water utilities. The strategic approach present in WSPs may be decisive for this purpose, allowing utilities to pursue effective risk assessments with positive repercussions for public health and environmental protection, as well as for the governance of the water sector. This article investigates the factors influencing the voluntary adoption of WSPs by water utilities in Portugal prior to the change in the national regulatory framework. More specifically, it seeks to explore whether the governance arrangement of water utilities – in-house bureaucracies, municipal corporations, concessions to private firms or public-public partnerships – affects the likelihood of adoption of a WSP. The results indicate that governance arrangements can make a difference when it comes to the adoption of this methodology, suggesting that water utilities run by in-house bureaucracies are less likely to adopt WSPs. The dimension is also a relevant factor as utilities serving above 50,000 residents or 10,000 m³/day are more prone to adopt WSPs. Moreover, water utilities with quality management systems in place are more predisposed to adopt WSPs. Broadly, the article urges all stakeholders, mainly water utilities and national regulators, to implement measures that lead to the best possible results considering that the implementation of WSPs is a major upgrade in water quality assurance.  aPublisher supplied data  aUID/CPO/0758/2019cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (PT) 3aempirical research 3aenvironmental protection 3agovernance 3ahumans 3apublic health 3aquality control 3arisk 3arisk assessment process 3astakeholders 3awater 3awater quality 3awater utilities 3aPortugal1 aTavares, António F.0 tWater resources management.g2020 Mar., v. 34, no. 5 p.1757-1772dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-020-02527-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009000172300001600262520105700278592002801335650001501363650001901378650001501397650001301412650002301425650001401448650002301462650002001485650000901505651001601514653002301530653001901553653001201572653002501584653002001609653001201629700001701641700002301658700001901681700002401700700002201724700002101746700001901767700002201786773009001808856008501898852000901983655001201992IND60478103320221122050235.0160109e20151002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047810332DNAL7 a10.1080/14888386.2015.11179902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTampucci, Duccio10aPlant and arthropod colonisation of a glacier foreland in a peripheral mountain range  ap. 213-223.  aPrimary successions along glacier forelands are perfect examples of the changing climate upon high mountain ecosystems. Peripheral mountain ranges deserve particular attention, given they are characterised by high numbers of species and endemism and are considered to be particularly susceptible to climate change. We analysed thermal regime, soil parameters and plant/arthropod primary succession along a glacier foreland located in such a context, comparing it with those previously studied in the inner Alps. The overall patterns of the investigated primary succession agree with those of the inner Alps at the same elevation, but stands out for a delayed plant and arthropod colonisation which promotes the long-lasting persistence of pioneer cold-adapted species. In light of the results obtained, and considering the glaciological features of peripheral mountain ranges (glaciers persistence at low elevation), this paper asserts the hypothesis that glacial landforms of these areas may act as warm-stage refugia for pioneer cold-adapted species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarthropods 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aglaciers 3aindigenous species 3amountains 3aprimary succession 3arefuge habitats 3asoil 3aAlps region 0aprimary succession 0aclimate change 0arefugia 0acold-adapted species 0acarabid beetles 0aspiders1 aGobbi, Mauro1 aBoracchi, Patrizia1 aCabrini, Erika1 aCompostella, Chiara1 aMangili, Federico1 aMarano, Giuseppe1 aPantini, Paolo1 aCaccianiga, Marco0 tBiodiversity.g2015 Oct. 2, v. 16, no. 4 p.213-223dTaylor & Francisx2160-06517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14888386.2015.11179903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01997naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245005900172300001600231520088400247592002801131650002001159650001101179650001201190650001601202650001501218651001001233653002701243653001601270653001901286653001001305653002501315700001501340700002301355700001901378773011901397856008601516852000901602655001201611IND60602470720221122084746.0180711e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060247072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.revpalbo.2015.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKealhofer, Lisa10aPhytoliths in Chinese foxtail millet (Setaria italica)  ap. 116-127.  aIncreasingly, archeologists are realizing that early agriculturalists manipulated suites of plant species as they contended with environmental instability and cultural performance. Studying these complex interactions requires robust diagnostic indicators for each species. This has been particularly difficult for millet macrobotanical remains in Asia. Microbotanical remains, such as phytoliths, offer a possible alternative for millet identification. To date, work on Setaria phytoliths has focused on a restricted number of species, limiting the confidence of identifying domesticated Setaria. Here we present the results of morphometric analysis of both leaf and inflorescence morphology across 12 of the 14 species of Setaria found in China today. Results suggest that robust discrimination of Setaria italica requires measurements of two types of inflorescence bract cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSetaria italica 3aleaves 3amillets 3amorphometry 3aphytoliths 3aChina 0aMicrobotanical remains 0aAgriculture 0aFoxtail millet 0aChina 0aPhytolith morphology1 aHuang, Fei1 aDeVincenzi, Maxine1 aKim, Morris M.0 tReview of palaeobotany and palynology.g2015 Dec., v. 223 p.116-127dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11736x0034-66677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2015.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011300170300001800283500001900301520174100320592002802061596012102089650003002210650003002240650001102270650001202281650001902293650001902312650001002331651001002341700001702351773012602368856008302494852000902577655001202586IND60696143820221118143159.0201112e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069614382DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-020-02531-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPichuka, Subbarao10aAssessment of Extreme Precipitation in Future through Time-Invariant and Time-Varying Downscaling Approaches  ap. 1809-1826.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSkill of a time-varying downscaling approach, namely Time-Varying Downscaling Model (TVDM), against time-invariant Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) approach for the assessment of precipitation extremes in the future is explored. The downscaled precipitation is also compared with a Regional Climate Model (RCM) product obtained from Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX). The potential of downscaling the extreme events is assessed considering Bhadra basin in India as the study area through different models (SDSM, TVDM and RCM) during historical period (calibration: 1951–2005, testing: 2006–2012). Next, the changes in precipitation extremes during future period (2006–2035) have been assessed with respect to the observed baseline period (1971–2000), for different Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. All the models indicate an increasing trend in the precipitation, for the monsoon months and maximum increase is noticed using RCP8.5. The annual precipitation during the future period (RCP8.5) is likely to increase by 7.6% (TVDM) and 4.2% (SDSM) in the study basin. An increase in magnitude and number of extreme events during the future period is also noticed. Such events are expected to be doubled in number in the first quarter of the year (January–March). Moreover, the time-invariant relationship (in SDSM) between causal-target variables is needed to be switched with time-varying (TVDM). This study proves that the time-varying property in TVDM is more beneficial since its performance is better than SDSM and RCM outputs in identifying the extreme events during model calibration and testing periods. Thus, the TVDM is a better tool for assessing the extreme events.  aPublisher supplied data  aDST/CCP/CoE/79/2017(G)cDepartment of Science and Technology, Climate Change Programme (SPLICE), Government of India 3aadministrative management 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abasins 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3amonsoon season 3awater 3aIndia1 aMaity, Rajib0 tWater resources management.g2020 Mar., v. 34, no. 5 p.1809-1826dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-020-02531-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245006600168300001200234500001900246520116900265592002801434596006801462596006801530596006801598596007201666650001501738650002501753650002201778650001501800650001001815650001001825650002601835650002601861650002201887650001601909650001701925650001301942650003101955650001401986650001302000700002502013700002002038700006002058700002102118773011002139856008302249852000902332655001202341IND60719168720221120161128.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071916872DNAL7 a10.1186/s12985-020-01459-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGale, Trevor V.10aElevated L-threonine is a biomarker for Lassa fever and Ebola  ap. 188.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBACKGROUND: Lassa fever and Ebola are characterized by non-specific initial presentations that can progress to severe multisystem illnesses with high fatality rates. Samples from additional subjects are examined to extend and corroborate biomarkers with prognostic value for these diseases. METHODS: Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry metabolomics was used to identify and confirm metabolites disrupted in the blood of Lassa fever and Ebola patients. Authenticated standards are used to confirm the identify of key metabolites. RESULTS: We confirm prior results by other investigators that the amino acid L-threonine is elevated during Ebola virus infection. L-Threonine is also elevated during Lassa virus infection. We also confirmed that platelet-activating factor (PAF) and molecules with PAF moiety are reduced in the blood of patients with fatal Lassa fever. Similar changes in PAF and PAF-like molecules were not observed in the blood of Ebola patients. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolomics may provide tools to identify pathways that are differentially affected during viral hemorrhagic fevers and guide development of diagnostics to monitor and predict outcome.  aPublisher supplied data  aAI104621cNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  aAI114855cNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  aAI115754cNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  a1U19AI135995cNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases 3aEbolavirus 3aLassa mammarenavirus 3aLassa virus fever 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3adeath 3adiagnostic techniques 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amoieties 3aplatelet-activating factor 3athreonine 3avirology1 aSchieffelin, John S.1 aBranco, Luis M.1 aGarry, Robert F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5683-32501 aGrant, Donald S.0 tVirology journal.g2020 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.188-188dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-020-01459-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245016100208300001600369506007600385520108400461592002801545506003701573650002101610650001901631650001901650650001101669650002401680650002301704650001501727650001401742650001301756650001001769650001001779650001101789650001001800650001901810650001401829650001301843650001301856650001501869651001401884700002801898700002301926700001901949700002101968700002201989700001702011700001702028773011402045856008202159852000902241655001202250IND60591136820221207133605.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059113682DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-018-1035-x2doi7 aPMC65246262pmcid7 a295164402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMosbech, Anders10aOn the crucial importance of a small bird: The ecosystem services of the little auk (Alle alle) population in Northwest Greenland in a long-term perspective  ap. 226-243.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe little auk is the most numerous seabird in the North Atlantic and its most important breeding area is the eastern shores of the North Water polynya. Here, a population of an estimated 33 million pairs breeds in huge colonies and significantly shapes the ecosystem. Archaeological remains in the colonies document that the little auk has been harvested over millennia. Anthropological research discloses how the little auk has a role both as social engineer and as a significant resource for the Inughuit today. The hunting can be practiced without costly equipment, and has no gender and age discrimination in contrast to the dominant hunt for marine mammals. Little auks are ecological engineers in the sense that they transport vast amounts of nutrients from sea to land, where the nutrients are deposited as guano. Here, the fertilized vegetation provides important foraging opportunities for hares, geese, fox, reindeer, and the introduced muskox. We estimate that the relative muskox density is ten times higher within 1 km of little auk fertilized vegetation hotspots.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOvibos moschatus 3aanimal manures 3abreeding sites 3abreeds 3aecosystem engineers 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aequipment 3aforaging 3afoxes 3ageese 3agender 3ahares 3amarine mammals 3anutrients 3areindeer 3aseabirds 3avegetation 3aGreenland1 aJohansen, KasperLambert1 aDavidson, ThomasA.1 aAppelt, Martin1 aGrønnow, Bjarne1 aCuyler, Christine1 aLyngs, Peter1 aFlora, Janne0 tAmbio.g2018 Apr., v. 47, no.

Even though several control strategies have been applied, PRRS is still not effectively controlled due to the continuous emergence of new variants and limited cross-protection by current vaccines. During the routine epidemiological investigation in 2017, two PRRSV variants were identified from a severe abortion farm and a clinically healthy farm, respectively. The viruses were isolated and denominated as XJ17-5 and JSTZ1712-12. Genomic sequencing indicated that their genomes are both 14,960 bp in length sharing 99.45% nucleotide identity. Sequence alignments identified a discontinuous 30-amino-acid deletion and a continuous 120-amino-acid deletion in nsp2 of both isolates. Genome-based phylogenetic analysis confirmed that XJ17-5 and JSTZ1712-12 belong to the HP-PRRSV subtype but form a new branch with other isolates containing the same 150-amino-acid deletion in nsp2. Pathogenic analysis showed that XJ17-5 is highly virulent causing 60% mortality, while JSTZ1712-12 is avirulent for piglets. Furthermore, fragment comparisons identified 34-amino-acid differences between XJ17-5 and JSTZ1712-12 that might be associated with the distinct virulence. The identification of highly homologous HP-PRRSV variants with new genetic feature and distinct virulence contributes to further analyze the pathogenesis and evolution of PRRSV in the field.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aamino acids 3across immunity 3aepidemiological studies 3afarms 3afinancial economics 3agenome 3agenomics 3amortality 3apathogenesis 3aphylogeny 3apiglets 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3apork industry 3asequence alignment 3avaccines 3avirulence 3aviruses1 aYe, Mengxue 1 aHuang, Yucheng 1 aLi, Shuai 1 aXiao, Yanzhao 1 aLi, Xinshuai 1 aLi, Shubin 1 aLi, Xiangdong 1 aYu, Xiuling 1 aTian, Kegong 1 aZhu, Jianzhong 0 tViruses.g2019 Sept. 18, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v110908753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011400169300001400283520172700297592002802024650002702052650000802079650001202087650001302099650001102112650001402123650001602137650001202153650001202165650002102177650001902198650002202217650001102239653001202250653001602262653001602278653002202294653002702316700001402343700001202357700001402369700001402383700001402397773010902411856008702520852000902607655001202616IND60601885920221116150801.0190318e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060188592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2017.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaguerre, O.10aInfluence of the air humidity on the drying of a liquid droplet on a solid plate and on bacterial destruction  ap. 76-86.  aThis study was carried out in order to develop experimental methodology using a camera to monitor the evolution of the surface of a liquid droplet deposited on a solid surface composed of polypropylene. The droplet was exposed to various ambient relative humidity conditions (11.3%, 43.2%, 68.9% and 75.5%). Two types of liquid were investigated: distilled water and water containing nutritive substances (salmon “juice”). At 11.3% relative humidity, it takes 40% longer to evaporate a water droplet (initial weight 0.36 g, volume 360 μL, radius 6.5 × 10−3 m) than a salmon “juice” droplet (3.66 h for distilled water, 2.83 h for salmon “juice”). In the case of the distilled water droplet, the wet surface decreases gradually and completely disappears at the end of the process. In the case of the salmon “juice” droplet, the wet surface is constant for about 2 h and then decreases gradually because of drying from the edge towards the center of the droplet. A simple equation making it possible to predict the drying rate as a function of air humidity was developed. Also, measurements of the loss of cultivability of Listeria monocytogenes under different relative humidity conditions were carried out experimentally. The relationship between the relative humidity, droplet drying time and loss of cultivability was analyzed. It was observed that for 11.3%, 43.2% and 68.9% relative humidity conditions, the drying time and the loss of cultivability can be correlated, while at 75.5% relative humidity, the phenomena are more complex. This study shows that the relative humidity of air can potentially be controlled in order to limit bacterial growth, thus enhancing hygiene in food plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aair 3acameras 3adroplets 3adrying 3aequations 3afood plants 3ahygiene 3aliquids 3amicrobial growth 3apolypropylenes 3arelative humidity 3asalmon 0aDroplet 0aEvaporation 0aDrying rate 0aRelative humidity 0aListeria monocytogenes1 aLecoq, L.1 aZoz, F.1 aGuyot, S.1 aBeney, L.1 aFlick, D.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2017 Nov., v. 212 p.76-86dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2017.05.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245012400166520141100290592002801701650002501729650001701754650002401771650001501795650001801810650001101828650001201839650002301851650003101874650001001905650001401915650005201929650001501981650002001996653002402016653002402040653001802064653002902082700001902111773012102130856007702251852000902328655001202337IND60673404420221118073009.0191018e20181003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067340442DNAL7 a10.1093/femsle/fny2432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneider, Ellen M10aN-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) supports the growth of Borrelia burgdorferi in the absence of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)  aBorrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, lacks the ability to biosynthesize many essential nutrients de novo, including N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). This amino sugar is required for cell wall synthesis, and is a component of the complex growth medium used for in vitro propagation. When cultured without free GlcNAc, B. burgdorferi cells exhibit a unique biphasic growth pattern. We hypothesized that genes involved in the GlcNAc starvation response would be differentially expressed when compared to cells cultured in complete medium, and investigated this using transcriptomics. Twenty-one genes were differentially regulated in wild-type and starvation-adapted cells cultured without GlcNAc compared to wild-type cells cultured with GlcNAc. Of those, three genes involved in carbohydrate utilization were upregulated: bbb04 (chbC) encoding a subunit of the chitobiose transporter, bb0629 (fruA-2) encoding a putative carbohydrate transporter and bb0644 (nanE) encoding a putative GlcNAc-6-phosphate-2-epimerase predicted to catalyze the conversion of N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate (ManNAc-6-P) to GlcNAc-6-P. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to confirm differential expression of select genes, and substitution of free GlcNAc with free ManNAc resulted in growth to high cell density, suggesting B. burgdorferi cells can utilize free ManNAc for cell wall synthesis and energy production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aLyme disease 3aN-acetylglucosamine 3acell walls 3aculture media 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3aetiological agents 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3anutrients 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astarvation 3atranscriptomics 0aN acetylglucosamine 0aN-acetylmannosamine 0atranscriptome 0acarbohydrate utilization1 aRhodes, Ryan G0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2018 Oct. 03, v. 365, no. 21dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl50329x1574-69687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsle/fny2433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006800153245009200221300001600313520139900329592002801728650001701756650001101773650002201784650001701806650002501823650001501848650001101863650001801874650001101892650001101903650002201914653001901936653001801955653002601973653001801999653003102017700006102048773013402109856008802243852000902331655001202340IND60611463720221118040628.0210121e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061146372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.08.2762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarkodie, Samuel Asumadu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5035-598312aA review on Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis using bibliometric and meta-analysis  ap. 128-145.  aThe Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis dates back in decades and is still topical presently due to its importance in environmental policy formulation. There are several systematic reviews of the EKC hypothesis using traditional review method. However, this review employs bibliometric and meta-analysis to track historical trends on the theme using the VOSviewer software and meta-analytic methods. The review translates the network analysis into visualized forms based on authors' contribution, the impact of the research by countries, citations count, and text corpus modeling using a network data extracted from Web of Science. The meta-analysis reveals that the collection of studies that validate the inversed-U shaped relationship has an average of US$8910 as the turning point of annual income level. Low income and middle-income countries are found below the thresholds of annual income level while high-income countries are above. Heterogeneity is confirmed among turning point in studies on EKC hypothesis due to differences in the period of study and econometric methods used in model estimation. The empirical findings reveal that most of the studies on EKC hypothesis are based on atmospheric indicators, while literature is sporadic and limited on EKC hypothesis which employs land indicators, oceans, seas, coasts and biodiversity indicators, and freshwater indicators.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acoasts 3acomputer software 3aeconometrics 3aenvironmental policy 3afreshwater 3aincome 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3aoceans 3asystematic review 0aEKC hypothesis 0aMeta-analysis 0aBibliometric analysis 0aTurning point 0aPollution haven hypothesis1 aStrezov, Vladimir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9129-92840 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 649 p.128-145dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.08.2763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245017700167300001400344520176200358592002802120650001802148650001102166650001502177650001202192650001302204650001202217650001102229650001302240651001102253653001902264653002202283653001802305653003102323700002302354700002102377700002302398773010202421856008402523852000902607655001202616IND60602471120221122041926.0180711e20150315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060247112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sedgeo.2014.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerry, Serge14aThe base-of-slope carbonate breccia system of Céüse (Tithonian, S-E France): Occurrence of progradational stratification in the head plug of coarse granular flow deposits  ap. 71-86.  aOnce interpreted as a deep-water canyon infilling and later as some kind of tempestite deposit, the Tithonian breccias of Ceüse are here reinterpreted as a small lobe deposit, emplaced at the mouth of a gully cutting into a slope between two deep-water terraces in the eastern part of the subalpine basin. The breccias belong to two basic categories: mostly grain-supported and occasionally mud-supported. Spectacular large-scale oblique geometries (apparent lateral accretions) are observed in the grain-supported breccias, both within the infilling of the lower feeder channel and in the updip part of the lobe. Detailed analyses of these geometries show that they correspond to progradational features. Both laterally and in a more distal position on the lobe, these progradational bodies evolve into a pile of unsorted massive breccias, sometimes showing a crude, even stratification. We thus propose a depositional model for the grain-supported breccias, linking the two facies as follows: the deposition of a gravity flow begins at the toe-of-slope (mouth of the tributary gully) by a progradational head which evolves downslope and laterally to a splay of massive or crudely stratified breccia. The internal oblique stratification flattens distally over a distance of a few kilometres. Elementary beds pile up in morphological compensation to build the 100m thick breccia body of Céüse. Because the breccias are derived from the gravity-reworking of deep-water nodular carbonates, there is no sand-sized material available in the depositional system, or only a little probably produced through an erosive clast grain diminution process during transport. This explains why the thick breccia beds pass quickly eastward to thin-bedded mud turbidites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTithonian age 3abasins 3acarbonates 3acutting 3ageometry 3agravity 3amodels 3aterraces 3aFrance 0aUpper Jurassic 0aCarbonate breccia 0aGranular flow 0aApparent lateral accretion1 aGrosheny, Danièle1 aBackert, Nicolas1 aAtrops, François,0 tSedimentary geology.g2015 Mar. 15, v. 317 p.71-86dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11737x0037-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2014.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003200188245009000220300001600310506007600326520102900402592002801431506003701459650002201496650001101518650001901529651001401548700003201562700001701594773011401611856008201725852000901807655001201816IND60591137220221207130827.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059113722DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-018-1032-02doi7 aPMC59635662pmcid7 a295164442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersen, AstridOberborbeck10aIs sustainable resource utilisation a relevant concept in Avanersuaq? The walrus case  ap. 265-280.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis article addresses the role of Atlantic walrus (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) in present-day Avanersuaq from anthropological and biological perspectives, and asks whether or not sustainable resource utilisation is a useful concept in northwest Greenland. We describe the relations that unfold around walrus and walrus hunting, in the communities living adjacent to the North Water polynya on the eastern side of Smith Sound. We examine the interplay of walrus population abundance, hunting practices, uses, and formal (governmental) and informal (traditional) ways of regulating the hunt, and we analyse how walruses acquire multiple values as they circulate in different networks. Sustainable resource utilisation, we conclude, is a concept that is relevant in Avanersuaq and beyond, because it works as a biological standard, and hence organises laws, norms, and practices of formal management. Simultaneously, the term is problematic, because it ignores manifold levels of human and societal values connected to walrus.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOdobenus rosmarus 3ahumans 3asocial benefit 3aGreenland1 aHeide-Jørgensen, MadsPeter1 aFlora, Janne0 tAmbio.g2018 Apr., v. 47, no.

The effects of: (i) the generation, (ii) the type of peripheral groups near the cationic charges (a SiMe₂ moiety or a S atom depending on the synthetic procedure, hydrosilylation or thiol–ene addition, respectively), (iii) the core of dendrimers (polyphenoxo vs. Si atom) and (iv) the focal point of dendrons (–N₃, –NH₂, –OH) have been assessed. The structure–activity relationship analysis indicates the importance of an adequate balance between the hydrophilic and lipophilic fragments of these molecules to reach the best antibacterial activity. Regarding hemolysis, lowest toxicity values were registered for dendritic systems with a sulfur atom close to the surface and, in the particular case of dendrons, for those with a hydroxyl focal point. One dendrimer and one dendron, both bearing a sulfur atom close to the surface, scored best in the activity–toxicity relationship analysis and were chosen for resistance assays. No changes in the inhibitory and bactericidal capacity in the case of the dendron and only a slight increase of these values for the dendrimer were observed after 15 subculture cycles. Furthermore, these two compounds remained active towards different strains of resistant bacteria, including multi-resistent S. aureus, and avoided formation of biofilms at concentrations over the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aammonium 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3adendrimers 3ahemolysis 3ahydrophilicity 3alipophilicity 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amoieties 3asilicon 3astructure-activity relationships 3asulfur 3atoxicity1 aSánchez-Nieves, Javier1 aHernández-Ros, José M.1 aFernández-Ezequiel, Alba1 aSoliveri, Juan1 aCopa-Patiño, José L.1 aGómez, Rafael,1 aJavier de la Mata, F.0 tRSC advances.g2016 Jan. 18, v. 6, no. 9 p.7022-7033dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra25901k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014600167300001600313520098600329592002801315650001301343650000901356650001701365650001901382650001501401650001201416650001201428650001101440650001201451650001801463650002001481650001201501650002301513650001501536650001101551651001601562653002301578653001201601653002001613653001601633700002401649700001601673700001501689700001401704700001601718700001301734773012201747856008501869852000901954655001201963IND60478103920221122094041.0160109e20151002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047810392DNAL7 a10.1080/00288233.2015.10731602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSneddon, NW10aPredicted dairy product yields and deficits of lactose for manufacturing under differing selection and manufacturing scenarios in New Zealand  ap. 432-440.  aThe New Zealand dairy industry is pasture-based and more than 90% of milk products are exported. The breeding goal of the breeding programme of New Zealand dairy cattle is to improve the capability of the cow to convert feed into farmer profit. The breeding objective rewards yields of protein and fat but penalises milk volume and ignores lactose, despite it being an important component of milk powders. With the industry currently in deficit for lactose, this study investigated the expected response to selection over the next 10 years and its impact on the annual industry production of milk, its components and yields of dairy products based on expected cow performance, number of cows and a fixed area for dairying. After 10 years of selection (with no increase in herbage production), there was a 5% increase in milk production per hectare. Total milk exports increased by 5.9% and the lactose deficit increased by 14% when 60% of milk was processed into whole milk powder.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding 3acows 3adairy cattle 3adairy industry 3adried milk 3aexports 3afarmers 3aforage 3alactose 3amanufacturing 3amilk production 3apowders 3aselection response 3awhole milk 3ayields 3aNew Zealand 0abreeding objective 0alactose 0amilk processing 0aNew Zealand1 aLopez-Villalobos, N1 aHickson, RE1 aShalloo, L1 aDavis, SR1 aGarrick, DJ1 aGeary, U0 tNew Zealand journal of agricultural research.g2015 Oct. 2, v. 58, no. 4 p.432-440dTaylor & Francisx1175-87757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288233.2015.10731603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245015100166300001500317520141500332592002801747650002601775650001101801650001401812651001201826651001001838653001201848653002601860653001001886653002001896653001301916700001501929700001601944700001401960700001401974700005301988700005802041773010302099856008402202852000902286655001202295IND60602471220221122045905.0180711e20150315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060247122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sedgeo.2014.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Goff, J.10aContribution to the understanding of the Ionian Basin sedimentary evolution along the eastern edge of Apulia during the Late Cretaceous in Albania  ap. 87-101.  aIntegrated in the peri-Adriatic domain, the Ionian Basin extended along a NW-SE direction during the Late Cretaceous, limited on its sides by the Apulian and the Kruja platforms. The basinal/slope succession was studied in seven outcrops exposed in the Albanian fold-and-thrust belt. Sedimentological investigations, supported by bio- and chronostratigraphy were performed on calcareous Upper Cretaceous hemipelagites, gravity-flow deposits and slumps. The western part of the basin was studied, revealing a strong influence of the Apulian margin, alternatively shedding sediment basinward, by means of a tectonically controlled edge. The Late Albian to Cenomanian period is characterized by the settling of muddy debrites along the margin. A deep basinal environment characterizes this period which prolongs until the Santonian, with no significant influx of the platform basinward. This sedimentary setting abruptly changed at the end of the Santonian, with an important influx derived from both platforms. Coarsening and thickening upward sequences show a progressive increase in sediment shedding during the Campanian. The Late Campanian-Early Maastrichtian period points out a major change on the resedimentation processes with the settling of several slumped units reworking thick sediment packages. The latter can be traced along the Apulian margin, testifying of instabilities along the edge of Apulia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLate Cretaceous epoch 3abasins 3asediments 3aAlbania 3aItaly 0aAlbania 0aGravity-flow deposits 0aSlump 0aLate Cretaceous 0aTectonic1 aCerepi, A.1 aSwennen, R.1 aLoisy, C.1 aCaron, M.1 aMuska, K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6853-46371 aEl Desouky, H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0702-73050 tSedimentary geology.g2015 Mar. 15, v. 317 p.87-101dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11737x0037-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2014.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245012000203300001600323520211500339592002802454650001902482650001602501650002102517650002602538650002902564653003802593653003502631653002502666653002002691700001602711700001602727700001902743773009702762856008502859852000902944655001202953IND60749722620221120045807.0211017e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074972262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2021.08.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Bolin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8907-884510aTemporal-spatial determinants of renewable energy penetration in electricity production: Evidence from EU countries  ap. 438-451.  aThe challenge of global warming requires deep decarbonization of the electricity system, which can be achieved with a higher share of renewables in the electricity mix. However, the driving mechanism for renewable penetration in electricity production has not been clearly revealed so far. Using the data of the European Union (EU) during 2001–2017, this paper aims to investigate the spatial-temporal heterogeneity and dynamic evolution mechanism of renewable electricity penetration. To this end, from the investment-production-consumption perspective, renewable electricity generation is decomposed into seven factors through temporal and spatial factor decomposition methods. Then, this paper integrates the factor decomposition results into a coupling elasticity analysis to study the dynamic evolution mechanism of renewable penetration in electricity production. The results are as follows. (1) Investment structure contributes the most to increasing renewable electricity generation, while the energy intensity effect and renewable generation-to-capacity ratio effect are the main reasons for the reduction in renewable electricity generation. The effect of technological structure is minor. (2) The economic scale effect and the investment structure effect are dominating factors accounting for the regional difference of renewable power generation between the EU countries and the benchmark region. (3) The progress of renewable electricity penetration accelerates over time for the EU, western EU, and eastern EU. The Western EU has realized remarkable progress in facilitating renewable electricity penetration during 2009–2017. (4) On the whole, the investment effect makes the largest contribution to promoting renewable electricity penetration, while the production effect is the major inhibiting factor, showing that there is considerable potential in renewable generation efficiency improvement in the EU. This paper provides insightful implications for energy policies aimed at the shift towards a low-carbon electricity system in the EU, which also gives a reference for other economies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aelectricity 3apower generation 3arenewable electricity 3arenewable energy sources 0aRenewable electricity penetration 0aTemporal-spatial heterogeneity 0aFactor decomposition 0aCoupling effect1 aFang, Debin1 aYu, Hongwei1 aZhao, Chaoyang0 tRenewable energy.g2021 Dec., v. 180 p.438-451dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.08.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03586naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245007400207300001200281520217500293592002802468596007902496650002002575650001602595650002202611650001102633650002802644650002302672650001702695650001902712650001602731650001802747650001202765651001202777651002802789700002802817700002102845700002802866700001902894700002202913773011302935856008303048852000903131655001203140IND60719169120221120161104.0211015e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071916912DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-020-04481-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFolly, Arran J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0106-218510aEquine seroprevalence of West Nile virus antibodies in the UK in 2019  ap. 596.  aBACKGROUND: West Nile virus (WNV) is a single-stranded RNA virus that can cause neurological disease in both humans and horses. Due to the movement of competent vectors and viraemic hosts, WNV has repeatedly emerged globally and more recently in western Europe. Within the UK, WNV is a notifiable disease in horses, and vaccines against the virus are commercially available. However, there has been no investigation into the seroprevalence of WNV in the UK equine population to determine the extent of vaccination or to provide evidence of recent infection. METHODS: Equine serum samples were obtained from the Animal and Plant Health Agency’s equine testing service between August and November 2019. A total of 988 serum samples were selected for horses resident in South East England. WNV seroprevalence was determined using two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to detect total flavivirus antibodies and WNV-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Positive IgM results were investigated by contacting the submitting veterinarian to establish the clinical history or evidence of prior vaccination of the horses in question. RESULTS: Within the cohort, 274 samples tested positive for flavivirus antibodies, of which two subsequently tested positive for WNV-specific IgM antibodies. The follow-up investigation established that both horses had been vaccinated prior to serum samples being drawn, which resulted in an IgM-positive response. All the samples that tested positive by competition ELISA were from horses set to be exported to countries where WNV is endemic. Consequently, the positive results were likely due to previous vaccination. In contrast, 714 samples were seronegative, indicating that the majority of the UK equine population may be susceptible to WNV infection. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence for cryptic WNV infection in a cohort of horses sampled in England in 2019. All IgM-seropositive cases were due to vaccination; this should be noted for future epidemiological surveys in the event of a disease outbreak, as it is not possible to distinguish vaccinated from infected horses without knowledge of their clinical histories.  aPublisher supplied data  aSE0555cUnited Kingdom, Department for Environment, Food and Rural affairs 3aWest Nile virus 3ablood serum 3adisease outbreaks 3ahorses 3anervous system diseases 3anotifiable disease 3aplant health 3aseroprevalence 3avaccination 3aveterinarians 3aviruses 3aEngland 3aWestern European region1 aWaller, Elisabeth S.

However, in practice, they are rarely implemented. We analyze the failure of a floodplain restoration project that was supposed to be implemented on the River Rhône (France). Based on the analysis of floodplain restoration projects implementation literature, we identified several constraints on the implementation of the project. In accordance with the literature, institutional factors were found to have played a critical role in the failure of the project. Other factors such as opposing representations between inhabitants and river managers were also important. Moreover, the strong involvement of the State alongside river managers proved to be a major constraint on implementation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflood control 3afloodplains 3amanagers 3amodels 3arivers 3aFrance0 tRegional environmental change.g2015 Mar., v. 15, no. 3 p.559-568dSpringer-Verlagx1436-37987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-014-0650-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001800168245007400186300001400260520091300274592002801187650002501215650001401240650001501254650001101269650001401280650001201294650001701306650001001323650003001333650004501363650001801408650001301426650001201439650002401451650002101475650002001496650003601516650003901552650004601591650001801637650002901655650002401684700001801708700001601726700001701742700002101759773008101780856008501861852000901946655001201955IND4448731020221118053700.0141112e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444873102DNAL7 a212275952pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2010.11.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aM.

In PCR, all the samples generated an amplicon of 456bp. Restriction enzyme digestion of the PCR product with AluI, HhaI, BspTI and ApoI revealed characteristic RFLP patterns. Of the samples of unknown origin few were identified as cattle, few as buffalo and some were admixtures of two, suggesting adulteration. The RFLP pattern of one did not match any of species included in the study, which on sequencing was confirmed as camel meat. Application of this technique on adulterated meat samples could detect both animal species in proportion of 50:50 and 75:25 (except in case of goat+cattle). The technique however could not detect any of the two species when proportion of mixture was 90:10 (except in case of cattle+buffalo).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulterated products 3abuffaloes 3acamel meat 3acattle 3adigestion 3aenzymes 3afood animals 3agenes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribosomal RNA 3ataxonomy 2aAnimals 2aBuffaloesxgenetics 2aCattlexgenetics 2aGoatsxgenetics 2aMeatxanalysisxclassification. 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aRNAxanalysis 2aRNA, Ribosomalxanalysis 2aSpecies Specificity1 aY.

In order to quantify transpiration rate (TR) of oyster mushrooms and to develop an empirical predictive model that will allow to design an effective packaging system, fresh mushrooms were stored at 2, 6, 10, 14 and 18 °C and at 86, 96 and 100% relative humidity (RH) under an ambient atmosphere. Periodically, mushroom mass was recorded over 248 h of storage. TR of mushrooms ranged between 0.52 (±0.04), at 2 °C and 100% RH, and 3.88 (±0.41) g.kg−1.h−1 for mushrooms stored at 18 °C and 86% RH. An empirical mathematical model considering the effect of temperature and RH was developed. Temperature effect was explained using an Arrhenius model and the constants of the model were fitted into linear equations to explain the effect of RH on TR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPleurotus ostreatus 3aequations 3afresh produce 3amathematical models 3amushrooms 3apackaging 3arelative humidity 3ashelf life 3astorage temperature 3atranspiration 0aModelling 0aMass loss rate 0aPleurotus ostreatus 0apackaging1 aCunha, Luís M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4590-75331 aOliveira, Jorge C.1 aMahajan, Pramod V.1 aFonseca, Susana C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4793-59650 tJournal of food engineering.g2017 Nov., v. 212 p.108-112dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2017.05.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013300165300001400298520139600312592002801708650001601736650001601752650002701768650002001795650002501815650001601840650001801856650002401874650000901898650002101907650001801928650002201946650001101968650002801979650001402007650001602021650001402037653001602051653002802067653001202095653001402107653001102121653001102132653001102143653000902154653001102163653001102174653000802185653000902193653000902202653000702211653000802218700002402226700002102250700001802271700001802289700002202307700002302329700002902352773011702381856008202498852000902580655001202589IND60533604020221118160632.0190410e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053360402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2014.10.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrudal, Espen10aVaccination with outer membrane vesicles from Francisella noatunensis reduces development of francisellosis in a zebrafish model  ap. 50-57.  aInfection of fish with the facultative intracellular bacterium Francisella noatunensis remains an unresolved problem for aquaculture industry worldwide as it is difficult to vaccinate against without using live attenuated vaccines. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are biological structures shed by Gram-negative bacteria in response to various environmental stimuli. OMVs have successfully been used to vaccinate against both intracellular and extracellular pathogens, due to an ability to stimulate innate, cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. We show by using atomic force and electron microscopy that the fish pathogenic bacterium F. noatunensis subspecies noatunensis (F.n.n.) shed OMVs both in vitro into culture medium and in vivo in a zebrafish infection model. The main protein constituents of the OMV are IglC, PdpD and PdpA, all known Francisella virulence factors, in addition to the outer membrane protein FopA and the chaperonin GroEL, as analyzed by mass spectrometry. The vesicles, when used as a vaccine, reduced proliferation of the bacterium and protected zebrafish when subsequently challenged with a high dose of F.n.n. without causing adverse effects for the host. Also granulomatous responses were reduced in F.n.n.-challenged zebrafish after OMV vaccination. Taken together, the data support the possible use of OMVs as vaccines against francisellosis in fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aFrancisella 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aadverse effects 3aaquaculture industry 3achaperonins 3aculture media 3aelectron microscopy 3afish 3ahumoral immunity 3alive vaccines 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3aouter membrane proteins 3apathogens 3avaccination 3avirulence 0aFrancisella 0aOuter membrane vesicles 0aVaccine 0aZebrafish 0aF.n.n. 0aF.n.o. 0aF.t.n. 0aOMVs 0ad.p.i. 0aw.p.i. 0aCFU 0agDNA 0aqPCR 0aGE 0aLAV1 aLampe, Elisabeth O.1 aReubsaet, Léon,1 aRoos, Norbert1 aHegna, Ida K.1 aThrane, Ida Marie1 aKoppang, Erling O.1 aWinther-Larsen, Hanne C.0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2015 Jan., v. 42, no. 1 p.50-57dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2014.10.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245016600178300001600344520138300360592002801743650001901771650001801790650002601808650001801834650001401852650001901866650001201885650002201897650001001919650001501929653001801944653001801962653001901980653001901999653001802018653001002036700002202046700002302068700002202091700001802113700002102131700002102152700001402173700002002187700001902207773008802226856008602314852000902400655001202409IND60089199120221120033058.0160903e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008919912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.03.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHettelingh, Jean-Paul10aAssessing interim objectives for acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone of the EU National Emission Ceilings Directive with 2001 and 2012 knowledge  ap. 129-140.  aThe National Emission Ceilings Directive regulating European Union (EU) Member State emissions of acidifying and eutrophying pollutants as well as ozone precursors was adopted in 2001. Its interim environmental objectives, to be achieved in 2010, consist of a reduction of the exceedance of critical loads for acidification and eutrophication and of critical levels of ground-level ozone relative to 1990. Objectives for acidification and ground-level ozone were to be met in every single receptor grid cell in the European Union. For eutrophication, however, the target was to be met only for the EU area as a whole. Since 2001, reported emissions for 1990 and 2010 as well as knowledge and methodologies and for computing atmospheric dispersion and critical loads and levels have changed. In this paper, it is shown that acidification and eutrophication objectives are largely met when assessing them with the knowledge of 2001. However, with 2012 knowledge the interim objectives for acidification and eutrophication are not met in most of the EU. The objectives for ground-level ozone are met in most EU Member States with both 2001 and present (2012) knowledge, with the exception of the objective for forests, which was still not met in most Member States in 2010. Therefore, it seems prudent that science is employed also in the implementation phase of policy agreements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aacidification 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acritical load 3aemissions 3aeutrophication 3aforests 3aissues and policy 3aozone 3apollutants 0aAcidification 0aAir pollution 0aCritical loads 0aEutrophication 0aNEC Directive 0aOzone1 aPosch, Maximilian1 aVelders, Guus J.M.1 aRuyssenaars, Paul1 aAdams, Martin1 aLeeuw, Frank de,1 aLükewille, Anke1 aMaas, Rob1 aSliggers, Johan1 aSlootweg, Jaap0 tAtmospheric environment.g2013 Aug., v. 75 p.129-140dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.03.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245015800165300001600323520148500339592002801824596004001852650002101892650001701913650001601930650001701946650002501963650001901988650002102007650002402028650001102052650001602063650001202079650001202091650000902103650001702112651001802129700002002147700006202167773012102229856008202350852000902432655001202441IND60655937720221119125917.0190807e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065593772DNAL7 a10.1007/s11130-019-00755-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEarling, Mei10aAçai Berry (Euterpe oleracea) Dietary Supplements: Variations in Anthocyanin and Flavonoid Concentrations, Phenolic Contents, and Antioxidant Properties  ap. 421-429.  aAçai (Euterpe oleracea) is a palm plant that is native to South America and produces deep purple berry fruits. Despite açai’s popularity as a dietary supplement, little is known about the phenolic composition and antioxidant properties of commercially available açai berry products. Therefore, twenty açai supplements in a variety of forms (e.g., capsule, powder, frozen pulp, and liquid) were analyzed for their total phenolic and anthocyanin contents, individual anthocyanin and other flavonoid concentrations, and antioxidant capacities. Hierarchical cluster analysis was then used to group açai supplements into categories based on similarities in their chemical profiles and antioxidant properties. Results showed that over half of the supplements contained little or no açai fruit or had sufficient amounts of water to substantially lower the concentration of açai chemical components. Additionally, two açai supplements contained unlisted ingredients that greatly altered the products’ chemical properties. Chromatographic analysis of individual anthocyanins and other flavonoids was useful in identifying the presence of açai fruit within the dietary supplements while complimentary in vitro spectroscopic assays aided in detection of adulterants. This study highlights the complexity of the dietary supplement market while also showing the importance of collectively analyzing data from multiple complimentary techniques when evaluating açai berry products.  aPublisher supplied data  aAF-0005cRobert A.

Basic morphological data is given for all species of Amphisbaenia known for Bolivia and Peru to aid in the identification of specimens from those countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSquamata 3abiodiversity 3acolor 3ageographical distribution 3ahead 3alizards 3amuseums 3arare species 3ashape 3aBolivia 3aKansas 3aPeru 0aCarl Gans 0aMuseum 0aReptile 0aTaxonomy1 aWelton, Luke J.1 aHallermann, Jakob0 tEvolutionary Systematics.g2018 Sept. 19, v. 2, no. 2 p.125-135dPensoft PublisherswJournal:27337x2535-07307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/evolsyst.2.280593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007300148245006900221300001600290520112600306592002801432596008101460650003401541650001301575650002201588650002501610650001101635650002801646650001001674650002001684650002201704650001801726650003101744650002201775650001801797650002601815650002201841650004301863650001301906700003001919700002501949700002201974700002701996700002202023700001902045773012102064856008202185852000902267655001202276IND60655937820221119130132.0190807e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065593782DNAL7 a10.1007/s11130-019-00757-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira Raphaelli, Chirle1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6398-356710aApple Phenolic Extracts Strongly Inhibit α-Glucosidase Activity  ap. 430-435.  aThe beneficial health effects of apple consumption are well known, however, little is known about the potential of its phenolic fractions to inhibit α-glucosidases and thereafter to treat diseases related to the carbohydrate metabolism, such as postprandial hyperglycemia and diabetes. In the present study, the α-glucosidase inhibition and antioxidant activity of different phenolic fractions of apple were evaluated using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. Moreover, the phenolic fractions were chemically characterized by LC-MS in order to identify the compounds responsible for the biological properties. The purified extract (not fractionated) had the highest α-glucosidase and hydroxyl radical inhibitions. The purified extract and fractions III and IV were more active against the enzyme activity than the positive control acarbose, the drug used by diabetic patients to treat postprandial hyperglycaemia. Our results show that apple phenolic extracts strongly inhibit α-glucosidase acitivity, validating their potential to be used in the management of type 2 diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data  a00106998056cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aacarbose 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aantioxidant activity 3aapples 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3adrugs 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3afractionation 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ahyperglycemia 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients1 ados Santos Pereira, Elisa1 aCamargo, Taiane Mota1 aVinholes, Juliana1 aRombaldi, Cesar Valmor1 aVizzotto, Márcia1 aNora, Leonardo0 tPlant foods for human nutrition.g2019 Sept., v. 74, no. 3 p.430-435dSpringer USwJournal:jnl42388x0921-96687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11130-019-00757-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245006200170500001400232520128600246592002801532650000801560650001301568650001901581650000901600650002201609650001201631650002801643650001701671650001101688650001801699650001701717650001501734650001401749650001401763650002201777650002201799700002501821700002501846700002401871773012301895856007402018852000902092655001202101IND60718977320221119040436.0201126e20201104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071897732DNAL7 a10.3390/nu121133802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeterson, Christine  Tara10aB Vitamins and Their Role in Immune Regulation and Cancer  aNAL-light  aB group vitamins represent essential micronutrients for myriad metabolic and regulatory processes required for human health, serving as cofactors used by hundreds of enzymes that carry out essential functions such as energy metabolism, DNA and protein synthesis and other critical functions. B vitamins and their corresponding vitamers are universally essential for all cellular life forms, from bacteria to humans. Humans are unable to synthesize most B vitamins and are therefore dependent on their diet for these essential micronutrients. More recently, another source of B vitamins has been identified which is derived from portions of the 10¹³ bacterial cells inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract. Here we review the expanding literature examining the relationship between B vitamins and the immune system and diverse cancers. Evidence of B vitamin’s role in immune cell regulation has accumulated in recent years and may help to clarify the disparate findings of numerous studies attempting to link B vitamins to cancer development. Much work remains to be carried out to fully clarify these relationships as the complexity of B vitamins’ essential functions complicates an unequivocal assessment of their beneficial or detrimental effects in inflammation and cancers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abacteria 3acarcinogenesis 3adiet 3aenergy metabolism 3aenzymes 3agastrointestinal system 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aimmune system 3ainflammation 3aliterature 3aneoplasms 3anutrients 3aprotein synthesis 3avitamin B complex1 aRodionov, Dmitry  A.1 aOsterman, Andrei L.,1 aPeterson, Scott  N.0 tNutrients.g2020 Nov. 04, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu121133803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001600184245012100200300001300321506007600334520107600410592002801486506003701514650001601551650001401567650001301581650003001594650001001624650001301634650001701647650001401664650002501678650001801703653002201721653001601743653002001759653002601779700001901805700001801824700001801842700002401860700001801884773011601902856007702018852000902095655001202104IND60127808620221207104454.0151124e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012780862DNAL7 a10.1673/031.012.125012doi7 aPMC36332482pmcid7 a234520112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArai, Ikuyo10aImmunohistochemical Analysis of the Role of Hemocytin in Nodule Formation in the Larvae of the Silkworm, Bombyx mori  ap. 1-13.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHemocytin, a multidomain protein from Bombyx mori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae), is an ortholog of von Willebrand factor and is expected to be a major mediator of hemocyte aggregation. Antiserum was generated against hemocytin, and immune staining of hemocytes, hemolymph, and nodules was performed. Hemocytin was observed in steady-state hemocytes but not in plasma, even after bacterial injection. When hemolymph was smeared on glass slides, hemocytin-containing fibrous structures formed a cellular network mainly consisting of granulocytes and oenocytoids. Hemocytin was stained only in the granules of the granulocytes. When nodule-like aggregates formed 30 sec after bacterial injection, both granulocytes and bacterial cells were observed binding to hemocytin-containing fibrous structures. When nodule sections were stained with antiserum, hemocytin was seen in the matrix of the nodules surrounding the hemocytes. These data suggest that hemocytin plays a major role in nodule formation as a component of the sticky fibrous structure exocytosed from granulocytes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBombyx mori 3aantiserum 3abacteria 3ablood coagulation factors 3aglass 3agranules 3agranulocytes 3ahemocytes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainsect larvae 0acellular immunity 0agranulocyte 0ainnate immunity 0avon Willebrand factor1 aOhta, Masayuki1 aSuzuki, Asahi1 aTanaka, Shiho1 aYoshizawa, Yasutaka1 aSato, Ryoichi0 tJournal of insect science .g2013 Nov., v. 12, no. 125 p.1-13dUniversity of Wisconsin Libraryx1536-24427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1673/031.012.125013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03630naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012900170300001600299520227100315592002802586650001202614650001302626650001202639650002602651650001802677650002502695650002102720650002902741650001102770650001202781650001102793650001802804650001802822650001702840650001302857650001702870650001302887650002602900651001902926700001902945773011802964856008103082852000903163655001203172IND60615529620221117232101.0181011e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061552962DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-006-0492-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Collin H.10aAvailability of dissolved organic matter offsets metabolic costs of a protracted larval period for Bugula neritina (Bryozoa)  ap. 301-311.  aFor nearly a century researchers have investigated the uptake and utilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by marine invertebrates, but its contribution to their growth, reproduction, and survival remains unclear. Here, the benefit of DOM uptake was assessed for the marine bryozoan Bugula neritina (Linnaeus 1758) through performance comparisons of individuals in the presence and absence of DOM. The experiments were performed using B. neritina collected from floating docks in Beaufort, NC, USA from July to September 2004. Seawater was subjected to ultraviolet irradiation to reduce naturally occurring DOM, and then enriched with either 1 μM of palmitic acid or a mixture containing 1 μM each of glucose, alanine, aspartic acid and glycine. Larvae in DOM-enriched and DOM-reduced treatments were sampled and induced to metamorphose following 1, 6, 12, and 24 h of continuous swimming at 25°C. Sampled larvae were assessed for initiation of metamorphosis, completion of metamorphosis, and ancestrular lophophore size to determine the extent to which energy acquired from DOM uptake could offset the metabolic costs of prolonged larval swimming. DOM treatment had no significant effect on initiation of metamorphosis, but did have a significant effect on completion of metamorphosis and lophophore size. Larvae swimming in DOM-enriched treatments for 24 h experienced a 20% increase in metamorphic completion rate, compared to larvae swimming for 24 h in the DOM-reduced treatment. In addition, larvae in the amino acid and sugar mixture for 24 h had a significantly larger lophophore surface area and volume (23 and 31%, respectively), compared to larvae in DOM-depleted seawater. To ensure that the increases in performance found in larvae with access to DOM were not due to a decrease in metabolic activity, the respiration rates for these larvae were compared to those of larvae in DOM-depleted seawater. There were no significant differences between these treatments, indicating that the increases in performance were due to the energy acquired from DOM. These results clearly show that for B. neritina, DOM uptake results in increased metamorphic success and in the size of the feeding apparatus following an extended larval swimming duration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryozoa 3aNeritina 3aalanine 3aaquatic invertebrates 3aaspartic acid 3abiochemical pathways 3acell respiration 3adissolved organic matter 3aenergy 3aglucose 3alarvae 3ametamorphosis 3apalmitic acid 3areproduction 3aseawater 3asurface area 3aswimming 3aultraviolet radiation 3aNorth Carolina1 aWendt, Dean E.0 tMarine biology.g2007 Mar., v. 151, no. 1 p.301-311dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-006-0492-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04084naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013800165300001400303520203700317592002802354650002902382650002002411650002002431650001402451650001602465650001402481650002102495650001702516650001902533650001502552650002202567650002102589650002202610650002002632650003102652650001002683650001002693650001802703650002202721650002102743650001902764650002402783650002002807650004302827650001702870650001302887650001602900650002202916650001102938650001902949650002402968650002102992650004203013650001603055653000903071653002003080653002003100700001503120700001803135700001803153773012403171856008203295852000903377655001203386IND60094723820221121235231.0190329e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009472382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2013.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiruthika, J.10aMolecular cloning and characterization of acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP) gene from shrimp Penaeus monodon exposed to salinity stress  ap. 78-82.  aAcyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP), a protein present ubiquitously in wide range of organisms play significant role in transport of acyl groups for macromolecular biosynthesis involved in various functional and regulatory processes. In crustaceans, ACBP has functional role in growth, reproduction and temperature tolerance. In the present study, two suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) cDNA libraries were performed using gut tissues of shrimp Penaeus monodon exposed to low (3ppt) and high (55ppt) salinity stress conditions. SSH library resulted in identification of differentially expressed genes that belonged to various functional classes such as the nucleic acid regulation and replication, defence proteins, allergen protein, signal transduction pathways, apoptosis, energy and metabolism, cell cycle regulation and hypothetical proteins. ACBP was identified as one of the differentially expressed gene in both the SSH libraries of shrimp P. monodon subjected to low and high salinity stress. The full-length cDNA of P. monodon ACBP gene was isolated and the sequence revealed 273bp open reading frame encoding 90 amino acids with molecular mass of 10kDa and pI 6.8. The ORF showed presence of four phosphorylation sites, with absence of signal peptide sequence and glycosylation sites. The deduced amino acid sequence of ACBP exhibited high sequence identity (92%) with ACBP class of protein identified from Fenneropenaeus chinensis. Real time PCR analysis of shrimps subjected to 3ppt salinity conditions after 2weeks revealed an increase in expression of ACBP transcripts, in the gut (28.08-folds), gills (11.71-folds) and in the muscle tissues (1.70-folds). Whereas, shrimps exposed to 55ppt salinity conditions after 2weeks exhibited increased ACBP transcript levels in the gut (11.95-folds), gills (1.052-folds) and muscle tissues (7.35-folds). The significant increase in expression levels of ACBP in various tissues of shrimps suggests a functional role of this gene in salinity stress tolerance and adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFenneropenaeus chinensis 3aPenaeus monodon 3aacyl coenzyme A 3aallergens 3aamino acids 3aapoptosis 3abinding proteins 3abiosynthesis 3acDNA libraries 3acell cycle 3acomplementary DNA 3adigestive system 3aenergy metabolism 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agills 3aglycosylation 3amolecular cloning 3amolecular weight 3amuscle tissues 3aopen reading frames 3aphosphorylation 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areproduction 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asequence analysis 3ashrimp 3asignal peptide 3asignal transduction 3astress tolerance 3asuppression subtractive hybridization 3atemperature 0aACBP 0aPenaeus monodon 0aSalinity stress1 aRajesh, S.1 aPonniah, A.G.1 aShekhar, M.S.0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2013 May, v. 40, no. 1 p.78-82dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2013.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245018400163300001600347520169900363592002802062650002502090650002502115650001002140650002002150650001502170650002102185650001202206650001302218650000702231650001702238650003302255650002402288650001202312650001102324650001302335653003302348653002502381653002202406653001702428700001502445700001202460773012702472856008202599852000902681655001202690IND60094723920221121235224.0190329e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009472392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2013.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jian10aSmLMWPTP, a teleost low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase, inhibits the immune response of peripheral blood leukocytes in a manner that depends on the conserved P-loop  ap. 103-111.  aProtein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are a family of enzymes that play a key role in cellular signal transduction. Low molecular weight PTPs (LMWPTPs) are a subfamily of PTPs that are characterized by the presence of a conserved phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) with the signature sequence of (V/I)CXGNXCRS. To date, very little study on teleost LMWPTPs has been documented, and, as a result, the function of LMWPTPs in fish is essentially unknown. In this study, we identified a LMWPTP from turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) and examined its biological activity and functionality. The turbot LMWPTP (SmLMWPTP) is composed of 158 residues and possesses a typical P-loop sequence in the form of 12VCLGNICRS20. Purified recombinant SmLMWPTP (rSmLMWPTP) exhibited apparent phosphatase activity, which was optimal at pH 5 and 50°C. The activity of SmLMWPTP was abolished when C13 and, in particular, R19 of the P-loop were mutated. SmLMWPTP expression was detected in a wide range of tissues and upregulated by bacterial and viral infection. Subcellular localization analysis showed that SmLMWPTP was secreted by peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) into the extracellular milieu. When PBL were treated with rSmLMWPTP, the cells exhibited significant reductions in (i) proliferative and respiratory burst activity, (ii) expression levels of multiple immune relevant genes, and (iii) phagocytic activity. In contrast, the mutant SmLMWPTP bearing R19 mutation had no effect on PBL activity. Taken together, these results indicate that SmLMWPTP is a secreted PTP that exerts a negative regulatory effect on the innate immune response of PBL in a manner that depends on the structural integrity of the P-loop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScophthalmus maximus 3abioactive properties 3agenes 3aimmune response 3aleukocytes 3amolecular weight 3amutants 3amutation 3apH 3aphagocytosis 3aprotein-tyrosine-phosphatase 3asignal transduction 3atissues 3aturbot 3atyrosine 0aProtein tyrosine phosphatase 0aScophthalmus maximus 0aImmune regulation 0aPhagocytosis1 aChen, Ling1 aSun, Li0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2013 June, v. 40, no. 2 p.103-111dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2013.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02747naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009200159300001800251500001900269500002000288520134600308592002801654596004901682596004201731650001901773650003101792650002001823650000901843650003001852650001201882650001601894650003301910650001101943700001701954700001601971700001901987700001202006700001702018700001502035700001602050773014002066856007402206852000902280655001202289IND60705839920221117230358.0200807e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070583992DNAL7 a10.1111/jipb.129162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Zhiqiang14aThe Brassica napus GATA transcription factor BnA5.ZML1 is a stigma compatibility factor  ap. 1112-1131.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSelf‐incompatibility (SI) is a genetic mechanism that rejects self‐pollen and thus prevents inbreeding in some hermaphroditic angiosperms. In the Brassicaceae, SI involves a pollen‐stigma recognition system controlled by a single locus known as the S locus, which consists of two highly polymorphic genes that encode S‐locus cysteine‐rich protein (SCR) and S‐receptor kinase (SRK). When self‐pollen lands on the stigma, the S‐haplotype‐specific interaction between SCR and SRK triggers SI. Here, we show that the GATA transcription factor BnA5.ZML1 suppresses SI responses in Brassica napus and is induced after compatible pollination. The loss‐of‐function mutant bna5.zml1 displays reduced self‐compatibility. In contrast, overexpression of BnA5.ZML1 in self‐incompatible stigmas leads to a partial breakdown of SI responses, suggesting that BnA5.ZML1 is a stigmatic compatibility factor. Furthermore, the expression levels of SRK and ARC1 are up‐regulated in bna5.zml1 mutants, and they are down‐regulated in BnA5.ZML1 overexpressing lines. SRK affects the cellular localization of BnA5.ZML1 through direct protein–protein interaction. Overall, our findings highlight the fundamental role of BnA5.ZML1 in SI responses in B. napus, establishing a direct interaction between BnA5.ZML1 and SRK in this process.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cNatural Key Research Program of China 3aBrassica napus 3aGATA transcription factors 3ahermaphroditism 3aloci 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amutants 3apollination 3aprotein-protein interactions 3astigma1 aZhang, Yatao1 aTu, Jinxing1 aShen, Jinxiong1 aYi, Bin1 aFu, Tingdong1 aDai, Cheng1 aMa, Chaozhi0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2020 Aug., v. 62, no. 8 p.1112-1131dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949844x1672-90727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jipb.129163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02071naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245013500207300001600342520072700358592002801085596002901113650002201142650002701164650002501191650001401216650001101230650001801241650001901259650002201278650002401300650001601324650002301340650002801363650001401391700002101405700002301426773012101449856008201570852000901652655001201661IND60655938120221119130143.0190807e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065593812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11130-019-00736-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDia, Vermont P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2804-432310aSorghum Phenolics Inhibits Inflammasomes in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Primed and Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)-Activated Macrophages  ap. 307-315.  aSorghum contains phenolic compounds with reported biological activities. The objective was to evaluate the ability of sorghum phenolic extract to inhibit inflammasomes in THP-1 human macrophages. THP-1 human macrophages was pre-treated with sorghum phenolics and the inflammasome was activated by lipopolysaccharide and adenosine triphosphate treatment. Treatment of macrophages with 50 μg sorghum extract/mL reduced IL-1β and IL-18 secretion by 59.7 and 32.0%, respectively, associated with caspase-1 activity reduction. Moreover, the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species was reduced. Our data showed the potential role of sorghum phenolics in diseases associated with aberrant inflammasomes activation.  aPublisher supplied data  aHATCH 1010230cUSDA-NIFA 3aSorghum (Poaceae) 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abioactive properties 3acaspase-1 3ahumans 3ainflammasomes 3ainterleukin-18 3ainterleukin-1beta 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3aphenolic compounds 3areactive oxygen species 3asecretion1 aBradwell, Jordan1 aPangloli, Philipus0 tPlant foods for human nutrition.g2019 Sept., v. 74, no. 3 p.307-315dSpringer USwJournal:jnl42388x0921-96687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11130-019-00736-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002200143245004100165300001600206500000900222520152100231592002801752650001401780650001301794650001201807650001501819650003201834650002501866650002101891650001801912650000901930650001701939650001101956650003701967650001602004650002302020650001702043651001702060700002302077700002202100773012102122852000902243856007902252655001202331IND4386537020221116154303.0191226e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438653702DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2005.00632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuiker, Sjoerd W.10aTillage × Maize Hybrid Interactions  ap. 436-442.  aepub  aContinuous maize (Zea mays L.) yields may be depressed with no-tillage (NT) compared with conventional chisel and disking systems (CD). Shallow or deep in-row tillage (ST and DT, respectively) may help alleviate this yield reduction, whereas some hybrids may be better adapted to NT. We therefore evaluated five maize hybrids with NT, ST, DT, and CD from 2002 to 2004 on a Hagerstown silt loam (fine, mixed, semiactive, mesic Typic Hapludalf) in southeastern Pennsylvania. Residue cover, penetration resistance, bulk density, and soil temperature were measured as well as maize emergence, mid-season height, and yield. Residue cover varied in the order NT > ST and DT > CD. Bulk density and penetration resistance in NT were higher than in ST, DT, and CD to the depth of tillage. In 2002, the average soil temperature during the first month after planting varied in the order NT < ST and DT < CD, but did not vary between tillage systems in 2004. Emergence was slower in NT than the other tillage systems in 2002 only. Emergence varied between hybrids, but there was no tillage × hybrid interaction. Mid-season maize height was not lower in NT than the other tillage systems. Tillage systems did not affect yield, and there was no tillage × hybrid interaction for yield, although some hybrids yielded better than others. The study suggests continuous maize yields with NT will be similar to tilled systems on well-drained soils in the northeastern USA and that tillage system is not important for hybrid selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3aZea mays 3ahybrids 3ano-tillage 3asoil penetration resistance 3aconventional tillage 3asoil temperature 3acrop residues 3acorn 3abulk density 3aheight 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agrain yield 3aseedling emergence 3asoil density 3aPennsylvania1 aHaldeman, James F.1 aJohnson, David H.0 tAgronomy journal.g2006 May, v. 98, no. 3 p.436-442dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2005.00633Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03277naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013000166300001600296500001500312520151100327592002801838650002301866650002401889650001801913650001401931650002401945650002001969650001601989650002002005650001202025650001402037650003602051650001302087650002002100650002202120650003402142650001002176650001202186650003102198650002002229650002002249650001802269650003602287650001702323653001002340653002002350653001702370653001702387653001102404700001802415700001502433700001702448773011902465856008202584852000902666655001202675IND60533604420221118160701.0190410e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053360442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2014.10.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xian-De10aNuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in pearl oyster Pinctada fucata: Molecular cloning and functional characterization  ap. 108-113.  a2019-12-06  aNuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) plays an important role in nonimmune cells and also in T cells and many other cells of the immune system, by regulating the expression of a variety of genes involved in the immune response, organ development, developmental apoptosis and angiogenesis. In the present study, the NFAT homology gene, PfNFAT, from the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata was cloned and its genomic structure and promoter were analyzed. PfNFAT encodes a putative protein of 1226 amino acids, and contains a highly conserved Rel homology region (RHR) with DNA-binding specificity, and a regulatory domain (NFAT homology region, NHR) containing a potent transactivation domain (TAD). The PfNFAT gene consists of 12 exons and 11 introns, and its promoter contains potential binding sites for transcription factors such as NF-κB (Nuclear factor κB), STATx (signal transducer and activator of transcription), AP-1 (activator protein-1) and Sox-5/9 (SRY type HMG box-5/9), MyoD (Myogenic Differentiation Antigen) and IRF (Interferon regulatory factor). Comparison and phylogenetic analysis revealed that PfNFAT shows high identity with other invertebrate NFAT, and clusters with the NFAT5 subgroup. Furthermore, gene expression analysis revealed that PfNFAT is involved in the immune response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) stimulation and in the nucleus inserting operation. The study of PfNFAT may increase understanding of molluscan innate immunity.  aPublisher supplied data 3amuscle development 3alipopolysaccharides 3aT-lymphocytes 3aphylogeny 3asignal transduction 3agene expression 3aamino acids 3atransactivators 3aintrons 3aapoptosis 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3aantigens 3aimmune response 3amolecular cloning 3ainterferon regulatory factors 3aexons 3aoysters 3atranscriptional activation 3ainnate immunity 3aPinctada fucata 3abinding sites 3apolyinosinic-polycytidylic acid 3aangiogenesis 0agenes 0aGene expression 0aGene cloning 0aPearl oyster 0aPfNFAT1 aWei, Guo-jian1 aZhang, Hua1 aHe, Mao-Xian0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2015 Jan., v. 42, no. 1 p.108-113dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2014.10.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008500170300001600255520134700271592002801618650006901646650001501715650001301730650001101743650002201754650002701776651001101803773011301814856008101927852000902008655001202017IND60447103020221118014528.0151029e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044710302DNAL7 a10.1007/s10739-015-9408-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCassata, Francesco10a“A Cold Spring Harbor in Europe.” EURATOM, UNESCO and the Foundation of EMBO  ap. 539-573.  aThis article explores the problem of the foundation of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO), by reconstructing a broader institutional framework, which includes other international actors – EURATOM, UNESCO and the International Laboratory of Genetics and Biophysics (ILGB) in Naples – and a relevant, but still neglected figure, the Italian geneticist Adriano Buzzati-Traverso (1913–1983). The article considers the tension between centralized and federal models of organization in the field of life sciences not just as an EMBO internal controversy, but rather as a structural issue of European scientific cooperation in fundamental biology in the early 1960s. Along with EMBO, the article analyzes in particular the EURATOM Biology Division Program and the constitution of UNESCO International Cell Research Organization (ICRO). Adriano Buzzati-Traverso, as founder of ILGB and scientific consultant of EURATOM and UNESCO, played a crucial role in the complex negotiation which ultimately led to the foundation of EMBO. A synchronic treatment of ILGB, EURATOM, UNESCO-ICRO and EMBO opens a window on the early 1960s institutional configuration of molecular biology in Europe, showing how it basically incorporated the “Cold Spring Harbor” decentralized model rather than reproducing the “CERN” centralized model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 3abiophysics 3agenetics 3amodels 3amolecular biology 3amolecular conformation 3aEurope0 tJournal of the history of biology.g2015 Nov., v. 48, no. 4 p.539-573dSpringer Netherlandsx0022-50107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10739-015-9408-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01792naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012500168300001600293520061200309592002800921650002000949650001500969650002200984650001801006650001501024650001801039650001101057700001601068700002101084700001601105700002501121700002001146700002101166700001601187773011301203856008101316852000901397655001201406IND60519413620181219000000.0170724e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051941362DNAL7 a10.1007/s13765-016-0170-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Cheng-yi,10aEvaluation of the quality change and estimation of the shelf life of instant Bibimbap (Korean Mixed Rice) during storage  ap. 321-326.  aThis study estimates the shelf life of four different instant bibimbaps.

Here, we investigated the effect of repeated intake of IP₆ on fasting SUA levels in hyperuricemic subjects. This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design study included 31 asymptomatic hyperuricemic subjects (fasting SUA level > 7.0 but <9.0 mg/dL). Subjects ingested placebo or IP₆ drinks (600 mg twice daily) during two 2-week intervention periods with a 2-week washout period. The primary outcome was fasting SUA level; the secondary outcome was the urinary uric acid to creatinine ratio. Fasting SUA levels in the IP₆ group were lower than those in the placebo group (p < 0.05). The urinary uric acid to creatinine ratio did not change between the placebo and IP₆ groups (p > 0.05). This study showed that a 2-weeks supplementation period of 600 mg IP₆ twice daily can improve fasting SUA levels in hyperuricemic subjects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abeverages 3ablood serum 3acreatinine 3across-over studies 3afasting 3afood composition 3ainositols 3anucleosides 3aplacebos 3auric acid1 aKakumoto, Keiji1 aKohda, Noriyuki1 aYamamoto, Tetsuya0 tPlant foods for human nutrition.g2019 Sept., v. 74, no. 3 p.316-321dSpringer USwJournal:jnl42388x0921-96687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11130-019-00735-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004700092040001800139100002300157245009900180300001600279500000900295520147300304592002801777650002301805650001101828650001501839650001001854650001101864650001501875650001101890650000901901650001201910651002001922700001801942700002301960700002301983773020702006852000902213856009402222655001202316IND2206922920221118061341.0191028e199903  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220692292DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1999.00472425002800020038x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarney, Francis J.10aDust and Endosulfan Deposition in a Cotton-Growing Area of Northern New South Wales, Australia  ap. 692-701.  aepub  aThe pesticide endosulfan (6,7,8,9,10,10-hexachloro-1,5,5a,6,9,9a-hexahydro-6,9-methano-2,4,3-benzodioxathiepin-3-oxide) has been detected in rivers in the cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)-growing area of northern New South Wales at a 5 yr mean (1991–1995) concentration of 0.06 µg L⁻¹. One pathway by which endosulfan reaches the riverine environment is transport on contaminated dust. Our objectives were to examine: (i) dust deposition from vehicular traffic on an unsealed road on a cotton farm, and around a cotton field in the 11 to 65 h period after endosulfan application; (ii) endosulfan deposition in the 11 to 65 h period after endosulfan application, and over a 3-mo period at on-farm and off-farm (nontarget) locations. Dust deposition rates from vehicular traffic varied from 0.013 g m⁻² vehicle⁻¹ at 1 m distance, to 0.002 g m⁻² vehicle⁻¹ at 100 m distance from an unsealed road (soil surface, no gravel added). The maximum endosulfan deposition in the 11 to 65 h post-spraying period was 95 µg m⁻² at 5 m from the field. Over a 3-mo monitoring period (December 1996–March 1997), the average daily deposition rate of endosulfan was 0.16 µg m⁻² d⁻¹ for the off-farm sites compared with 0.35 µg m⁻² d⁻¹ for the on-farm site. As the measurement period was one of the wettest on record and the number of endosulfan applications was less-than-normal, the dust and endosulfan deposition results may be interpreted as minima.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acotton 3aendosulfan 3afarms 3agravel 3amonitoring 3arivers 3asoil 3atraffic 3aNew South Wales1 aLeys, John F.1 aMüller, Jochen F.1 aMcTainsh, Grant H.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g1999 Mar., v. 28, no. 2 p.692-701dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1999.00472425002800020038x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02729naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245006000174300001600234520167300250592002801923650002301951650000901974650001101983650001801994650000902012650002202021653000802043653001502051653000802066653003102074653001502105653001802120700002502138773009702163856008602260852000902346655001202355IND60783015220220714000000.0220714e20220704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078301522DNAL7 a10.1080/08927936.2022.20270952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliva, Jessica Lee10aDevelopment of the Pet Owner Connectedness Scale (POCS)  ap. 545-557.  aStudies that have reported on the loneliness protective effect of pet ownership have recently been called into question owing to methodological drawbacks, including the use of inappropriate scales of measurement for loneliness in pet owner samples. It has also been recently demonstrated that pet interactions may only influence positive, not negative, human affect. In light of these recent advances, the current study aimed to create a new scale focusing on the inverse experience of loneliness: connectedness. An initial 24-item scale was developed using qualitative data collected from our previous study investigating the impact of pet ownership for Australians living alone during a government-enforced lockdown in response to COVID-19. Study 1 included 934 dog and cat owners who self-selected into the online study. Factor analyses revealed two distinct factors, and only items that loaded uniquely on one factor were retained. Study 2 included 526 dog and cat owners who self-selected into the online study, which confirmed the two-factor structure and established validity and reliability of the scale. The result was a 14-item Pet Owner Connectedness Scale (POCS) with two subscales: (i) owner–pet connection, and (ii) connectedness through pet. Hence, we present evidence for a new scale that can be used to measure the positive social states of connectedness that owners may gain from their pets. This may provide a good alternative to more traditional methods such as measuring the buffering effect pets have on negative social states such as loneliness. It may also offer a more robust method to measure the impact of pet interactions on their owners.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3adogs 3ahumans 3apet ownership 3apets 3aprotective effect 0aCat 0aconnection 0adog 0ahuman–animal interaction 0aloneliness 0aquestionnaire1 aJohnston, Kim Louise0 tAnthrozoös.g2022 July 04, v. 35, no. 4 p.545-557dRoutledgewJournal:2060x1753-03777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08927936.2022.20270953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245011500207300001400322520130600336592002801642650001301670650001601683650002101699650001801720650001401738650001801752650002201770650001301792650002101805650001101826650001601837653001501853653002101868653002801889653003001917700001801947700002101965700002001986773011702006856008202123852000902205655001202214IND60533604520221118160649.0190410e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053360452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2014.10.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonaghy, Ludovic1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6840-220414aThe known and unknown sources of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in haemocytes of marine bivalve molluscs  ap. 91-97.  aReactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) are naturally produced in all cells and organisms. Modifications of standard conditions alter reactive species generation and may result in oxidative stress. Because of the degradation of marine ecosystems, massive aquaculture productions, global change and pathogenic infections, oxidative stress is highly prevalent in marine bivalve molluscs. Haemocytes of bivalve molluscs produce ROS and RNS as part of their basal metabolism as well as in response to endogenous and exogenous stimuli. However, sources and pathways of reactive species production are currently poorly deciphered in marine bivalves, potentially leading to misinterpretations. Although sources and pathways of ROS and RNS productions are highly conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates, some uncommon pathways seem to only exist in marine bivalves. To understand the biology and pathobiology of ROS and RNS in haemocytes of marine bivalves, it is necessary to characterise their sources and pathways of production. The aims of the present review are to discuss the currently known and unknown intracellular sources of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in marine bivalve molluscs, in light of terrestrial vertebrates, and to expose principal pitfalls usually encountered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3aaquaculture 3abasal metabolism 3aglobal change 3ahemocytes 3ainvertebrates 3amarine ecosystems 3anitrogen 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3avertebrates 0aHaemocytes 0aBivalve molluscs 0aReactive oxygen species 0aReactive nitrogen species1 aHong, Hyun-Ki1 aJauzein, Cécile1 aChoi, Kwang-Sik0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2015 Jan., v. 42, no. 1 p.91-97dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2014.10.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245019300160300001600353500001400369520099000383592002801373650001401401650001001415650001501425650001001440650001201450650001601462650001501478650001301493650001201506651001201518653001501530653001501545653002301560653000901583653002601592700002001618773011901638856008001757852000901837655001201846IND60696548020221120154935.0200528e20181130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069654802DNAL7 a10.3897/evolsyst.2.307932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJueg, Uwe10aLost and found – Fritz Müller´s type material of Glossiphoniaverrucata (Fr.

This study not only addressed the occurrence of leeches in the different lakes, but also contains the description of a new species - Glossiphoniaverrrucata (Fr. Müller, 1844). Unfortunately, he never mentioned how many specimens he found and where he deposited the material of his dissertation research. Thus, it came as a surprise that the material appeared in the small leech collection of the Zoological Museum of the University of Greifswald. Here, we provide an overview of the material focusing especially on the four syntypes of G.verrucata. Since this is a rarely found species, we further explored historical material from the type locality, Lake Tegel, held in other museums. Our survey revealed that the material collected by Müller is the only one known to date from the species-rich Lake Tegel, which is inhabited by 14 species of freshwater leeches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHirudinea 3afauna 3afreshwater 3alakes 3amuseums 3anew species 3aoccurrence 3aresearch 3asurveys 3aGermany 0aHirudinida 0aLake Tegel 0afreshwater leeches 0aZIMG 0aGlossiphoniaverrucata1 aMichalik, Peter0 tEvolutionary Systematics.g2018 Nov. 30, v. 2, no. 2 p.163-168dPensoft PublisherswJournal:27337x2535-07307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/evolsyst.2.307933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009300169300001600262520106900278592002801347650001201375650001201387650002001399650003101419650002401450650001301474650001101487650002001498650001401518650002901532650001601561653001201577653001001589653001601599653001001615653001301625700002401638700002101662773009801683856008601781852000901867655001201876IND60600368420221119030040.0180703e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060036842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendez, C.J.10aPerformance and emission characteristics of butanol/Jet A blends in a gas turbine engine  ap. 135-140.  aButanol, which can be derived from biomass, is an attractive alternative energy resource to petroleum fuels. Recently, butanol seems to be preferred over other alcohols, particularly for blending with petroleum fuels such as gasoline/Jet A, because its properties are closer to those of the latter. The focus of this study was the effect of butanol/Jet A blends on the performance and emission characteristics of a gas turbine engine. Pure Jet A, butanol and their blends with varying concentrations of butanol, ranging from 25% to 75% by volume, were used as fuels. The performance characteristics, the thrust, thrust-specific fuel consumption, turbine inlet temperature and exhaust gas temperature, and the emission characteristics, such as thrust-specific emission indices of CO and NOx, were measured over a range of throttle settings. The operational thrust range of the engine for butanol-containing fuels was reduced when compared to that of Jet A fuel. The NOx and CO emission indices were lower for butanol and butanol blends compared to those with Jet A.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3abutanol 3acarbon monoxide 3aenergy use and consumption 3agas turbine engines 3agasoline 3amixing 3anitrogen oxides 3apetroleum 3arenewable energy sources 3atemperature 0aButanol 0aJet A 0aGas turbine 0aBlend 0aEmission1 aParthasarathy, R.N.1 aGollahalli, S.R.0 tApplied energy.g2014 Apr. 01, v. 118 p.135-140dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015400165300001600319520131300335592002801648650001601676650001701692650001401709650003001723650002701753650002801780650001501808650001201823650002801835650002001863650001601883650001301899650001301912700001901925700001701944773011301961856008102074852000902155655001202164IND60519413820181219000000.0170724e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051941382DNAL7 a10.1007/s13765-015-0143-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYun, Hee Rang10aRice small GTPase Rab11 is required for intracellular trafficking from the trans-Golgi-network to the plasma membrane and/or prevacuolar compartments  ap. 163-171.  aMembers of the Rab family of small GTPases play important roles in membrane trafficking along the exocytic and endocytic pathways, their function being dependent on their localization. Here, we show the vital roles of the Oryza sativa Rab11 (OsRab11) in intracellular trafficking using a dominant-negative mutant approach based on a protoplast-trafficking assay. GTP-binding and GTP hydrolysis assays revealed that OsRab11 is a small GTP-binding protein complementing △ypt32/ypt31. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-OsRab11 has been localized to both the trans-Golgi-network (TGN) and the endosomes/prevacuolar compartments (PVC) in Arabidopsis protoplasts. The protoplast transformation with the dominant-negative mutant OsRab11(S28N) revealed that the trafficking of plasma membrane marker proteins [H⁺-ATPase-GFP and Ca²⁺-ATPase8-GFP (ACA8-GFP)] and central vacuole marker proteins [Arabidopsis aleurain-like protein (AALP-GFP) and sporamin (Spo-GFP)] was inhibited. Moreover, overexpression of Arabidopsis AtRha1 did not recover the trafficking inhibition of marker proteins from the central vacuole. These results strongly indicate that OsRab11 localizes to either the TGN or the PVC, and plays a significant role in the intracellular trafficking from the TGN to the PM and/or to the PVC in planta.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aOryza sativa 3aendosomes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aguanosine triphosphate 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3ahydrolysis 3amutants 3aphysiological transport 3aplasma membrane 3aprotoplasts 3asporamin 3avacuoles1 aRim, Yeong Gil1 aHeo, Jae Bok0 tHan'guk Ŭngyong Saengmyŏng Hwahakhoe chi =.g2016 Apr., v. 59, no. 2 p.163-171dSpringer Netherlands7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13765-015-0143-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03658naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011000171300001600281520192600297592002802223650001202251650002602263650001302289650001202302650001202314650001902326650001502345650001402360650002102374650001102395650001302406650001602419650001702435650001302452650001702465650001602482650001102498650001502509650001502524650001702539650001102556650001402567650001202581650003102593651001002624653002002634653002002654653001202674653002302686653002402709700001402733700001302747700001802760700001402778700001702792700001502809773008902824856008602913852000902999655001203008IND60089199720221120042157.0160903e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008919972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.05.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yisheng10aEmission inventory of carbonaceous pollutants from biomass burning in the Pearl River Delta Region, China  ap. 189-199.  aEmissions from burning major agricultural residue were measured through laboratory simulations using a self-designed dilution chamber system. Emission factors of CO2, CO, non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), PM10, PM2.5, OC and EC in PM2.5 were measured for burning rice straw in flaming and smoldering combustion, and for burning of sugarcane leaves.

Acetone and aldehyde were major OVOCs species in open straw burning emissions. A survey was conducted to determine the fraction of field crop biomass burned during harvesting season and the amounts of household firewood and crop residue consumption in 2008. Information obtained from the survey, together with measured EFs for field burning of rice straw and sugarcane, and EFs from literatures for field burning of other agricultural residues, biofuel combustion and forest fires, were used in developing the source inventories of carbonaceous pollutants in the PRD region. The annual emissions of CO, VOCs (including NMHCs and OVOCs), NOx, PM2.5, OC and EC from burning biomass were estimated to be 186.38, 15.94, 4.93, 15.56, 7.10, 2.25 kt in the year 2008, respectively. These estimates are lower than previously published estimates by 23–63%. Open burning patterns (flaming and smoldering) and rural biofuel use contribute to the differences. Field burning of straw contributed mainly to VOCs, PM2.5 and OC emissions while the residential sector was the dominant source of EC, CO and NOx. The contributions of biomass burning to entire PRD emissions are estimated as 3.37–6.53%, respectively, for PM, and 1.82–3.17%, respectively, for VOCs, and 0.52–2.77%, respectively, for NOx.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3aburning 3acarbon dioxide 3acombustion 3aemissions 3aemissions factor 3aethane 3aethylene 3afield crops 3aforest fires 3afuelwood 3aharvest date 3ainventories 3aleaves 3apollutants 3arice straw 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3asugarcane 3asurveys 3avolatile organic compounds 3aChina 0aBiomass burning 0aEmission factor 0aChamber 0aEmission inventory 0aRegional allocation1 aShao, Min1 aLin, Yun1 aLuan, Shengji1 aMao, Ning1 aChen, Wentai1 aWang, Ming0 tAtmospheric environment.g2013 Sept., v. 76 p.189-199dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.05.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008100175300001600256520119100272592002801463650001001491650002301501650001501524650001301539650002101552650002301573650000901596651001301605651001401618653002001632653001701652653002301669653001501692653002401707700002601731773013201757856008501889852000901974655001201983IND60701792720221118160131.0200715e20200706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070179272DNAL7 a10.3897/neotropical.15.e503252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGil-Ospina, Raul F.10aNew records of Clytoctantesalixii (Elliot, 1870) in Eastern Caldas, Colombia  ap. 201-207.  aClytoctantesalixii is a bird that lives on the edges of old-growth, secondary and cleared forests undergoing regeneration and presents a distribution restricted to Colombia and Venezuela. The species is considered to be at risk of extinction (EN) due to its particular characteristics and restricted distribution. However, knowledge of its ecology and distribution is still incipient. The objective of this study was therefore to expand the knowledge of C.alixii in Caldas, present the southernmost record of the species and describe its behaviour. The species was monitored within the protected areas of the Manso Diversion in the period 2014 and 2017, using mist nets and fixed radius point counts. Two individuals of C.alixii were recorded, both by observation, with one of these subsequently also captured in a forest in an advanced state of succession. Recording of this population is important because it is the southernmost in the Cordillera Central and confirms that habitats with the presence of hollow stem plants largely define the presence of the species, as well as potentially determining the location of other populations of this species within its range of distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3aconservation areas 3aextinction 3ahabitats 3anets (equipment) 3aold-growth forests 3arisk 3aColombia 3aVenezuela 0aextinction risk 0aconservation 0aCordillera Central 0aprotection 0asouthernmost record1 aMoreno-López, Daniel0 tNeotropical Biology and Conservation.g2020 July 06, v. 15, no. 3 p.201-207dPensoft PublisherswJournal:27346x2236-37777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/neotropical.15.e503253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013800168300001600306520110300322592002801425650001701453650002801470650001401498650001801512650001101530650002601541651001001567653001201577653001701589653002501606653002801631653002401659700001601683773014301699856008601842852000901928655001201937IND60783015420221120060708.0220714e20220527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078301542DNAL7 a10.1080/08974438.2020.18691352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Swati10aDrivers of Repurchase Intention of Organic Food in India: Role of Perceived Consumer Social Responsibility, Price, Value, and Quality  ap. 246-268.  aSustainable consumption and organic food demand are increasing at a rapid rate in emerging economies. This research studies the repurchase intention toward organic food in the Indian context and employs a cross-sectional survey technique (n = 450). The study analyses the role of perceived consumer social responsibility, price, value, and quality in repurchase intention through structural equation modeling using PLS-SEM. Findings suggest that perceived price fairness and perceived value have a significant influence on repurchase intention; perceived consumer social responsibility positively influences perceived price fairness and perceived quality. Interestingly, the relationship between perceived quality and repurchase intention was not significant; however, the indirect effect of perceived quality was found significant. Furthermore, the mediating role of perceived value was established in the relationship of perceived price fairness and repurchase intention as well as perceived quality and repurchase intention, signifying the importance of perceived value for Indian consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagribusiness 3across-sectional studies 3aequations 3aorganic foods 3aprices 3asocial responsibility 3aIndia 0aDrivers 0aorganic food 0arepurchase intention 0asustainable consumption 0avalue consciousness1 aAlok, Swati0 tJournal of international food & agribusiness marketing.g2022 May 27, v. 34, no. 3 p.246-268dRoutledgewJournal:jnl43743x1528-69837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08974438.2020.18691353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02460naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245005400165300001600219520094200235592002801177650002101205650001701226650001401243650002001257650001201277650002501289650001701314650001101331650002801342650001801370650001701388650001701405650001701422650001001439650001001449650001201459650001801471650001601489650002301505650001401528650002001542650001001562650003201572650001301604700001501617700003201632700001901664700002001683773011301703856008101816852000901897655001201906IND60519413920181219000000.0170724e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051941392DNAL7 a10.1007/s13765-015-0137-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Dae Gyuun10aBacterial synthesis of four hydroxycinnamic acids  ap. 173-179.  aHydroxycinnamates are a class of phenolic compounds that have a C6-C3 carbon backbone. Hydroxycinnamic acids are derived from cinnamic acid via hydroxylation or methylation and are found in foods such as pears, coffee beans, and dandelions. They are involved in protection against chemotherapy side effects and the prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer. We synthesized four types of hydroxycinnamates (p-coumaric acid, cinnamic acid, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid) from glucose in Escherichia coli by introducing different combination of four genes: tyrosine ammonia lyase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, S.espanaensis monooxygenase, and Oryza sativa O-methyltransferase. The final yields of hydroxycinnamic acids were increased by engineering the metabolic pathway of E. coli. Using these strategies, 100.1 mg/L p-coumaric acid, 138.2 mg/L caffeic acid, 64 mg/L ferulic acid, and 1072.3 mg/L cinnamic acid were synthesized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aOryza sativa 3aTaraxacum 3aadverse effects 3aammonia 3abiochemical pathways 3acaffeic acid 3acarbon 3acardiovascular diseases 3acinnamic acid 3acoffee beans 3adrug therapy 3aferulic acid 3afoods 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahydroxylation 3amethylation 3amethyltransferases 3aneoplasms 3ap-coumaric acid 3apears 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3atyrosine1 aCha, Mi Na1 aNadarajan, Saravanan Prabhu1 aKim, Pong-gyu,1 aAhn, Joong-Hoon0 tHan'guk Ŭngyong Saengmyŏng Hwahakhoe chi =.g2016 Apr., v. 59, no. 2 p.173-179dSpringer Netherlands7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13765-015-0137-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01922naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013100171300001600302520071200318592002801030650002301058650001701081650001501098650001101113650000901124650001201133653001301145653001601158653002701174653002301201653001701224700002101241700002001262700001601282773014301298856008601441852000901527655001201536IND60783015520221120060702.0220714e20220527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078301552DNAL7 a10.1080/08974438.2021.18805142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuhartanto, Dwi10aCOVID-19: Pre-Purchase Trust and Health Risk Impact on M-Commerce Experience – Young Customers Experience on Food Purchasing  ap. 269-288.  aThis study evaluates the impact of pre-purchase trust and health risk on young customer experience and satisfaction with online food purchasing during the COVID-19 pandemic, by integrating the valence theoretical framework and quality-based behavioral model.

To this end, a series of soap bottles was produced that were identical in shape but had different intensities of colouring (white, pink, or red). The weight of the bottles also varied (either light −350g, or heavy −450g). Two different concentrations of perfume were added to the liquid soap contained in the bottles (either low or high). The participants evaluated the perceived intensity of the fragrance contained in each bottle, the perceived weight of each bottle, and the expected efficacy of the soap itself (that is, the soap’s expected “cleaning ability”). The results revealed a significant main effect of the colour of the packaging on the perceived intensity of the soap’s fragrance. Significant effects of the perceived weight of the container on both the perceived intensity of the fragrance and on the expected efficacy of the soap were also documented. These results are discussed in terms of the design of multisensory packaging and containers for liquid body soap and, more generally, for body care and beauty products.  aPublisher supplied data 3abottles 3acleaning 3acolor 3aconsumer attitudes 3acosmetics 3aodors 3apackaging 3aperfumes 0aMultisensory design 0aPackaging 0aSkincare products 0aMultisensory integration1 aBordegoni, Monica1 aSpence, Charles0 tFood quality and preference.g2014 Jan., v. 31 p.56-64dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2013.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014400169300001300313520181600326592002802142650002002170650002402190650002102214650001302235650001902248650000902267650003002276650001302306651001902319700002002338700001702358700003002375700001902405700001802424700002102442700002402463700002002487700002202507773011502529856008102644852000902725655001202734IND60615530020221122052025.0181011e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061553002DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-006-0447-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeo, Steven L.

The hypothesis that movement patterns, diving behavior, and thermal biology change during different stages of the breeding migration was tested. Mature Atlantic bluefin tuna tagged in the western Atlantic and the GOM, were on their breeding grounds from February to June for an average of 39 ± 11 days. The bluefin tuna experienced significantly warmer mean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) within the GOM (26.4 ± 1.6°C) than outside the GOM (20.2 ± 1.9°C). As the bluefin tuna entered and exited the GOM, the fish dove to daily maximum depths of 568 ± 50 and 580 ± 144 m, respectively, and exhibited directed movement paths to and from the localized breeding areas. During the putative breeding phase, the bluefin tuna had significantly shallower daily maximum depths (203 ± 76 m), and exhibited shallow oscillatory dives during the night. The movement paths of the bluefin tuna during the breeding phase were significantly more residential and sinuous. The heat transfer coefficients (K) were calculated for a bluefin tuna in the GOM using the recorded ambient and body temperatures. The K for this fish increased rapidly at the high ambient temperatures encountered in the GOM, and was significantly higher at night in the breeding phase when the fish was exhibiting shallow oscillatory dives. This suggests that the fish were behaviorally and physiologically thermoregulating in the Gulf of Mexico. This study demonstrates that the movement patterns, diving behavior, and thermal biology of Atlantic bluefin tuna change significantly at different stages of the breeding migration and can be used to define spawning location and timing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThunnus thynnus 3aambient temperature 3abody temperature 3abreeding 3abreeding sites 3afish 3aheat transfer coefficient 3aspawning 3aGulf of Mexico1 aBoustany, Andre1 aDewar, Heidi1 aStokesbury, Michael J.

A conceptual model of O3 air pollution is developed based on the analysis of data obtained at Tung Chung (TC) in Hong Kong. By comparing meteorological parameters between O3 and non-O3 episode days, it was found that high temperatures, strong solar radiation, low wind speeds and relative humidity, northeasterly and/or northwesterly prevailing winds were favorable for the O3 formation, while tropical cyclones were most conducive to the occurrence of O3 episodes. Backward trajectories simulation and graphical illustration of O3 pollution suggested that super-regional (i.e. central and eastern China) and regional (i.e. Pearl River Delta, southern China) transport was another factor that contributed to high O3 levels in Hong Kong. The photochemical O3 formation, generally VOC-limited in Hong Kong, was controlled by a small number of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Furthermore, the positive matrix factorization (PMF) simulation suggested that solvent usage and vehicular emissions are the major contributors to ambient VOCs in Hong Kong. Finally, this paper presents recommendations for further O3 research and implementation of O3 control strategies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair pollution 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aemissions 3ahurricanes 3amodels 3aozone 3arelative humidity 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3asolar radiation 3asolvents 3atemperature 3avolatile organic compounds 3awind direction 3awind speed 3aChina 0aConceptual model 0aOzone 0aRegional 0aSuper-regional 0aHong Kong1 aGuo, H.1 aZheng, J.Y.1 aLouie, P.K.K.1 aCheng, H.R.1 aJiang, F.1 aCheung, K.1 aWong, L.C.1 aFeng, X.Q.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2013 Sept., v. 76 p.208-220dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.09.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024003900130040001800169100002200187245010800209300001600317520148400333592002801817596006601845596003901911596003901950650002301989650001602012650001002028650002402038650001602062650001802078650002302096650001402119650001102133650001002144650001502154650002202169650001202191650001202203650001302215650002102228650001002249650002102259650001002280650001202290650001002302651001802312700002202330700005902352773012102411856008202532961001302614852000902627655001202636IND60655938620221119130044.0190807e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065593862DNAL7 a10.1007/s11130-019-00732-y2doi7 a10.1007/s11130-019-00732-y2chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHooper, Sharon D.10aSingle Varietal Dry Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) Pastas: Nutritional Profile and Consumer Acceptability  ap. 342-349.  aDry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) are a nutrient dense food rich in protein, dietary fiber, minerals, and folate. Consumption of dry beans is relatively low in the United States and this may be due in part to the lack of diversity in bean products beyond whole seeds. Products that incorporate beans in new forms, such as flours, offer the potential to increase dry bean utilization. In this study whole dry beans were milled into flour and used to make gluten free fresh pastas. Six bean varieties each from a different market class (white kidney, navy, otebo, cranberry, dark red kidney and black) were made into pasta. Their consumer appeal was compared to fresh wheat pasta and their nutritional value was compared to fresh wheat pasta and whole boiled beans. The dry bean pastas were nutritionally superior to wheat pasta with higher protein, ash, resistant starch and protein digestibility corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS) as well as lower total starch content. While consumers preferred the flavor, texture and appearance of the wheat pasta to the dry bean pasta, 36% of participants said they would definitely or probably purchase the dry bean pastas from the light colored beans. There was some loss of nutritional value of bean pasta vs. whole boiled beans but this can mostly be attributed to the bean pasta being 90% bean. These results suggest that single variety fresh dry bean pastas have commercial potential in the U.S. as healthy gluten free pasta options.  aPublisher supplied data  aN/AcMichigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development  aN/AcAgricultural Research Service  aN/AcAgricultural Research Service 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aamino acids 3acolor 3aconsumer acceptance 3acranberries 3adietary fiber 3adigestible protein 3adry beans 3aflavor 3aflour 3afolic acid 3agluten-free foods 3akidneys 3amarkets 3aminerals 3anutrient content 3apasta 3aresistant starch 3aseeds 3atexture 3awheat 3aUnited States1 aGlahn, Raymond P.1 aCichy, Karen A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4311-07740 tPlant foods for human nutrition.g2019 Sept., v. 74, no. 3 p.342-349dSpringer USwJournal:jnl42388x0921-96687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11130-019-00732-y3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004700092040001800139100002000157245006300177300001600240500000900256520156500265592002801830650001501858650001301873650001301886650001601899650001701915650001501932650001501947650001301962650001701975650002501992650002802017650000902045650002002054650001602074700001802090700001702108700001902125773020702144852000902351856009402360655001202454IND2206924420221118061518.0191028e199903  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220692442DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1999.00472425002800020044x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoskinen, W.

The possibility of adsorption of organic chemicals to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) lysimeters, a more economical alternative to stainless steel, has led to debate over their suitability for groundwater sampling. The adsorption of different pesticide chemistries, chloroacetanilide (alachlor (2-chloro-N-(2,6-diethylphenyl)-N-(methoxymethyl)acetamide)), s-triazine (atrazine (6 - chloro - N - ethyl - N′-1-methylethyl)-1-3-5-triazine-2,4-diamine)), chloronicotinyl (intidacloprid (1-[(6-chloro-3-pyridinyl)-methyl]-N-nitro-2-imidazolidinimine)), organophosphorus (isofenphos (1-methylethyl 2-[[ethoxy[(1-methylethyl)amino]phosphinothioyl] oxy]benzoate)), sulfonylurea (nicosulfuron (2-[[[[(4,6-dimethoxy-2-pyr-imidinyl) amino ] carbonyl]amino]sulfonyl]-N,N-dimethyl -3-pyridine carboxamide)), and azole (triadimefon (1-(4-chlorophenoxy)-3,3-dimethyl-1-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-2-butanone)), on a lysimeter constructed from rigid PVC was determined to evaluate the suitability of PVC material for use in groundwater sampling. Among all pesticides tested, only isofenphos demonstrated slight adsorption (9% of applied) on the lysimeter; adsorption was rapid and isophenfos was not easily desorbed with methanol and water. None of the other pesticides adsorbed to the lysimeter. When selecting a lysimeter, potential adsorptive interactions between other pesticide chemistries and the materials used in the lysimeter construction should be evaluated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aalachlor 3aatrazine 3agroundwater 3aimidacloprid 3aisofenphos 3alysimeters 3amethanol 3anicosulfuron 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3asoil 3astainless steel 3atriadimefon1 aCecchi, A.

Results from a recent molecular phylogenetic study of tribe Pisonieae showed that Pisonia is non-monophyletic and comprises three well-supported lineages: one including typical Pisonia and allies (Pisonia s.str.), a clade of species which corresponds to the original description of Ceodes and a third lineage whose single representative was formerly treated under the monotypic genus Rockia . Thus, as part of an effort to achieve a natural classification for tribe Pisonieae, this work proposes to re-establish Ceodes and Rockia to accommodate taxa with inconspicuous glands on anthocarps, recognising 21 species (20 for the former and one for the latter), of which 16 are new combinations: Ceodes amplifolia comb. nov., Ceodes artensis comb. nov., Ceodes austro-orientalis comb. nov., Ceodes brownii comb. nov., Ceodes cauliflora comb. nov., Ceodes coronata comb. nov., Ceodes diandra comb. nov., Ceodes gigantocarpa comb. nov., Ceodes gracilescens comb. nov., Ceodes lanceolata comb. nov., Ceodes merytifolia comb. nov., Ceodes muelleriana comb. nov., Ceodes rapaensis comb. nov., Ceodes sechellarum comb. nov., Ceodes taitensis comb. nov. and Ceodes wagneriana comb. nov. A general distribution of each species recognised in this work is also included, along with line drawings and colour pictures of representative species of Ceodes, Pisonia and Rockia and an updated dichotomous key based on reproductive characters for the nine genera (Ceodes, Cephalotomandra, Grajalesia, Guapira, Neea, Neeopsis, Pisonia, Pisoniella and Rockia) comprising the tribe Pisonieae.

To test the efficacy of a color based discrimination system, L. hesperus of both genders were reared from eggs through day 10 of adulthood under a 10 hour photophase at a constant temperature. They were separated into three color groups (yellow, pale green, dark green), then dissected for diapause categorization based on internal development. Most yellow individuals were in diapause, dark green individuals were not, and pale green ones were mixed. A group of 25 assessors, naïve with regard to L. hesperus development, were then asked to use a simplified color criteria (yellow = diapause, green = non-diapause) to estimate the status of a mixture of diapausing and non-diapausing adults of both genders aged two to seven days post-eclosion. After dissection to verify diapause status, assessor accuracy was found to be ineffective for assessing adults of both sexes younger than four days because color differences, which increased with age, were subtle or non-existent at this stage. For four to seven-day-old bugs, 84% of females and 67% of males were correctly categorized, on average. Incorrect assessments in all but the youngest males over-identified diapause, but for females there was no trend in miscategorizations. Overall, the results indicate that diapause status can be adequately discriminated by color assessment, and with greatest accuracy when sampling older females. However, factors other than photoperiod appear to also influence coloration.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLygus hesperus 3aadulthood 3aadults 3aanimals 3acolor 3adiapause 3aeggs 3afemales 3amales 3aoverwintering 3aphenotype 3aphotophase 3arearing 3atemperature 0aoverwintering 0apolyphenism 0awestern tarnished plant bug0 tJournal of insect science .g2012 Nov., v. 12, no. 136 p.1-14dUniversity of Wisconsin Libraryx1536-24427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1673%2F031.012.136013Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245012300170300001400293520150800307592002801815650001501843650001101858650001401869650001601883650001201899650001101911650002401922650002201946650003701968650001702005650001102022650001702033650002502050650001202075650001102087700002102098773012102119856005702240852000902297655001202306IND6019491520221121184858.0190605e199507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND601949152DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1995.tb01943.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Huanan,10aGenetic and phenotypic variation for flight ability in the cactophilic Drosophila species, D. aldrichi and D. buzzatii  ap. 25-35.  aThe flight ability of Drosophila aldrichi (Patterson & Crow) and D. buzzatii (Patterson & Wheeler) using tethered flights, was measured with respect to age‐related changes, genetic variation and adult body size variation induced by rearing at different larval densities. Drosophila buzzatii flew for much longer than D. aldrichi, especially females, but age‐related changes in flight duration were significant only for D. aldrichi. Effects of body size on flight ability were significant in D. buzzatii, but not in D. aldrichi. In D. buzzatii, there was a significant genotype‐environment interaction (larval density × line) for flight duration, with short and average flight duration isofemale lines showing longer flights, but a long flight duration line shorter flights as body size decreased (i.e., as larval density increased). Heritability estimates for flight duration were similar in the two species, but flight duration showed no significant genetic correlations with developmental time, body size or wing dimensions (except for one wing dimension in D. buzzatii). Although not significantly different between the species, heritabilities for life‐history traits (adult size and developmental time) showed contrasting patterns ‐ with higher heritability for body size (body weight and thorax length) in D. buzzatii, and higher for developmental time in D. aldrichi. In agreement with limited previous field evidence, D. buzzatii is better adapted for colonization than is D. aldrichi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aadults 3abody size 3abody weight 3afemales 3aflight 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic variation 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aheritability 3alarvae 3alife history 3aphenotypic variation 3arearing 3athorax1 aBarker, J.

For this purpose, we evaluated larval mortality and the quality of the marks generated in sagitta otoliths after 0.5- or 2-h immersion in 50–800mg L-1 alizarin red S stain. The optimal condition (2h, 200mg L-1) was chosen to stain Prochilodus lineatus larvae, which were offered to single predators at 5 or 12 days after marking (DAM). The otoliths were searched in the digestive tract of predators killed 1–17h after ingestion of the prey, and were then examined for mark presence. Otolith recovery rates were high (>70%) and mark detection was above 80% up to 3h after ingestion, but even after 9h, 20–40% of the otoliths were recovered, with mark detection levels of 65%. A higher number of DAM was associated with a higher success in otolith recovery and mark detection. Otolith marking constitutes a single and inexpensive technique that could be applied in both laboratory and field experimental studies of predator–prey interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProchilodus lineatus 3aalizarin 3adigestive tract 3afish larvae 3aingestion 3amortality 3aotoliths 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredators 0aalizarin red S 0afish larvae 0apredation 0aProchilodus lineatus1 aFuentes, C.

At −10 kPa, accuracy of predicting gravimetric water contents increased with increased number of inputs. The R²s and the slopes between predicted and measured water contents for 50 samples increased, and the intercepts came closer to zero as the inputs progress from clay only to soil texture plus organic matter and CaCO₃ and on to sand separates plus texture, organic matter, and CaCO₃. At the −33- and −1500-kPa matric potentials, the clay-only model predicted soil-water content equally as well as the two local models with more inputs. A previously published clay-only model that had been calibrated using semiarid soils performed almost as well as the locally calibrated models. Two other published models performed unsatis-factorily in predicting water retention at any of the matric potentials. Deep plowing increased clay content of one specific soil from 4 to 14%. Wind erosion subsequently reduced clay to 6% after 5 yr. Predicted water contents were 0.281, 0.341, and 0.293 kg kg⁻¹, respectively, at −10 kPa, and 0.012, 0.050, and 0.020 kg kg⁻¹, respectively, at −1500 kPa.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium carbonate 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3adeep tillage 3agravimetric water content 3aorganic matter 3aprediction 3asand 3asandy soils 3asemiarid soils 3asoil texture 3astatistical models 3atexture 3awater content 3awind erosion1 aTaylor, H.

These measurements were assessed during 2 years in situ within a benthic chamber simultaneously with bacterial production (BP). Results suggested that community respiration in Wimereux sandy beach sediments was probably dominated by bacterial respiration and that the estimated benthic bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) was highly variable. Although temperature significantly controlled both BP and BCR during low tide at the annual scale, the temperature effect on BGE was not significant. The instability and sediment erosion caused by the wave action and the tidal cycle were thus thought to influence the BGE. Since the sampling site is regularly affected by Phaeocystis foam deposit (enhancing the BCR and decreasing the BGE), and since GPP rates were highly variable and supported by high assimilation numbers (i.e., >1 mgC mgChla ⁻¹ h⁻¹), phytoplankton organic matter deposit following the immersion of the study site was thought to explain the BGE variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaeocystis 3aecosystems 3afoams 3alittoral zone 3ametabolism 3aorganic matter 3aphytoplankton 3aseasonal variation 3asediments 3atemperature1 aLamy, Dominique1 aArtigas, Luis Felipe1 aDavoult, Dominique0 tMarine biology.g2007 Mar., v. 151, no. 1 p.41-52dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-006-0446-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245012800180300001300308520131300321592002801634650002801662650002001690650001801710650001801728650002301746653002401769653002301793653002801816653005201844653002501896653002401921773010701945856008702052852000902139655001202148IND60542975320221122155519.0190408e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054297532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2013.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBécue-Bertaut, Monica,10aTracking verbal-based methods beyond conventional descriptive analysis in food science bibliography. A statistical approach  ap. 2-15.  aThe usage of verbal-based methods beyond conventional descriptive analysis is increasing in sensory analysis, either as full-methods or as a complement to holistic methods. They contribute to a better understanding of the consumers’ likes and willingness, important factors to the food industry. A prime objective of this paper is to give a global vision of the scientific publications in food science related to this topic from their abstracts. Textual statistics, combining multidimensional methods such as correspondence analysis, multiple factor analysis for contingency tables and characteristic words, are proving to be useful for extracting information from the corpus of abstracts. These abstracts have evolved over time towards a higher concern for research about methodology, which has become more complex and requires sophisticated statistical methods. Sensory methods, such as free choice profile, flash profile, repertory grid, sorting task, napping, word association and CATA, have emerged or have been revitalised. New statistical methods, such as multiple factor analysis, have been introduced to analyse data issued from verbalisation tasks. However, correspondence analysis, a reference method for dealing with texts and, more generally, frequency tables, is used with too much restraint.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrespondence analysis 3afactor analysis 3afood analysis 3afood industry 3asensory evaluation 0aVerbalisation tasks 0aTextual statistics 0aCorrespondence analysis 0aMultiple factor analysis for contingency tables 0aCharacteristic words 0aBibliographic study0 tFood quality and preference.g2014 Mar., v. 32 p.2-15dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2013.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245014900161300001600310520149900326592002801825650002801853650001701881650002901898650001301927650002901940650001901969650001601988650001502004650000902019650002302028650000902051650002002060650001002080650001402090650002602104650002002130650002202150650001302172650002002185650003202205653003202237653002502269653002602294653001502320700001802335700001602353700002002369700001402389773011902403856008202522852000902604655001202613IND60533605220221118160723.0190410e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053360522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2014.10.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xia14aThe effects of Ficus carica polysaccharide on immune response and expression of some immune-related genes in grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella  ap. 132-137.  aThe present study investigated the effect of Ficus carica polysaccharide (FCP), isolated from the fruit of F. carica L., at 0%, 0.1%, 0.5% and 1.0% doses supplementation with feed on genes Interleukin 1-β (IL-1β), Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNF-α) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) gene expression in blood, humoral innate immune parameters and resistant to Flavobacterium columnare of grass carp at weeks 1, 2 and 3. The results revealed that administration of FCP significantly (P < 0.05) up regulated IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression. HSP70 gene expression was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in FCP-fed fish at the end of trial. The serum total protein, albumin and globulin did not significantly increased in any diet on the first week whereas it was significantly enhanced in 0.5% and 1.0% supplementation diets on weeks 2 and 3 when compared to control. The serum complement C3 was significantly (P < 0.05) increased on weeks 1 and 2 when compared to control, however, no significant difference was found in this activity after 3 weeks of treatment. All diets significantly enhanced the serum lysozyme activity, bactericidal activity from weeks 1–2 as compared to control. Grass carp fed with FCP showed remarkably higher resistance against F. columnare (60% survival) compared to the control group (30% survival). These results confirm that FCP can up regulate immune related genes expression, stimulates immune response that per se enhances disease resistance in grass carp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aFicus carica 3aFlavobacterium columnare 3aalbumins 3aantibacterial properties 3ablood proteins 3ablood serum 3acomplement 3adiet 3adisease resistance 3afish 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglobulins 3aheat-shock protein 70 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-1beta 3alysozyme 3apolysaccharides 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aFicus carica polysaccharide 0aImmune-related genes 0aHumoral innate immune 0aGrass carp1 aGuo, Jian Lin1 aYe, Jin Yun1 aZhang, Yi Xiang1 aWang, Wei0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2015 Jan., v. 42, no. 1 p.132-137dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2014.10.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01885naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245009900198300001600297500001900313520066400332592002800996650002601024650001301050650002001063650001001083651001101093700006601104700007501170700001801245700006001263773013901323856007601462852000901538655001201547IND60705841020221117230216.0200807e20200609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070584102DNAL7 a10.3398/064.080.02072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarper, Alan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4437-470110aCurrent Distribution of the California Vole (Microtus californicus) in Baja California, Mexico  ap. 194-203.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe revisited 26 of the 28 known collection sites for the California vole, Microtus californicus, in Baja California, Mexico.

Effective conservation actions are required for recovery of California vole populations in Baja California.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrotus californicus 3ahabitats 3apopulation size 3avoles 3aMexico1 aPeralta García, Anny,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1214-15241 aValdez Villavicencio, Jorge H.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9612-03031 aTremor, Scott1 aConroy, Chris J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7198-96510 tWestern North American naturalist.g2020 June 9, v. 80, no. 2 p.194-203dBrigham Young UniversitywJournal:jnl3973452x1527-09047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3398/064.080.02073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245010200214300001800316500001900334520192700353592002802280650001502308650001802323650001202341650001502353650001102368650001202379650000902391650001302400650001202413650001602425650001402441650002402455650001402479700005602493700006002549773011802609856008702727852000902814655001202823IND60701796920221118160007.0200716e20200528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070179692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c001922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngikath, Fabiyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1554-007X10aInvestigating the Effects of C₃ and C₄ Alcohol Blending on Ignition Quality of Gasoline Fuels  ap. 8777-8787.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe study of the ignition quality of alcohol blends with petroleum fuels is a subject of practical interest. It is well known that the ignition delay time (IDT), as well as the octane number (ON), increases when gasoline fuels are blended with ethanol. This study focuses on the impact on inverse ignition delay time (IDT–¹) when alcohols, such as n-propanol and n-butanol, are blended with gasoline fuels. A nonlinear decrease in the IDT–¹ of the blends was observed. Predicting the extent of nonlinearity in blends is complicated because it involves unknown intermolecular interactions between base fuel components and the blended components. The purpose of this study is to establish the dependence of base fuel composition (in terms of functional groups) on observed nonlinearity. Gasoline fuel contains hundreds of compounds (predominantly hydrocarbons), making it a challenge to understand observed nonlinearity when they blend with other components. In this study, the IDTs of primary reference fuels (PRFs, a binary mixture of iso-octane and n-heptane) and FACE (fuel for advanced combustion engines) gasolines blended with two alcohols (n-propanol and n-butanol) were obtained with an ignition quality tester (IQT) following ASTM D6890 standards. A mole-based Gaussian fit was used to model the blending effects of alcohol with gasoline. The synergistic effect of the different mixtures tested in this study was investigated by analyzing the Gaussian parameters. A multiple linear regression model was formulated to provide information about the impact of the structural composition (functional group) on the synergistic blending effects of gasoline–alcohol mixtures. Constant-volume homogeneous batch reactor simulations were also conducted, using Chemkin-Pro for alcohols blended with a FACE J surrogate mixture to provide kinetic information about the blending effects observed in the IQT measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-propanol 3abatch systems 3abutanol 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aethanol 3aface 3agasoline 3aheptane 3aiso-octanes 3apetroleum 3aregression analysis 3asynergism1 aNaser, Nimal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2740-21791 aSarathy, S.

Examples are groups of dummy variables representing categorical variables, or present and lagged values of time series data. Since model selection in such cases typically aims for selecting groups of variables rather than individual covariates, an extension of the popular least angle regression (LARS) procedure to groupwise variable selection is considered. Data sets occurring in applied statistics frequently contain outliers that do not follow the model or the majority of the data. Therefore a modification of the groupwise LARS algorithm is introduced that reduces the influence of outlying data points. Simulation studies and a real data example demonstrate the excellent performance of groupwise LARS and, when outliers are present, its robustification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3amodels 3astatistics 3atime series analysis 0aCategorical variables 0aModel selection 0aOutliers 0aTime series1 aCroux, Christophe1 aGelper, Sarah0 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2016 Jan., v. 93 p.421-435dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2015.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010200159500001900261520142200280592002801702650002101730650001901751650001801770650001601788650001901804650002501823650002701848650001901875650001601894650001601910650001201926650001801938650001101956650001001967650001001977650001101987650001201998650004302010650001702053650001602070650001602086651001402102700001502116700001902131700001802150773012302168856007402291852000902365655001202374IND60718978720221119040522.0201126e20201104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071897872DNAL7 a10.3390/nu121133922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Jungbin 10aAnti-Obesity Effects of a Prunus persica and Nelumbo nucifera Mixture in Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPrunus persica and Nelumbo nucifera are major crops cultivated worldwide. In East Asia, both P. persica flowers and N. nucifera leaves are traditionally used for therapeutic purposes and consumed as teas for weight loss. Herein, we investigated the anti-obesity effects of an herbal extract mixture of P. persica and N. nucifera (HT077) and the underlying mechanism using a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity model. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal diet, HFD, HFD containing 0.02% orlistat (positive control), or HFD containing 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4% HT077 for 12 weeks. HT077 significantly reduced final body weights, weight gain, abdominal fat weights, liver weights, and hepatic levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol. HT077 also lowered glucose, cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and leptin levels and increased AST/ALT and adiponectin/leptin ratios and adiponectin levels. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that HT077 decreased the expression of lipogenic genes and increased the expression of fatty acid oxidation-related genes in adipose tissue. Our results indicate that HT077 exerts anti-obesity effects and prevents the development of obesity-related metabolic disorders. These beneficial effects might be partially attributed to ameliorating adipokine imbalances and regulating lipid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation in adipose tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNelumbo nucifera 3aPrunus persica 3aabdominal fat 3aadiponectin 3aadipose tissue 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartate transaminase 3abeta oxidation 3acholesterol 3afatty acids 3aglucose 3ahigh fat diet 3aleptin 3aliver 3amales 3amodels 3aobesity 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atherapeutics 3aweight gain 3aweight loss 3aEast Asia1 aKim, JiYe,1 aPark, Hyo-jin,1 aKim, Hocheol 0 tNutrients.g2020 Nov. 04, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu121133923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245013400171300001200305520156400317592002801881650001201909650002201921650001801943650002801961650001601989650001102005650001402016650001402030650002402044650001902068650001902087650000902106650002802115650002402143650001702167650001702184651000902201700006302210700002002273700002002293773013502313856008202448852000902530655001202539IND60655939320221119125848.0190909e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065593932DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-019-8508-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahabinejad, Nader10aIn situ field measurement of wind erosion and threshold velocity in relation to soil properties in arid and semiarid environments  ap. 501.  aField measurement of wind erosion linked to soil properties improves our understanding of erosion processes in arid and semiarid regions to combat this environmental threat. The aim of this study was to investigate wind erosion and threshold velocity (Vₜ) in relation to soil properties using a portable wind tunnel in 60 sites of Kerman, the largest province of Iran. The result indicated that wind erosion rates ranged from 0.03 g m⁻² min⁻¹ to 3.41 g m⁻² min⁻¹, indicating a wide variability in the erodibility of soils. Wind erosion was inversely attributed to Vₜ following a power function. In all cases, the influence of soil properties on wind erosion was supported by their opposite effect on threshold velocity. Clay and silt fractions, mean weight diameter (MWD) of aggregates, dry stable aggregates (DSA), shear strength, surface gravel, the concentrations of K⁺, Ca²⁺, and Mg²⁺, soil organic carbon (SOC) and calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE) were inversely proportional to wind erosion rates following nonlinear functions. Wind erosion was significantly increased as electrical conductivity (EC) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) increased. Critical values of 5.7–8.9 m s⁻¹ at 10-m height for Vₜ, 7% for clay content, .3 mm for MWD, 25% for DSA, and 5% for surface gravel were recognized, approximately. Multiple regression analysis indicated that SAR and MWD were the best predictors of wind erosion rate. Meanwhile, MWD, surface gravel, clay content, and SOC had the best estimation for threshold velocity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3aclay fraction 3aelectrical conductivity 3aerodibility 3agravel 3amagnesium 3apotassium 3aregression analysis 3asemiarid zones 3ashear strength 3asilt 3asodium adsorption ratio 3asoil organic carbon 3awind erosion 3awind tunnels 3aIran1 aMahmoodabadi, Majid1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6230-94821 aJalalian, Ahmad1 aChavoshi, Elham0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2019 Aug., v. 78, no. 16 p.501-501dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-019-8508-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013600168300001600304520166200320592002801982650002502010650002302035650002402058650002302082653004302105653002202148653002102170653002202191653003902213653003702252700001702289700002302306700001902329773011002348856008702458852000902545655001202554IND60542975620221122155514.0190408e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054297562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2013.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Min-a,10aHigher performance of constant-reference duo–trio test incorporating affective reference framing in comparison with triangle test  ap. 113-125.  aFor measuring the sensory discriminability of consumers, ways to optimize the test protocols were investigated in relation to the concept of the test practicality and operational power. Specifically, reference frames using consumers’ affective state of mind and adoption of selective tasting orders of products in a test were designed as the operationally more powerful ways of using consumer discrimination tests. Their effects were investigated in terms of three different versions of the constant-reference duo–trio tests, in comparison to the balanced-reference triangle test as a control protocol. The three different duo–trio protocols were: (1) a duo–trio with a constant-reference of a stronger sample; (2) a duo–trio with a constant-reference of a stronger sample with a fake brand name provided and (3) a duo–trio with a constant-reference of each subject’s preferred sample. Based on signal detection analysis assuming a comparison of distances strategy, all three duo–trio tests were determined to be superior to the triangle test when the first two replications were compared, while only the duo–trio test using the affective reference frame (either with the brand name encoded or with the preferred reference), were found to be superior to the triangle test when all replications were compared. Significant sequence effects were found only for the triangle test. These results indicated that the duo–trio with a constant-reference incorporating the consumers’ state of mind by using the affective reference frames and selective test sequences had the operationally favorable sample sequences and higher test practicality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer preferences 3aconsumers (people) 3aexperimental design 3asensory evaluation 0aAffective consumer discrimination test 0aOperational power 0aSequence effects 0aReference framing 0aConstant-reference duo–trio test 0aBalanced-reference triangle test1 aChae, Ji-Eun1 avan Hout, Danielle1 aLee, Hye-Seong0 tFood quality and preference.g2014 Mar., v. 32 p.113-125dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2013.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01648naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010900163300001600272520068400288592002800972650001101000650003301011650001901044650001801063650000901081700001701090700001901107700001601126773010201142856008101244852000901325655001201334IND60121135420221118035352.0150216e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012113542DNAL7 a10.1007/s00226-015-0702-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wangyu14aThe influence of moisture content on the interfacial properties of natural palm fiber–matrix composite  ap. 371-387.  aThe objective of this study was to investigate the influence of moisture content on the interfacial properties of natural palm.

We here report that supplementation with vitamin D can strengthen the urinary bladder lining. Vitamin D deficient and sufficient mice were infected with Escherichia coli (E. coli) transurethrally to cause urinary tract infection. In addition, bladder biopsies were obtained from postmenopausal women before and after a 3-month period of supplementation with 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃ (25D₃) and ex vivo infected with E. coli. In biopsies, obtained before E. coli infection, vitamin D had no impact on tight junction proteins. However, during E. coli infection, vitamin D induced occludin and claudin-14 in mature superficial umbrella cells of the urinary bladder, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Increased cell-cell adhesion consolidating the epithelial integrity is thereby promoted. We here describe a novel role of vitamin D in the urinary tract supporting vitamin D supplementation to restore the bladder epithelial integrity.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcStiftelsen Olle Engkvist Byggmästare  aNAcStockholm County Council (ALF project)  aNAcKarolinska Institutet  aNAcKarolinska Institutet  aNAcKarolinska Institutet  aNAcSwedish Neurological Association  aNAcSiriraj Hospital Mahidol University 3aEscherichia coli 3abiopsy 3abladder 3acell adhesion 3aepithelium 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amice 3aoccludins 3apostmenopause 3atight junctions 3aurinary tract diseases 3avitamin D 3avitamin D deficiency 3awomen1 aKamolvit, Witchuda1 aHertting, Olof1 aBrauner, Annelie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5533-68370 tCell and tissue research.g2020 June, v. 380, no. 3 p.669-673dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl14430x0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-019-03162-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245014000170300001600310520163100326592002801957596005301985596002902038596002302067650000902090650001502099650000902114650001202123650002602135700002102161700002502182700001702207700002002224700002002244700001702264700005902281773012902340856008202469852000902551655001202560IND60696141120221118143118.0200522e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069614112DNAL7 a10.1007/s00441-019-03163-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNichols, David H.10aInteraction with ectopic cochlear crista sensory epithelium disrupts basal cochlear sensory epithelium development in Lmx1a mutant mice  ap. 435-448.  aThe LIM homeodomain transcription factor Lmx1a shows a dynamic expression in the developing mouse ear that stabilizes in the non-sensory epithelium. Previous work showed that Lmx1a functional null mutants have an additional sensory hair cell patch in the posterior wall of a cochlear duct and have a mix of vestibular and cochlear hair cells in the basal cochlear sensory epithelium. In E13.5 mutants, Sox2-expressing posterior canal crista is continuous with an ectopic “crista sensory epithelium” located in the outer spiral sulcus of the basal cochlear duct. The medial margin of cochlear crista is in contact with the adjacent Sox2-expressing basal cochlear sensory epithelium. By E17.5, this contact has been interrupted by the formation of an intervening non-sensory epithelium, and Atoh1 is expressed in the hair cells of both the cochlear crista and the basal cochlear sensory epithelium. Where cochlear crista was formerly associated with the basal cochlear sensory epithelium, the basal cochlear sensory epithelium lacks an outer hair cell band, and gaps are present in its associated Bmp4 expression. Further apically, where cochlear crista was never present, the cochlear sensory epithelium forms a poorly ordered but complete organ of Corti. We propose that the core prosensory posterior crista is enlarged in the mutant when the absence of Lmx1a expression allows JAG1-NOTCH signaling to propagate into the adjacent epithelium and down the posterior wall of the cochlear duct. We suggest that the cochlear crista propagates in the mutant outer spiral sulcus because it expresses Lmo4 in the absence of Lmx1a.  aPublisher supplied data  aRO1 AG060504cNational Institutes of Health (US)  aRO1 DC 005590cNIH/NIDCD  aP20 RR 018788cNCR 3aears 3aepithelium 3amice 3amutants 3atranscription factors1 aBouma, Judith E.1 aKopecky, Benjamin J.1 aJahan, Israt1 aBeisel, Kirk W.1 aHe, David Z.

This study digs into the drivers leading European cities in setting ambitious GHG reduction targets by 2030. A total number of 246 local action plans, accepted in the Covenant of Mayors initiative, were evaluated, and ambitious municipalities (with reduction targets over 50%) were compared against those committing to regular targets (40–50%).Results show that the key factor enabling a higher climate ambition in cities is to develop local mitigation actions in line with the results of the baseline emission inventory, focusing on implementing actions in the most emitting sectors of activity. Furthermore, the study reveals the abilities of specific cities to set highly ambitious mitigation targets: to municipalise energy facilities increasing renewable energy production, and to be able of developing mitigation actions even tackling highly emitting sectors (e.g., transport) that traditionally are not under the competence of local governments.The study also shows other easy-to-reach solutions that every local authority can take into account to increase its ambition such as developing in-house action plans and conducting a deep stakeholder engagement and participatory processes from the initial stage of the action plan development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aenergy 3ainventories 3apollution control 3arenewable energy sources 3astakeholders 0aClimate change 0aMitigation 0aCovenant of mayors 0aEuropean green deal 0aGHG reduction Target1 aUrraca, Ruben1 aBertoldi, Paolo1 aThiel, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6439-57750 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 20, v. 320 p.128878-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1288783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245015800169520131600327592002801643650002301671650002401694650001801718650002901736650001701765650001101782650002201793650001601815650001101831650000701842650002001849650001901869653002901888653001801917653003501935653001901970653004601989700001502035700001602050700001702066700001502083700001702098773010202115856008102217852000902298655001202307IND60777852420221118233826.0220614e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077785242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fm.2022.1040592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Katherine Fan,10aTechnological characterization and flavor-producing potential of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional dry fermented sausages in northeast China  aThirty-seven lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains were isolated from traditional dry sausages collected from Northeast China, including Latilactobacillus sakei (29 strains), Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (4 strains), Latilactobacillus curvatus (2 strains), Weissella hellenica (1 strain), and Lactococcus lactis (1 strain). Some LAB strains had tolerance to high concentrations of sodium chloride (6%), sodium nitrite (150 mg/L NaNO₂), and acid (pH 4.0). They showed good growth and acidification properties and antimicrobial activity. Among them, five LAB strains that exhibited the best technological properties were selected and inoculated in the sausage model to explore their roles in flavor development. The contents of total free amino acids (FAAs) decreased ranging from 109.11 mg/g to 58.06 mg/g. A total of 46 volatile compounds were identified and the contents of volatile compounds increased in the sausage model during fermentation. Partial least squares regression analysis showed that Lb. sakei HRB10, Lb. plantarum MDJ2, W. hellenica HRB6, and Lc. lactis HRB0 promoted the generation of FAAs and volatile compounds in the sausage model. These findings demonstrated that the autochthonous LAB species are promising for the production of sausage with better flavor and fermentation performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactococcus lactis 3aWeissella hellenica 3aacidification 3aantimicrobial properties 3afermentation 3aflavor 3afood microbiology 3alactic acid 3amodels 3apH 3asodium chloride 3asodium nitrite 0aAutochthonous microbiota 0aMeat products 0aTechnological characterization 0aFlavor profile 0aPartial least squares regression analysis1 aTian, Yuan1 aZhu, Jiamin1 aWen, Rongxin1 aChen, Qian1 aKong, Baohua0 tFood microbiology.g2022 Sept., v. 106 p.104059-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2022.1040593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02012naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009600168300001600264520096100280592002801241650001901269650001401288650001001302650002601312650002001338650001501358650000901373700001801382700002201400700002101422700002701443773010201470856008101572852000901653655001201662IND60121135720221118035534.0150216e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012113572DNAL7 a10.1007/s00226-015-0706-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrazide, Cécile10aWood heterogeneities and failure load of timber structural elements: a statistical approach  ap. 421-440.  aIn this work, the effect of spatial location and geometrical characteristics of wood defects (only knots) on the failure load of timber structural elements is addressed. For a large set of timber structural elements (188 Maritime pine full size beams), spatial location and geometrical characteristics of knots were estimated from the analysis of external images of each element, and then, modulus of elasticity (MOE) and failure load obtained from a four-point bending test were experimentally estimated. From this large database, correlations between the failure load, MOE and geometrical characteristics of knots were studied on the basis of a polynomial regression and a nonlinear regression based on neural network. It was shown that accounting for simple geometrical characteristics of knots, such as the area, the circularity and the location, in addition to the MOE, significantly improves the prediction of the failure load of structural elements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus pinaster 3adatabases 3aknots 3amodulus of elasticity 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3awood1 aCointe, Alain1 aCoureau, Jean-Luc1 aMorel, Stéphane1 aDumail, Jean-François0 tWood science and technology.g2015 Mar., v. 49, no. 2 p.421-440dSpringer-Verlagx0043-77197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-015-0706-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245012500173300001800298520115300316592002801469650002201497650001201519650001201531650001701543650002201560650001401582650001501596650002601611650000901637650002101646650001501667650001301682650000901695650001101704650001001715650003701725650001401762700002201776700002301798700002801821700002701849700002401876773014601900856008102046852000902127655001202136IND60510660720221119003858.0160225e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051066072DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-4139-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeurtet-Mazel, Agnès10aBiosynthesis of gold nanoparticles by the living freshwater diatom Eolimna minima, a species developed in river biofilms  ap. 4334-4339.  aTesting biotransformation capacities of living aquatic microalgae diatoms to naturally synthetize gold nanoparticles (AuNP) from gold salts and assessing aftereffects on their viability by microscope observations is a great challenge. In this work, a laboratory experiment was conducted, which aimed to observe (i) directly by transmission electronic and light microscopy and (ii) through indirect measurements (UV-visible spectroscopy) the periphytic freshwater diatom Eolimna minima exposed to gold salts. This work revealed the capacity of E. minima to intracellularly biosynthetize AuNP and to tolerate it. AuNP synthesis appears as a mechanism of detoxification to protect diatom from gold salt contamination. We also pointed out the risks associated with the spread of diatoms full of AuNP, through the trophic web of freshwater ecosystems. The preponderant part of the diatoms in natural biofilms associated with their position at the basis of the trophic webs in rivers could then make them responsible for the contamination of their consumers (grazer animals) and consequently for the potential release of AuNP through the entire food web.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aanimals 3abiofilm 3abiosynthesis 3abiotransformation 3afood webs 3afreshwater 3afreshwater ecosystems 3agold 3alight microscopy 3amicroalgae 3ananogold 3arisk 3arivers 3asalts 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3aviability1 aMornet, Stéphane1 aCharron, Laëtitia1 aMesmer-Dudons, Nathalie1 aMaury-Brachet, Régine1 aBaudrimont, Magalie0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Mar., v. 23, no. 5 p.4334-4339dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4139-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012900154300002000283520106500303592002801368650002101396650003601417650001401453650002301467650001901490650002401509650001301533650001801546650001601564650001401580650001901594650001801613650001401631650003101645700001701676700001801693700001401711700001501725700001501740700001901755700001701774773012401791856007401915852000901989655001201998IND60640240420221120233716.0190504e20160209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064024042DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra25842a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Fan10aGraphene oxide/carbon nanotubes–Fe₃O₄ supported Pd nanoparticles for hydrogenation of nitroarenes and C–H activation  ap. 16911-16916.  aFe₃O₄ magnetic nanocomposites combined with graphene oxide (GO) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are synthesized by a hydrothermal method, followed by synthesis of GO/CNT–Fe₃O₄ supported Pd nanoparticles using a gas–liquid interfacial plasma (GLIP) method with Pd(OAc)₂ as a precursor, and the Pd nanoparticles show a uniform particle size distribution. The catalysts exhibit remarkable catalytic activity during the hydrogenation of nitroarenes under H₂ atmosphere at 60 °C in water using a small amount of catalyst, and the catalyst can be magnetically separated from the reaction mixture. The addition of the Fe₃O₄ component to the GO/CNTs can be used to effectively prevent aggregation and restacking of GO and the CNTs, and the GO/CNT composite can adjust the hydrophilic–hydrophobic property of the catalysts. Furthermore, the Pd catalyst can be readily recovered and reused several times without a significant decrease in activity.

Regular spherical chitosan microparticles were obtained with an average diameter of 62.9μm and a size distribution index of 1.9 and showed stable under wide pH range (4.0 to 10.0) and various chemical conditions. Size distribution and chemical stability of the prepared chitosan microparticles were relatively close to those of Sepharose 4B. Polyclonal antibody against zearalenone (ZEN) as a model ligand was coupled onto chitosan microparticles or Sepharose 4B to obtain immunoaffinity columns. Further characterization indicated that chitosan microparticle-based column exhibited a maximum binding capacity of 6.1μg/mL gel, higher than that (3.1μg/mL gel) of Sepharose 4B-based column, and a column-to-column variation of 6.0%, slightly lower than that (8.6%) of Sepharose 4B-based column. When challenged with cornmeal samples fortified with ZEN at 50 and 100ng/g, satisfied recoveries of 92.1–100.2% with relative standard deviation (RSD)≤7.6% and 88.3–107.3% with RSD≤7.6% were both yielded by chitosan microparticle- and Sepharose 4B-based column, respectively, indicating that the obtained chitosan microparticles could be hopefully used as matrix support for immunoaffinity chromatography with reproducible extraction behavior and high extraction efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagarose 3abinding capacity 3achitosan 3acorn meal 3aemulsifying 3agels 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3aligands 3amicroparticles 3amodels 3apH 3apolyclonal antibodies 3astandard deviation 3azearalenone 0aChitosan microparticles 0aZearalenone 0aImmunoaffinity chromatography1 aYang, Yamei1 aWang, Shuwen1 aZhou, Xinhua1 aLuo, Shilong1 aZhang, Chen1 aWang, Yun0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 June 15, v. 131 p.1147-1154dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.04.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245014100208506007600349520159900425592002802024506003702052650002402089650002902113650001302142650001602155650002002171650001602191650002402207650001902231650001102250650001402261650004302275650001002318650001402328650001302342700002502355700002502380700002402405773013302429856007702562852000902639655001202648IND60670170220221207070345.0190925e20190903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067017022DNAL7 a10.3390/vetsci60300712doi7 aPMC67896362pmcid7 a314843832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarponi, Garyfalia 12aA Cellular Model of Infection with <i>Brucella melitensis</i> in Ovine Macrophages: Novel Insights for Intracellular Bacterial Detection  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIntracellular bacteria provoking zoonoses, such as those of the genus Brucella, present a host cell tropism mostly limited to the monocyte/macrophage lineage, leading to chronic inflammatory reactions, difficult-to-eradicate-infections, and widespread prevalence among ruminants. Eradication of brucellosis has been based on programs that translate into a substantial financial burden for both the authorities and stockbreeders, if not strictly followed. To this end, we sought to create an in vitro cell model that could be utilized as future reference for adequately measuring the number of engulfed brucellae/cell, using peripheral blood-derived sheep macrophages infected with B. melitensis at decimal multiplicities of infection (MOI = 5000-5), to simulate the host cell/microorganism interaction and monitor bacterial loads up to 6 days post-infection. We show that the MOI = 5000 leads to high numbers of engulfed bacteria without affecting macrophages&rsquo; viability and that the minimum detection limit of our Real-Time PCR assay was 3.97 &plusmn; 5.58 brucellae/cell. Moreover, we observed a time-associated, significant gradual reduction in bacterial loads from Day 2 to Day 6 post-infection (p = 0.0013), as part of the natural bactericidal properties of macrophages. Overall, the work presented here constitutes a reliable in vitro cell model of Brucella melitensis for research purposes that can be utilized to adequately measure the number of engulfed brucellae/cell and provides insights towards future utilization of molecular biology-based methods for detection of Brucella.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrucella melitensis 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3abrucellosis 3adetection limit 3amacrophages 3amicrobial detection 3amicrobial load 3amodels 3amonocytes 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asheep 3aviability 3azoonoses1 aKritas, Spyridon  K.1 aPapanikolaou, Eleni 1 aPetridou, Evanthia 0 tVeterinary sciences.g2019 Sept. 03, v. 6, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27139x2306-73817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vetsci60300713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01992naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245009500181300001400276520079000290592002801080650001701108650001501125650001701140650002401157651001301181653001501194653002301209653001701232653001601249700005901265700005701324700002001381700001601401773010501417856008701522852000901609655001201618IND60777852620221118233821.0220621e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077785262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrurstud.2022.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinkoff-Zern, Laura-Anne10aProtracted dependence and unstable relations: Agrarian questions in the H-2A visa program1  ap. 43-54.  aDrawing on US Department of Labor data and a qualitative case study of New York state horticultural growers, this article explores farmers’ experiences with the H-2A agricultural guestworker visa program.

These moderate-sized farmers, while the primary users of the program, are less likely than larger scale farmers to have the time and profit margin to easily navigate the program.

Research was conducted in fresh broadleaved forest habitat (6 plots), fresh mixed broadleaved forest (1 plot) and upland fresh broadleaved forest (1 plot). The dominant species in the stands studied was European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) along with a small amount of oak. The soils in the plots studied were classified as acid brown, lessive brown and rusty brown soils.Soil samples from 0-5 cm and 5-15 cm depth were analyzed to determine: the activity of urease, asparaginase, acid phosphatase, dehydrogenases and the content of organic carbon and total nitrogen, pH, base cations (Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺), exchangeable acidity (Hw), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and the degree of base saturation of the sorption complex w (% V). There was a significant correlation between the studied enzymatic and chemical parameters. Based on those biochemical properties that reflect the richness of soil nutrients and soil biological activity, the forest soil fertility was formulated. This value was the highest in the plot Góra Śląska and Mrągowo and was the lowest in Kwidzyn, Jamy and Brzeziny. In all the plots studied, the enzyme activity was significantly higher in the 0-5 cm layer than in the 5-15 cm layer : in the two respective layers enzyme activities were, urease 22.9 and 9.5; asparaginase 3.5 and 1.9; dehydrogenase 1.95 and 0.47, and acid phosphatase 0.89 and 0.22. The upper layer contained much more organic carbon, which is the substrate need for growth of soil microbes. All of the chemical parameters examined were higher in the 0-5 cm layer than at 5-15 cm. Soils in beech stands typically had high spatial variability in their chemical and biochemical properties.Soil fertility ratio can be applied in a detailed diagnosis of the status of forest habitats and it may complement other diagnostic tools used in chemical research of forest soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. sylvatica 3aacid phosphatase 3aacidity 3aasparaginase 3abase saturation 3abiological activity in soil 3acalcium 3acarbon 3acation exchange capacity 3acations 3adeciduous forests 3aenzyme activity 3aforest habitats 3aforest soils 3ahighlands 3amagnesium 3anitrogen content 3apH 3apotassium 3asodium 3asoil fertility 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil nutrients 3asorption 3aurease 3aPoland 0aenzymatic activity 0achemical properties of soils 0aforest soils 0aEuropean beech0 tLeśne prace badawcze =.g2011 Nov. 30, v. 72, no. 4 p.321-328dVersitax2082-89267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10111-011-0032-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03861naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010100169300001600270520255900286592002802845650002502873650002502898650001902923650000902942650000902951650001502960650001902975650001002994650002003004650001103024650001803035653003003053653002803083653002703111653001603138700001703154700002003171700001503191700001603206773009903222856008503321852000903406655001203415IND60653660120221121230620.0191108e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065366012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2019.07.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSéguin, M.-A.10aStudy of particle residence time in a pressurized fluidized bed with in-bed heat exchanger tubes  ap. 201-212.  aAnthropogenic climate change is amongst the greatest of challenges to human civilization. A key area that will play a large role in mitigating its effects are clean fossil fuel applications. Clean coal combustion can be achieved with an oxygen-fired pressurized fluidized bed combustor incorporating carbon capture and storage. In relation to pressurized fluidization processes, understanding the influence of pressure on fluidized bed hydrodynamics and, in turn, their effect on parameters including fuel residence time is essential. For the combustor under consideration here, a fraction of the heat exchanger boiler tubes are submerged in the fluidized bed such that the effect of the horizontal tube bundle on the fuel residence time is of great importance. The main focus of the present work was to evaluate the impact of gas velocity, pressure, presence or absence of a horizontal tube bundle and fuel feed rate on the average fuel residence time in a dense gas-solid fluidized bed. Experiments were conducted under cold flow conditions in a pressurized fluidized bed with an inner diameter of 0.15 m. The fluidization material was large glass beads (1.0 mm in diameter) while fuel particles were simulated with smaller glass beads (64 and 83 μm in Sauter mean diameter) that were susceptible to entrainment. Operating pressures and superficial gas velocities were maintained between 101.3 and 1200 kPa and 1.5 and 3.2 Umf, respectively. To simulate continuous fuel injection, experiments were conducted with the fuel surrogate particles being continuously fed to the fluidized bed of large particles over a desired period of time. Downstream, entrained particles were captured to determine the average entrainment rate and average mass of fuel particles inside the fluidized bed at steady state, which yielded the average fuel residence time. The combination of elevated pressure with the tube bundle present was found to have the most influential impact when compared to base conditions of atmospheric pressure and with no tube bundle present. It was found to enhance gas bubble break up and reduce the average gas bubble size substantially. In turn, this increased the average residence time of 83 μm particles by nearly three-fold in comparison to the case of atmospheric pressure with no tube bundle present. The effect of gas velocity on particle residence time was not found to be statistically significant under the range tested. Similarly, the effect of increasing fuel feed rate by 50% had no statistically significant impact.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3acoal 3acold 3acombustion 3afluidized beds 3aglass 3aheat exchangers 3ahumans 3ahydrodynamics 0aPressurized fluidized bed 0aParticle residence time 0aHorizontal tube bundle 0aEntrainment1 aHughes, R.W.1 aFitzsimmons, M.1 aMacchi, A.1 aMehrani, P.0 tPowder technology.g2019 Oct., v. 355 p.201-212dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2019.07.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01421naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245007200213520043300285592002800718650001300746650002900759650001300788700001900801700002000820700001900840700002700859700002500886773011300911856008601024852000901110655001201119IND60749719720221120210836.0211009e20211025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074971972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1288842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMauerhofer, Volker1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5444-261910aEnvironmental net-gain governance: Global implementation challenges  aThis Letter outlines the EU's & UN's latest environmental principle towards Net-Gains.

Here we examined the influence of the parasites on their external environment by monitoring the impact of adult Schistosoma mansoni worms on the murine plasma proteome in vitro and, in particular, on how the worms affect the blood coagulation protein high molecular weight kininogen (HK). METHODS: Following the incubation of adult schistosomes in murine plasma, two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) was conducted to look for changes in the plasma proteome compared with control plasma. A major change to the blood protein kininogen (HK) was observed, and the interaction of Schistosoma mansoni parasite with this protein alone was then investigated by western blot analysis and activity assays. Finally, the generation of bradykinin from HK was monitored using a bradykinin detection kit. RESULTS: The most striking change to the plasma proteome concerned HK; while the full-length protein was more abundant in control plasma, carboxyl-terminal truncated forms were more abundant in plasma that contained schistosomes. Incubating parasites in buffer with pure HK followed by Western blot analysis confirmed that human HK is degraded by the worms. The resulting digestion pattern differed from that brought about by kallikrein, a host serine protease that normally acts on HK to release the vasodilator bradykinin. We found that live schistosomes, while digesting HK, do not generate bradykinin nor do they cleave a chromogenic kallikrein substrate. Since the cleavage of HK by the worms is not impeded by the serine protease inhibitor PMSF but is blocked by the cysteine protease inhibitor E64c, we hypothesize that schistosome tegumental cysteine proteases are responsible for HK cleavage. CONCLUSIONS: Since proteomic and biochemical studies have revealed that the schistosome tegument contains two cysteine proteases belonging to the calpain family (SmCalp1 and SmCalp2) we conclude that these are likely responsible for the HK cleavage reported here. Schistosome cleavage of HK should help impede blood clotting and inflammation around the worms in vivo and so promote their ease of movement within the vasculature of their hosts.  aPublisher supplied data  aAI056273cFoundation for the National Institutes of Health0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3aWestern blotting 3aadults 3ablood 3ablood coagulation 3ablood flukes 3ablood proteins 3abradykinin 3acalpain 3acoagulation 3aelectrophoresis 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3ahosts 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3akininogens 3amice 3amolecular weight 3amonitoring 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aschistosomiasis 3aserine proteinases1 aDa’dara, Akram A.1 aSkelly, Patrick J.0 tParasites & vectors.g2018 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.182-182dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-2704-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006800152245009800220300001600318520105200334592002801386650004401414650001501458650001801473650001301491650002301504650001901527650001801546650003701564650001401601650000701615650003301622650001601655650002501671653002501696653001301721653002001734653002201754700002401776700002401800773013501824856008701959852000902046655001202055IND60639316220221116222838.0190606e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063931622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.04.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViswanathan, Natrayasamy1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4939-344210aDevelopment of chitosan encapsulated tricalcium phosphate biocomposite for fluoride retention  ap. 811-816.  aThe powder form of tricalcium phosphate (TCP) causes the significant pressure drop which limit its application under field conditions. To trounce such technological troubles and to enhance the defluoridation capacity (DC) of TCP, chitosan (CS) encapsulated TCP polymeric composite was prepared by dispersing TCP particles into chitosan polymeric matrix to produce tricalcium phosphate/chitosan (TCPCS) composite which could be made into any desirable form. The synthesized TCPCS composite possesses an enhanced DC of 1034 mgF−/kg than the individual components viz., TCP and chitosan which has got DC of 490 and 52 mgF−/kg respectively. The prepared adsorbents were characterized by FTIR, SEM and EDAX analysis. The various physico-chemical properties such as contact time, solution pH, co-anions and temperature were optimized to get maximum defluoridation. The equilibrium and kinetic experiments were conducted for TCPCS composite toward fluoride removal. The practical applicability of TCPCS composite was examined at field conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3abiocomposites 3achitosan 3acomposite polymers 3adefluoridation 3aencapsulation 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afluorides 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3atricalcium phosphate 0aTricalcium phosphate 0aChitosan 0aTCPCS composite 0aFluoride sorption1 aKumar, Ilango Aswin1 aMeenakshi, Sankaran0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 July 15, v. 133 p.811-816dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.04.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001400166245012800180300001800308520124000326592002801566650001201594650002501606650001701631650001101648650001501659650001101674650002301685650001001708650002001718650001801738650002201756650002901778650001801807650002101825650002201846650002001868650004101888651001001929651001001939700001601949700001901965700001701984700001502001773011802016856004802134852000902182655001202191IND50068183420221119025853.0130730e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006818342DNAL7 a234177542pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-013-3115-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDou, Ming10aInfluence of changes in hydrodynamic conditions on cadmium transport in tidal river network of the Pearl River Delta, China  ap. 7501-7516.  aWith rapid economic development, the Pearl River Delta (PRD) of China has experienced a series of serious heavy metal pollution events. Considering complex hydrodynamic and pollutants transport process, one-dimensional hydrodynamic model and heavy metal transport model were developed for tidal river network of the PRD. Then, several pollution emergency scenarios were designed by combining with the upper inflow, water quality and the lower tide level boundary conditions. Using this set of models, the temporal and spatial change process of cadmium (Cd) concentration was simulated. The influence of change in hydrodynamic conditions on Cd transport in tidal river network was assessed, and its transport laws were summarized. The result showed the following: Flow changes in the tidal river network were influenced remarkably by tidal backwater action, which further influenced the transport process of heavy metals; Cd concentrations in most sections while encountering high tide were far greater than those while encountering middle or low tides; and increased inflows from upper reaches could intensify water pollution in the West River (while encountering high tide) or the North River (while encountering middle or low tides).  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3aeconomic development 3aheavy metals 3amodels 3apollutants 3arivers 3atemporal variation 3atides 3awater pollution 3awater quality 2aCadmiumxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aHydrodynamics 2aModels, Chemical 2aRiversxchemistry 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aChina 0aChina1 aZuo, Qiting1 aZhang, Jinping1 aLi, Congying1 aLi, Guiqiu0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2013 Sept., v. 185, no. 9 p.7501-7516dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-013-3115-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012100170300001600291520107600307592002801383650002501411650001201436650001801448650001001466650001501476650001101491650004401502650002001546650000901566653002801575653001101603653003201614653002101646653000801667653001101675700001301686700001501699700001701714700001601731773011701747856008501864852000901949655001201958IND60478101220221120065207.0160220e20160503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047810122DNAL7 a10.1080/02773813.2015.11045442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Caoxing10aStructural Characterization of the Lignins from the Green and Yellow Bamboo of Bamboo Culm (Phyllostachys pubescens)  ap. 157-172.  aMilled wood lignins were isolated from green and yellow bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens), termed MWLg and MWLy, respectively. The structural features of the lignin preparations and the remaining LCC were characterized by quantitative ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance (¹³C NMR) spectroscopy and two-dimensional heteronuclear signal quantum coherence NMR (2D HSQC NMR) spectroscopy. The results indicated that the main substructures in MWLg and MWLy were β -O-4 alkyl-aryl ether, resinol, phenylcoumaran, spirodienone, and α , β -diaryl ether, and their abundances per 100 Ar units were 38.2 and 39.8, 6.9 and 6.3, 3.8 and 2.9, 1.7 and 2.1, 0.4 and 0.3, respectively. The S:G:H ratios of MWLg and MWLy were estimated to be 40:54:6 and 51:44:5, respectively. The γ -acylation of green bamboo lignin was 17.22%, lower than that of yellow bamboo lignin (21.12%). Moreover, a flavonoid compound (tricin) was also detected in the MWLg and MWLy. Some carbohydrates remained in the purified MWL preparations, which were considered as the lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCC).  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhyllostachys edulis 3abamboos 3acarbohydrates 3aculms 3aflavonoids 3alignin 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3astable isotopes 3awood 0aPhyllostachys pubescens 0alignin 0astructural characterization 0aquantitative NMR 0aLCC 0atricin1 aHe, Juan1 aDu, Liting1 aMin, Douyong1 aYong, Qiang0 tJournal of wood chemistry and technology.g2016 May 3, v. 36, no. 3 p.157-172dTaylor & Francisx1532-23197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02773813.2015.11045443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02030naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245007500173300001600248500002000264520067600284592002800960650002900988650002901017650001901046650002201065650001801087650002601105650002401131650002401155650001801179650002301197650003301220650002001253650002201273650003001295650002101325700002101346773014301367852000901510856008901519655001201608IND4400512420221119084126.0200107e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440051242DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8276.2007.01047.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLence, Sergio H.10aWelfare Impacts of Cross‐Country Spillovers in Agricultural Research  ap. 197-215.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe welfare implications of intellectual property protection (IPP) for private sector agricultural research are analyzed, focusing on the realistic cases where countries provide different IPP levels, technology spills over across countries, and the public sector is involved in research.

The performed model allows estimating the hydrogen content in the syngas produced from biomass in different types of facilities. Bubbling fluidized bed (FB) and circulating fluidized bed (CFB) are taken into account in the study. Comparing with the previous FB gasification results, CFB gasification was capable of producing syngas with higher hydrogen concentration.The model considers and covers a broad range of conditions, influencing the hydrogen rich-gas production. The presented non-iterative approach gives quick and accurate results as an answer to the input data sets. The H₂ concentration in the gas, estimated using the developed model, is in good agreement with the experimental data. Maximum relative error between measured and calculated data is lower than ±8%.The model allows also studying the influence of operating parameters on the hydrogen concentration in the gas. The method constitutes an easy to employ and useful complementary technique in relation to the other ways of data handling, including experimental procedures. The model can be used by scientists and engineers for optimizations purposes and can be applied as a submodel oraseparate module in engineering calculations, capable to predict the H₂ concentration in the syngas from biomass via the CaO sorption both in FB and CFB gasifiers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3abiomass 3acalcium oxide 3adata collection 3aengineering 3afluidized beds 3agasification 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aneural networks 3ascientists 3asorbents 3asorption 3asynthesis gas 0aBiomass 0aHydrogen 0aCalcium oxide 0aFluidization 0aGenetic algorithms 0aNeural networks1 aFan, Hongtao1 aFeng, Yi1 aShaykh, ʻAbd al-Raḥīm,1 aFang, Mengxiang1 aWang, Qinhui0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 171 p.1651-1661dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.06.0983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01743naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100004200140245008200182300002000264520065600284592002800940650002200968650002100990650001401011650001301025650002301038650002801061650003301089650001001122650001101132700002001143700002301163773012401186856007401310852000901384655001201393IND60640240820221120223743.0190504e20160202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064024082DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra25850b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRājāc(Motion picture journalists),10aSisal-derived activated carbons for cost-effective lithium–sulfur batteries  ap. 13772-13779.  aElemental sulfur was successfully impregnated in an activated carbon (AC) matrix obtained from sisal fibers.

In this study, we used RM and corn straw (CS) to fabricate functional biochar composites (FBCs) via pyrolysis. We fully characterized the changes in morphology and composition on the preparation of FBCs at different pyrolytic temperature and the gaseous products during pyrolysis. It was found that a porous structure was generated on CS, endowing FBCs with the ability to remove dyes in water. Moreover, CaO was created through the decomposition of CaCO₃ in RM at ~700 °C, suggesting that FBCs could be used to neutralize the acidic wastewater. Hence, FBCs showed excellent performance in treating acidic dye wastewater, a common industrial wastewater with high contents of acid and dye and for which disposal is laborious. Additionally, FBCs exhibited magnetism because magnetic zero-valent iron was generated by the reduction of ferric oxide in RM with the CS gaseous product (CO) during pyrolysis. This work provided a dual-win strategy for waste recyclability and wastewater treatment, and the proposed method may have potential applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3acalcium oxide 3acorn straw 3adyes 3aferric oxide 3aindustrial wastes 3aindustrial wastewater 3airon 3amagnetism 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3awastewater treatment 3aChina 0aRed mud 0aAcid dye 0aFunctional biochar1 aZhang, Jia1 aChen, Chaowen1 aDu, Yue1 aTeng, Guopeng1 aWu, Zhengyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8142-18480 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 20, v. 320 p.128887-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1288873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245015300154300002000307520149700327592002801824650002001852650001001872650001801882650000701900650002201907650002401929650001701953650003701970650001002007650001602017700001702033700001902050700001402069773012402083856007402207852000902281655001202290IND60640240920221120223845.0190504e20160309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064024092DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra25851k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Junbo10aResonance Rayleigh scattering and resonance nonlinear scattering methods for the determination of nicardipine hydrochloride using eosin Y as a probe  ap. 25887-25893.  aIn a Britton–Robinson (pH 3.5) buffer solution, nicardipine hydrochloride (NCD) reacted with eosin Y (EY) to form an ion-association complex of [NCD·EY], which would self-aggregate to form [NCD·EY]ₙ nanoparticles with an average size of 55 nm via the squeezing effect of the aqueous phase and the van der Waals force. As a result, the intensities of resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS), second-order scattering (SOS) and frequency doubling scattering (FDS) were enhanced and the new scattering spectra appeared. The maximum RRS, SOS and FDS wavelengths were located at 294 nm, 552 nm and 327 nm, respectively. The increments of scattering intensity (ΔIRRS, ΔISOS and ΔIFDS) were directly proportional to the concentration of NCD in certain ranges. The detection limits (3σ) of RRS, SOS and FDS were 1.3 ng mL⁻¹, 2.2 ng mL⁻¹ and 1.6 ng mL⁻¹. The optimum conditions of the RRS method and the influence factors were discussed. In addition, the structure of the ion-association complex and the reaction mechanism were investigated. The shape of nanoparticles was characterized by transmission electron microscopy. The reaction mechanism and the reasons for enhancement of scattering were discussed based on infrared spectra, quantum chemical calculations and absorption spectroscopy. Accordingly, a novel rapid, convenient, sensitive and selective RRS method for determination of NCD was proposed and applied to detect NCD in tablet and urine samples with satisfactory results.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3aeosin 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aquantum mechanics 3areaction mechanisms 3aspectroscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aurine 3awavelengths1 aYang, Xiaoli1 aYang, Jinxiang1 aLai, Lina0 tRSC advances.g2016 Mar. 09, v. 6, no. 31 p.25887-25893dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra25851k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245013700172300001800309520126300327592002801590650003701618650001101655650001901666650001401685650001701699650001101716650001901727650000701746650001701753650002401770650003301794650001301827650001301840650002301853650001701876650001501893650001201908653001301920653002101933653001501954653001201969700001501981700001401996700001402010700001302024700001802037700001802055700001602073773012102089856008802210852000902298655001202307IND60611461820221118040521.0201209e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061146182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.08.2582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Hualing10aDefluoridation investigation of Yttrium by laminated Y-Zr-Al tri-metal nanocomposite and analysis of the fluoride sorption mechanism  ap. 1342-1353.  aIn this study, a laminated nanocomposite of Y-Zr-Al with significantly high surface area of 256.6 m²/g was successfully prepared, and was used to investigate the defluoridation performance of sorbent based on Yttrium. The composite showed high fluoride sorption performance, especially at low F⁻ concentration conditions. SEM, BET, Elemental Mapping and XPS were used to characterize physicochemical properties of the composite in detail. Several influence factors including pH, presence of coexisting anions and contacting time were detailly investigated. The sorption course was studied by equilibrium sorption isotherm and sorption kinetics. Based on experimental results, a mechanism for fluoride sorption onto Y-Zr-Al composite was proposed, which revealed that there were three main sorption models, including mesoporous diffusion sorption, electronic interaction sorption and ion exchange, in the sorption course. The composite was considered to be highly potential in treating fluoride polluted waste water due to its high efficiency, high anti-interference ability and easy operation, and the discovery of fluoride highly attractive rare earth element was important to further understand and develop defluoridation sorbents based on rare earth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aanions 3adefluoridation 3afluorides 3aion exchange 3amodels 3ananocomposites 3apH 3aporous media 3arare earth elements 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorbents 3asorption 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3awastewater 3ayttrium 0aSorption 0aFluoride removal 0aRare earth 0aYttrium1 aLi, Xueqin1 aTian, Lei1 aWang, Tao1 aWang, Qi1 aNiu, Pingping1 aChen, Pinghua1 aLuo, Xubiao0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 648 p.1342-1353dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.08.2583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02008naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011200169300001600281520074800297592002801045650001501073650001601088650001401104650001801118650001501136650001201151650001801163650000901181653001901190653002401209653001901233653000901252653001201261700001501273700001901288700001901307700001701326700002001343773011701363856008501480852000901565655001201574IND60478101520221120065153.0160220e20160503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047810152DNAL7 a10.1080/02773813.2015.11124022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoaiza, J.

The influence of the operating conditions used in the soda–anthraquinone pulping of the solid phase resulting from the autohydrolysis process was examined. Autohydrolysis of the raw material at a liquid/solid ratio of 8 kg water/kg material at 180°C for 30 min was found to provide a commercially useful liquid phase containing most of the starting hemicellulose. The autohydrolysis treatment allowed the subsequent production of soda–anthraquinone cellulose pulp and paper with properties as good as or even better than those obtained without the pretreatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3abiorefining 3acellulose 3ahemicellulose 3apaper pulp 3apulping 3araw materials 3awood 0aAutohydrolysis 0aEucalyptus globulus 0ahemicelluloses 0apulp 0asoda-AQ1 aLópez, F.1 aGarcía, M.

Its molecular mass was determined to be 35 kDa, and the pI to be 8.5. The recombinant plasmid pGT1, containing the MPH-encoding gene, mpdB, cloned into pGEX-4T-2 was over-expressed in Escherichia coli as GST-MPH fusion protein. The recombinant MPH was purified to homogeneity by a single step, using GSTPrep FF affinity column, with the molecular mass identical to that of the native enzyme. The purified enzyme had the specific activity of about 1,600 unit mg−1 protein and the yield of about 75%, a 39-fold increase in recovery compared to that of the native enzyme. The optimal temperature and pH were 25°C and 9.0, respectively. The MPH was stable, with its activity unchanged for 48 h at 4°C, and reduced to 50% after 5 h and to 45% after 48 h at 25°C. The enzyme activity remained 80–90% after 8–15 h at pH 6–7. Cd2+, Co2+, and Zn2+ ions at the concentration of 1 mM enhanced the activity; while sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), dithiothreitol (DTT) and ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) reduced it. The enzyme also showed cross reactivity with other insecticides within the organophosphate group, and the kinetic parameters for individual substrates were investigated. Since MPH from B. cepacia has wide potential applications in detoxification and detection of organophosphate compounds, this study provides important basis for its future use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderia cepacia 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aEscherichia coli 3aagarose 3achromatography 3across reaction 3adithiothreitol 3aenzyme activity 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aions 3amolecular weight 3apH 3aparathion-methyl 3aplasmids 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3atemperature 2aBurkholderia cepaciaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aChromatography, Affinity 2aChromatography, Liquidxmethods 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aEnzyme Activatorsxmetabolism 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxmetabolism 2aEnzyme Stability 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aInsecticidesxmetabolism 2aIsoelectric Point 2aMethyl Parathionxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aOrganophosphatesxmetabolism 2aPhosphoric Monoester Hydrolasesxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPlasmids 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTemperature 3aThailand 0aThailand1 aJongsareejit, Boonsri1 aYamkunthong, Wanphen1 aWichitwechkarn, Jesdawan0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2012 Apr., v. 28, no. 4 p.1739-1746dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-011-0985-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245011500164520124900279592002801528650002501556650001801581650001101599650002801610650001601638650001501654650001501669650001001684650002001694650001801714650001501732650001401747653001801761653001401779700005201793700005101845700001601896700002001912773011301932856008602045852000902131655001202140IND60749720120221120160549.0211206e20211020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074972012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1288882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNi, Jing10aEvaluation of MQL broaching AISI 1045 steel with sesame oil containing nano-particles under best concentration  aCutting fluid could improve the machining efficiency and reduce the energy consumption during broaching process. However, the commercial cutting fluids (CCF) contain harmful constituents causing various environmental threats. Vegetable oil based nanofluids, which contain nanoparticles in the environmentally friendly vegetable oils, could be regarded as a potential alternative for cutting fluids. In this paper, the best concentrations of three sesame oil-based nanofluids containing Fe₃O₄, Al₂O₃, Carbon nanoparticles respectively were obtained. Then, the experiments on broaching AISI 1045 steel under MQL lubrication were conducted. The results showed that nanofluid (total weight:30 g) containing 160 mg Carbon produced the best lubricating effect. Its reduction of the average broaching load peak and load valley were 725 N and 614 N, which were 115.7%, 118.5% higher than those of CCF. And its root mean square error (RMSE) of broaching vibration signal was 36.15% lower than CCF. Also, the best surface quality was obtained. Cost analysis for the application of nanofluids is done in the present work. The sesame oil-based Carbon nanofluid (160 mg) has both environmental and efficient benefits for industrial application.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanoparticles 3acost analysis 3aenergy 3aindustrial applications 3alubrication 3ananofluids 3asesame oil 3asteel 3asurface quality 3avegetable oil 3avegetables 3avibration 0aMQL Broaching 0aNanofluid1 aCui, Zhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0821-42281 aWu, Can1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2842-40461 aSun, Jingbo1 aZhou, Jiangheng0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 20, v. 320 p.128888-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1288883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02914naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245007900170300001400249520163900263592002801902650001301930650002601943650001901969650001201988650000902000650002402009650002402033650001702057650001402074650000902088650001102097650001302108653002102121653002402142653001702166653001602183700002002199700001602219700001902235700002302254773008902277856008102366852000902447655001202456IND60516057220221120044114.0160323e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051605722DNAL7 a10.1017/S17517311110013762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaureano, M.

The models included the direct additive genetic effect as a random effect and contemporary group (defined as the year and month of test) and age of cow at calving (linear and quadratic effect) as fixed effects. For the repeatability model, in addition to the effects cited, the permanent environmental effect of the animal was also included as a random effect. Variance components were estimated using the restricted maximum likelihood method in single- and multiple-trait and repeatability analyses. The heritability estimates for TDMF ranged from 0.23 (TDMF 6) to 0.32 (TDMF 2 and TDMF 4) in single-trait analysis and from 0.28 (TDMF 7 and TDMF 10) to 0.37 (TDMF 4) in multiple-trait analysis. In general, higher heritabilities were observed at the beginning of lactation until the fourth month. Heritability estimated with the repeatability model was 0.27 and the coefficient of repeatability for first lactation TDMF was 0.66. The genetic correlations were positive and ranged from 0.72 (TDMF 1 and 10) to 0.97 (TDMF 4 and 5). The results indicate that milk flow should respond satisfactorily to selection, promoting rapid genetic gains because the estimated heritabilities were moderate to high. Higher genetic gains might be obtained if selection was performed in the TDMF 4. Both the repeatability model and the multiple-trait model are adequate for the genetic evaluation of animals in terms of milk flow, but the latter provides more accurate estimates of breeding values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aadditive gene effects 3abreeding value 3acalving 3acows 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic improvement 3aheritability 3alactation 3amilk 3amodels 3avariance 0afunctional trait 0agenetic correlation 0aheritability 0amilkability1 aBignardi, A.

To make a comparison we have also shown the formation of such stable vesicles using a common cationic surfactant, benzyldimethylhexadecylammonium chloride (BHDC) which has a similar alkyl chain length but different headgroup region to that of [C₁₆mim]Cl. It has been revealed from dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and other optical spectroscopic techniques that the micelles of [C₁₆mim]Cl and BHDC in aqueous solutions transform into stable unilamellar vesicles upon increasing concentration of cholesterol. We find that, as the concentration of cholesterol increases, the solvation and rotational relaxation time of C153 in [C₁₆mim]Cl/cholesterol solution as well as in BHDC/cholesterol solution gradually increases indicating a significant decrease in the hydration behavior around the self-assemblies upon micelle–vesicle transition. However, the extent of increase in solvation and rotational relaxation time is more prominent in the case of [C₁₆mim]Cl/cholesterol solutions than in the BHDC/cholesterol system. This indicates that [C₁₆mim]Cl/cholesterol vesicular membranes are comparatively less hydrated and more rigid than the BHDC/cholesterol vesicular bilayer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acationic surfactants 3achlorides 3acholesterol 3aionic liquids 3alight scattering 3amicelles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphysical chemistry 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aKuchlyan, Jagannath1 aGhosh, Surajit1 aBanerjee, Chiranjib1 aKundu, Niloy1 aBanik, Debasis1 aSarkar, Nilmoni0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 June 05, v. 118, no. 22 p.5913-5923dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp501033n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01502naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245009700159300001800256520049200274592002800766650001100794650001300805650002100818650001300839650001400852650001900866650001200885650001100897700001900908700001900927773013100946856007801077852000901155655001201164IND60541020720221122062653.0160820e20150527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054102072DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b028782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Sung Ki10aElectrochemical Vapor Deposition of Semiconductors from Gas Phase with a Solid Membrane Cell  ap. 6638-6642.  aWe demonstrate the feasibility of semiconductor deposition via the electrochemical reduction of gaseous precursors by the use of an anhydrous proton-conducting membrane, the solid acid CsHSO₄, at 165 °C.

Inhalation of conidia can result in pulmonary histoplasmosis and, in some cases, causes severe disseminated disease and death. This fungus is an ascomycete that has an anamorphic or asexual stage and a teleomorphic or sexual stage, known as Ajellomyces capsulatus, which results from (+) and (−) mating types. Sexual reproduction is regulated by a specialized genomic region known as the mating-type (MAT1) locus. The mating process in this heterothallic species is represented by isolates that contain only one of the two different MAT1 locus idiomorphs (MAT1-1 or MAT1-2) that have unrelated sequences encoding different transcription factors. In medically important dimorphic pathogens and in most ascomycete molds, one MAT locus idiomorph encodes a high-mobility-group (HMG) box-domain transcription factor, and the other idiomorph encodes an alpha-box domain transcription factor. There is scarce molecular information about H. capsulatum mating type although recombinant population structures have been reported that could occur in nature and this process has been documented in distinct models such as parasites and other fungi. In this review, we shall focus on published studies on H. capsulatum sexuality, and outline the distribution of the two H. capsulatum mating types in Latin America.This manuscript is part of the series of works presented at the “V International Workshop: Molecular genetic approaches to the study of human pathogenic fungi” (Oaxaca, Mexico, 2012).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAjellomyces 3aHistoplasma capsulatum 3aanamorphs 3aanimal pathogenic fungi 3abreathing 3aconidia 3adeath 3agenomics 3ahistoplasmosis 3aloci 3amating types 3amodels 3aparasites 3asexual reproduction 3asoil 3ateleomorphs 3atranscription factors 0aHistoplasma capsulatum 0aMAT1 locus 0aIdiomorphs 0aGenetic diversity 0aLatin America 0aHistoplasma capsulatum 0aMAT1 locus 0aIdiomorfos 0aDiversidad genética 0aSudamérica1 aSousa, Carolina Nascimento1 aEvangelista Oliveira, Manoel Marques1 aPizzini, Claudia Vera1 aAlmeida, Marcos Abreu1 aRodríguez-Arellanes, Gabriela1 aTaylor, María Lucía,1 aZancopé-Oliveira, Rosely Maria0 tRevista iberoamericana de micología.g2014 Jan.,  Mar., v. 31, no. 1 p.7-10dElsevier EspanaaRevista Iberoamericana de MicologíawJournal:12421x1130-14067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.riam.2013.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005700155245022500212300001600437520125700453592002801710650002501738650002701763650003001790650001701820650001301837650001401850650001301864650002501877653003501902653002301937653002101960653002201981653002902003700002202032700001902054773007702073856008902150852000902239655001202248IND60570912920221120160855.0170709e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057091292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEndo, Satoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8702-160210aComparing polyethylene and polyoxymethylene passive samplers for measuring sediment porewater concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls: Mutual validation and possible correction by polymer-polymer partition experiment  ap. 358-365.  aTwo sediment passive samplers, polyethylene (PE) and polyoxymethylene (POM), were compared and mutually validated for measuring freely dissolved concentrations (Cfree) of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in sediment porewater. PE and POM strips in commonly used dimensions (30 and 76 μm in thickness, respectively) were exposed to sediment slurries for 28 d. The Cfree values calculated using literature polymer-water partition coefficients were consistently higher for PE than for POM by a factor of 2 on average. Time series experiments over 96 d show that 28 d are sufficient for attaining partition equilibrium of PCBs for PE, whereas even 96 d may not be enough for POM. To gain additional insight, POM and PE strips were co-exposed to bovine serum albumin suspension spiked with PCBs. The POM/PE concentration ratios increased over 56 d, and the ratios at 28 d were in agreement with the POM-to-PE ratios of PCB concentrations from the 28-d sediment slurry experiments. This agreement suggests that the use of apparent POM-water partition coefficients (i.e., non-equilibrium concentration ratios) suitable for a 28-d exposure to sediment slurries may correct the non-attainment of equilibrium and could provide more accurate Cfree values.  aPublisher supplied data 3abovine serum albumin 3apartition coefficients 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolyethylene 3asamplers 3asediments 3aslurries 3atime series analysis 0aFreely dissolved concentration 0aSediment porewater 0aPassive sampling 0aSorption kinetics 0aEquilibrium partitioning1 aYabuki, Yoshinori1 aTanaka, Shuhei0 tChemosphere.g2017 Oct., v. 184 p.358-365dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03437naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245010500175300001400280520159300294592002801887650001701915650001801932650001601950650001801966650001601984650002102000650001602021650001302037650002602050650002402076650001202100650004402112650001102156650003702167650001002204650001802214650002702232650001302259650001802272650001402290650003302304650001502337651001902352653002702371653001402398653001602412653002102428653001802449653002402467700001402491700001902505700002602524700002202550700002002572773012602592856008402718852000902802655001202811IND60531750220221120130034.0180831e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053175022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.12.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZanardini, Elisabetta10aDiversity of archaeal and bacterial communities on exfoliated sandstone from Portchester Castle (UK)  ap. 78-87.  aIn this study exfoliated sandstone samples from Portchester Castle were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersion X-ray (EDX) analyses to observe stone surface colonisation, geomorphological structure and to assess damage. Archaeal and bacterial diversity were assessed using cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent methods. SEM analysis showed that sandstone had high levels of stone decay. There was considerable weathering of the minerals associated with biofilms containing microbes with various cellular morphologies. Microorganisms were especially prevalent in pores, cavities and in the heavily decayed parts of the minerals, and some etching was seen. EDX analyses indicated microbes were associated with the sheet structures of aluminium-containing phyllosilicate minerals, most likely glauconite. Microbial colonisation was preferentially concentrated within specific sheets of the mineral structure. Isolation studies revealed the presence of Bacillus and Arthrobacter that appeared to be well adapted to “extreme” environments, specifically these isolates were tolerant to high salt, high UV and oligotrophic conditions. Cultivation-independent studies using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene fragments showed a more complex community. Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, Deinococcus, α- and β-proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidetes and halophilic Archaea from the family Halobacteriaceae, were the predominant types of Bacteria and Archaea detected respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthrobacter 3aBacteroidetes 3aChloroflexi 3aCyanobacteria 3aDeinococcus 3aHalobacteriaceae 3aX-radiation 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abeta-Proteobacteria 3abiofilm 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agenes 3ageomorphology 3amicrobial colonization 3aminerals 3aribosomal RNA 3asandstone 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aweathering 3aUnited Kingdom 0aStone biodeterioration 0aSandstone 0aExfoliation 0aSEM-EDX analyses 0aDGGE analyses 0aMicrobial diversity1 aMay, Eric1 aInkpen, Robert1 aCappitelli, Francesca1 aMurrell, J.

The status of the plants at that time depends on the degree of injury that occurs during the stress treatment and the repair or tolerance of that injury. The purpose of this research was to evaluate species differences in the degree of initial injury due to heat stress. The incorporation of radio-labeled leucine as an indicator of the net rate of protein synthesis and the efflux of cell solutes from plant tissue sections into distilled water were evaluated immediately after turfgrass shoots or tissue sections were exposed to temperatures in the range of 43 to 51 °C for 30 min. Net protein synthesis in the grasses was very heat labile. Incorporation of radiolabeled leucine declined an average of 69% in plants previously heated at 43 °C compared to plants held at 27 °C. Efflux of cell solutes from the tissue sections did not increase in plants that had been heated to 43, 45, 47, or 49 °C compared to plants held at 25 °C. No significant differences were found between the grasses for the parameters tested. Either disruption of some other physiological process or differential repair or tolerance of the heat stress injury accounted for the heat tolerance rankings of the grasses. Also, the results of this study indicate that indirect rather than direct heat injury is responsible for the behavior of the grasses stressed at the temperatures and exposure periods used in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoa pratensis 3ainterspecific variation 3acultivars 3aLolium perenne 3aPoa annua 0aspecies differences1 aWatschke, T.

F.10aFoetal life protein restriction in male mink (Neovison vison) kits lowers post-weaning protein oxidation and the relative abundance of hepatic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase mRNA  ap. 50-60.  aFoetal life malnutrition has been studied intensively in a number of animal models. Results show that especially foetal life protein malnutrition can lead to metabolic changes later in life. This might be of particular importance for strict carnivores, for example, cat and mink (Neovison vison) because of their higher protein requirement than in other domestic mammals. This study aimed to investigate the effects of low protein provision during foetal life to male mink kits on their protein metabolism during the early post-weaning period of rapid growth and to investigate whether foetal life protein deficiency affects the response to adequate or deficient protein provision post weaning. Further, we intended to study whether the changes in the gene expression of key enzymes in foetal hepatic tissue caused by maternal protein deficiency were manifested post-weaning. A total of 32 male mink kits born to mothers fed either a low-protein diet (LP), that is, 14% of metabolizable energy (ME) from protein (foetal low – FL), n = 16, or an adequate-protein (AP) diet, that is, 29% of ME from protein (foetal adequate – FA), n = 16) in the last 16.3 ± 1.8 days of pregnancy were used. The FL offspring had lower birth weight and lower relative abundance of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Fru-1,6-P2ase) and pyruvate kinase mRNA in foetal hepatic tissue than FA kits. The mothers were fed a diet containing adequate protein until weaning. At weaning (7 weeks of age), half of the kits from each foetal treatment group were fed an AP diet (32% of ME from protein; n = 8 FA and 8 FL) and the other half were fed a LP diet (18% of ME from protein; n = 8 FA and 8 FL) until 9.5 weeks of age, yielding four treatment groups (i.e. FA-AP, FA-LP, FL-AP and FL-LP). Low protein provision in foetal life lowered the protein oxidation post-weaning compared with the controls (P = 0.006), indicating metabolic flexibility and a better ability to conserve protein. This could not, however, be supported by changes in liver mass because of foetal life experience. A lower relative abundance of Fru-1,6-P₂ase mRNA was observed (P < 0.05), being lower in 9.5-week-old FL than in FA kits. It can be concluded that foetal life protein restriction leads to changes in post-weaning protein metabolism through lower protein oxidation of male mink kits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeovison vison 3aanimal models 3abirth weight 3acarnivores 3agene expression regulation 3akwashiorkor 3aliver 3alow protein diet 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolizable energy 3amink 3amothers 3aoxidation 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3aprotein deficiencies 3aprotein metabolism 3aprotein requirement 3apyruvate kinase 3aweaning 0aprotein oxidation 0aprotein restriction 0anitrogen metabolism 0ametabolic flexibility 0aenergy metabolism1 aBlache, D.1 aThomsen, P.

This study examines the heterogeneity of Australian consumer preferences related to fresh pork cues. Using best–worst scaling, we examine the importance of 15 intrinsic and 31 extrinsic product attributes to 196 Australian consumers. Findings reveal that taste, succulence and the smell of boar taint were the most important intrinsic cues, while animal welfare and naturalness were the most important extrinsic cues. Based on the importance of intrinsic cues, four segments were identified, namely boar taint haters, lean meat eaters, colour lovers and cuts and size matters. Four segments based on extrinsic cues were identified as animal and environment lovers, naturalness lovers, demanding buyers and utilitarian buyers. This study contributes significantly to the industry by offering granular insights with respect to Australian consumer demands and optimal communication of cues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3aanimals 3aboar taint 3acolor 3alean meat 3apork 3apork industry 3asmell 3ataste 0aPork attribute 0aAustralian consumer 0aBest-worst scaling 0aConsumer segment 0aPork consumption trends 0aHierarchical clustering1 aSung, Billy1 aLee, Sean1 aEaston, Julia0 tMeat science.g2022 Nov., v. 193 p.108954-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2022.1089543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012800169300001400297520146600311592002801777650001501805650002401820650001701844650001201861653001701873653002401890653002701914653003401941653003001975773011202005856008502117852000902202655001202211IND60481045520221117180845.0160201e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048104552DNAL7 a10.1080/09715010.2015.10435972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNatarajan, N.10aEffect of distance-dependent and time-dependent dispersion on non-linearly sorbed multispecies contaminants in porous media  ap. 16-29.  aIn this study, the effect of distance-dependent and time-dependent dispersion coefficient on the transport of multispecies contaminants subjected to Freundlich non-linear adsorption in porous media has been analyzed. An implicit finite difference has been used to develop the numerical model. A constant continuous source of first species contaminant has been assumed at the inlet of the porous domain. The results obtained from distance-dependent and time-dependent dispersion coefficient has been compared with that obtained using constant dispersion coefficient for different fluid velocities and dispersivity–distance ratios. The first species of the multispecies transport is subjected to Freundlich non-linear sorption. Sensitivity analysis has been conducted to study the effect of different simulation time, fluid velocities, sorption exponent, and dispersivity–distance ratio on solute transport mechanism within the porous media. Results suggest that the effect of distance-dependent dispersion coefficient on multispecies contaminant movement is negligible when the fluid velocity is very low. The fluid velocity has a significant impact on the multispecies solute movement when non-linear sorption and distance-dependent dispersion coefficient are considered. The effect of variation of the Freundlich sorption exponent on contaminant concentration is negligible when distance-dependent and time-dependent dispersion coefficients are considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3amathematical models 3aporous media 3asolutes 0aporous media 0anon-linear sorption 0amultispecies transport 0adistance-dependent dispersion 0atime-dependent dispersion0 tISH journal of hydraulic engineering.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 22, no. 1 p.16-29dTaylor & Francisx2164-30407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09715010.2015.10435973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245011100180520099200291592002801283650002501311650001101336650001601347650001701363650001401380650001101394650001201405650001701417650002101434650001701455651001101472653001901483653002301502653002101525653001201546653001601558700002801574700002301602700001901625773009501644856008601739852000901825655001201834IND60791371720221123040405.0220914e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079137172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2022.1089552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorradini, Annafrancesca10aConsumers' perceptions and attitudes toward hunted wild game meat in the modern world: A literature review  aHunted wild game meat (HWGM) has a complete nutritional profile, and its environmental impact is lower than farmed meat. However, HWGM derives from hunting, which often relates to consumers' ethical concerns. This review aims to clarify which variables are linked to consumers' perceptions and attitudes toward HWGM. Results highlight that the body of literature about this topic is growing, especially in Europe and U.S. Moreover, gender and residence seem to be good predictors of consumers' perceptions and attitudes toward HWGM. Furthermore, some positive drivers were detected. The positive attitude toward hunting and familiarity with hunting resulted to be linked to HWGM consumption. Conversely, food safety consumers' concerns represent one of the main barriers. Finally, the seasonality of the product and the relative lack of HWGM market supply represent barriers to its consumption. Our findings may assist stakeholders in defining targeted marketing strategies and policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental impact 3aethics 3afood safety 3agame animals 3agame meat 3agender 3amarkets 3ameat science 3anutrient content 3astakeholders 3aEurope 0aWild game meat 0aConsumer attitudes 0aHunting activity 0aHunters 0aFood choice1 aMarescotti, Maria Elena1 aDemartini, Eugenio1 aGaviglio, Anna0 tMeat science.g2022 Dec., v. 194 p.108955-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2022.1089553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245011000175520162600285592002801911650004401939650001101983650001701994650003502011650001202046650001402058650001802072650001502090650001302105650001702118650001602135650003402151650002102185650001302206650002502219653002802244653004202272653004602314653001802360700001702378700002502395773010602420856008702526852000902613655001202622IND60678576920221122174357.0200210e20200220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067857692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1243082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKohli, Himanshu P.10aCharacterization and stability study of pseudo-emulsion hollow fiber membrane: Separation of Ethylparaben  aEthylparaben (EP), being one of the members of parabens family is an endocrine disrupting compound. Despite their efficient elimination in waste water treatment plants, parabens are still noticed in river waters. Studies were conducted by Pseudo-emulsion hollow fiber strip dispersion (PEHFSD) system using pseudo-emulsion comprised of Trioctylamine (carrier), n-heptane (solvent) and Na₂CO₃ (strippant) for EP elimination from aqueous feed phase. Influence of different operational factors like concentration of feed, carrier and stripping phase were studied for EP removal. 100% removal of EP was achieved by PEHFSD system. Permeability studies were conducted and mass transfer coefficient for aqueous and membrane phase were also evaluated at optimum conditions. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the bonding and existence of various functional groups in the membrane phase. Field emission scanning electron microscope revealed the pores on hollow fiber membrane surface. Droplet size distribution and backscattering profile of pseudo-emulsion at different impeller speed indicated instability of pseudo-emulsion and concentrated EP can be easily recovered. Multiple runs conducted with fresh feed solution and fresh pseudo-emulsion showed 100% removal of EP for five runs which indicated stability of membrane phase within the micropores for longer time. The recyclability of pseudo-emulsion phase was also studied by contacting the fresh feed with the previously used pseudo-emulsion phase. It was observed that removal of EP was 100%, 73% and 43% for 1ˢᵗ, 2ⁿᵈ and 3ʳᵈ run respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aamines 3adroplet size 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aheptane 3aimpellers 3amass transfer 3amicropores 3amoieties 3apermeability 3ariver water 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asodium carbonate 3asolvents 3awastewater treatment 0aEthylparaben separation 0aPseudo-emulsion hollow fiber membrane 0aBackscattering profile of pseudo-emulsion 0aMultiple runs1 aGupta, Smita1 aChakraborty, Mousumi0 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Feb. 20, v. 587 p.124308-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1243083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245015000163300002000313520142800333592002801761650002001789650001901809650001601828650003301844650002501877650002301902650001501925650001001940650001701950650001901967650002401986650001302010650001302023650002602036650001102062650002502073700001702098700001402115700001502129700001802144700001602162700001302178700005502191773014302246856007902389852000902468655001202477IND60614597520221118210725.0181002e20180910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061459752DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b025992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yunpeng10aGenome-Centered Metagenomics Analysis Reveals the Symbiotic Organisms Possessing Ability to Cross-Feed with Anammox Bacteria in Anammox Consortia  ap. 11285-11296.  aAlthough using anammox communities for efficient wastewater treatment has attracted much attention, the pure anammox bacteria are difficult to obtain, and the potential roles of symbiotic bacteria in anammox performance are still elusive. Here, we combined long-term reactor operation, genome-centered metagenomics, community functional structure, and metabolic pathway reconstruction to reveal multiple potential cross-feedings during anammox reactor start-up according to the 37 recovered metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). We found Armatimonadetes and Proteobacteria could contribute the secondary metabolites molybdopterin cofactor and folate for anammox bacteria to benefit their activity and growth. Chloroflexi-affiliated bacteria encoded the function of biosynthesizing exopolysaccharides for anammox consortium aggregation, based on the partial nucleotide sugars produced by anammox bacteria. Chlorobi-affiliated bacteria had the ability to degrade extracellular proteins produced by anammox bacteria to amino acids to affect consortium aggregation. Additionally, the Chloroflexi-affiliated bacteria harbored genes for a nitrite loop and could have a dual role in anammox performance during reactor start-up. Cross-feeding in anammox community adds a different dimension for understanding microbial interactions and emphasizes the importance of symbiotic bacteria in the anammox process for wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArmatimonadetes 3aProteobacteria 3aamino acids 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abiochemical pathways 3aexopolysaccharides 3afolic acid 3agenes 3ametagenomics 3amicrosymbionts 3anitrifying bacteria 3anitrites 3aproteins 3asecondary metabolites 3asugars 3awastewater treatment1 aLiu, Shufeng1 aJiang, Bo1 aFeng, Ying1 aZhu, Tingting1 aTao, Huchun1 aTang, Xi1 aLiu, Sitong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6849-87040 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Sept. 10, v. 52, no. 19 p.11285-11296dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b025993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245013500166300001400301520145300315592002801768650001801796650002001814650001701834650001801851650002601869650001601895650002201911650001301933650002301946650001401969650002201983650001102005653002402016653002702040653002402067653003002091653002002121653002102141700005802162700001502220700001702235700002202252700002002274773012602294856008402420852000902504655001202513IND60531750620221121011957.0180831e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053175062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2016.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhan, Hop V.10aBacterial community dynamics in an anoxic-aerobic membrane bioreactor – Impact on nutrient and trace organic contaminant removal  ap. 61-72.  aThe bacterial community in different redox regimes of an anoxic-aerobic MBR under different operating conditions was investigated using pyrosequencing. With internal recirculation (IR) between the anoxic and aerobic reactors, the bacterial communities in these reactors were highly similar in structure and phylogenetic relationship, indicating IR as a key driving force shaping the bacterial communities that are responsible for the core function in the system. Without IR, each redox condition sustained the growth of distinct bacterial communities according to their oxygen requirement, and the anoxic community presented a low capacity of nutrient and trace organic contaminant (TrOC) removal. Higher bacterial diversity under longer sludge retention time (SRT) was evident; however, except for a few TrOCs, removal efficiency of TOC, TN and TrOCs were the same irrespective of the SRT. The presence of TrOCs induced shifts in bacterial communities, and a correlation between bacterial communities and TrOC transformation was noted. The important candidates for TrOC biotransformation were the taxa within Proteobacteria, particularly Methylophilales and Myxococcales. Other bacterial groups potentially contributing to TrOC biotransformation were those related to nitrogen removal, such as Rhodocyclales and Plantomycetes. In contrast, the detected members of Cytophagaceae (Bacteroidetes) appeared not to contribute to TrOC biotransformation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCytophagaceae 3aMethylophilales 3aMyxococcales 3aRhodocyclales 3abacterial communities 3abioreactors 3abiotransformation 3anitrogen 3aoxygen requirement 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3asludge 0aBacterial community 0aInternal recirculation 0aMembrane bioreactor 0aTrace organic contaminant 0aRedox condition 0aNutrient removal1 aHai, Faisal I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0480-43431 aZhang, Ren1 aKang, Jinguo1 aPrice, William E.1 aNghiem, Long D.0 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2016 Apr., v. 109 p.61-72dElsevier LtdwJournal:12418x0964-83057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2016.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02294naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245006400169520101800233592002801251650001001279650001201289650000701301650000901308650001701317650002701334650001601361653001701377653001501394653001001409653000701419653001501426700001601441700001901457700001901476700002001495700001401515700001501529700001401544700001801558700001201576700001601588700001801604773009501622856008601717852000901803655001201812IND60791371920221123040335.0220906e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079137192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2022.1089582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaniels, R.P.10aReduced scald time does not influence ultimate pork quality  aFresh pork color is a function of pigment, and the pH and temperature conditions in the carcass postmortem. To explore the role of scald on color development, carcasses (n = 16) were subjected to either a 4- or 8-min scald. Semimembranosus (SM) muscle samples were collected before and after scalding, and at 24 h postmortem. A 50% reduction in scald time resulted in lighter color (L*) across the muscle early postmortem (P < 0.001), yet the 8-min scald treatment was lighter (P = 0.001) at 24 h. An interaction between scald time and sampling time showed in an increase in L* values at 4-min immediately following scald (P < 0.001). Two-hundred carcasses were then subjected to a modified scald time (6.5 min, or 7.5 min) in an industrial setting. Lowering scald time failed to recapitulate results. In fact, darker meat (L* value; P = 0.0166) was noted in the SM across longer scalds. These data suggest modest changes in scald time may not be responsible for changes in pork quality development.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3amuscles 3apH 3apork 3apork quality 3asemimembranosus muscle 3atemperature 0aPork quality 0aScald time 0aColor 0apH 0aTwo-toning1 aWicks, J.C.1 aZumbaugh, M.D.1 aMatarneh, S.K.1 aVenhuizen, M.D.1 aElgin, J.1 aBodmer, J.1 aYen, C.N.1 aEl-Kadi, S.W.1 aShi, H.1 aSilva, S.L.1 aGerrard, D.E.0 tMeat science.g2022 Dec., v. 194 p.108958-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2022.1089583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02104naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011100166300001600277520097100293592002801264650001301292650003001305650001501335650004301350650002201393700002001415700002001435700001901455700002001474700001801494700002101512773013101533856008101664852000901745655001201754IND60579855720221118012048.0170902e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057985572DNAL7 a10.1134/S106235901705003X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvdonin, P.

We have found that H₂O₂ at a non-toxic concentration (100 μM) increases the amount of vWF secreted by HUVEC by 43 ± 14% over control (p < 0.03) and elevates total exposition of vWF on cell surface by 89 ± 5% (p < 0.01). Analysis of immunofluorescent images of HUVEC with CellProfiler program revealed that the average number of antigen positive structures on the single cell surface increases from 11.4 ± 0.16 in control up to 17.5 ± 0.21 after incubation with H₂O₂ (p < 0.01). vWF is exposed on the cell surface as dots with the average sizes around 1–3 μm. H₂O₂ causes an increase in the number of these dots and the appearence of the strings of vWF which are absent in control HUVEC. It is suggested that H₂O₂ may serve as a messenger which stimulates vWF exocytosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3ablood coagulation factors 3aexocytosis 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahydrogen peroxide1 aTsitrina, A.

The excess molar volumes (Vᴱ), deviation in isentropic compressibilities (Δκₛ), deviation in viscosities (Δη) and deviation in refractive indices (ΔnD) are calculated from experimental values and are correlated by Redlich–Kister polynomial equations. The Vᴱ and Δκₛ values for the aforesaid systems are negative over the entire composition range while the Δη and ΔnD values are positive under the same experimental conditions. The intermolecular interactions and structural effects were analyzed on the basis of measured and derived properties. A qualitative analysis of the results is discussed in terms of the ion-dipole, ion-pair interactions and hydrogen bonding between ILs and water. Furthermore, the hydrogen bonding features between ILs with water were analyzed by using a molecular modeling program with the help of HyperChem7.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aaqueous solutions 3aatmospheric pressure 3aequations 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen bonding 3aionic liquids 3amolecular models 3aqualitative analysis 3arefractive index 3asulfates 3aultrasonics 3aviscosity1 aAttri, Pankaj1 aVenkatesu, Pannuru0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 June 05, v. 118, no. 22 p.5971-5982dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp502400z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012100166520172900287592002802016650002802044650002502072650002402097650001702121650001202138650001202150650001302162650002002175650001702195650000902212650001502221650001902236650002402255650001802279650001902297651001002316653003302326653002902359653002802388653001502416653002602431700001702457700001602474700001602490700001902506700001102525700001502536700001302551700001202564773008702576856008502663852000902748655001202757IND60791372120221117165633.0221004e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079137212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2022.1065872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenqing10aSoil depth determine the ecological stoichiometry of soil aggregates after returning ancient rice terraces to forest  aSoil carbon-nitrogen-phosphorus (CNP) ecological stoichiometry is an effective means of reflecting soil nutrient status, transformations, and limitations, but the effect of returning ancient rice terraces to forest on soil CNP stoichiometry is still unclear at the aggregate scale in the subtropical hilly areas of southern China. This study explored how the CNP content and stoichiometry of soil water-stable aggregates responded after returning ancient rice terraces to forest in the soil layer depth of 0–60 cm in subtropical hilly areas. The results showed that the stability, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), C/P, and N/P ratios of soil aggregates decreased significantly with soil depth in ancient rice terraces, Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata), and moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens). The proportion of macroaggregates decreased gradually and the proportion of microaggregates increased significantly after the soil depth increased. Returning ancient rice terraces to Chinese fir was more conducive to increasing the SOC, TN, C/P, and N/P ratios of soil aggregates, which may be related to plant litter biomass. Eta squared analysis showed that soil depth had a greater impact on soil aggregate stability (34 %, 38 %, and 46 %), CNP content (34 %–45 %), and stoichiometry (34 %–57 %) than land use types and their interactions. These findings indicated that returning ancient rice terraces to Chinese fir and moso bamboo can significantly alter soil water-stable aggregate stability, CNP content, and stoichiometry, and soil depth plays an extremely important role in changing them. Future research should focus on the ecological impacts of soil depth on agroforestry ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCunninghamia lanceolata 3aPhyllostachys edulis 3aaggregate stability 3aagroforestry 3abiomass 3acatenas 3aland use 3amicroaggregates 3aplant litter 3arice 3asoil depth 3asoil nutrients 3asoil organic carbon 3astoichiometry 3atotal nitrogen 3aChina 0aReturning farmland to forest 0aEcological stoichiometry 0aWater-stable aggregates 0aSoil depth 0aAncient rice terraces1 aShen, Faxing1 aLiu, Yaojun1 aLi, Zhongwu1 aJiang, Jinfeng1 aLi, Qi1 aZheng, Han1 aWang, Xi1 aWu, Jin0 tCatena.g2022 Dec., v. 219 p.106587-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.1065873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003300148245007000181300001400251520137600265592002801641650002101669650002501690650002801715650001601743650001401759650002001773650001801793650002601811650001101837650001401848650004301862653001201905653001501917653001901932653001401951653001201965653001501977653003101992653001802023700002802041700002802069700002802097773016902125856008202294852000902376655001202385IND60601607220180918000000.0180706e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060160722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.riam.2013.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez Alvarez, José A.,14aThe immune response against Candida spp. and Sporothrix schenckii  ap. 62-66.  aCandida albicans is the main causative agent of systemic candidiasis, a condition with high mortality rates. The study of the interaction between C. albicans and immune system components has been thoroughly studied and nowadays there is a model for the anti-C. albicans immune response; however, little is known about the sensing of other pathogenic species of the Candida genus. Sporothrix schenckii is the causative agent of sporotrichosis, a subcutaneous mycosis, and thus far there is limited information about its interaction with the immune system. In this paper, we review the most recent information about the immune sensing of species from genus Candida and S. schenckii. Thoroughly searches in scientific journal databases were performed, looking for papers addressing either Candida- or Sporothrix-immune system interactions. There is a significant advance in the knowledge of non-C. albicans species of Candida and Sporothrix immune sensing; however, there are still relevant points to address, such as the specific contribution of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) for sensing by different immune cells and the immune receptors involved in such interactions.This manuscript is part of the series of works presented at the “V International Workshop: Molecular genetic approaches to the study of human pathogenic fungi” (Oaxaca, Mexico, 2012).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aSporothrix schenckii 3aanimal pathogenic fungi 3acandidiasis 3adatabases 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3aimmunologic receptors 3amodels 3amortality 3apathogen-associated molecular patterns 0aCandida 0aSporothrix 0aImmune sensing 0aCell wall 0aCandida 0aSporothrix 0aReconocimiento inmunitario 0aPared celular1 aPérez-García, Luis A.1 aFlores-Carreón, Arturo1 aMora-Montes, Héctor M.0 tRevista iberoamericana de micología.g2014 Jan.,  Mar., v. 31, no. 1 p.62-66dElsevier EspanaaRevista Iberoamericana de MicologíawJournal:12421x1130-14067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.riam.2013.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002800112245008300140300001600223506002800239520111000267592002801377506003701405650002201442650002801464650002101492650001601513650000901529650001901538650002001557650001601577653001701593653002201610653002101632653002201653700002301675700002101698700002001719700002601739700002301765700002901788773020401817852000902021655001202030IND60773890820221207065644.0220329e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077389082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVargas, Carolina Boeira10aBariatric surgery induces positive changes in Body composition in older adults  ap. 301-309.  aResource is Open Access  aThe number of older adults have increased considerably in the last years, as well as the number of obese older adults is also on the rise. Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in body composition of older adults after 3, 6, and 12 months of bariatric surgery. Materials and Methods: A historical cohort of 35 older adults (62.35±1.47 years) who underwent bariatric surgery took part in this study. Body composition was analyzed by bioelectrical impedance. Data regarding physical activity and diet profile were also analyzed. Results: There was a significant reduction in body weight and fat percentage after the surgery, and skeletal muscle mass showed stabilization 6 months after the surgery. Forty-eight percent of the participants adhered to a combination of aerobic and resistance training and to a higher protein intake after the surgery. Conclusion: We believe that our main finding was the maintenance of lean muscle mass despite the weight reduction after the surgery and that this was associated with the combination of resistance training and the increase in protein intake.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abariatric surgery 3abioelectrical impedance 3abody composition 3abody weight 3adiet 3aprotein intake 3askeletal muscle 3aweight loss 0aolder adults 0abariatric surgery 0abody composition 0aphysical training1 aPicolli, Francine 1 aRossoni, Carina 1 aDani, Caroline 1 aMottin, Claudio Corá1 aMachado, Ana Paula1 aBaptista, Rafael Reimann0 tRevista brasileira de obesidade, nutrição e emagrecimento.g2022 Mar., v. 15, no. 93 p.301-309dInstituto Brasileiro de Pesquisa e Ensino em Fisiologia do ExercíciowJournal:27930x1981-99197nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010300168300001400271520110300285592002801388650002601416650002301442650001301465650002801478650002001506650002801526650002701554650000901581650001301590650000901603650001901612650001101631650000901642650001501651650001901666650002001685650001201705650001801717653002901735653001301764653002301777653002301800700001301823700001801836700001601854700001701870773009801887856008501985852000902070655001202079IND60546442720221119022843.0160903e20151015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054644272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Zhiyuan10aFate of Escherichia coli O157: H7 in agricultural soils amended with different organic fertilizers  ap. 30-36.  aFive organic fertilizers (vermicompost, pig manure, chicken manure, peat and oil residue) were applied to agricultural soils to study their effects on the survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7). Results showed that E. coli O157:H7 survival changed greatly after organic fertilizers application, with shorter td values (survival time needed to reach the detection limit of 100CFUg−1) (12.57±6.57 days) in soils amended with chicken manure and the longest (25.65±7.12 days) in soils amended with pig manure. Soil pH, EC and free Fe/Al (hydro) oxides were significant explanatory factors for E. coli O157:H7 survival in the original soils. Soil constituents (minerals and organic matter) and changes in their surface charges with pH increased the effect of soil pH on E. coli O157:H7 survival. However, electrical conductivity played a more important role in regulating E. coli O157:H7 survival in fertilizer-amended soils. This study highlighted the importance of choosing appropriate organic fertilizers in the preharvest environment to reduce food-borne bacterial contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aagricultural soils 3aaluminum 3abacterial contamination 3adetection limit 3aelectrical conductivity 3afertilizer application 3airon 3aminerals 3aoils 3aorganic matter 3aoxides 3apeat 3apig manure 3apoultry manure 3asoil amendments 3asoil pH 3avermicomposts 0aEscherichia coli O157:H7 0aSurvival 0aOrganic fertilizer 0aAgricultural soils1 aYang, Li1 aWang, Haizhen1 aWu, Jianjun1 aXu, Jianming0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 296 p.30-36dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100002000160245011300180300001400293500000900307520139400316592002801710650001601738650001401754650002401768650000701792650001601799650000901815650002401824650001501848650001301863700002301876773012001899852000902019856009702028655001202125IND8402325020221121222248.0191122e198401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND840232502DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1984.00021962007600010021x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvans, Lance S.10aComparison of Experimental Designs Used to Detect Changes in Yields of Crops Exposed to Acidic Precipitation  ap. 81-84.  aepub  aA comparison of experimental designs used to detect changes in yield of crops exposed to simulated acidic rain was performed. Seed yields were determined from field-grown soybeans (Glycine max L.) exposed to simulated rainfalls in which all ambient rainfalls were excluded by automatically moveable rainfall exclusion shelters. When all eight, 4 ✕ 4 , latin squares were used, simulated rainfalls of pH 4.1,3.3, and 2.7 exhibited yields 10.6,16.8, and 23.9%, respectively, below yields of plants exposed to pH 5.6. The linear component of pH treatment differences showed a highly significant decrease in yield (p < 0.001). The eight latin squares analyzed as individual experiments yielded erratic conclusions. However, when all eight latin squares were combined a satisfactory evaluation can be made. The low probability value for differences among latin squares (p < 0.005) indicates that field locations are a legitimate source of stratification. Sources of variation are also highly significant for both pooled among rows within squares (p = 0.0028) and the pooled among columns within squares (p = 0.0168) indicating that the two stratifications within each latin square was doubly effective in reducing the residual error term. The relative efficiency of the latin square to a randomized complete block design, and a completely randomized design was 132-146 and 162%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aacid rain 3aexperimental design 3apH 3aprobability 3arain 3arainfall simulation 3aseed yield 3asoybeans1 aThompson, Keith H.0 tAgronomy journal.g1984 Jan., v. 76, no. 1 p.81-84dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1984.00021962007600010021x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02857naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005500145245011800200300002000318520149000338592002801828650001101856650000801867650001501875650001601890650001501906650001501921650001301936650001401949650001501963650002001978650001301998650001302011650002102024650001602045700001502061700002002076700001702096700001202113700005402125773014302179856008002322852000902402655001202411IND60614597920221118210726.0181020e20180907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061459792DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b028522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Renyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1943-940310aHybrid Hydrogel with High Water Vapor Harvesting Capacity for Deployable Solar-Driven Atmospheric Water Generator  ap. 11367-11377.  aThe Earth’s atmosphere holds approximately 12 900 billion tons of fresh water distributed all over the world with fast replenishment. Atmospheric water harvesting is emerging as a promising strategy for clean water production in arid regions, land-locked areas, and remote communities. The water vapor sorbent is the key component for atmospheric water harvesting devices based on absorbing-releasing process. In this work, a flexible hybrid photothermal water sorbent composed of deliquescent salt and hydrogel was rationally fabricated. It possesses superior water sorption capacity even in low humidity air thanks to the deliquescent salt and maintains a solid form after it sorbs a large amount of water owing to the hydrogel platform. The harvested water could be easily released under regular sunlight via the photothermal effect, and it can be directly reused without noticeable capacity fading. An “easy-to-assemble-at-household” prototype device with 35 g of the dry hydrogel was tested outdoors under field conditions and delivered 20 g of fresh water within 2.5 h under natural sunlight. It is estimated that the material cost of making such a device to supply minimum daily water consumption for an adult (i.e., 3 kg) is only $3.20 (USD). This type of atmospheric water generator (AWG) is cheap and affordable, works perfectly with a broad range of humidity, does not need any electricity, and thus is especially suitable for clean water production in remote areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aair 3aarid zones 3aelectricity 3afreshwater 3aharvesting 3ahumidity 3ahydrogels 3aprototypes 3asolar radiation 3asorbents 3asorption 3awater harvesting 3awater vapor1 aShi, Yusuf1 aAlsaedi, Mossab1 aWu, Mengchun1 aShi, Le1 aWang, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0856-08650 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Sept. 07, v. 52, no. 19 p.11367-11377dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b028523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005400155245017300209500002200382520140400404592002801808650002301836650002101859650001501880650001901895650002001914650001301934650001301947650001101960650001901971650001301990650001302003650001602016653001602032653002102048653002302069653002302092653003502115700002002150700001302170700001502183700002702198773005602225856008902281852000902370655001202379IND60570913820221120114813.0170709s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057091382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Siqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2160-473810aAdsorptive removal of sulfate from acid mine drainage by polypyrrole modified activated carbons: Effects of polypyrrole deposition protocols and activated carbon source  aPre-press version  aPolypyrrole modified activated carbon was used to remove sulfate from acid mine drainage water. The polypyrrole modified activated carbon created positively charged functionality that offered elevated sorption capacity for sulfate. The effects of the activated carbon type, approach of polymerization, preparation temperature, solvent, and concentration of oxidant solution over the sulfate adsorption capacity were studied at an array of initial sulfate concentrations. A hardwood based activated carbon was the more favorable activated carbon template, and this offered better sulfate removal than when using bituminous based activated carbon or oak wood activated carbon as the template. The hardwood-based activated carbon modified with polypyrrole removed 44.7 mg/g sulfate, and this was five times higher than for the pristine hardwood-based activated carbon. Various protocols for depositing the polypyrrole onto the activated carbon were investigated. When ferric chloride was used as an oxidant, the deposition protocol that achieved the most N+ atomic percent (3.35%) while also maintaining the least oxygen atomic percent (6.22%) offered the most favorable sulfate removal. For the rapid small scale column tests, when processing the AMD water, hardwood-based activated carbon modified with poly pyrrole exhibited 33 bed volume compared to the 5 bed volume of pristine activated carbons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid mine drainage 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3adrainage water 3aferric chloride 3ahardwood 3aoxidants 3aoxygen 3apolymerization 3asolvents 3asulfates 3atemperature 0aPolypyrrole 0aActivated carbon 0aSulfate adsorption 0aAcid mine drainage 0aRapid small scale column tests1 aCannon, Fred S.1 aHou, Pin1 aByrne, Tim1 aNieto Delgado, César,0 tChemosphere.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245010000173300001500273520129300288592002801581650001701609650002201626650001201648650001901660650003001679650001301709650001401722650001501736653003401751653002001785653001901805653001801824653002101842653001301863700005901876773012701935856008402062852000902146655001202155IND60531751120221117175154.0180831e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053175112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2016.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadhi, Susant Kumar10aBenzene control from waste gas streams with a sponge-medium based rotating biological contactor  ap. 96-103.  aRotating biological contactors (RBCs) are low-cost, efficient and an eco-friendly volatile organics control technique. In this study, a state-of-art disk-based RBC has been modified to a drum-based with sponge supporting medium and its performance at different inlet loading rates (ILR) of gaseous benzene, and its effect on elimination capacity (EC) and removal efficiency (RE) have been investigated. The results showed that the RE remained over 90% up to the ILR of about 8 g m⁻³ h⁻¹, and decreased to about 80% with the further increase in ILR. The EC reached maximum to about 45 g m⁻³ h⁻¹ at a benzene load of about 69 g m⁻³ h⁻¹. The EC of benzene increased with the increase in loading rate, but the RE showed an opposite trend. The production of carbon dioxide, which determines the degree of pollutant degradability, also increased with the increase in EC. Along with benzene the nutrients (NH3–N and PO4–P) from liquid phase also got removed in RBC, which shows its potential application in industries. Furthermore, a potential benzene degrader was tentatively identified as genera Enterobacter. The maximum biodegradation rate (rmax) and half saturation constant (Ks) were determined as 21.46 g m⁻³ h⁻¹ and 1.71 g m⁻³, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacter 3aammonium nitrogen 3abenzene 3abiodegradation 3acarbon dioxide production 3aindustry 3anutrients 3apollutants 0aRotating biological contactor 0aGaseous benzene 0aBiodegradation 0aSponge medium 0aEnterobacter sp. 0aKinetics1 aGokhale, Sharad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8707-78680 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2016 Apr., v. 109 p.96-103dElsevier LtdwJournal:12418x0964-83057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2016.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010200172300001400274520113600288592002801424650001301452650001301465650002801478650001601506650002701522650002201549650001101571650001001582653003201592653000801624653001601632653001701648700002501665773011201690856008501802852000901887655001201896IND60481046220221117162322.0160201e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048104622DNAL7 a10.1080/09715010.2015.10801262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCyriac, Rosemary10aOptimization of pumping policy using coupled finite element-particle swarm optimization modelling  ap. 88-99.  aAn optimal pumping policy during groundwater extraction ensures the sustainability of groundwater resources. In this paper, a coupled finite element-particle swarm simulation–optimization model is implemented to assess the optimal pumping policy in a confined heterogeneous anisotropic synthetic aquifer. Pumping wells are set up in the aquifer to meet a specified water demand. The objective is to find the optimum number and pumping discharges of these wells such that their collective drawdown is minimized while meeting the demand at a reasonable cost. Constraints on the maximum allowable pumping discharge and the location of the wells are also imposed. After analysing the aquifer behaviour in the presence of 8, 9 and 10 pumping wells, the optimal number of wells is selected. The coupled FEM-PSO model also predicts the spatial distribution of the wells that incur the minimum cost for installation and pumping to a specified storage location. Adequate tuning of the PSO parameters involving population size, inertia weight, acceleration constants and number of iterations is performed to arrive at their optimal values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3adrawdown 3afinite element analysis 3agroundwater 3agroundwater extraction 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3awells 0aparticle swarm optimization 0aFEM 0agroundwater 0awell pumping1 aRastogi, Ashok Kumar0 tISH journal of hydraulic engineering.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 22, no. 1 p.88-99dTaylor & Francisx2164-30407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09715010.2015.10801263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013200169300001600301520130100317592002801618650001401646650001401660650002001674650002401694650001301718650004201731650001301773650002601786650001401812650001101826650001501837653002001852653002001872653001901892653003101911700001401942700001501956700001801971700001601989700001702005700001602022700001802038700001302056700001802069773010102087856008502188852000902273655001202282IND60546442920221119022227.0160903e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054644292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.04.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaodong10aAerobic granulation strategy for bioaugmentation of a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) treating high strength pyridine wastewater  ap. 153-160.  aAerobic granules were successfully cultivated in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR), using a single bacterial strain Rhizobium sp. NJUST18 as the inoculum. NJUST18 presented as both a good pyridine degrader and an efficient autoaggregator. Stable granules with diameter of 0.5–1mm, sludge volume index of 25.6±3.6mL g−1 and settling velocity of 37.2±2.7mh−1, were formed in SBR following 120-day cultivation. These granules exhibited excellent pyridine degradation performance, with maximum volumetric degradation rate (Vmax) varied between 1164.5mgL−1h−1 and 1867.4mgL−1h−1. High-throughput sequencing analysis exhibited a large shift in microbial community structure, since the SBR was operated under open condition. Paracoccus and Comamonas were found to be the most predominant species in the aerobic granule system after the system had stabilized. The initially inoculated Rhizobium sp. lost its dominance during aerobic granulation. However, the inoculation of Rhizobium sp. played a key role in the start-up process of this bioaugmentation system. This study demonstrated that, in addition to the hydraulic selection pressure during settling and effluent discharge, the selection of aggregating bacterial inocula is equally important for the formation of the aerobic granule.  aPublisher supplied data 3aComamonas 3aRhizobium 3abioaugmentation 3acommunity structure 3agranules 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ainoculum 3amicrobial communities 3apyridines 3asludge 3awastewater 0aAerobic granule 0aBioaugmentation 0aBiodegradation 0aHigh-throughput sequencing1 aChen, Yan1 aZhang, Xin1 aJiang, Xinbai1 aWu, Shijing1 aShen, Jinyou1 aSun, Xiuyun1 aLi, Jiansheng1 aLu, Lude1 aWang, Lianjun0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 295 p.153-160dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.04.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245015200179300001600331520149800347592002801845650001701873650002101890650001201911650001701923650002001940650001401960650001601974650001301990650001902003650001402022650001802036650001202054650000902066650001202075650001202087650001202099650004602111650004402157650002702201650001302228650002702241650005302268700001802321700002002339700001802359700001902377700001202396700001402408700001802422700001702440700001802457773010602475856008102581852000902662655001202671IND4473639820221121022758.0141111e20110520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447363982DNAL7 a216217432pmid7 a10.1016/j.jgg.2011.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Xiuhua10aIntrogression of qPE9-1 allele, conferring the panicle erectness, leads to the decrease of grain yield per plant in japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.)  ap. 217-223.  aPanicle architecture is closely related to yield formation. The qPE9-1 gene has been proved to be widely used in high-yield rice cultivar developments, conferring erect panicle character in japonica rice. Recently, qPE9-1 has been successfully cloned; however, the genetic effect on grain yield per plant of the erect panicle allele qPE9-1 is controversial yet. In the present study, a drooping panicle parent Nongken 57, carrying qpe9-1 allele, was used as recurrent parent to successively backcross to a typical erect panicle line from the double haploid (DH) population (Wuyunjing 8/Nongken 57), which was previously shown to carry qPE9-1 allele. Thus a pair of near-isogenic lines (NILs) was developed. The comparison of agronomic traits between the NILs showed that, when qpe9-1 was replaced by qPE9-1, the panicle architecture was changed from drooping to erect; moreover, the panicle length, plant height, 1000-grain weight and the tillers were significantly decreased, consequently resulting in the dramatic decrease of grain yield per plant by 30%. Therefore, we concluded that the qPE9-1 was a major factor controlling panicle architecture, and qPE9-1 had pleiotropic nature, with negative effects on grain yield per plant. This result strongly suggests that the erect panicle allele qPE9-1 should be used together with other favorable genes in the high-yield breeding practice. In addition, the effect of qPE9-1 on eating and cooking quality was also discussed in the present study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aagronomic traits 3aalleles 3abackcrossing 3acooking quality 3acultivars 3agrain yield 3ahaploidy 3ainflorescences 3aingestion 3aintrogression 3aparents 3arice 3atillers 2aAlleles 2aCooking 2aCrops, Agriculturalxeconomicsxgenetics. 2aFlowersxanatomy & histologyxgenetics. 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aHaploidy 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aOryzaxanatomy & histologyxeconomicsxgenetics.1 aZhang, Zujian1 aZeng, Shengyuan1 aTian, Chunyan1 aPeng, Juncheng1 aLi, Min1 aLü, Yue,1 aMeng, Qingcai1 aGu, Minghong1 aYan, Changjie0 tJournal of genetics and genomics.g2011 May 20, v. 38, no. 5 p.217-223dElsevier Ltdx1673-85277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2011.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245005300171300001600224520123700240592002801477650002301505650001301528650002301541650001001564650002201574650001601596650001101612650002001623650001901643650001701662650002001679650001001699653001901709653001501728653001501743653001601758653002201774700002401796700001801820773011401838856008501952852000902037655001202046IND60481046320221117162336.0160201e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048104632DNAL7 a10.1080/09715010.2015.10884102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBishnoi, Kailsh10aFlow to a collector pipe laid under a stream bed  ap. 100-108.  aWith the increase in population growth, there is tremendous pressure on the decision-makers to look for sustainable sources of safe and adequate water supply for different purposes. Therefore, during recent times, engineers are looking toward cost-effective process of water treatment. Collector wells constructed on the banks of a river are cost-effective means of supplying adequate and safe water supply to people living on the banks of a river. Collector pipes act as a carrier of water to the collector well. Collector pipes placed under a riverbed are the most effective in terms of quantity of water. Previously researchers have derived an analytical solution for potential and flow to the collector pipe under steady-state flow condition. In this study, an analytical method using conformal mapping has been suggested to estimate the potential at different locations in the flow domain. Further, expressions have been derived for estimating the quantity of flow to the collector pipe, entrance velocity, and the travel time of a parcel of water from the stream bed to the collector pipe along the shortest path. Using the travel time, the log cycle reduction in bacteria concentration has been found using logistic function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3abacteria 3acost effectiveness 3apipes 3apopulation growth 3aresearchers 3arivers 3astream channels 3awater quantity 3awater supply 3awater treatment 3awells 0aCollector pipe 0astream bed 0asafe yield 0atravel time 0aentrance velocity1 aKansal, Mitthan Lal1 aMishra, G.

We find that the HER mechanism involves protonation of the electron rich molybdenum hydride site (Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism), leading to a calculated free energy barrier of 17.9 kcal/mol, in good agreement with the barrier of 19.9 kcal/mol estimated from the experimental turnover frequency. Hydronium protonation of the hydride on the Mo site is 21.3 kcal/mol more favorable than protonation of the hydrogen on the S site because the electrons localized on the Mo–H bond are readily transferred to form dihydrogen with hydronium. We predict the Volmer–Tafel mechanism in which hydrogen atoms bound to molybdenum and sulfur sites recombine to form H₂ has a barrier of 22.6 kcal/mol. Starting with hydrogen atoms on adjacent sulfur atoms, the Volmer–Tafel mechanism goes instead through the M–H + S–H pathway. In discussions of metal chalcogenide HER catalysis, the S–H bond energy has been proposed as the critical parameter. However, we find that the sulfur–hydrogen species is not an important intermediate since the free energy of this species does not play a direct role in determining the effective activation barrier. Rather we suggest that the kinetic barrier should be used as a descriptor for reactivity, rather than the equilibrium thermodynamics. This is supported by the agreement between the calculated barrier and the experimental turnover frequency. These results suggest that to design a more reactive catalyst from edge exposed MoS₂, one should focus on lowering the reaction barrier between the metal hydride and a proton from the hydronium in solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3ahydrides 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amodels 3amolybdenum 3asulfur1 aNielsen, Robert J.1 aGoddard, William A.1 aSoriaga, Manuel P.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 May 27, v. 137, no. 20 p.6692-6698dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b033293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245015700161300001600318520162200334592002801956650001101984650002501995650002102020650002502041650001702066650001002083650000902093650002502102650002602127650002702153650001002180650001102190650001802201650001002219650004302229650001802272650002402290653001802314653001902332653001002351653001002361653001202371700002202383700001702405700001502422700001702437773009102454856008102545852000902626655001202635IND60516058320221120044134.0160323e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051605832DNAL7 a10.1017/S17517311110014792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmink, W.10aLinoleic and α-linolenic acid as precursor and inhibitor for the synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in liver and brain of growing pigs  ap. 262-270.  aStudies suggested that in human adults, linoleic acid (LA) inhibits the biosynthesis of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), but their effects in growing subjects are largely unknown. We used growing pigs as a model to investigate whether high LA intake affects the conversion of n-3 LC-PUFA by determining fatty acid composition and mRNA levels of Δ5- and Δ6 desaturase and elongase 2 and -5 in liver and brain. In a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement, 32 gilts from eight litters were assigned to one of the four dietary treatments, varying in LA and α-linolenic acid (ALA) intakes. Low ALA and LA intakes were 0.15 and 1.31, and high ALA and LA intakes were 1.48 and 2.65 g/kg BW⁰.⁷⁵ per day, respectively. LA intake increased arachidonic acid (ARA) in liver. ALA intake increased eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) concentrations, but decreased docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (all P < 0.01) in liver. Competition between the n-3 and n-6 LC-PUFA biosynthetic pathways was evidenced by reductions of ARA (>40%) at high ALA intakes. Concentration of EPA (>35%) and DHA (>20%) was decreased by high LA intake (all P < 0.001). Liver mRNA levels of Δ5- and Δ6 desaturase were increased by LA, and that of elongase 2 by both ALA and LA intakes. In contrast, brain DHA was virtually unaffected by dietary LA and ALA. Generally, dietary LA inhibited the biosynthesis of n-3 LC-PUFA in liver. ALA strongly affects the conversion of both hepatic n-3 and n-6 LC-PUFA. DHA levels in brain were irresponsive to these diets. Apart from Δ6 desaturase, elongase 2 may be a rate-limiting enzyme in the formation of DHA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3aarachidonic acid 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3abrain 3adiet 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afatty acid composition 3agilts 3ahumans 3alinoleic acid 3aliver 3along chain polyunsaturated fatty acids 3amessenger RNA 3aomega-3 fatty acids 0alinoleic acid 0alinolenic acid 0aliver 0abrain 0aenzymes1 aGerrits, W.

Five indigenous strains (I-1, I-2, I-3, I-4 and I-5) and a reference strain (I-0: Coccolithus pelagicus 913/3) were subjected to CO ₂ concentrations of 0.03–15% and NaHCO ₃ of 0.05–2 g CO ₂ l –¹. The logistic model was applied for data fitting, as well as for estimation of the maximum growth rate (μ ₘₐₓ) and the biomass carrying capacity (B ₘₐₓ). Amongst the five indigenous strains, I-3 was similar to the reference strain with regards to biomass production values. The B ₘₐₓ of I-3 significantly increased from 214 to 828 mg l –¹ when CO ₂ concentration was increased from 0.03 to 15% (r = 0.955, P = 0.012). Additionally, the B ₘₐₓ of I-3 increased with increasing NaHCO ₃ (r = 0.885, P = 0.046) and was recorded at 153 mg l –¹ (at 0.05 g CO ₂ l –¹) and 774 mg l –¹ at (2 g CO ₂ l –¹). Relative electron transport rate (rETR) and maximum quantum yield (F ᵥ/F ₘ) were also applied to assess the impact of elevated carbon sources on the microalgal cells at the physiological level. Isolate I-3 displayed the highest rETR confirming its tolerance to higher quantities of carbon. Additionally, the decline in F ᵥ/ F ₘ with increasing carbon was similar for strains I-3 and the reference strain. Based on partial 28s ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, strain I-3 was homologous to the ribosomal genes of Chlorella sp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella 3abiomass production 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarrying capacity 3aelectron transfer 3agenes 3alogit analysis 3amicroalgae 3aphysiological response 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 0aCO2 fixation 0aCO2 tolerance 0alogistic model 0amicroalgal isolation 0aNaHCO3 0aNaHCO3 tolerance 0aphysiological stress1 aSwalaha, Feroz Mahomed1 aNasr, Mahmoud1 aKumari, Sheena1 aBux, F.q(Faizel),0 tEuropean journal of phycology.g2016 Oct. 1, v. 51, no. 4 p.401-412dTaylor & Francisx1469-44337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670262.2016.11939023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002600150245020200176300001600378520143600394592002801830650001501858650001501873650000901888650001201897650002901909650001701938650001801955650001001973650002401983650000902007650001502016650001602031700001902047700002102066773008402087856008602171852000902257655001202266IND4462100320221118081558.0141111e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446210032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2011.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRinaldi, Massimiliano10aReal-time estimation of slowest heating point temperature and residual cooking time by coupling multipoint temperature measurement and mathematical modelling: Application to meat cooking automation  ap. 412-418.  aIn this work, an innovative procedure for real-time heat transfer modelling and dimensional change estimation during meat cooking was presented. By using a multipoint temperature probe, a punctual calculation of slowest heating point (SHP) temperature was obtained at each time from the radial temperature distribution inside the product. Experimental temperature data from the multipoint probe was combined with a mathematical algorithm previously validated to perform a real-time estimation of SHP temperature and residual cooking time on the basis of the data stored at each instant. The developed procedure and algorithm were validated by cooking pork loin and roast beef samples at 180 and 200Â Â°C both under natural and forced convection regimes. Real-time predicted cooking time and SHP endpoint temperature values were very close to those experimentally obtained: at the 85% of the cooking process, the maximum percentage errors for SHP endpoint temperature and cooking time prediction were 1.72 and 1.67%, respectively. In addition, SHP location inside the meat samples was also obtained at each time instant and used to estimate dimensional changes during cooking: calculated final characteristic dimensions were very similar to those experimentally obtained for all cooking trials. The developed approach could be useful for the automatic cooking operations planning in food-service with microbial safety assurance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aautomation 3abeef 3acooking 3adistribution (economics) 3afood service 3aheat transfer 3aloins 3amathematical models 3apork 3aprediction 3atemperature1 aChiavaro, Emma1 aMassini, Roberto0 tFood control.g2012 Feb., v. 23, no. 2 p.412-418dElsevier Ltdx0956-71357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2011.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02189naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245009300165520085900258592002801117650001301145650001401158650002801172650002501200650001501225650003301240650002501273653002101298653001901319653001201338653002501350653004301375700001101418700001401429700001501443700001801458700001701476700001401493700001601507700001801523773010601541856008701647852000901734655001201743IND60678577920221120073837.0200210e20200220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067857792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1243182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Fan10aImproved corrosion resistance of acrylic coatings prepared with modified MoS2 nanosheets  aAcrylic coatings composed of modified MoS₂ nanosheets (MMN) were successfully prepared on the surface of galvanized sheets.

Scanning electron microscopy results showed that MMN reduced the number of cracks in the coatings and made the coatings more compact. Furthermore, the coating corrosion resistance was significantly enhanced. Polarization curves showed that the corrosion current density was reduced by nearly two orders of magnitude by preparing the coating with 0.2 g/L of MMN (sample CM₋₀.₂). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results also demonstrated that the barrier performance was stronger for the MMN composite coating.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3acorrosion 3adielectric spectroscopy 3amolybdenum disulfide 3ananosheets 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aultrasonic treatment 0aGalvanised steel 0aMoS2 nanosheet 0aCoating 0aCorrosion resistance 0aElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy1 aDu, An1 aMa, Ruina1 aLv, Chuang1 aYang, Huazhen1 aFan, Yongzhe1 aZhao, Xue1 aWu, Jianjun1 aCao, Xiaoming0 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Feb. 20, v. 587 p.124318-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1243183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04074naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007500167300001600242520252800258592002802786650002502814650001302839650002302852650001202875650002102887650001602908650001302924650001702937650000902954650001602963650001602979650001102995650002003006650001803026650002203044650002003066650002403086650001503110650001103125650001503136650002903151650002003180650002703200650001503227653003003242653001103272653001203283653000903295700002303304773009103327856008103418852000903499655001203508IND60516058620221123044544.0160323e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051605862DNAL7 a10.1017/S17517311110015222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRakhshandeh, A.10aEvaluation of chronic immune system stimulation models in growing pigs  ap. 305-310.  aTwo experiments (EXPs) were conducted to evaluate models of immune system stimulation (ISS) that can be used in nutrient metabolism studies in growing pigs. In EXP I, the pig's immune response to three non-pathogenic immunogens was evaluated, whereas in EXP II the pig's more general response to one of the immunogens was contrasted with observations on non-ISS pigs. In EXP I, nine growing barrows were fitted with a jugular catheter, and after recovery assigned to one of three treatments. Three immunogens were tested during a 10-day ISS period: (i) repeated injection of increasing amounts of Escherichiacoli lipopolysaccharide (LPS); (ii) repeated subcutaneous injection of turpentine (TURP); and (iii) feeding grains naturally contaminated with mycotoxins (MYCO). In EXP II, 36 growing barrows were injected repeatedly with either saline (n = 12) or increasing amounts of LPS (n = 24) for 7 days (initial dose 60 μg/kg body weight). Treating pigs with TURP and LPS reduced feed intake (P < 0.02), whereas feed intake was not reduced in pigs on MYCO. Average daily gain (ADG; kg/day) of pigs on LPS (0.50) was higher than that of pigs on TURP (0.19), but lower than that of pigs on MYCO (0.61; P < 0.01). Body temperature was elevated in pigs on LPS and TURP, by 0.8°C and 0.7°C, respectively, relative to pre-ISS challenge values (39.3°C; P < 0.02), but remained unchanged in pigs on MYCO. Plasma concentrations of interleukin-1β were increased in pigs treated with LPS and TURP (56% and 55%, respectively, relative to 22.3 pg/ml for pre-ISS; P < 0.01), but not in MYCO-treated pigs. Plasma cortisol concentrations remained unchanged for pigs on MYCO and TURP, but were reduced in LPS-treated pigs (30% relative to 29.8 ng/ml for pre-ISS; P < 0.05). Red blood cell glutathione concentrations were lower in TURP-treated pigs (13% relative to 1.38 μM for pre-ISS; P < 0.05), but were unaffected in pigs on LPS and MYCO. In EXP I, TURP caused severe responses including skin ulceration and substantial reductions in feed intake and ADG, whereas MYCO did not induce effective ISS. In EXP II, ISS increased relative organ weights, eye temperature, white blood cell count and plasma acute-phase proteins (P < 0.05), confirming that repeated injection with increasing amounts of LPS induced chronic and relatively mild ISS. Repeated injection with increasing amounts of LPS is a suitable model for studying nutrient metabolism and evaluating the efficacy of nutritional intervention during chronic ISS in growing pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute phase proteins 3aantigens 3aaverage daily gain 3abarrows 3abody temperature 3abody weight 3acortisol 3aerythrocytes 3aeyes 3afeed intake 3aglutathione 3agrains 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aleukocyte count 3alipopolysaccharides 3ametabolism 3amodels 3amycotoxins 3anutritional intervention 3anutritive value 3asubcutaneous injection 3aturpentine 0aimmune system stimulation 0amodels 0adisease 0apigs1 ade Lange, C.

HDO involves a combination of different reactions such as hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, decarbonylation, and dehydration. These reactions occur at different catalytic sites, typically with heterogeneous catalysts (e.g., metal, acid, and bifunctional sites), making HDO reactions complex. Therefore, the selection of active site type is critical when designing effective heterogeneous catalysts for HDO processes. Catalyst stability is a major issue in designing HDO catalysts. Traditional catalysts are not stable under HDO conditions (i.e., high partial pressure of water). Metal particles are leached and/or sintered. A solid acid support suffers from phase transformation and losses in surface area. The condensation or polymerization of the CC or CO bond within biomass and its derived oxygenates is easy to undertake under high temperatures in the HDO process, causing carbon deposition on the catalyst. Poor catalyst stability is a major challenge that needs to be overcome for innovation in HDO technologies. Therefore, herein, we focus on providing an insight into how to design effective catalysts for use in HDO reactions. First, the roles of different catalytic sites in HDO and strategies to stabilize these active sites are discussed. Current achievements in the HDO of different biomass feedstocks (e.g., model compounds and bio-oils) over various heterogeneous catalysts are highlighted. Recent developments in electrochemical HDO processes, which do not require gaseous hydrogen, are discussed. Finally, points to be considered for further research into HDO over heterogeneous catalysts and pending challenges are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3aelectrochemistry 3afeedstocks 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3amodels 3apartial pressure 3aphase transition 3apolymerization 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aKwon, Eilhann E.1 aKim, Yong Tae1 aJung, Sungyup1 aKim, Hyung Ju1 aHuber, George W.1 aLee, Jechan0 tGreen chemistry.g2019 July 15, v. 21, no. 14 p.3715-3743dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9gc01210a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02082naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245007100167300001600238520110900254592002801363650001801391650001501409650001401424650001201438650001001450650001701460650002901477650003101506700003101537773010301568856007601671852000901747655001201756IND60691112720221120042153.0200427e20090401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069111272DNAL7 a10.4161/rna.6.2.77932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPascual-García, Pau12aA tale of coupling, Sus1 function in transcription and mRNA export  ap. 141-144.  aEukaryotic cells have evolved unveiling a tightly coupled scenario between transcription, RNA biogenesis and mRNA transport out of the nucleus. Gene expression regulation relies partially on the action of some protein complexes, which ensure that all these processes work co-ordinately in order to achieve an optimal performance. The evolutionarily conserved export factor Sus1 plays a key role in coupling transcription activation with mRNA export as part of the nuclear pore associated complex TREX2 and the transcriptional coactivator SAGA. Being a factor shared by these two complexes, Sus1 physically link the activated GAL1 gene to the nuclear periphery, which constitute a determinant of regulation. An exciting new study has expanded our knowledge of Sus1 function. Sus1 is required for transcription elongation, it’s recruited to coding regions and interacting with different factors during mRNA biogenesis. Moreover, SAGA and TREX2 are necessary for efficient Sus1 recruitment to chromatin. These results underscore the key role of Sus1 coordinating gene transcription coupled to mRNA export.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA transport 3abiogenesis 3achromatin 3aexports 3agenes 3anuclear pore 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptional activation1 aRodríguez-Navarro, Susana0 tRNA biology.g2009 Apr. 1, v. 6, no. 2 p.141-144dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/rna.6.2.77933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245007400199300001400273500001400287506007600301520126500377592002801642506003701670650002801707650003401735650002401769650001101793650003001804650001001834650001101844650003101855650001001886650001001896650002001906650001201926650001101938650001901949650001101968650001401979650002401993650002002017650001802037650001702055650001502072650002902087653002402116700001402140700001902154700002102173700001702194773009202211856007302303852000902376655001202385IND60690006220221207070414.0200424e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069000622DNAL7 a10.4161/fly.195532doi7 aPMC33979222pmcid7 a226147852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDobeš, Pavel,13aAn improved method for nematode infection assays in Drosophila larvae  ap. 75-79.  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe infective juveniles (IJs) of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) seek out host insects and release their symbiotic bacteria into their body cavity causing septicaemia, which eventually leads to host death. The interaction between EPNs and their hosts are only partially understood, in particular the host immune responses appears to involve pathways other than phagocytosis and the canonical transcriptional induction pathways. These pathways are genetically tractable and include for example clotting factors and lipid mediators. The aim of this study was to optimize the nematode infections in Drosophila melanogaster larvae, a well-studied and genetically tractable model organism. Here we show that two nematode species namely Steinernema feltiae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora display different infectivity toward Drosophila larvae with the latter being less pathogenic. The effects of supporting media and IJ dosage on the mortality of the hosts were assessed and optimized. Using optimum conditions, a faster and efficient setup for nematode infections was developed. This newly established infection model in Drosophila larvae will be applicable in large scale screens aimed at identifying novel genes/pathways involved in innate immune responses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aHeterorhabditis bacteriophora 3aSteinernema feltiae 3aassays 3ablood coagulation factors 3adeath 3adosage 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3agenes 3ahosts 3aimmune response 3ainsects 3alipids 3amicrosymbionts 3amodels 3amortality 3anematode infections 3anematode larvae 3apathogenicity 3aphagocytosis 3asepticemia 3atranscription (genetics) 0aGalleria mellonella1 aWang, Zhi1 aMarkus, Robert1 aTheopold, Ulrich1 aHyrsl, Pavel0 tFly.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 6, no. 2 p.75-79dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2251x1933-69427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/fly.195533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01966naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245011900166300001800285520088100303592002801184650001701212650001201229650002401241650002101265650001301286650001701299650001401316700002801330700002401358700003001382773013201412856007501544852000901619655001201628IND60538573720221116155423.0160815e20120620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053857372DNAL7 a10.1021/ja303147a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrantley, Johnathan

Irradiating acetonitrile solutions of these polymers with ultrasound resulted in the formal cycloreversion of the triazole units, as determined by a variety of spectroscopic and chemical labeling techniques. The aforementioned reactions were monitored over time, and the rate constant for the cycloreversion of the 1,5-disubstituted triazole was measured to be 1.2 times larger than that of the 1,4-disubstituted congener. The difference was attributed to the increased mechanical deformability of the 1,5-regioisomer as compared to the 1,4-isomer. This interpretation was further supported by computational studies, which employed extended Bell theory to predict the force dependence of the activation barriers for the cycloreversions of both isomers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aisomers 3alabeling techniques 3amolecular weight 3apolymers 3aspectroscopy 3atriazoles1 aKonda, Sai Sriharsha M.1 aMakarov, Dmitrii E.1 aBielawski, Christopher W.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 June 20, v. 134, no. 24 p.9882-9885dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja303147a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01966naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245007800163300001600241500001400257520072900271592002801000650001501028650002301043650003001066650001201096650001001108650001901118650001501137650001701152650001901169653001401188653001501202653001901217653001401236653001601250653001101266653002101277653001801298700002801316773009401344856007301438852000901511655001201520IND60690006320221119005148.0200424e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069000632DNAL7 a10.4161/fly.195542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBousquet, François10adesat1bA Swiss army knife for pheromonal communication and reproduction?  ap. 102-107.  aNAL-light  aThe desat1 gene possesses an extraordinary—maybe unique—feature in the control of sensory communication systems: it codes for the two principal and complementary aspects—the emission and the reception—of Drosophila sex pheromones.

Such a functional pleiotropy may be related to the molecular structure of desat1 gene which combines a highly conserved coding region with fast evolving regulatory regions: It produces at least five transcripts all giving rise to the ∆9-desaturase enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3achemical structure 3acommunications technology 3aenzymes 3agenes 3aosmoregulation 3apleiotropy 3areproduction 3asex pheromones 0acourtship 0adesaturase 0adiscrimination 0aevolution 0ahydrocarbon 0ajockey 0alipid metabolism 0asex pheromone1 aFerveur, Jean-François0 tFly.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 6, no. 2 p.102-107dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2251x1933-69427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/fly.195543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245016400171520145100335592002801786650001301814650002601827650001501853650001501868650003101883650001501914650001001929650001001939650001601949650001301965650003101978650002202009650001702031650001202048653002702060653001702087653002602104653001502130700002702145700002502172700001702197700002502214773010702239856008502346852000902431655001202440IND60773155520221121225935.0220523e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077315552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2022.1094282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaabis, Sarah M.10aAssessing the effects of experimental bacterial challenge with Pasteurella multocida and ampicillin on the respiratory microbiota of pre-weaned Holstein calves  aThe association between changes in the respiratory microbiota and Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) in dairy calves is not well understood. We investigated characteristics of the nasopharyngeal (NP) microbiota associated with BRD following Pasteurella multocida infection. We also evaluated the effect of ampicillin on the respiratory microbiota. Calves (n = 30) were inoculated with P. multocida and randomly allocated into an antibiotic group (AMP; n = 17) or placebo group (PLAC; n = 11) when lung lesions developed. Deep NP swabs (DNPS) were collected before and after challenge. Monitoring was performed daily until euthanasia at day 14. Swabs and tissue samples were collected for analysis. The V4 hypervariable region of the 16 S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Increased species abundance in the pre-challenge DNPS was associated with a decrease in cumulative respiratory disease over 14 days post-infection. While NP beta diversity was affected by infection, antibiotic therapy showed no effect on the alpha and beta diversity nor the relative abundance (RA) of genera in the NP tonsil, lymph node and lung microbiota. Antibiotic therapy was associated with an increased RA of NP Pasteurella spp. and a decreased RA of NP Prevotella spp. Common taxa among all samples included GIT-associated bacteria, which suggests a possible link between the GIT microbiota and respiratory microbiota in dairy calves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aPasteurella multocida 3aPrevotella 3aampicillin 3abovine respiratory disease 3aeuthanasia 3agenes 3alungs 3alymph nodes 3aplacebos 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aspecies abundance 3atherapeutics 3atonsils 0aRespiratory microbiota 0aDairy calves 0aPasteurella multocida 0aAmpicillin1 aHolschbach, Chelsea L.1 aSkarlupka, Joseph H.1 aSuen, Garret1 aOllivett, Theresa L.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2022 June, v. 269 p.109428-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2022.1094283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245014200168300002000310520155400330592002801884650001501912650001901927650002601946650003701972650002802009650000902037650001302046650000902059650001202068650002402080650001402104650001402118650002102132650002102153650001902174650001702193650002202210650003302232650001602265650002202281650003702303700002002340773012502360856007402485852000902559655001202568IND60641132020221122044037.0190505e20160913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064113202DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra17898g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhankhar, Sandeep Singh10aGreen synthesis, optical and magnetic properties of a Mnᴵᴵ metal–organic framework (MOF) that exhibits high heat of H₂ adsorption  ap. 86468-86476.  aGreen synthesis of a 3D, Mn(ii) metal–organic framework (MOF) composed of a trimeric Mn(ii) cluster and NDC linker formulated as [Mn₃(NDC)₃(DMA)₄]ₙ (1) (where, NDC = 2,6 napthalene dicarboxylic acid, DMA = N,N-dimethylacetamide) has been achieved by employing mechanochemical and sonochemical routes. Interestingly, MOF 1 undergoes reversible structural transformation upon desolvation and solvation of DMA molecules. The desolvated framework, 1′ containing two unsaturated Mn(ii) sites exhibits interesting H₂ and CO₂ uptake properties with isosteric heats of adsorption (Qₛₜ) for H₂ and CO₂ of 11.8 and 29.2 kJ mol⁻¹, respectively. Remarkably, the Qₛₜ of H₂ estimated for 1′ is found to be the highest value amongst the Mn(ii) MOFs reported so far and the high value has been attributed to the stronger interaction of H₂ with the unsaturated Mn(ii) centers. Further, variable temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements of 1 revealed weak antiferromagnetic coupling interactions between the adjacent Mn(ii) ions. The thermal stability of 1 has also been examined and was found to be highly stable. Photoluminescence investigation revealed that the emission from MOF 1 is owed to ligand based charge transfer transitions. Furthermore, compound 1 undergoes temperature induced solid-state conversion into phase pure MnO nanocrystals of about 10–18 nm in size embedded in a carbonaceous layer to form MnO–C nanocomposite (NC). The MnO–C NC has been characterized by PXRD, FE-SEM, EDAX and TEM analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acoordination polymers 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aferrimagnetic materials 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3aions 3aligands 3amagnetic properties 3amagnetism 3amanganese 3amanganese oxides 3amechanochemistry 3ananocomposites 3ananocrystals 3aphotoluminescence 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aNagaraja, C.

As a type of RNN, LSTM has a good performance on processing time series data as well as some nonlinear and complex problems. To explore more accurate electricity price forecasting approach, in this paper, a new hybrid model based on wavelet transform and Adam optimized LSTM neural network, denoted as WT-Adam-LSTM, is proposed. After the wavelet transform, nonlinear sequence of electricity price can be decomposed and processed data will have a more stable variance, and the combination of Adam, one of efficient stochastic gradient-based optimizers, and LSTM can capture appropriate behaviors precisely for electricity price. This study presented four cases to verify the performance of the hybrid model, and the dataset from New South Wales of Australia and French were adopted to illustrate the excellence of the hybrid model. The results show that the proposed model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aelectricity costs 3afuels 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprocessing time 3atime series analysis 3avariance 3awavelet 3aweather 3aNew South Wales 0aComponent 0aElectricity price prediction 0aWavelet transform 0aLong short-term memory 0aAdam1 aZhang, Yang1 aChen, Wenbo0 tEnergy.g2019 Nov. 15, v. 187dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.07.1343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009900166520154800265592002801813650001301841650001701854650002001871650001301891650002101904650001801925650001401943650002001957650001301977650002401990650002002014650001102034650001602045653001102061653001602072653002202088700005902110700001602169700002202185700005602207700002202263700001802285773009302303856008202396852000902478655001202487IND60759111220221119134959.0220314e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075911122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2021.1115622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamamoto, Miho10aCachexia criteria in chronic illness associated with acute weight loss in patients with stroke  aWeight loss after a stroke is associated with poor outcomes. However, the causes of weight loss in the acute phase of a stroke are not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between acute weight changes and cachexia criteria in patients with an acute stroke. In this prospective-cohort study, we assessed patients’ body weight change during hospitalization, and investigated the five cachexia criteria (muscle strength, fatigue, anorexia, skeletal muscle mass, and abnormal biochemistry) at time of discharge in patients with an acute stroke. A patient was defined as being cachectic if ≥3 cachexia criteria were met. A multivariate analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between weight changes and cachexia criteria. A total of 155 patients with an acute stroke were enrolled in this study, and 30 patients (19%) were found to have weight loss (≥5% weight loss). A univariate regression analysis found that the cachexia criteria were significantly associated with weight changes (β = –0.338; P < 0.001). The multivariate analyses after adjusting for energy intake, age, sex, body mass index at time of admission, National Institutes of Health stroke scale score, inflammatory disease, length of hospital stay, length of bed rest, and swallowing function showed that the cachexia criteria were significantly associated with weight changes (β = –0.154; P = 0.043). The cachexia criteria were independently associated with acute weight loss in patients with a stroke.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanorexia 3abiochemistry 3abody mass index 3acachexia 3achronic diseases 3aenergy intake 3ahospitals 3amuscle strength 3apatients 3aregression analysis 3askeletal muscle 3astroke 3aweight loss 0aStroke 0aWeight loss 0aCachexia criteria1 aNozoe, Masafumi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5579-22581 aMasuya, Rio1 aYoshida, Yōsuke,1 aKubo, Hiroki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3278-75281 aShimada, Shinichi1 aShomoto, Koji0 tNutrition.g2022 Apr., v. 96 p.111562-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2021.1115623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03314naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015100166300001200317520152700329592002801856596005901884596008801943650001102031650001202042650002102054650001102075650001202086650002002098650001302118650001302131650002102144650003102165650001702196650002202213650001102235650001102246650001802257650001602275650000902291650001902300650001702319650001802336650001202354650001702366651001302383700001702396700001802413700001702431700002402448700002102472773015202493856008202645852000902727655001202736IND60676317320221118010625.0220505e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067631732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-019-7909-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIrshad, Samina10aEstimating the pollution characteristics and health risks of potentially toxic metal(loid)s in urban-industrial soils in the Indus basin, Pakistan  ap. 748.  aThe Indus Basin Irrigation Network (IBIN) plays a vital role in the agricultural system of Pakistan, irrigating seventeen million hectares of cultivated areas. Rapid urbanization, industrialization, and agricultural activities along the Indus basin have influenced the soil quality and human health; it is, therefore, critical to know its pollution characteristics. Soil samples from Indus basin, i.e., Abbottabad (ABT), Haripur (HRP), Attock (ATC), and Islamabad (ISB) have been analyzed for the total contents of potentially toxic metal(loid)s (PTMs) in the top layer. The topsoil samples from 0 to 10 cm depth have been further investigated using different pollution indices and human health risk assessment models. The contamination degree of soil pollution was highest in ISB (33.75), followed by ABT (25.30) and ATC (23.57). The assessment of the daily intake of PTMs by children and adults through different pathways revealed ingestion as the significant exposure pathway. Cr was found to be the major element posing non-carcinogenic health risks to children at ATC whereas the non-carcinogenic risks posed by all other PTMs were within the safe limit. Furthermore, life-time carcinogenic risks for Ni followed by Cr and Cd were greatly exceeded at all locations and As at ATC and ISB for both age groups, but comparatively children were found to be at a higher risk of carcinogenicity. Hence, efficient remediation strategies are needed to reduce the increasing content and health risks of PTMs in the Indus basin.  aPublisher supplied data  a41173032cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a1804b06020358cKey Program for Science and Technology Development of Anhui Province 3aadults 3aarsenic 3abasin irrigation 3abasins 3acadmium 3acarcinogenicity 3achildren 3achromium 3acultivation area 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahuman health 3aindustrialization 3amodels 3anickel 3aoral exposure 3aremediation 3arisk 3asoil pollution 3asoil quality 3asoil sampling 3atopsoil 3aurbanization 3aPakistan1 aLiu, Guijian1 aYousaf, Balal1 aUllah, Habib1 aAli, Muhammad Ubaid1 aRinklebe, Jörg,0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2019 Dec., v. 191, no. 12 p.748-748dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-019-7909-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003200153245008000185520152600265592002801791650000801819650001701827650002401844650001701868650002601885653002401911653003301935653002701968653001801995700002202013700002902035773012002064856008802184852000902272655001202281IND60759111320221119134704.0220404e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075911132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.1060402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernandez-Betancur, Jose D.12aA data engineering approach for sustainable chemical end-of-life management  aThe presence of chemicals causing significant adverse human health and environmental effects during end-of-life (EoL) stages is a challenge for implementing sustainable management efforts and transitioning towards a safer circular life cycle. Conducting chemical risk evaluation and exposure assessment of potential EoL scenarios can help understand the chemical EoL management chain for its safer utilization in a circular life-cycle environment. However, the first step is to track the chemical flows, estimate releases, and potential exposure pathways. Hence, this work proposes an EoL data engineering approach to perform chemical flow analysis and screening to support risk evaluation and exposure assessment for designing a safer circular life cycle of chemicals. This work uses publicly-available data to identify potential post-recycling scenarios (e.g., industrial processing/use operations), estimate inter-industry chemical transfers, and exposure pathways to chemicals of interest. A case study demonstration shows how the data engineering framework identifies, estimates, and tracks chemical flow transfers from EoL stage facilities (e.g., recycling and recovery) to upstream chemical life cycle stage facilities (e.g., manufacturing). Also, the proposed framework considers current regulatory constraints on closing the recycling loop operations and provides a range of values for the flow allocated to post-recycling uses associated with occupational exposure and fugitive air releases from EoL operations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acase studies 3aexposure assessment 3ahuman health 3aoccupational exposure 0aCircular life cycle 0aEnd-of-life management chain 0aChemical flow analysis 0aData pipeline1 aMartín, Mariano,1 aRuiz-Mercado, Gerardo J.0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2022 Mar., v. 178 p.106040-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.1060403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002700166245011000193300001600303520155500319592002801874650001801902650001001920650001001930650001901940650001401959650001001973653002001983653001002003653001902013700002102032700001902053700002002072700001802092700002202110773012802132856008102260852000902341655001202350IND60654941020221123033625.0190727e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065494102DNAL7 a272104922pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299160002002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaeussermann, Angelika10aEffect of a multi-sided concave liner barrel design on thickness and roughness of teat-end hyperkeratosis  ap. 188-195.  aIn a round liner barrel, the force of the closing liner is transferred by the two opposite sides of the liner wall to the teat apex. Liners with a multi-sided barrel shape close at three or more planes and distribute their force to a larger area of the teat apex. The objective of the study was to investigate effects of a liner with a multi-sided concave barrel design on the degree of teat-end hyperkeratosis, thickness and roughness, and on the time delay until thickness or roughness of teat-end hyperkeratosis responded to the experimental liner. The investigations were done on two dairy farms, one in USA and one in Germany. A split-udder arrangement of liners was used, and control treatment was a liner with round barrel shape. The test period comprised 14 weeks in the first study and 16 weeks in the second study. Thickness of teat-end hyperkeratosis was influenced by farm and test week. Roughness was influenced by farm, test week and treatment. In the first study, the incidence of rough teat-end hyperkeratosis was about 28 and 42% lower in teats milked with the experimental liner than in teats milked with the control liner by test weeks 11 and 14, respectively. In the second study, incidence of rough teat-end hyperkeratosis was rare in general, and in addition hardly occurred in teats milked with the experimental liner. The results indicate that the barrel design of the experimental liner causes similar effects on different farms but magnitude of the effect depends on initial incidence of teat end hyperkeratosis in the herd.  aPublisher supplied data 3adairy farming 3afarms 3aherds 3ahyperkeratosis 3aroughness 3ateats 0aMachine milking 0aliner 0ateat condition1 aBritten, Justine1 aBritten, Allan1 aPahl, Christian1 aÄlveby, Nils1 aHartung, Eberhard0 tJournal of dairy research.g2016 May, v. 83, no. 2 p.188-195dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45499x1469-76297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299160002003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03299naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245009900174300001600273520170300289592002801992650001602020650001102036650002302047650001902070650002502089650001202114650000902126650002002135650003102155650001002186650001102196650001602207650001002223650001002233650001202243650001102255650002102266650003402287650003002321650000902351653003702360653001402397653002502411653002102436700001902457700001602476700001802492700001702510700001602527773009102543856009002634852000902724655001202733IND60628211920221120180835.0190326e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062821192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.01.0942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dong-Liang10aSex-specific alterations of lipid metabolism in zebrafish exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls  ap. 768-777.  aPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent organic pollutants (POPs) mixtures exerting environmental health risk. In mammals, PCBs have been shown to disrupt metabolic state, especially lipid metabolism, and energy balance, but their effects on lipid metabolism in fish are largely unknown. The zebrafish were selected as model and both male and female adult zebrafish were exposed to different concentrations of PCBs at gradient concentrations of 0.2, 2.0 and 20.0 μg/L for 6 weeks. PCB exposure did not affect survival, but a significant inhibition of growth was observed in the males after exposure to 20.0 μg/L. The lower concentrations of 0.2 and 2.0 μg/L increased hepatic lipid accumulation to a greater extent in male fish, but the higher concentration of 20.0 μg/L did not cause significant fat accumulation in either male or female fish. In males, the expression of genes related to lipogenesis and lipid catabolism was upregulated in a concentration-dependent manner in the liver and visceral mass without liver and gonad; the effects of exposure on lipid metabolism-related genes in female fish were less pronounced. PCB exposure did not induce significant oxidative stress, but did upregulate the expression of stress- and apoptosis-related genes, mostly in male fish. The low concentrations of PCBs (0.2 μg/L and 2.0 μg/L) exerted sex-specific effects on zebrafish lipid metabolism, and male fish were more sensitive to the exposure. This study provides new mechanistic insights into the complex interactions between PCBs, lipid metabolism, and sex in zebrafish, and may contribute to a future systematic assessment of the effects of PCBs on aquatic ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aadults 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aenergy balance 3aenvironmental health 3afemales 3afish 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3alipids 3alipogenesis 3aliver 3amales 3amammals 3amodels 3aoxidative stress 3apersistent organic pollutants 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3arisk 0aPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) 0aZebrafish 0aSex-specific effects 0aLipid metabolism1 aHuang, Yu-Juan1 aGao, Shuang1 aChen, Li-Qiao1 aTiu, Cheryl,1 aDu, Zhen-Yu0 tChemosphere.g2019 Apr., v. 221 p.768-777dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.01.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01881naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002000189245010700209300001400316506007600330520049200406592002800898506003700926650001700963650001700980650002000997650001001017650001401027650001301041650001301054650001401067653002001081653001701101653002501118653001701143700002101160700001901181773015501200856008301355852000901438655001201447IND60551047320221207101248.0190416s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055104732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mmcr.2013.01.0022doi7 aPMC38859342pmcid7 a244322122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRolfe, Nancy E.10aManagement of Scedosporium apiospermum in a pre- and post-lung transplant patient with cystic fibrosis  ap. 37-39.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough the predominant type of infection seen in the cystic fibrosis lung remains bacterial, fungal organisms are being isolated more frequently and are associated with a high mortality rate in lung transplant recipients.

Under these conditions, cells spread and divide in all directions resulting in an inherent variability in cell shape, morphology and behavior. The high cell-to-cell variance of the overall population impedes the success of HCA, especially for drug development. The ability of micropatterns to normalize the shape and internal polarity of every individual cell provides a tremendous opportunity for solving this critical bottleneck 1-2. To facilitate access and use of the micropatterning technology, CYTOO has developed a range of ready to use micropatterns, available in coverslip and microwell formats. In this video article, we provide detailed protocols of all the procedures from cell seeding on CYTOOchip micropatterns, drug treatment, fixation and staining to automated acquisition, automated image processing and final data analysis. With this example, we illustrate how micropatterns can facilitate cell-based assays. Alterations of the cell cytoskeleton are difficult to quantify in cells cultured on homogenous substrates, but culturing cells on micropatterns results in a reproducible organization of the actin meshwork due to systematic positioning of the cell adhesion contacts in every cell. Such normalization of the intracellular architecture allows quantification of even small effects on the actin cytoskeleton as demonstrated in these set of protocols using blebbistatin, an inhibitor of the actin-myosin interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aautomation 3acell adhesion 3acell lines 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3aimage analysis 3amicrofilaments 3aquantitative analysis 3asowing 3astaining 3atissue culture 3avariance1 aAuzan, Muriel1 aChapuis, Violaine1 aBéghin, Anne1 aChadeyras, Amélie1 aNelep, Constantin1 aCalvo-Muñoz, Maria Luisa1 aYoung, JoAnne,1 aChatelain, François1 aFuchs, Alexandra0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2010 Dec. 02, , no. 46 p.e2514-e2514dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/25143Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/2514/improved-visualization-quantitative-analysis-drug-effects-using  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001500180245012800195300001400323500001400337506007600351520106700427592002801494506003701522650001501559650001201574650001101586650001601597650002001613650001301633650001501646650000901661650003001670650002001700650002501720653000901745653001701754653000801771653002001779700001501799700001401814700001701828700002201845700002501867773009201892856007301984852000902057655001202066IND60690006820221207064113.0200424e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069000682DNAL7 a10.4161/fly.200292doi7 aPMC33979232pmcid7 a226347142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chao10aH3S10 phosphorylation by the JIL-1 kinase regulates H3K9 dimethylation and gene expression at the white locus in Drosophila  ap. 93-97.  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe JIL-1 kinase is a multidomain protein that localizes specifically to euchromatin interband regions of polytene chromosomes and is the kinase responsible for histone H3S10 phosphorylation at interphase. Genetic interaction assays have suggested that the function of the epigenetic histone H3S10ph mark is to antagonize heterochromatization by participating in a dynamic balance between factors promoting repression and activation of gene expression as measured by position-effect variegation (PEV) assays. Interestingly, JIL-1 loss-of-function alleles can act either as an enhancer or indirectly as a suppressor of wᵐ⁴ PEV depending on the precise levels of JIL-1 kinase activity. In this study, we have explored the relationship between PEV and the relative levels of the H3S10ph and H3K9me2 marks at the white gene in both wild-type and wᵐ⁴ backgrounds by ChIP analysis. Our results indicate that H3K9me2 levels at the white gene directly correlate with its level of expression and that H3K9me2 levels in turn are regulated by H3S10 phosphorylation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3aalleles 3aassays 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3ahistones 3ainterphase 3aloci 3aloss-of-function mutation 3aphosphorylation 3apolytene chromosomes 0aChIP 0aJIL-1 kinase 0aPEV 0aheterochromatin1 aCai, Weili1 aLi, Yeran1 aGirton, Jack1 aJohansen, Jørgen1 aJohansen, Kristen M.0 tFly.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 6, no. 2 p.93-97dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2251x1933-69427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/fly.200293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245011400175520130500289592002801594650002301622650002601645650002001671650001501691650001401706650000901720650001401729650001601743650001401759650001501773650000901788650002101797653001501818653002701833653001901860653000901879653001201888653001001900700002001910700001801930700002701948700002501975700002502000700002102025700002902046700001902075700002702094773010702121856008502228852000902313655001202322IND60773155820221122033536.0220523e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077315582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2022.1094312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, Wellison A.10aBeneficial effects of probiotics on the pig production cycle: An overview of clinical impacts and performance  aIn pig nutrition, antibiotics are used to promote growth and/or to treat diseases in order to improve animal performance. However, due to the potential risk of cross selective pressure for antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens, the development of new nutritional additives is needed. Among them, probiotics are of great interest since they could improve the immune response, maintain animal intestinal health, and improve nutritional efficiency. Studies with probiotics have also demonstrated their antimicrobial effects on several pathogenic strains, emphasizing that the form of administration can enhance the beneficial effects. In view of the promising advances in probiotic research, it is opportune to highlight their capacity to modulate health and improve performance at all stages of pig production. Therefore, in this review, we will discuss the benefits of probiotics on physiological, immunological, and clinical aspects during different stages of the pig’s life cycle. Specifically, probiotics improve performance during pregnancy, parturition and lactation in sows, they can improve immunohematological parameters and defenses in the growing phase, they can influence the quality of meat in the finishing phase and can also help in the reduction of environmental pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal performance 3aantibiotic resistance 3aimmune response 3aintestines 3alactation 3ameat 3anutrition 3aparturition 3apregnancy 3aprobiotics 3arisk 3aswine production 0aProbiotics 0aAntibiotic alternative 0aPig production 0aSows 0aPiglets 0aSwine1 aFranco, Sara M.1 aReis, Iara L.1 aMendonça, Carlos M.N.1 aPiazentin, Anna C.M.1 aAzevedo, Pamela O.S.1 aTse, Marcos L.P.1 aDe Martinis, Elaine C.P.1 aGierus, Martin1 aOliveira, Ricardo P.S.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2022 June, v. 269 p.109431-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2022.1094313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006400146245012800210300002000338520107800358592002801436650001101464650001401475650002101489650001801510650002201528650001101550650002201561650001301583650001901596650001701615650003701632700006301669700002001732700001701752773017401769856008001943852000902023655001202032IND60751109120220217000000.0210922e20210910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075110912DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c020042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindberg, Aleksandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2344-327X10aSources of Oxygen Produced in the Chlorate Process Utilizing Dimensionally Stable Anode (DSA) Electrodes Doped by Sn and Sb  ap. 13505-13514.  aIdentifying the sources of oxygen in the chlorate process is challenging due to the complex set of chemical and electrochemical reactions involved. Here, two types of electrodes have been investigated—Ti₀.₇Ru₀.₃Oₓ, and electrodes with aimed composition Ti₀.₃₄Ru₀.₃Sn₀.₃Sb₀.₀₆Oₓ, both compared with platinum anodes. The cell oxygen off-gas was analyzed employing mass spectrometry together with ex situ UV–vis spectroscopy to quantify the kinetic rate constants. Noteworthy is that the respective rates of oxygen formation from anodic and chemical reactions in the presence of hypochlorite are of the same magnitude. The addition of Sn and Sb doubled the surface area of the electrodes and decreased oxygen production when electrodes were used for the first time. However, rate constants for total oxygen production with reused electrodes follow the trend: homogeneous hypochlorite decomposition < TiRu < TiRuSnSb to the highest value obtained by Pt. The same trend is noticed for rate constants concerning the hypochlorite decomposition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3achlorates 3aelectrochemistry 3ahypochlorites 3amass spectrometry 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3aplatinum 3aprocess design 3asurface area 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aDiaz-Morales, Oscar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1221-08091 aHolmin, Susanne1 aCornell, Ann0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 Sept. 10, v. 60, no. 37 p.13505-13514dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c020043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012800168520145400296592002801750650001501778650002401793650001901817650001401836650003101850650002101881650001601902650002001918650002401938653001901962653003101981653001102012653001402023653004002037700001802077700005602095773008002151856008502231852000902316655001202325IND60659378220221120155229.0190822e20191115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065937822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.1158842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Jungkeun14aThe effects of the air-fuel ratio on a stationary diesel engine under dual-fuel conditions and multi-objective optimization  aThe fundamental combustion characteristics and engine performance of a dual-fuel engine, fueled with diesel and natural gas, were investigated using a commercial 1D simulation program (GT-Power). Furthermore, the effects of air-fuel ratio under dual-fuel combustion conditions were studied, and optimized design points that minimize brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions simultaneously were determined using a multi-objective Pareto optimization method. The engine model was validated based on experimental results and previous work under various engine loads. The thermal efficiency of the engine, which was modified from a diesel to a dual-fuel engine, showed a decreasing tendency as the natural gas substitution ratio (NSR) increased due to changes in the combustion characteristics. The decline in thermal efficiency in dual-fuel combustion could be improved somewhat by optimizing the injection strategy. Under dual-fuel combustion conditions, an optimum air-fuel ratio value for BSFC could be determined, especially for higher NSR conditions. However, NOX emissions showed a tendency to increase with increasing air-fuel ratio. The relationship between the trends was more than a simple tradeoff, so multi-objective Pareto optimization was conducted to minimize both BSFC and NOX emissions, with start of injection timing and air-fuel ratio as variables. Ultimately, optimal design points were determined.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3acomputer simulation 3adiesel engines 3aemissions 3aenergy use and consumption 3amodel validation 3anatural gas 3anitrogen oxides 3asystem optimization 0aAir-fuel ratio 0aCombustion characteristics 0aDiesel 0aDual fuel 0aPareto multi-objective optimization1 aPark, Sangjun1 aSong, Soonho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3969-55540 tEnergy.g2019 Nov. 15, v. 187dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.1158843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002400183245006000207300001600267506007600283520150500359592002801864506003701892650001501929650002701944650001201971650000901983650002601992650001902018650001502037650002902052650001702081650001102098700001702109700001802126700003302144700002202177773010302199856007602302852000902378655001202387IND60691113520221207122936.0200427e20090401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069111352DNAL7 a10.4161/rna.6.2.80502doi7 aPMC27831912pmcid7 a192469892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoughlin, Daniel J.10aPrediction and verification of mouse tRNA gene families  ap. 195-202.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Transfer RNA (tRNA) gene predictions are complicated by challenges such as structural variation, limited sequence conservation and the presence of highly reiterated short interspersed sequences (SINEs) that originally derived from tRNA genes or tRNA-like transcription units. Annotation of “tRNA genes” in sequenced genomes generally have not been accompanied by experimental verification of the expression status of predicted sequences. Results: To address this for mouse tRNA genes, we have employed two programs, tRNAScan-SE and ARAGORN, to predict the tRNA genes in the nuclear genome, resulting in diverse but overlapping predicted gene sets. From these, we removed known SINE repeats and sorted the genes into predicted families and single-copy genes. In particular, four families of intron-containing tRNA genes were predicted for the first time in mouse, with introns in positions and structures similar to the well characterized intron-containing tRNA genes in yeast. We verified the expression of the predicted tRNA genes by microarray analysis. We then confirmed the expression of appropriately sized RNA for the four intron-containing tRNA gene families, as well as the other 31 tRNA gene families creating an index of expression-verified mouse tRNAs. Conclusions: These confirmed tRNA genes represent all anticodons and all known mammalian tRNA structural groups, as well as a variety of predicted “rogue” tRNA genes within families with altered anticodon identities.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanticodons 3agermplasm conservation 3aintrons 3amice 3amicroarray technology 3anuclear genome 3aprediction 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransfer RNA 3ayeasts1 aBabak, Tomas1 aNihranz, Chad1 aHughes, T.

We used a novel elicitation approach which combined individual and group elicitation. With no change from current RD&D funding levels, experts on average expected current (Gen. III/III+) designs to be somewhat more expensive in 2030 than they were in 2010, and they expected the next generation of designs (Gen. IV) to be more expensive still as of 2030. Projected costs of proposed small modular reactors (SMRs) were similar to those of Gen. IV systems. The experts almost unanimously recommended large increases in government support for nuclear RD&D (generally 2–3 times current spending). The majority expected that such RD&D would have only a modest effect on cost, but would improve performance in other areas, such as safety, waste management, and uranium resource utilization. The U.S. and E.U. experts were in relative agreement regarding how government RD&D funds should be allocated, placing particular focus on very high temperature reactors, sodium-cooled fast reactors, fuels and materials, and fuel cycle technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aenergy 3aexperts 3afuels 3afunding 3anuclear power 3atemperature 3auranium 3awaste management 3aUnited States1 aBosetti, Valentina1 aBunn, Matthew1 aCatenacci, Michela1 aLee, Audrey0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2012 Nov. 06, v. 46, no. 21 p.11497-11504dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes300612c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03899naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245014900211300001800360520221800378592002802596596006402624596006602688650001102754650001702765650001602782650002302798650002602821650001302847650001902860650001502879650002302894650001302917650001602930650001702946650002402963650000902987650001202996650001603008650001803024650001903042700002403061700002603085700002903111700001903140700002203159773010903181856008203290852000903372655001203381IND60676318020221118010551.0191114e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067631802DNAL7 a10.1007/s11252-019-00892-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerra, Sónia R.

However, these streams are under multiple-stressors, including artificialization of the channel and flow, poor water quality and cut of riparian vegetation which puts in risk their ecological integrity and consequently their services. In this study, we aimed to understand variations in macroinvertebrate communities and in biological condition as a response to flow and water quality, by following a Mediterranean urban stream over 8 months (December–July). With a monthly periodicity, we sampled invertebrate communities and characterized in situ water physicochemical parameters. The urban stream studied showed a high variation of environmental factors over time. Invertebrate communities were generally poor, with some Ephemeroptera (Baetis sp.) but was dominated by Chironomidae and Oligochaeta that changed over time alongside with environmental conditions. Biological quality based on the Portuguese Invertebrates Index (IPtIS) varied between poor and bad. Multivariate community patterns (at genus level) showed variations in communities over time, as well as in their biological trait patterns (invertebrates’ maximal size, reproduction mode, resistance form, feeding habits and locomotion mode). Periods displaying worse biological quality, less diverse communities and lower functional richness corresponded to peaks of discharge, higher conductivity and hardness while the best quality communities were found under lower nitrate concentrations. Our study points out that the detection of impacts or recovery in urban streams through invertebrate communities might require at least the use of genus level as family level does not detect smoother changes. Communities reflect the complex interplay of environmental variables affecting structural and functional natural patterns and ultimately the biological condition of this urban stream. Rehabilitation measures should carefully consider this complex interplay of variables to enhance quality and ecosystem services.  aPublisher supplied data  aPD\BD\52510\2014cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  aUID/MAR/04292/2013cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia 3aBaetis 3aChironomidae 3aOligochaeta 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental factors 3ahardness 3ahydrochemistry 3alocomotion 3amacroinvertebrates 3anitrates 3aperiodicity 3areproduction 3ariparian vegetation 3arisk 3astreams 3aurban areas 3awater quality 3awater quantity1 aCalapez, Ana Raquel1 aSimões, Nuno Eduardo1 aSá Marques, José A.

Transmitters that provide high spatial resolution have only recently become available for small-bodied animals and show promise for providing new information on habitat use. However, as with any new technology it is important to assess adverse effects on study species. We tested the efficacy of using 1.1-g miniaturized GPS units to document the breeding and post-breeding movements of adult Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) from the federally threatened Atlantic Coast population. We also assessed the potential impact of these miniaturized GPS units on nest survival, chick survival, and apparent adult survival rates. We found that Piping Plover movements to and from nesting areas were related to tidal stage, we documented Piping Plovers to be using previously undocumented foraging areas during the breeding season, and we obtained fine resolution habitat use data for two birds on their wintering areas in the Bahamas. The attachment of a GPS tag had no effect on apparent weekly survival of adults, and we found no differences in daily nest survival and chick survival rates between pairs with GPS tags and controls. GPS tags did not appear to adversely impact Piping Plovers during the breeding season, yet lower return rates of GPS tagged birds than controls might suggest potential negative effects on survival. While GPS tags offer a valuable tool to evaluate habitat use of this threatened species on the breeding grounds, long-term tracking needs further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCharadrius melodus 3aadults 3achicks 3acoasts 3aendangered species 3ahabitat preferences 3ahumans 3anests 3awater birds 3aBahamas 0aapparent survival 0achick survival 0anest survival 0aPiping Plover 0aresearcher effect 0ashorebird1 aCohen, Jonathan B.0 tWaterbirds.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 43, no. 3-4 p.271-280dWaterbirds SocietywJournal:6297x1524-46957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.043.03053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011700161300002000278520133300298592002801631650003401659650002101693650001201714650001201726650000901738650001501747650002301762650001201785650001701797650001701814650001301831650001101844700002701855700001701882700001601899773012701915856007502042852000902117655001202126IND60534438320221120044548.0160802e20121106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053443832DNAL7 a10.1021/es300991u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBisson, Teresa
M.10aCharacterization of Mercury Binding onto a Novel Brominated Biomass Ash Sorbent by X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy  ap. 12186-12193.  aRecent laboratory and field-scale experiments demonstrated the potential for brominated industrial solid waste from biomass combustion (Br-Ash) to be an efficient, cost-effective alternative to activated carbon for capturing mercury from coal-fired power plants. To develop this attractive alternative technology to a commercially sustainable level, a better understanding of mercury capture mechanisms by Br-Ash is required. For this purpose, X-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) spectra of Br-Ash were collected at the Hg LIII-edge, Br K-edge and S K-edge, and analyzed to determine the local bonding environment of mercury atoms. The coordination environment of Hg was compared with that on a commercial brominated activated carbon. Our results indicate that the mercury was captured by chemisorption on both the commercial and biomass ash sorbents; however, the mercury binding environment was different for each sorbent. Mercury was found to bind to the reduced sulfur by the commercial brominated activated carbon, in contrast to mercury binding with carbon and bromine on the brominated biomass ash. Based on the results obtained, a mechanism of Hg capture involving oxidation of elemental Hg followed by binding of the oxidized mercury on the surface of the sorbent near Br was proposed for the brominated biomass ash.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aactivated carbon 3abiomass 3abromine 3acoal 3acombustion 3acost effectiveness 3amercury 3apower plants 3asolid wastes 3asorbents 3asulfur1 aMacLean, Lachlan C.

A total of 65 insect samples collected from sesame fields in Antalya, Turkey, during 2012–2014 were tested for phytoplasma detection. Phytoplasmas detected in fifteen samples showed an amplicon approximately 1250 bp in size using the universal primers of P1/P7 and R16F2n/R16R2. Identification of the phytoplasmas by sequence analysis revealed three different 16S rDNA phytoplasma groups: the peanut witches’‐broom, group II; clover proliferation, group VI; and pigeon pea witches’‐broom, group IX. The molecular characterization of subgroups was determined by sequence analysis and PCR‐RFLP using the restriction enzymes RsaI and TaqI. Restriction profiles of the subgroups were also confirmed using the iPhyclassifier program. BLAST and PCR‐RFLP analyses classified the subgroups as II‐D, VI‐A and IX‐C. This is the first report of molecular detection of three 16S rDNA subgroups of phytoplasmas, II‐D, VI‐A and IX‐C, from N. haematoceps in Turkey. This study also supports earlier studies of sesame phyllody phytoplasmas by N. haematoceps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicadellidae 3aPhytoplasma 3ainsects 3apeanuts 3aphyllody 3apigeon peas 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asequence analysis 3aTurkey (country)0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2018 Apr., v. 166, no. 4 p.242-248dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000109x0931-17857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jph.126813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245006300171300001600234520177200250592002802022650002302050650001302073650002102086650001202107650001502119650001602134650001202150650001402162650001502176650001802191650002002209650003802229650001702267650001302284650000902297650002202306650001902328653001702347653001602364653004002380653001402420700002002434700001802454700002002472700002302492773012902515856008102644852000902725655001202734IND60654941620221123033440.0190727e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065494162DNAL7 a10.1017/S00220299160002972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Funmilola C10aEarly post parturient changes in milk acute phase proteins  ap. 352-359.  aThe periparturient period is one of the most critical periods in the productive life of a dairy cow, and is the period when dairy cows are most susceptible to developing new intramammary infections (IMI) leading to mastitis. Acute phase proteins (APP) such as haptoglobin (Hp), mammary associated serum amyloid A3 (M-SAA3) and C-reactive protein (CRP) have been detected in milk during mastitis but their presence in colostrum and milk in the immediate postpartum period has had limited investigation. The hypothesis was tested that APP are a constituent of colostrum and milk during this period. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used to determine each APP's concentration in colostrum and milk collected daily from the first to tenth day following calving in 22 Holstein-Friesian dairy cows. Haptoglobin was assessed in individual quarters and composite milk samples while M-SAA3 and CRP concentration were determined in composite milk samples. Change in Hp in relation to the high abundance proteins during the transition from colostrum to milk were evaluated by 1 and 2 dimension electrophoresis and western blot. In 80% of the cows all APPs were detected in colostrum on the first day following parturition at moderately high levels but gradually decreased to minimal values in the milk by the 6ᵗʰ day after calving. The remaining cows (20%) showed different patterns in the daily milk APP concentrations and when an elevated level is detected could reflect the presence of IMI. Demonstration that APP are present in colostrum and milk following parturition but fall to low levels within 4 days means that elevated APP after this time could be biomarkers of post parturient mastitis allowing early intervention to reduce disease on dairy farms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aHolstein 3aWestern blotting 3aamyloid 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acalving 3acolostrum 3adairy cows 3adairy farming 3aelectrophoresis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahaptoglobins 3amastitis 3amilk 3apostpartum period 3audder quarters 0aPost-calving 0ahaptoglobin 0amammary associated serum amyloid A3 0adairy cow1 aWaterston, Mary1 aHastie, Peter1 aHaining, Hayley1 aEckersall, P David0 tJournal of dairy research.g2016 Aug., v. 83, no. 3 p.352-359dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45499x1469-76297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299160002973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245007100167300001600238520097400254592002801228650002101256650001901277650001401296650001201310650001301322650001401335650002401349700002101373700001801394773012801412856008201540852000901622655001201631IND60089628220221120025639.0141102e20120824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008962822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.07.1132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Maruf H.14aThe role of MAP4K3 in lifespan regulation of Caenorhabditiselegans  ap. 413-418.  aThe TOR pathway is a kinase signaling pathway that regulates cellular growth and proliferation in response to nutrients and growth factors. TOR signaling is also important in lifespan regulation – when this pathway is inhibited, either naturally, by genetic mutation, or by pharmacological means, lifespan is extended. MAP4K3 is a Ser/Thr kinase that has recently been found to be involved in TOR activation. Unexpectedly, the effect of this protein is not mediated via Rheb, the more widely known TOR activation pathway. Given the role of TOR in growth and lifespan control, we looked at how inhibiting MAP4K3 in Caenorhabditiselegans affects lifespan. We used both feeding RNAi and genetic mutants to look at the effect of MAP4K3 deficiency. Our results show a small but significant increase in mean lifespan in MAP4K3 deficient worms. MAP4K3 thus represents a new target in the TOR pathway that can be targeted for pharmacological intervention to control lifespan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3agrowth factors 3alongevity 3amutants 3amutation 3anutrients 3asignal transduction1 aHart, Matthew J.1 aRea, Shane L.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Aug. 24, v. 425, no. 2 p.413-418dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.07.1133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012600160300001600286500001400302520153900316592002801855650001501883650001201898650001801910650001501928650001001943650001801953650001301971650001101984650001001995650001702005650001102022650001902033650001002052650001602062650001202078650001402090650002402104650002902128653000802157653000802165653000902173653003302182653001202215653002602227700002602253700001902279700002202298700002102320700002502341700002302366700002902389773009402418856007302512852000902585655001202594IND60690007320221119005408.0200424e20120701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069000732DNAL7 a10.4161/fly.202472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSloan, Roketa S.10aCharacterization of null and hypomorphic alleles of the Drosophila l(2)dtl/cdt2 genebLarval lethality and male fertility  ap. 173-183.  aNAL-light  aThe Drosophila lethal(2)denticleless (l(2)dtl) gene was originally reported as essential for embryogenesis and formation of the rows of tiny hairs on the larval ventral cuticle known as denticle belts. It is now well-established that l(2)dtl (also called cdt2) encodes a subunit of a Cullin 4-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets a number of key cell cycle regulatory proteins, including p21, Cdt1, E2F1 and Set8, to prevent replication defects and maintain cell cycle control. To investigate the role of l(2)dtl/cdt2 during development, we characterized existing l(2)dtl/cdt2 mutants and generated new deletion alleles, using P-element excision mutagenesis. Surprisingly, homozygous l(2)dtl/cdt2 mutant embryos developed beyond embryogenesis, had intact denticle belts, and lacked an observable embryonic replication defect. These mutants died during larval stages, affirming that loss of l(2)dtl/cdt2 function is lethal. Our data show that L(2)dtl/Cdt2 is maternally deposited, remains nuclear throughout the cell cycle, and has a previously unreported, elevated expression in the developing gonads. We also find that E2f1 regulates l(2)dtl/cdt2 expression during embryogenesis, possibly via several highly conserved putative E2f1 binding sites near the l(2)dtl/cdt2 promoter. Finally, hypomorphic allele combinations of the l(2)dtl/cdt2 gene result in a novel phenotype: viable, low-fertility males. We conclude that “denticleless” is a misnomer, but that l(2)dtl/cdt2 is an essential gene for Drosophila development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aalleles 3abinding sites 3acell cycle 3adeath 3aembryogenesis 3aexcision 3agonads 3ahairs 3ahomozygosity 3alarvae 3amale fertility 3amales 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aregulatory proteins 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 0aCRL 0aE2F 0acdt2 0aembryonic gonadal expression 0al(2)dtl 0alethal(2)denticleless1 aSwanson, Christina I.1 aGavilano, Lily1 aSmith, Kristen N.1 aMalek, Pamela Y.1 aSnow-Smith, Mayronne1 aDuronio, Robert J.1 aKey, S.

The adsorption parameters optimized were: initial Cr(VI) concentration (10–30 mg L−1), contact time (180 min), adsorbent dose (2.0 g L−1), initial pH (2.0), temperature (30–50 °C), and agitation speed (250 rpm). Freundlich isotherm was found better fitted with a high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.97 for mixed waste tea and 0.92 for coffee ground) than to Langmuir model (R2 = 0.89 for mixed waste tea and 0.86 for coffee ground) for the 10–250 mg L−1 concentration range. Analysis of kinetic studies indicated that Cr(VI) adsorption by both adsorbents was consistent with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model with a good R2 and Marquardt's present standard deviation (MPSD) values. Experimental data demonstrated a sorption capacity of 94.34 mg g−1 of mixed waste tea and 87.72 mg g−1 of coffee ground. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) revealed the noticeable chromium accumulation on the adsorbent surfaces after adsorption. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies showed that carbon and oxygen functional groups on the surface of both adsorbents involved in Cr(VI) adsorption. The adsorbents could be reused four times. Large-scale operation using 100 L of packed-bed reactor showed the breakthrough time of adsorption for mixed waste tea of 30 min in 100 mg L−1 Cr(VI) concentration. These results suggested that mixed waste tea and coffee ground be considered as alternative adsorbent for Cr(VI) removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aagitation 3acarbon 3achromium 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3akinetics 3amoieties 3aoxygen 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3astandard deviation 3atea 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awastewater 0aCr(VI) removal 0aAdsorption isotherm 0aAdsorption kinetics 0aBeverage wastes1 aNithettham, Srisuda1 aCharoenpanich, Jittima0 tChemosphere.g2019 Apr., v. 221 p.758-767dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.01.1003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03534naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245008400166520194500250592002802195650001602223650001902239650001202258650002402270650002102294650002202315650002002337650001302357650001502370650001702385650001302402650003302415650001802448650001002466650002102476653000802497653000802505653000802513653000802521653000802529653000702537653004202544653003002586653002702616653002002643653002902663653002002692700001702712700001702729773011602746856008402862961001302946852000902959655001202968IND60773156320221121235852.0220606e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077315632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2022.1076402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorwin, D.L.10aModified ECa – ECe protocols for mapping soil salinity under micro-irrigation  aClimate change will increase the frequency and intensity of drought in water-scarce agricultural areas that rely on irrigation. The increased strain on finite water resources for irrigated agriculture will cause a shift from sprinkler and flood irrigation to micro-irrigation. Micro-irrigation results in complex 3-dimensional salinity patterns. Current field-scale apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECₐ) directed soil sampling protocols and guidelines are inadequate for mapping the complex local-scale 3-dimensional nature of salinity resulting from water applications by micro-irrigation systems (i.e., drip, buried drip, micro sprinklers, bubblers, etc.). A field study was conducted to develop additional ECₐ-directed soil sampling guidelines to map local- and field-scale variability in salinity under drip-irrigation systems within a commercial nut production orchard (i.e., pistachio orchard) using hard (i.e., salinity or ECₑ, electrical conductivity of the saturation extract) and soft data (i.e., geospatial ECₐ measurements), which required an accurate ECₐ – ECₑ calibration. The revised ECₐ-directed soil sampling guidelines for drip irrigation on a mature pistachio orchard indicate that a single soil core should be taken 0.9–1.2 m perpendicular to the drip line within the tree root system, rather than at the drip line, to improve the ECₐ – ECₑ calibration.

Although pollinators often forage at different sites in response to spatiotemporal variations in floral resources, little is known about the differences in pollinator foraging between urban and nearby natural environments. We monitored the foraging patterns of bumblebees in open and forest habitats in two areas with and without urban gardens with respect to flowering phenology and the availability of floral resources in each habitat. Floral richness in the forest habitat decreased as the season progressed, with a peak in late spring to early summer, whereas floral resources in the open habitat increased late in the season. Thus, floral resources in the open habitat could compensate for seasonal declines in forest floral resources. In the urban area, which contained green gardens, floral richness in the open habitat was much greater than that in the forest habitat. This resulted in a relatively high density of bumblebees in the open habitat in the urban area compared with those in the natural area, which lacked green gardens. Visitation frequency of bumblebees to forest flowers decreased as the floral richness of the open habitat increased. These results suggest that although urban gardens are important foraging sites for pollinators, the high attractiveness of garden flowers reduces pollinator visits to wildflowers in nearby forests. This may result in reduced pollination of native flowers.  aPublisher supplied data  a15H02641cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aBombus 3aflowering 3aflowers 3aforage 3aforaging 3aforest habitats 3aforests 3agardens 3ahabitat preferences 3aornamental plants 3aphenology 3apollination 3apollinators 3aspatial variation 3aspring 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3awild flowers1 aKudo, Gaku0 tUrban ecosystems.g2019 Dec., v. 22, no. 6 p.1097-1112dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870259x1083-81557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-019-00891-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245007700163300002000240520109700260592002801357650001501385650001301400650001401413650001901427650001901446650001301465650001501478650002001493650002201513650001401535700005401549700005501603700001501658700005501673773017401728856008001902852000901982655001201991IND60751109720221122054857.0210922e20210913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075110972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c022692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNg, E.

However, a holistic review of the fundamentals and desirable selection criteria for different types of antifoams for the gas sweetening process is scarcely available. Therefore, this review analyses the selection criteria of each type of antifoam for acid gas sweetening, particularly silicone, polyether glycol, alcohol, and blended-based antifoams. These selection criteria are crucial in defining the properties and antifoaming performance in terms of solubility, dispersibility, surface tension, viscosity, defoaming rate, thermal stability, stability of defoaming performance, potential hazard, and chemical inertness. Hence, this review provides valuable insight into the existing and potential antifoams that could be employed in the acid gas sweetening process along with their distinctive antifoaming ability, benefits, and drawbacks. From this review, blended antifoam is able to fulfill most of the selection criteria and will be further explored in a subsequent study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aalcohols 3adefoaming 3adispersibility 3aprocess design 3asilicone 3asolubility 3asurface tension 3athermal stability 3aviscosity1 aLau, K.

Immobilized GI is often used due to increased stability as well as the expensive costs associated with free GI. In this study, GI was immobilized on silica/chitosan hybrid microspheres via simple process through in situ encapsulation. Enhanced rate of reaction was observed when the conversion of glucose to fructose was completed in 10min catalyzed by immobilized GI because most GI was located on the shell of the support. Moreover, it was found that immobilized GI exhibited better pH, temperature, ions, storage and operation stability when compared to free GI. The relative enzyme activity was found to be above 90% with a wide pH range of 5.8–8.0, temperature range of 40–80°C, storage range of 3 months and an increase in operation range of >15 times. Therefore, immobilized GI supported by silica/chitosan hybrid microspheres is an ideal candidate for biocatalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocatalysis 3acatalysts 3achitosan 3aencapsulation 3aenzyme activity 3afood industry 3afructose 3aglucose 3aions 3apH 3asilica 3atemperature 0aGlucose isomerase 0aImmobilization 0aSilica/chitosan hybrid microspheres 0aActivity 0aStability1 aCui, Qing1 aShah, Vishva1 aXu, Jianhong1 aWang, Tao0 tJournal of molecular catalysis.g2016 Apr., v. 126 p.18-23dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12410x1381-11777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcatb.2016.01.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100001700175245003300192300001400225520094800239592002801187650001501215650001601230650001201246650001301258650001501271650000901286650001401295650001801309650001001327650001501337650002301352700002201375700002101397700001701418700002201435773014901457856006801606856006401674990002301738852000901761655001201770IND60643277520221122223636.0190510e20110712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064327752DNAL7 a10.3791/25232doi7 aPMC31961882pmcid7 a217759622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Chi-Ling10aMouse bladder wall injection  ap. e2523.  aMouse bladder wall injection is a useful technique to orthotopically study bladder phenomena, including stem cell, smooth muscle, and cancer biology. Before starting injections, the surgical area must be cleaned with soap and water and antiseptic solution. Surgical equipment must be sterilized before use and between each animal. Each mouse is placed under inhaled isoflurane anesthesia (2-5% for induction, 1-3% for maintenance) and its bladder exposed by making a midline abdominal incision with scissors. If the bladder is full, it is partially decompressed by gentle squeezing between two fingers. The cell suspension of interest is intramurally injected into the wall of the bladder dome using a 29 or 30 gauge needle and 1 cc or smaller syringe. The wound is then closed using wound clips and the mouse allowed to recover on a warming pad. Bladder wall injection is a delicate microsurgical technique that can be mastered with practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanesthesia 3aantiseptics 3abladder 3acleaning 3aisoflurane 3amice 3aneoplasms 3asmooth muscle 3asoaps 3astem cells 3asurgical equipment1 aApelo, Charity A.1 aTorres, Baldemar1 aThai, Kim H.1 aHsieh, Michael H.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2011 July 12, , no. 53 p.e2523-e2523dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/25233Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/2523/mouse-bladder-wall-injection  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245011800162300002000280520156300300592002801863650001401891650001801905650001501923650001901938650001601957650001401973700001701987700005102004700005702055773017402112856008002286852000902366655001202375IND60751109920221120203150.0210922e20210908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075110992DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c023072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jibin10aData-Driven Prediction of Minimum Fluidization Velocity in Gas-Fluidized Beds Using Data Extracted by Text Mining  ap. 13727-13739.  aMinimum fluidization velocity (Uₘf) is of fundamental importance in gas fluidization. Lots of empirical correlations have so far been reported in the literature to calculate Uₘf. However, Uₘf is affected by numerous factors, including, among others, the operation conditions and physical properties of both solids and gases. The applicability of empirical correlations relies essentially on the experiments upon which they were developed, and in practice, the choice of Uₘf is a matter of the knowledge and experience of chemical engineers. In this work, we proposed to establish a database by extracting experimental data of Uₘf from open literature using the text mining technique. We first presented a pipeline of natural language processing to identify and extract the functional parameters related to Uₘf with 83% accuracy from ∼40 000 papers. A database of Uₘf containing eight impacting factors, i.e., particle diameter, particle density, particle sphericity, bed voidage at minimum fluidization, gas density, gas viscosity, operating temperature, and pressure, was created. We then used a data-driven machine learning method with the extracting data to predict Uₘf, which is shown superior over the empirical correlations by achieving higher accuracy for a much wider range of gas–solid systems. We expect this work illustrates a potential and promising approach to make use of the huge amount of experimental data in the literature and replace the empirical correlations in practical chemical engineering design and operations.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3aparticle size 3aprediction 3aprocess design 3atemperature 3aviscosity1 aLiu, Duiping1 aYe, Mao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7078-24021 aLiu, Zhongmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7999-29400 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 Sept. 08, v. 60, no. 37 p.13727-13739dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c023073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245009300154300001600247500001400263520153200277592002801809650001501837650002701852650001601879650001601895650001901911650002001930650001201950650002001962650001301982650002401995650001502019650002302034653002202057653002502079653001202104653001002116700001902126773009402145856007302239852000902312655001202321IND60690007620221119005439.0200424e20120701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069000762DNAL7 a10.4161/fly.207752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPing, Yong10aHomeostatic plasticity in Drosophila central neurons, and implications in human diseases  ap. 153-157.  aNAL-light  aSynaptic homeostasis is a form of neuronal plasticity that stabilizes activity of neural networks. Both presynaptic and postsynaptic effects are well documented in response to activity changes. The electrical signaling machinery of individual neurons, or intrinsic properties, have also been implicated in this plasticity. How synaptic and intrinsic changes are coordinated, however, is still a puzzle. A recent study by Ping and Tsunoda shows both synaptic and intrinsic changes in Drosophila central neurons in response to prolonged inactivity.¹ Changes include the upregulation of Dα7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and Shal (Kᵥ4) potassium channels. This work has two noteworthy findings. First, although mediated by different receptors, synaptic homeostasis in the central nervous system (CNS) is conserved across species. This is perhaps the most direct demonstration that nAChRs mediate synaptic homeostasis. Changes in the expression of nAChRs have long been noted during development, as well as during pathological conditions, such as nicotine addiction² and Alzheimer disease.³ The second interesting finding is the relationship between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity: nAChRs are upregulated immediately, subsequently triggering a rapid increase in Shal K⁺ channels. This novel mechanism regulates synaptic homeostasis to stabilize synaptic potentials. This study sets the stage for Drosophila central neurons as a model for cholinergic synaptic homeostasis, its regulation and role in disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3acentral nervous system 3aexhibitions 3ahomeostasis 3ahuman diseases 3aneural networks 3aneurons 3aneuroplasticity 3anicotine 3anicotinic receptors 3aplasticity 3apotassium channels 0aShal/Kv4 channels 0aSynaptic homeostasis 0adisease 0anAChR1 aTsunoda, Susan0 tFly.g2012 July 1, v. 6, no. 3 p.153-157dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2251x1933-69427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/fly.207753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002100175245007200196300001400268520143500282592002801717650001301745650001801758650001001776650001301786650001701799650001001816650000901826650001401835650001401849650002001863650002701883650003101910700001801941700002501959773014801984856006802132856010302200990002302303852000902326655001202335IND60643277620221122233510.0190510e20110505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064327762DNAL7 a10.3791/25252doi7 aPMC31970992pmcid7 a215871592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoeppen, Michael10aPressure controlled ventilation to induce acute lung injury in mice  ap. e2525.  aMurine models are extensively used to investigate acute injuries of different organs systems (1-34). Acute lung injury (ALI), which occurs with prolonged mechanical ventilation, contributes to morbidity and mortality of critical illness, and studies on novel genetic or pharmacological targets are areas of intense investigation (1-3, 5, 8, 26, 30, 33-36). ALI is defined by the acute onset of the disease, which leads to non-cardiac pulmonary edema and subsequent impairment of pulmonary gas exchange (36). We have developed a murine model of ALI by using a pressure-controlled ventilation to induce ventilator-induced lung injury (2). For this purpose, C57BL/6 mice are anesthetized and a tracheotomy is performed followed by induction of ALI via mechanical ventilation. Mice are ventilated in a pressure-controlled setting with an inspiratory peak pressure of 45 mbar over 1 - 3 hours. As outcome parameters, pulmonary edema (wet-to-dry ratio), bronchoalveolar fluid albumin content, bronchoalveolar fluid and pulmonary tissue myeloperoxidase content and pulmonary gas exchange are assessed (2). Using this technique we could show that it sufficiently induces acute lung inflammation and can distinguish between different treatment groups or genotypes (1-3, 5). Therefore this technique may be helpful for researchers who pursue molecular mechanisms involved in ALI using a genetic approach in mice with gene-targeted deletion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3aanimal models 3aedema 3agenotype 3ainflammation 3alungs 3amice 3amorbidity 3amortality 3amyeloperoxidase 3apulmonary gas exchange 3arespiratory tract diseases1 aEckle, Tobias1 aEltzschig, Holger K.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2011 May 05, , no. 51 p.e2525-e2525dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/25253Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/2525/pressure-controlled-ventilation-to-induce-acute-lung-injury-in-mice  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245008300157300002000240520169700260592002801957650001501985650001502000650001402015650001402029650002402043650000902067650001502076650002102091650001202112650001602124650002802140650001902168650001502187650000902202650001902211700001902230700002102249700002302270700002302293700001902316700001802335773012702353856007502480852000902555655001202564IND60534438720170606000000.0160802e20121106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053443872DNAL7 a10.1021/es30153272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJonsson, Sofi10aMercury Methylation Rates for Geochemically Relevant HgII Species in Sediments  ap. 11653-11659.  aMonomethylmercury (MeHg) in fish from freshwater, estuarine, and marine environments is a major global environmental issue. Mercury levels in biota are mainly controlled by the methylation of inorganic mercuric mercury (Hgᴵᴵ) to MeHg in water, sediments, and soils. There is, however, a knowledge gap concerning the mechanisms and rates of methylation of specific geochemical Hgᴵᴵ species. Such information is crucial for a better understanding of variations in MeHg concentrations among ecosystems and, in particular, for predicting the outcome of currently proposed measures to mitigate mercury emissions and reduce MeHg concentrations in fish. To fill this knowledge gap we propose an experimental approach using Hgᴵᴵ isotope tracers, with defined and geochemically important adsorbed and solid Hgᴵᴵ forms in sediments, to study MeHg formation. We report Hgᴵᴵ methylation rate constants, kₘ, in estuarine sediments which span over 2 orders of magnitude depending on chemical form of added tracer: metacinnabar (β-²⁰¹HgS(s)) < cinnabar (α-¹⁹⁹HgS(s)) < Hgᴵᴵ reacted with mackinawite (≡FeS-²⁰²Hgᴵᴵ) < Hgᴵᴵ bonded to natural organic matter (NOM-¹⁹⁶Hgᴵᴵ) < a typical aqueous tracer (¹⁹⁸Hg(NO₃)₂(aq)). We conclude that a combination of thermodynamic and kinetic effects of Hgᴵᴵ solid-phase dissolution and surface desorption control the Hgᴵᴵ methylation rate in sediments and cause the large observed differences in kₘ-values. The selection of relevant solid-phase and surface-adsorbed Hgᴵᴵ tracers will therefore be crucial to achieving biogeochemically accurate estimates of ambient Hgᴵᴵ methylation rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesorption 3aecosystems 3aemissions 3aestuaries 3aestuarine sediments 3afish 3afreshwater 3aisotope labeling 3amercury 3amethylation 3amethylmercury compounds 3aorganic matter 3aprediction 3asoil 3athermodynamics1 aSkyllberg, Ulf1 aNilsson, Mats B.1 aWestlund, Per-Olof1 aShchukarev, Andrey1 aLundberg, Erik1 aBjørn, Erik,0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2012 Nov. 06, v. 46, no. 21 p.11653-11659dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes30153273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02002naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002400148245005600172300001600228520075100244592002800995650001301023650001701036650002201053700002101075700001601096700002101112700001901133700002601152700002001178700002301198700001901221700002001240700002001260700002201280700002601302700002301328700001701351773011901368856008401487852000901571655001201580IND4487734920221120193144.0141110e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448773492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cosust.2011.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScholes, Robert J.,10aBuilding a global observing system for biodiversity  ap. 139-146.  aThe Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON) has been in formal existence for three years, following several years of design and discussion.

Since these functionalities are highly dependent on the degree of hydrolysis (DH) of the hydrolysates, the enzymatic hydrolysis process must be carefully controlled. Hydrolysates with both free amino acids and long-chain peptides are usually not desirable which leads to strict requirements for the commercial peptidases used. In the study presented, we characterized ten commercially available peptidase preparations in respect of the production of protein hydrolysates with defined compositions. Therefore, we utilized a three-step methodology to investigate the composition of the commercial peptidase preparations and to characterize the obtained protein hydrolysates applying a HPLC-based system for automated small-scale enzymatic reaction and analysis. With the presented methodology we identified two suitable preparations for the production of hydrolysates with high DH and high amounts of free amino acids, and six suitable preparations for the production of hydrolysates with low DH and negligible release of amino acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3acatalytic activity 3adietary protein 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afoods 3afree amino acids 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3apeptidases 3apeptides 3aprotein hydrolysates 0aACE 0aBis–tris-propane 0aDH 0ah 0ahtot 0aIS 0aLOD 0aLOQ 0aM* 0aOPA 0aSDS-Page 0aTCA 0aCommercial peptidases 0aPeptidase composition 0aMethodology 0aAmino acid release 0aAutomated enzymatic hydrolysis 0aFunctional hydrolysates1 aClaaßen, Wolfgang1 aAppel, Daniel1 aBerends, Pieter1 aRabe, Swen1 aBlank, Imre1 aStressler, Timo1 aFischer, Lutz0 tJournal of molecular catalysis.g2016 May, v. 127 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12410x1381-11777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcatb.2016.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245012900178300001600307520148400323592002801807650002001835650002001855650002001875650001401895650001601909650001401925650001401939650002001953650001301973650002601986650002502012650002302037650000902060651000902069653001802078653002002096653002002116653001802136653002702154773012902181856008102310852000902391655001202400IND60654942120221117165400.0190727e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065494212DNAL7 a10.1017/S00220299160003402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHossein-Zadeh, Navid Ghavi10aModelling lactation curve for milk fat to protein ratio in Iranian buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) using non-linear mixed models  ap. 334-340.  aThe aim of this study was to compare seven non-linear mathematical models (Brody, Wood, Dhanoa, Sikka, Nelder, Rook and Dijkstra) to examine their efficiency in describing the lactation curves for milk fat to protein ratio (FPR) in Iranian buffaloes. Data were 43 818 test-day records for FPR from the first three lactations of Iranian buffaloes which were collected on 523 dairy herds in the period from 1996 to 2012 by the Animal Breeding Center of Iran. Each model was fitted to monthly FPR records of buffaloes using the non-linear mixed model procedure (PROC NLMIXED) in SAS and the parameters were estimated. The models were tested for goodness of fit using Akaike's information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and log maximum likelihood (−2 Log L). The Nelder and Sikka mixed models provided the best fit of lactation curve for FPR in the first and second lactations of Iranian buffaloes, respectively. However, Wood, Dhanoa and Sikka mixed models provided the best fit of lactation curve for FPR in the third parity buffaloes. Evaluation of first, second and third lactation features showed that all models, except for Dijkstra model in the third lactation, under-predicted test time at which daily FPR was minimum. On the other hand, minimum FPR was over-predicted by all equations. Evaluation of the different models used in this study indicated that non-linear mixed models were sufficient for fitting test-day FPR records of Iranian buffaloes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aBubalus bubalis 3aanimal breeding 3abuffaloes 3adairy herds 3aequations 3alactation 3alactation curve 3amilk fat 3aparity (reproduction) 3astatistical analysis 3astatistical models 3awood 3aIran 0aDairy buffalo 0alactation model 0amilk components 0amodel fitting 0anon-linear mixed model0 tJournal of dairy research.g2016 Aug., v. 83, no. 3 p.334-340dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45499x1469-76297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299160003403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02295naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011100162300001400273520109000287592002801377650002101405650002401426650001601450650001101466650001601477650001601493650001501509650001201524650001101536650002601547700001601573700001701589700001501606700001501621700001801636773015201654856008201806852000901888655001201897IND60588864320221120044408.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058886432DNAL7 a10.1007/s10295-017-1990-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xue10aEngineering Escherichia coli for efficient coproduction of polyhydroxyalkanoates and 5-aminolevulinic acid  ap. 43-51.  aSingle-cell biorefineries are an interesting strategy for using different components of feedstock to produce multiple high-value biochemicals. In this study, a strategy was applied to refine glucose and fatty acid to produce 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). To express the ALA and PHAs dual-production system efficiently and stably, multiple copies of the poly-β-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthesis operon were integrated into the chromosome of Escherichia coli DH5αΔpoxB. The above strain harboring the ALA C5 synthesis pathway genes hemA and hemL resulted in coproduction of 38.2% PHB (cell dry weight, CDW) and 3.2 g/L extracellular ALA. To explore coproduction of ALA and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV), the PHBV synthetic pathway was also integrated into engineered E. coli and coexpressed with hemA and hemL; cells produced 38.9% PHBV (CDW) with 10.3 mol% 3HV fractions and 3.0 g/L ALA. The coproduction of ALA with PHB and PHBV can improve the utilization of carbon sources and maximize the value derived from the feedstock.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aaminolevulinic acid 3abiorefining 3acarbon 3achromosomes 3afatty acids 3afeedstocks 3aglucose 3aoperon 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates1 aZhang, Jian1 aXu, Jiasheng1 aZhao, Qian1 aWang, Qian1 aQi, Qingsheng0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2018 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.43-51dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl54684x1367-54357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-017-1990-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245012200166300001400288520162300302592002801925650002001953650001501973650002101988650002202009650001102031650002402042650001002066650001402076650002702090650002602117650002302143650001102166650002502177650000702202650000902209650001002218650000802228650001102236650001102247650001802258650001002276651001902286700001902305700001802324773009202342856008102434852000902515655001202524IND4467599720221118095632.0141110e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446759972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2012.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKettlewell, P.S.10aIs the control of green area index of barley crops by application of alkaline materials possible in field conditions?  ap. 38-41.  aThe risk of excessive leaf canopy growth in winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) grown in the UK is usually reduced by avoiding very early sowing at high seed rates, and in spring by delaying and reducing nitrogen fertilizer application. A preliminary study was conducted of a possible additional agronomic method for retarding winter barley leaf growth in spring. The study was based on previous plant physiological experiments showing that drought-induced reduction in leaf growth of barley is mediated by increasing alkalinity of the xylem sap. Leaf extension was measured in plants detached from the roots and fed artificial xylem sap adjusted to a wide range of pH. A field experiment tested the effects on barley canopy growth of solid calcium carbonate and alkaline pH buffer solution application to the foliage. Rate of leaf extension in the detached plant experiments decreased linearly with increasing artificial xylem sap pH, confirming the previous results in a different cultivar. Rate of canopy growth in the field experiment was halved by application of 1000kg/ha of calcium carbonate up to four days after application. In contrast at six and eight days after application, following rain, compensatory growth occurred and the rate of increase in canopy size was larger with increasing calcium carbonate application rate. A pH buffer spray gave similar results but was less effective at reducing canopy growth. An improvement in persistence of the reduction in canopy growth by alkaline materials is needed before the potential for retarding leaf growth as an additional agronomic practice can be assessed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aalkalinity 3aapplication rate 3acalcium carbonate 3acanopy 3acompensatory growth 3acrops 3acultivars 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3agrowth retardation 3aleaves 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apH 3arain 3aroots 3asap 3asowing 3aspring 3awinter barley 3axylem 3aUnited Kingdom1 aRichardson, A.1 aSnelson, M.W.0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2012 Aug., v. 41 p.38-41dElsevier B.V.x1161-03017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2012.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245005200184300001600236520090500252592002801157650001001185650001601195650002301211650001801234650001601252650001201268650001801280650002201298650001201320650002501332650001101357650001401368650002301382650001601405650001301421650002101434650001801455653001501473653001601488653003101504653001901535653002301554700002401577700002201601700002001623700002001643700002601663700002701689700002501716773010401741856008501845852000901930655001201939IND60558756720221122145127.0161115e20170704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055875672DNAL7 a10.1080/87559129.2016.11750112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoureiro, Guilherme A.

Research studies have developed standards for aspects of cacao quality that meet industrial criteria as well as international import and export legislation that is aimed at food security. This review focused on selected attributes of cacao bean quality. These attributes include the amount of acids, simple carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids, lipids, phenolic substances, and methylxanthines. Other attributes are bean moisture content, quantity of mineral nutrients, and presence of potentially toxic elements. Microbiological and organoleptic attributes are also of interest. Future research on cacao quality should focus on bean sampling, geographical location of plantations, genetic diversity of the cacao material, and standardized analytical methods for determination of organic and mineral substances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aamino acids 3aanalytical methods 3acarbohydrates 3acocoa beans 3aexports 3afood security 3agenetic variation 3aimports 3alaws and regulations 3alipids 3anutrients 3aphenolic compounds 3aplantations 3aproteins 3atoxic substances 3awater content 0aMycotoxins 0apolyphenols 0apotentially toxic elements 0astandard cacao 0aTheobroma cacao L.1 aAraujo, Quintino R.1 aSodré, George A.1 aValle, Raúl R.1 aSouza, José O.1 aRamos, Edson M.

In the light, C₃ species use a small portion of xylem‐transported CO₂ for leaf photosynthesis. However, it is not known if xylem‐transported CO₂ will exit leaves in the dark or be used for photosynthesis in the light in Kranz‐type C₄ plants. Cut leaves of Amaranthus hypochondriacus were placed in one of three solutions of [NaH¹³CO₃] dissolved in KCl water to measure the efflux of xylem‐transported CO₂ exiting the leaf in the dark or rates of assimilation of xylem‐transported CO₂* in the light, in real‐time, using a tunable diode laser absorption spectroscope. In the dark, the efflux of xylem‐transported CO₂ increased with increasing rates of transpiration and [¹³CO₂*]; however, rates of ¹³Cₑffₗᵤₓ in A. hypochondriacus were lower compared to C₃ species. In the light, A. hypochondriacus fixed nearly 75% of the xylem‐transported CO₂ supplied to the leaf. Kranz anatomy and biochemistry likely influence the efflux of xylem‐transported CO₂ out of cut leaves of A. hypochondriacus in the dark, as well as the use of xylem‐transported CO₂* for photosynthesis in the light. Thus increasing the carbon use efficiency of Kranz‐type C₄ species over C₃ species.  aPublisher supplied data  a#IIA‐1301346cNational Science Foundation  aIOS 0719118cNational Science Foundation  cUniversity of New Mexico 3aAmaranthus hypochondriacus 3aC3 plants 3aC4 plants 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3adiodes 3adissolved inorganic carbon 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3apotassium chloride 3astems 3atranspiration1 aHanson, David T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0964-93350 tnew phytologist.g2019 Aug., v. 223, no. 3 p.1241-1252dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.159083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03867naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100002400160245009400184300001600278500000900294520236500303592002802668650001902696650001802715650001802733650002002751650001502771650002202786650001202808650001902820650002602839650001202865650001302877650000902890650001602899650001302915650002102928650002102949650001502970650002502985650002503010650002403035650002603059650002203085650002503107773012303132852000903255856009703264655001203361IND8012415520221119191609.0191122e198009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND801241552DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1980.00021962007200050002x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSammis, Theodore W.10aComparison of Sprinkler, Trickle, Subsurface, and Furrow Irrigation Methods for Row Crops  ap. 701-704.  aepub  aTrickle, subsurface, and sprinkler irrigation have been attributed to higher yields and water-use efficiencies than the conventional furrow irrigation method. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which these irrigation systems could be used to increase water-use efficiency while maintaining reasonable yields, compared to furrow irrigation, and to determine what effect the frequency of irrigation would have on resulting yields and water-use efficiency. Potatoes (Solaneum tuberosum) ‘Kennebec’, and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) ‘GL-659’ were watered by sprinkler, trickle, subsurface, and furrow irrigation to maintain a minimum soil-water potential of −20 kPa and −60 kPa. When potatoes were grown on a Glendale clay-loam soil (mixed calcareous thermic family of Typic Torrifluvent) at a location where rainfall did not supply a significant portion of their water requirements the highest yield and water-use efficiency were achieved using a subsurface irrigation system with water applications occurring when the soil-water potential at the 15 cm depth reached −20 kPa. When potatoes were grown on a Pedrick sandy-loam soil (coarse-loamy, mixed calcareous, Mesic Ustic Torriorthent) and rainfall contributed a significant portion of the water requirements throughout the growing season, the highest water-use efficiency was obtained with trickle and subsurface systems with water applications occurring when the soil-water potential at the 15 cm depth reached −60 kPa. Differences in yields at this study site were non-significant for all irrigation methods. The subsurface irrigation method appears to offer the best method of supplying uniform soil moisture in the root zone to the plant throughout the growing season, resulting in highest yields and high water-use efficiencies. Comparable lettuce yields and water-use efficiencies were achieved by trickle, sprinkler, and frequent subsurface irrigation treatments due to good stand establishment and avoidance of moisture-stress conditions. Infrequent sprinkler irrigations reduced yields due to moisture stress. Furrow irrigation, using proper management and short furrow runs, resulted in yields and water-use efficiencies as high as those of the other irrigation methods. Yield and water-use efficiency were reduced when flooding of the beds occurred at germination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactuca sativa 3aTorrifluvents 3aTorriorthents 3aclay loam soils 3acrop yield 3afurrow irrigation 3afurrows 3agrowing season 3airrigation scheduling 3alettuce 3apotatoes 3arain 3arhizosphere 3arowcrops 3asandy loam soils 3aseed germination 3asoil water 3asoil water potential 3asprinkler irrigation 3astand establishment 3asubsurface irrigation 3awater requirement 3awater use efficiency0 tAgronomy journal.g1980 Sept., v. 72, no. 5 p.701-704dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1980.00021962007200050002x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle04047naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245008800200300001800288500002000306520157300326592002801899596005901927596005901986596007502045596007302120596007502193650002502268650001802293650001402311650002002325650002002345650001002365650002502375650001302400650001602413650003002429650001102459650001802470650001602488650002302504650001202527650002102539650002202560650001202582650002202594650002002616650002102636650002902657700005302686700001702739700001302756700006102769700001402830700001702844700005502861700005302916700005302969700001703022700005203039700005803091773011803149856007303267852000903340655001203349IND60654130820221118190259.0190722e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065413082DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.158742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Shuangzhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6145-031810aArabidopsis histone H3K4 demethylase JMJ17 functions in dehydration stress response  ap. 1372-1387.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUnder dehydration in plants, antagonistic activities of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase and histone demethylase maintain a dynamic and homeostatic state of gene expression by orientating transcriptional reprogramming toward growth or stress tolerance. However, the histone demethylase that specifically controls histone methylation homeostasis under dehydration stress remains unknown. Here, we document that a histone demethylase, JMJ17, belonging to the KDM5/JARID1 family, plays crucial roles in response to dehydration stress and abscisic acid (ABA) in Arabidopsis thaliana. jmj17 loss‐of‐function mutants displayed dehydration stress tolerance and ABA hypersensitivity in terms of stomatal closure. JMJ17 specifically demethylated H3K4me1/2/3 via conserved iron‐binding amino acids in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, H3K4 demethylase activity of JMJ17 was required for dehydration stress response. Systematic combination of genome‐wide chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP‐seq) and RNA‐sequencing (RNA‐seq) analyses revealed that a loss‐of‐function mutation in JMJ17 caused an ectopic increase in genome‐wide H3K4me3 levels and activated a plethora of dehydration stress‐responsive genes. Importantly, JMJ17 bound directly to the chromatin of OPEN STOMATA 1 (OST1) and demethylated H3K4me3 for the regulation of OST1 mRNA abundance, thereby modulating the dehydration stress response. Our results demonstrate a new function of a histone demethylase under dehydration stress in plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a31771352cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31601311cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016YFD0102003cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a20180101233JCcNatural Science Foundation of Jilin Province of China  a#2412018BJ002cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aabscisic acid 3achromatin 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahistone demethylases 3ahistones 3ahomeostasis 3aloss-of-function mutation 3alysine 3amessenger RNA 3amethylation 3amethyltransferases 3amutants 3aprecipitin tests 3asequence analysis 3astomata 3astomatal movement 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3atranscription (genetics)1 aZhang, Ai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8308-99731 aJin, Jing Bo1 aZhao, Bo1 aWang, Tian‐Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4802-35141 aWu, Yifan1 aWang, Shuang1 aLiu, Yutong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3303-58511 aWang, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1992-62981 aGuo, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8682-41631 aAhmad, Rafiq1 aLiu, Bao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5481-16751 aXu, Zheng‐Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4256-304X0 tnew phytologist.g2019 Aug., v. 223, no. 3 p.1372-1387dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.158743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245017200179520109800351592002801449650001701477650002001494650002001514650001901534650002101553650002301574650001501597650001101612650002001623650001201643650001701655653002301672653001401695653003001709653003601739700004001775700003201815700004301847700003601890700002701926700003201953773010001985856008702085852000902172655001202181IND60791370020221117165621.0221004e20230130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079137002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1340332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrado Massarioli, Adna10aSimulated gastrointestinal digestion/Caco-2 cell model to predict bioaccessibility and intestinal permeability of p-coumaric acid and p-coumaroyl derivatives in peanut  aData concerning physiological recovery of whole peanut major phenolics throughout the gastrointestinal tract are scarce. In our study, the bioaccessibility and intestinal permeability of peanuts major phenolics were predicted by simulated digestion followed by Caco-2 cells monolayer model. Phenolics identification and quantification were performed by HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS and HPLC-PDA, respectively. As results, p-coumaroyl conjugates with tartaric, sinapic and ferulic acids, and p-coumaric acid were the major phenolics found in the non-digested extract and in the digested and transported fractions. The in vitro bioaccessibility and Caco-2 cell transport of p-coumaric acid was 370% and 127%, respectively, while it was much lower for p-coumaroyl derivatives (7–100% and 14–31%, respectively). Nonetheless, the peroxyl scavenging activity remained unaltered, likely, at least partly, due to synergies between some phenolics, which concentration proportions changed throughout the experiment. Hence, there is indication that whole peanut is a source of bioavailable antioxidant phenolics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abioavailability 3adigestive tract 3afood chemistry 3ahuman cell lines 3ain vitro digestion 3aintestines 3amodels 3ap-coumaric acid 3apeanuts 3apermeability 0aPhenolic compounds 0aGroundnut 0aIn vitro bioaccessibility 0aIntestinal epithelial transport1 aGiovanini de Oliveira Sartori, Alan1 aFrancetto Juliano, Fernanda1 aEduardo Pedroso Gomes do Amaral, José1 aSantos, Roseane Cavalcanti dos,1 aMaria de Lima, Liziane1 aMatias de Alencar, Severino0 tFood chemistry.g2023 Jan. 30, v. 400 p.134033-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1340333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245010200198300001800300500002000318520140900338592002801747596004301775596000901818596006801827650001401895650002501909650001301934650001101947650002001958650001901978650002901997650001302026650001102039650002302050650002202073650001302095650001302108650002102121650002102142650001302163650001502176650001202191700007702203700002002280700006002300773011802360856007302478852000902551655001202560IND60654130920221118190302.0190722e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065413092DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.158852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViana, Inés G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3685-559110aDifferent strategies of nitrogen acquisition in two tropical seagrasses under nitrogen enrichment  ap. 1217-1229.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTropical marine seagrasses live in environments with low nutrient concentrations. However, as land development intensifies along tropical coastlines, the marine environment in which these organisms grow is becoming more nutrient‐rich. Nitrogen (N) uptake, assimilation, translocation and storage under a diversity of N sources in enriched conditions were investigated in two tropical seagrass species, Cymodocea serrulata and Thalassia hemprichii, from an oligotrophic marine environment. Both seagrasses were able to take up different inorganic and organic N sources through their above‐ and belowground tissues when enriched with high N concentrations. The uptake rates of T. hemprichii were generally higher than C. serrulata in leaves and rhizome, whereas root uptake was systematically higher in C. serrulata. Acropetal and basipetal translocation was observed in both species. Reduction and assimilation of N, measured in terms of their nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase activity, were correlated with nitrate and ammonium uptake rates, respectively. Cymodocea serrulata showed a tendency to immediately use the available N, whereas T. hemprichii allocated more N in assimilation and storage investment. The responses of these seagrasses to N‐enrichment demonstrate their ability to adapt to over‐enrichment by varying N sources in the first step of the eutrophication process.  aPublisher supplied data  a1046/3‐1cGerman Research Foundation  cDAAD  cConsellería de Cultura, Educación e Ordenación Universitaria 3aCymodocea 3aThalassia hemprichii 3aammonium 3acoasts 3aenzyme activity 3aeutrophication 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aland use 3aleaves 3amarine environment 3anitrate reductase 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrient content 3arhizomes 3aseagrasses 3atissues1 aSaavedra‐Hortúa, Daniel Arturo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4358-75291 aMtolera, Matern1 aTeichberg, Mirta1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1586-738X0 tnew phytologist.g2019 Aug., v. 223, no. 3 p.1217-1229dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.158853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01723naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245007700169300001600246520079900262592002801061650002601089650002001115650002001135650001201155650001001167650002201177700001501199773014101214856005701355852000901412655001201421IND4480342720221121022901.0120418e196912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448034272DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8489.1969.tb00062.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWright, A.14aThe application of simulation techniques to the study of grazing systems  ap. 144-153.  aDecision making studies in agriculture are often made difficult by the complex and dynamic nature of bio‐economic systems. Simulation is one of the newer systems research techniques which as yet has had limited use in farm management research. This paper discusses some methodological aspects of simulation with specific reference to grazing systems. Problems arising in the development and use of simulation models are discussed and the need for inter‐disciplinary co‐operation to overcome data problems is indicated. One approach to experimentation is illustrated by reference to a model of a sheep grazing system and the problem of cropping for winter grazing. It is concluded that simulation is a potentially useful technique for management‐oriented systems research in agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural research 3adecision making 3afarm management 3agrazing 3asheep 3asimulation models1 aDent, J.B.0 tAustralian journal of agricultural and resource economics.g1969 Dec., v. 13, no. 2 p.144-153dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-985X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8489.1969.tb00062.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245011200166300001400278520105400292592002801346650002601374650001701400650001801417650002801435650002101463650001501484650002601499650001901525650002201544650001501566650001101581650001401592650002001606650002101626650001101647650002501658650001501683650002101698651001401719653002301733653002601756653002101782653001901803653001901822653002301841653002401864700003201888700002301920700002301943700002201966773010101988856008002089852000902169655001202178IND60651600120221122180312.0200417e20190601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065160012DNAL7 a10.2478/fhort-2019-00042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaruso, Gianluca10aProductivity, nutritional and functional qualities of perennial wall-rocket: Effects of pre-harvest factors  ap. 71-80.  aPerennial wall-rocket (Diplotaxis tenuifolia) belongs to the Brassicaceae family.

In the past, Diplotaxis tenuifolia was a herbaceous plant harvested and consumed as a spontaneous herb, but today it is an important leafy vegetable in ready-to-use salads, with an increasing impact in the national and international vegetable retail markets. The leaves of perennial wall-rocket have valuable nutritional properties because of the amounts of antioxidant compounds they contain, in particular glucosinolates, vitamin C, as well as flavonoids, which make their consumption beneficial for preventing some types of cancer and cardiovascular disease. In the current review, major pre-harvest factors of Diplotaxis tenuifolia production, such as cropping systems, fertilization, as well as water management and irrigation, are addressed with respect to crop productivity and leaf quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiplotaxis tenuifolia 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3acardiovascular diseases 3acropping systems 3aflavonoids 3afunctional properties 3aglucosinolates 3aherbaceous plants 3airrigation 3aleaves 3aneoplasms 3anutritive value 3aretail marketing 3asalads 3atraditional medicine 3avegetables 3awater management 3aWest Asia 0acropping practices 0aDiplotaxis tenuifolia 0afunctional foods 0aglucosinolates 0aphytochemicals 0aproduce processing 0aready-to-use salads1 aDe Pascale, S.q(Stefania),1 aNicoletti, Rosario1 aCozzolino, Eugenio1 aRouphael, Youssef0 tFolia horticulturae.g2019 June 01, v. 31, no. 1 p.71-80dSciendowJournal:2057x2083-59657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/fhort-2019-00043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03577naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245015400177300001600331520178300347592002802130650002902158650002402187650001202211650001102223650001102234650002902245650001402274650001702288650001102305650001502316650001902331650001102350650001402361650000902375650002002384650001102404650001402415650001502429650001702444650000902461651001002470653001902480653001702499653002602516653003302542653003102575653002402606653001002630700005602640700001502696700001902711700001302730700001702743700001602760773007702776856008902853852000902942655001202951IND60570911520221120144728.0170709e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057091152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.05.1552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Guangliang10aHeavy metal fractions and ecological risk assessment in sediments from urban, rural and reclamation-affected rivers of the Pearl River Estuary, China  ap. 278-288.  aRapid urbanization and reclamation processes in coastal areas have resulted in serious pollution to the aquatic environment. Less is known on the geochemical fractions and ecological risks in river sediment under various human activities pressures, which is essential for addressing the connections between heavy metal pollution and anthropogenic influences. River sediments were collected from different landscapes (i.e., urban, rural and reclamation areas) to investigate the impacts of urbanization and reclamation on the metallic pollution levels and ecological risks in the Pear River Estuary of China. Results showed that Cd, Zn and Cu with high total contents and geoaccumulation index (Igeo) were the primary metals in the Peal River sediments. Generally, urban river sediments, especially the surface sediment layer (0–10 cm), exhibited higher metallic pollution levels. As for geochemical fractions, reducible and residual fractions were the dominant forms for six determined metals. And the percentage of heavy metals bound to Fe-Mn oxides decreased with increasing soil depth but the reverse tendency was observed for residual fractions. Compared with rural river sediments, heavy metals were highly associated with the exchangeable and carbonate fractions in both urban and reclamation-affected river sediments, suggesting that anthropogenic activities mainly increased the active forms of metals. Approximately 80% of Cd existed in the non-residual fraction and posed medium to high ecological risk according to the risk assessment code (RAC) values. The redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that both urbanization and reclamation processes would cause similar metallic characteristics, and sediment organic matter (SOC) might be the prominent influencing factor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquatic environment 3acadmium 3acoasts 3acopper 3aenvironmental assessment 3aestuaries 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3aorganic matter 3aoxides 3apollution 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3asediments 3asoil depth 3aurbanization 3azinc 3aChina 0aRiver sediment 0aHeavy metals 0aGeochemical fractions 0aGeoaccumulation index (Igeo) 0aRisk assessment code (RAC) 0aPearl river estuary 0aChina1 aBai, Junhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9992-13411 aXiao, Rong1 aZhao, Qingqing1 aJia, Jia1 aCui, Baoshan1 aLiu, Xinhui0 tChemosphere.g2017 Oct., v. 184 p.278-288dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.05.1553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245012600176300001600302520141400318592002801732650001701760650002401777650002501801650002301826650002301849650002101872650001501893650001501908650001501923650001501938650001501953650001501968650002301983650001402006650001502020650002002035650001102055650001502066651001702081653002902098653001902127653001502146653002202161700001902183700003102202700002402233700002602257773008402283856008502367852000902452655001202461IND60569355620221118071511.0170525e20170903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056935562DNAL7 a10.1080/00173134.2017.12834402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChamorro, Fermín J.10aBotanical origin and geographic differentiation of bee-pollen produced in high mountains from the Colombian eastern Andes  ap. 386-397.  aIn the high mountains of the Colombian Eastern Cordillera (~2000–3000 m above sea level), at the Altiplano Cundiboyacense region and surroundings, beekeepers have specialised in pollen production with substantial harvests all year round. Despite this productive advantage, the knowledge about plants used by honeybees as pollen resources is still limited. Hence, the aim of this work was to identify the botanical origin of bee pollen from this region and to examine differences between five distinguished sub-regions: Sabana de Bogotá, Fúquene, Márquez, Tundama and Norte-Gutiérrez. By means of palynological analyses of 86 pollen samples produced between 2008 and 2010, we found a total amount of 126 pollen types, most of them belonging to the families Asteraceae and Fabaceae. Major pollen types correspond to the exotic taxa Hypochaeris radicata , Brassicaceae, Eucalyptus globulus , Trifolium repens , Trifolium pratense and the native taxa Quercus humboldtii and Weinmannia sp. Differences between sample groups from the five sub-regions were mainly associated to variations in pollen abundance and frequency of native plant species. This result highlights the potential for commercialising bee-pollen from the Colombian Eastern Cordillera with geographical origin differentiation, as well as the importance for beekeeping in promoting the conservation of the natural ecosystems from the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassicaceae 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aHypochaeris radicata 3aQuercus humboldtii 3aTrifolium pratense 3aTrifolium repens 3aWeinmannia 3aapiculture 3abee pollen 3abeekeepers 3aecosystems 3ahoney bees 3aindigenous species 3amountains 3apalynology 3aplants (botany) 3apollen 3aprovenance 3aAndes region 0aAltiplano Cundiboyacense 0aApis mellifera 0abeekeeping 0amelissopalynology1 aLeón, Daniela1 aMontoya-Pfeiffer, Paula M.1 aSolarte, Víctor M.1 aNates Parra, Guiomar,0 tGrana.g2017 Sept. 3, v. 56, no. 5 p.386-397dTaylor & Francisx1651-20497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00173134.2017.12834403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02223naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245004900167300001600216520112800232592002801360650003301388650002501421650002801446650001901474650001801493650001001511650002101521650002301542650001201565650001101577651001801588700002201606773014501628856007901773852000901852655001201861IND60408779020221117203910.0150921e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040877902DNAL7 a10.1111/1541-4337.121512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldfein, Kara R.10aWhy Sugar Is Added to Food: Food Science 101  ap. 644-656.  aAvoiding too much sugar is an accepted dietary guidance throughout the world. The U.S. Nutrition Facts panel includes information on total sugars in foods. A focus on added sugars is linked to the concept of discretionary calories and decreasing consumption of added sugars or free sugars as a means to assist a consumer to identify foods that are nutrient‐dense. On March 14, 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposed that including “added sugars” declaration on the Nutrition Facts panel would be another tool to help consumers reduce excessive discretionary calorie intake from added sugars. Through deductive reasoning, labeling added sugars is one tactic to potentially curb the obesity epidemic in the United States. This review discusses the functions of sugar in food and shows that the methods used to replace added sugars in foods can result in no reduction in calorie content or improvement in nutrient density. Without clear benefit to the consumer for added sugars labeling, this review highlights the complex business obstacles, costs, and consumer confusion resulting from the proposed rule.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Drug Administration 3abusiness enterprises 3adietary recommendations 3aenergy content 3aenergy intake 3afoods 3anutrient density 3anutrition labeling 3aobesity 3asugars 3aUnited States1 aSlavin, Joanne L.0 tComprehensive reviews in food science and food safety.g2015 Sept., v. 14, no. 5 p.644-656dInstitute of Food Technologistsx1541-43377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.121513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03606naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001800160245008300178300001600261500000900277520190400286592002802190650001602218650001502234650001302249650001302262650002202275650002202297650002102319650001102340650001202351650000902363650002002372650002702392650001802419650001602437650001302453650001102466650001402477650001402491650002002505650001302525650001502538650001802553650002902571650002502600650002002625650002102645650002602666650001102692650000902703700001702712700001602729700001802745773012302763852000902886856009702895655001202992IND8012416220221119191604.0191122e198009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND801241622DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1980.00021962007200050009x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarren, H. L.10aEffect of Nitrapyrin and N Fertilizer on Yield and Mineral Composition of Corn  ap. 729-732.  aepub  aFertilizer N applied in the fall or early spring is often used less efficiently than N applied closer to the time of maximum N demand by plants. Nitrification inhibitors make it possible to delay nitrification of applied NH₄⁺-N in the soil and thereby reduce overwinter and early spring N loss from leaching and denitrification. Because NH₄⁺ absorption may induce changes in plant mineral composition, we evaluated under field conditions, the effect of inhibiting nitrification of NH₄⁺-N on the mineral composition of corn leaf tissue as well as on grain yield and protein content. Anhydrous ammonia with and without nitrapyrin [ 2-chloro-6-(trichloromethyl) pyridine] at 0.55 kg/ha was applied in the fall and spring on soils of three types. Addition of nitrapyrin to fall-applied NH₄⁺ significantly increased grain yield and grain protein. Grain protein was sometimes increased when nitrapyrin was applied with NH₄⁺ in the spring. Grain protein content was increased by N and nitrapyrin and from 10 to 33%. Protein generally continued to increase even after the maximum yield had been reached. The mineral composition of leaves was more dependent on soil type than on N treatment. The minerals K, Ba, and Mn were higher, and Ca, Mg, and A1 were lower in plants grown in Tracy sandy loam (Ultic Hapludalfs, coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic) than in those grown in either Runnymede loam (Typic Argiaquolls, fine-loamy, mixed, mesic) or Chalmers silty clay loam (Typic Haplaquolls, fine-silty, mixed, mesic) soils. The concentrations of minerals in plants were similar with fertilizer treatments and time of application. Zinc was the only mineral in plants that significantly increased when nitrapyrin was added to NH₄⁺. Nitrification inhibitors can effectively reduce N losses without adversely affecting the uptake of other minerals or the mineral composition of corn leaf tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgiaquolls 3aHapludalfs 3aZea mays 3aammonium 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanhydrous ammonia 3aapplication rate 3abarium 3acalcium 3acorn 3adenitrification 3afertilizer application 3agrain protein 3agrain yield 3aleaching 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amineral content 3aminerals 3anitrapyrin 3anitrification 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aprotein content 3asandy loam soils 3asilty clay loam soils 3aspring 3azinc1 aHuber, D.

Until recently, only one or a few low copy nuclear gene markers were included in such studies. Now, the rapid adoption of “next generation sequencing” (NGS) techniques offers simpler and cheaper access to hundreds of, and not just tens of, coding and noncoding DNA regions. In this review, we describe the most commonly‐used NGS methods available for accessing nuclear genes and discuss many NGS case studies that have been published in the last two to three years. These approaches include whole genome sequencing to target microsatellites, transcriptome sequencing, Exon‐Primed Intron‐Crossing sequencing (EPIC), targeted enrichment (or sequence capture), RAD sequencing (RAD‐Seq, including genotyping‐by‐sequencing or GBS), and genome skimming. We also discuss some of the challenges to, and posed by, the NGS approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3achloroplast DNA 3achloroplast genome 3achloroplasts 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aintergenic DNA 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amolecular systematics 3anuclear genome 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3atranscriptomics1 aWen, Jun0 tJournal of systematics and evolution.g2015 Sept., v. 53, no. 5 p.371-379dScience Pressx1674-49187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jse.121743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245015200156300001800308520136500326592002801691650001601719650001301735650002201748650001701770650002001787650001801807650002001825650001601845650001601861650001001877650002101887650002101908650001701929650003001946650000901976650002101985650002002006650001502026650001402041650002802055650001102083650002502094650001702119650001202136650003202148700001402180700001702194700001702211700001802228773012502246856007402371852000902445655001202454IND60653964120221122004517.0190722e20190717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065396412DNAL7 a10.1039/c9fo00713j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yujiao10aCaulerpa lentillifera polysaccharides enhance the immunostimulatory activity in immunosuppressed mice in correlation with modulating gut microbiota  ap. 4315-4329.  aIn this study, the immunostimulatory activity of Caulerpa lentillifera polysaccharides (CLP) was elucidated in cytoxan (CTX)-induced immunosuppressed BALB/c mice. The results showed that CLP ameliorated the CTX-evoked damage to body weight, colon length and thymus/spleen indexes and enhanced the secretions of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and superoxidase dismutase (SOD) in serum and thymic, splenic and colonic tissues of the immunosuppressed mice. Besides, CLP promoted the production of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) and mucin2 in the colonic tissue of the immunosuppressed mice. Associated with the above immunostimulatory effects, CLP positively affected the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and microbiota diversity and composition, such as improvement in the growth of Lactobacillus, Coriobacteriaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Clostridium_XVIII and Helicobacter, whereas it suppressed the microbial populations of Bacteroides, Barnesiella and Lachnospiraceae. These findings suggested that CLP modulated SCFA production and gut microbiota in the immunosuppressed mice, evoking the colonic mucosal immunity, which might activate the systemic immunity in blood, thymus and spleen. The results could be helpful for understanding the functions of CLP, supporting their potential as novel prebiotics and immunostimulators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides 3aCaulerpa 3aCoriobacteriaceae 3aHelicobacter 3aLachnospiraceae 3aLactobacillus 3aRuminococcaceae 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acolon 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunostimulants 3ainterleukins 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amice 3amucosal immunity 3apolysaccharides 3aprebiotics 3asecretion 3ashort chain fatty acids 3aspleen 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athymus gland 3atissues 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aLiu, Yang1 aAi, Chunqing1 aSong, Shuang1 aChen, Xuefeng0 tFood & function.g2019 July 17, v. 10, no. 7 p.4315-4329dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9fo00713j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03842naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003500148245010500183300001600288520190100304592002802205650002102233650002102254650002302275650001902298650001302317650001202330650001602342650001602358650002002374650001002394650001602404650001402420650001702434650001702451650003702468650001302505650001702518650002702535650001002562650001102572653001502583653001202598653002402610653001902634653002202653653001502675653001202690653002802702653002402730653002402754700002802778700003302806700003102839700003102870700004102901773017102942856008203113852000903195655001203204IND60601605420180918000000.0180706e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060160542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.riam.2013.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Freitas, Alessandra Ribeiro10aYeasts isolated from nosocomial urinary infections: Antifungal susceptibility and biofilm production  ap. 104-108.  aUrinary Candida infections in the hospital environment are frequent and need to be better understood.To compare the results of antifungal susceptibility profiles of yeasts isolated from patients with urinary infections obtained by broth microdilution method (BM) and by disk diffusion (DD), and also evaluate the capacity of these yeasts to form biofilms.Only yeasts obtained from pure urine cultures with counts higher than 10⁵ colony-forming units per milliliter, without bacteria development, of symptomatic patients were included. The isolates were identified by classical methods and the antifungal susceptibility tests were performed with the following drugs: amphotericin B, ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and caspofungin. The biofilm studies were carried out in polystyrene microtitration plates.Ninety-five yeasts isolates were analyzed, including 40 Candida albicans, 31 Candida glabrata, 24 Candida tropicalis. In general, the majority of the isolates were susceptible to the tested drugs but some resistance was observed, especially against fluconazole. Great variability in the antifungal susceptibility results was observed with the different tested drugs and a few discrepancies were observed between both methods. We suggest that in case of DD resistance this result should be confirmed by BM, the standard method. C. tropicalis isolates showed high biofilm production (91.7%) compared to C. albicans (82.5%) and C. glabrata (61.3%), with statistical significance (p=0.0129).Candiduria in critical patients requires major attention and a better control. The different susceptibility results obtained in this study showed the need to identify yeasts up to the species level, especially in patients with urinary tract infection. The development of techniques of antifungal susceptibility tests can help the clinicians in the empiric treatment of candiduria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aCandida glabrata 3aCandida tropicalis 3aamphotericin B 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3acandidiasis 3acaspofungin 3across infection 3adrugs 3afluconazole 3ahospitals 3aitraconazole 3aketoconazole 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apatients 3apolystyrenes 3aurinary tract diseases 3aurine 3ayeasts 0aCandiduria 0aBiofilm 0aBroth microdilution 0aDisk diffusion 0aUrinary infection 0aCandiduria 0aBiofilm 0aMicrodilución en caldo 0aDifusión con disco 0aInfección urinaria1 aBaeza, Lilian Cristiane1 aFaria, Maria Graciela Iecher1 aDalben Dota, Kelen Fátima1 aGodoy Martínez, Patrício1 aSvidzinski, Terezinha Inez Estivalet0 tRevista iberoamericana de micología.g2014 Apr.,  June, v. 31, no. 2 p.104-108dElsevier EspanaaRevista Iberoamericana de MicologíawJournal:12421x1130-14067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.riam.2013.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007400166300001600240520212600256592002802382650001902410650003402429650001602463650002302479650001602502650002602518650001602544653002502560653002502585653002302610653002302633653002502656653003002681653002402711653002602735773008802761856008102849852000902930655001202939IND60481044220221120042123.0160201e20110107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048104422DNAL7 a10.2478/v10091-010-0013-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerlín, Radim10aTheoretical approaches of methods to delimitate rural and urban areas  ap. 182-200.  aThe delimitation of rural and urban municipalities as well as the delimitation of contiguous rural areas has not been sufficiently resolved in either academic literature or legislative practice. In relation to the scale and size of their administrative units, different countries use very different methods for delimiting rural municipalities that are based on simple counts of the population, on a municipality's position in the system of public administration or on a combination of multiple socio-economic factors. For the delimitation of rural areas, the various EU member states utilize a method based on population density in relatively large NUTS III regions. This article discusses divergent approaches to the delimitation of rural municipalities, on the one hand, and the delimitation of contiguous rural areas, on the other. Concepts concerning the delimitation of rural municipalities, along with differing characteristics leading to the delimitation of rural municipalities for the statistical processing of large amounts of data or characteristics for subjective evaluations of a small group of units, are discussed using the example of Czechia's settlement structure. The article then focuses on the critical evaluation of methods used for the delimitation of rural areas and, on the basis of various tested variations, proposes a new method for delimiting rural areas in Czechia, using modified OECD criteria. Changes arising both from the significantly smaller units of observation, where instead of considering units at the NUTS III level - regions (kraj) in Czechia, we consider 384 administrative regions of Municipalities with Extended Powers (MEP), as well as from variable changes to the critical values of population density so as to better account for the Czech settlement structure. The article emphasizes the necessity of using different approaches in studying the delimitation of rural municipalities and rural areas, at various scale levels, and the inappropriateness of using the methods of delimitation for rural areas that are currently used for all EU member states, at the national scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3agovernment and administration 3amethodology 3apopulation density 3arural areas 3asocioeconomic factors 3aurban areas 0asettlement structure 0aadministrative units 0apopulation density 0aeconomic structure 0astruktura osídlení 0aadministrativní jednotky 0ahustota zalidnění 0aekonomická Struktura0 tEuropean countryside.g2011 Jan. 7, v. 2, no. 4 p.182-200dVersitax1803-84177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10091-010-0013-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245011600169300001600285500001500301520172000316592002802036650001202064650001002076650001602086650001302102650001502115650001102130650001102141650001102152650000902163650001602172650001102188650002202199650001102221650001802232650001702250650001502267650001902282650002702301650001102328653001602339700002002355700001902375700002202394700002302416773009402439856008102533852000902614655001202623IND4474891720221122113026.0151123e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447489172DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-011-9983-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCÃ©spedes, Blanca10aSoil seed bank, fire season, and temporal patterns of germination in a seeder-dominated Mediterranean shrubland  ap. 383-393.  a2019-12-05  aSoil seed banks play a major role in the post-fire regeneration of Mediterranean shrublands. They vary throughout the year in species composition, abundance, and readiness to germinate. After fire, germination occurs mainly during the following fall to spring. Time of germination can determine recruitment success. It is unclear what factors control post-fire germination and its timing. We tested the effects of season and fire on the readily germinable soil seed bank of a seeder-dominated shrubland. Plots were burned early and late in the summer season (ES, LS). Soil samples were collected before and after fire, and germinated in a chamber simulating successively autumn, winter, and spring conditions. Samples were kept moistened at all times. Fire intensity was similar between ES and LS. Several species of Cistus and herbs, mostly annuals, were dominant. Most germination occurred during the simulated-autumn period, with little subsequent germination during the following two periods. Germination speed (T ââ) during simulated-autumn was similar for shrubs and herbs, and independent of season or fire. Germination was lower for two shrubs (Rosmarinus officinalis, Cistus salvifolius) and higher for herbaceous dicots in LS than in ES soils. Fire reduced monocots and enhanced Cistus. Germination period significantly interacted with fire and season in some groups or species, altering the simulated-autumn germination peak. We demonstrate that the seed bank can germinate swiftly under simulated-autumn conditions. Hence, water availability is the main controlling factor of germination. Fire season differentially affected some species or groups, and could affect the post-fire regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannuals 3aherbs 3agermination 3asampling 3ashrublands 3aautumn 3ashrubs 3awinter 3asoil 3afire season 3aspring 3aspecies diversity 3asummer 3asoil sampling 3aburied seeds 3aLiliopsida 3afire intensity 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3aCistus 0arecruitment1 aTorres, IvÃ¡n1 aLuna, BelÃ©n1 aPÃ©rez, Beatriz1 aMoreno, JosÃ© M.0 tPlant ecology.g2012 Mar., v. 213, no. 3 p.383-393dSpringer Netherlandsx1385-02377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-011-9983-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100002300160245014200183300001600325500000900341520143400350592002801784650002301812650002101835650001101856650002201867650002701889650001501916650001901931650003101950650001301981650002501994650001802019650002702037650001802064650002602082700002302108700002102131700001702152773012202169852000902291856009702300655001202397IND8313123720221120050318.0191122e198311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND831312372DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1983.00021962007500060012x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaylor, Michael J.10aInteractions among a Herbicide Program, Nitrogen Fertilization, Tarnished Plant Bugs, and Planting Dates for Yield and Maturity of Cotton  ap. 903-907.  aepub  aThe influence of a maximum herbicide program, N rates, tarnished plant bugs [Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois)], planting date, and interactions among these treatments on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) was determined under field conditions on a Dewey silt loam (clayey, kaolinitic, thermic, Typic Paleudult) soil. High rates of herbicides caused early phytotoxicity and reduced earliness in all 3 years of this study. Total yields were reduced by herbicides in 1976 and 1978. In 1977, compensation for early season herbicide injury by the early-planted cotton apparently resulted in higher yields in the herbicide treated plots than in untreated plots. Generally, the herbicide program reduced earliness and yields most under conditions where the potential yield was greatest (early planting, high N rates, and effective tarnished plant bug control). Yield reductions due to the herbicide program were not additive with reductions due to other factors. Effects of variable N rates on yield were inconsistent. Tarnished plant bugs reduced total yields in cotton planted late in 1976, but because early-planted cotton had time to compensate for damage, plant bug infestations resulted in no yield loss in the early 1976 planting and in increased total yields in cotton planted early in 1977. Because of complex interactions among production practices, interdisciplinary research is needed to design optimum production systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aLygus lineolaris 3acotton 3aearly development 3afertilizer application 3aherbicides 3ainsect control 3ainterdisciplinary research 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aphytotoxicity 3aplant-insect relations 3aplanting date 3aproduction technology1 aBuchanan, Gary A.,1 aGilliland, F.
