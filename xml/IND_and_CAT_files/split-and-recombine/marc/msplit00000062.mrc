The plate culture method is the gold standard, but has received several well-known criticisms, which have induced researchers to develop alternative methods. The purpose of this study was to compare Legionella counts obtained by the analysis of potable water samples through the plate culture method and through the IDEXX liquid culture Legiolert method. Legionella plate culture, according to ISO 11731:1998, was performed using 1 L of water. Legiolert was performed using both the 10 mL and 100 mL Legiolert protocols. Overall, 123 potable water samples were analyzed. Thirty-seven (30%) of them, positive for L. pneumophila, serogroups 1 or 2–14 by plate culture, were used for comparison with the Legiolert results. The Legiolert 10 mL test detected 34 positive samples (27.6%) and the Legiolert 100 mL test detected 37 positive samples, 27.6% and 30% respectively, out of the total samples analyzed. No significant difference was found between either the Legiolert 10 mL and Legiolert 100 mL vs. the plate culture (p = 0.9 and p = 0.3, respectively) or between the Legiolert 10 mL and Legiolert 100 mL tests (p = 0.83). This study confirms the reliability of the IDEXX Legiolert test for Legionella pneumophila detection and enumeration, as already shown in similar studies. Like the plate culture method, the Legiolert assay is also suitable for obtaining isolates for typing purposes, relevant for epidemiological investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLegionella pneumophila 3aassays 3adetection 3adrinking water 3aepidemiological studies 3agold 3aliquids 3apathogens 3aprotocols 3areliability 3aresearchers 3arisk assessment 3asampling 3aserotypes 3atesting 3awater1 aBuffoni, Matteo 1 aGirolamo, Antonietta 1 aCristino, Sandra 1 aGirolamini, Luna 1 aMazzotta, Marta 1 aBucci Sabattini, Maria  Antonietta1 aZaccaro, Cristina  Maria1 aChetti, Leonarda 1 aLaboratory, Microbiology  Arpa Novara1 aBella, Antonino 1 aRota, Maria Cristina,1 aRicci, Maria Luisa,0 tPathogens.g2020 Aug. 23, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens90906903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245011500213300001600328500001900344500001100363520153700374592002801911650001701939650002201956650001001978650001801988650001502006650002202021650001302043651001102056700003102067700003702098700003302135700002802168700003202196700003802228700003902266773011302305856008202418852000902500655001202509IND60726174820221119141435.0210202e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072617482DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-020-04889-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima, William Gustavo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8946-936310aRate of exposure to Mayaro virus (MAYV) in Brazil between 1955 and 2018: a systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 347-361.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aMayaro fever is an infection caused by Mayaro virus (MAYV) that stands out among the neglected diseases transmitted by arthropods. Brazil is the country with the highest number of confirmed cases of MAYV infection. However, epidemiological surveillance studies conducted in Brazil are decentralized and focus on small outbreaks and unconfirmed cases. Thus, the aim of this review was to determine the general epidemiological profile of MAYV infections in Brazil. Several medical databases (i.e., PUBMED/MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, LILACS, SciELO, and Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde) were searched for studies reporting cases of MAYV infections in Brazilian patients. Then, the rate of exposure to MAYV in Brazil was analyzed using RStudio® Software. We identified 37 studies published from 1957 to 2019, containing data of 12,374 patients from 1955 to 2018. The general rate of exposure to MAYV in Brazil was 10% (95% CI; 0.04-0.22), with 1,304 reported cases. The highest incidence of MAYV infection was found in the northern region (13%; 95% CI; 0.05-0.29), with 1,142 cases (88% of all cases). Furthermore, autochthonous MAYV cases have also been reported in the Central West (8%; 95% CI; 0.03-0.18) and Southeast (0.4%; 95% CI; 0.00-0.28). The states with the highest number of cases are Amazonas (490 cases), Pará (276 cases), and Goiás (87 cases). In conclusion, the general rate of exposure to MAYV in Brazil between 1955 and 2018 was considerable, especially in the Legal Amazon, in which 93% of cases were reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMayaro virus 3acomputer software 3afever 3ameta-analysis 3amonitoring 3asystematic review 3avirology 3aBrazil1 aPereira, Rosângela Santos1 ada Cruz Nizer, Waleska Stephanie1 aBrito, Júlio César Moreira1 aGodói, Isabella Piassi1 aCardoso, Valbert Nascimento1 aFernandes, Simone Odília Antunes1 aFerreira, Jaqueline Maria Siqueira0 tArchives of virology.g2021 Feb., v. 166, no. 2 p.347-361dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6093x0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-020-04889-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010000167300001600267520147600283592002801759650000801787650001401795650002101809650001401830650001601844650002301860650001701883650001201900650002301912650001901935650001001954650002301964650001101987650001701998650001902015650002202034650002602056650001302082650001502095653000902110653000902119653000802128653000802136653000702144653000702151653000802158653000802166653000902174653001702183653001402200653003002214653001202244653000902256700001602265700001902281700001802300700001802318700001902336700001702355773011102372856008202483852000902565655001202574IND60541924620221120175530.0190401e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054192462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2014.01.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWon, Yeong-Seon10aα-Mangostin-induced apoptosis is mediated by estrogen receptor α in human breast cancer cells  ap. 158-165.  aIn this study, we evaluated the effects of α-mangostin on cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in MCF-7 ERα-positive human breast cancer cells. Our results showed that α-mangostin inhibited MCF-7 cell proliferation whereas ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells were less sensitive to the agent. Additionally, α-mangostin effectively induced apoptosis as evidenced by the appearance of apoptotic nuclei observed with Hoechst 33258 staining and evaluation of sub-G1 DNA contents by flow cytometry. α-Mangostin also activated caspases-8, -9, and -7; increased the protein levels of Bax, p53, and cytosolic cytochrome c; and induced PARP cleavage while reducing Bid and Bcl-2 protein expression. In addition, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) was transported from mitochondria to the cytosol after α-mangostin treatment. α-mangostin also induced apoptosis in 17-β-estradiol (E2)-stimulated MCF-7 cells in parallel with the non-stimulated cells. Moreover, treatment with 10μM α-mangostin for 48h specifically decreased the expression of ERα and pS2, an estrogen-responsive gene, in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, knockdown of ERα expression in MCF-7 cells with siRNA attenuated α-mangostin-induced cell growth inhibition and caspase-7 activation. These results suggest that ERα is required for α-mangostin-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in human breast cancer cells. Therefore, α-mangostin may be used to prevent and treat of ER-positive breast cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3acaspase-7 3acell growth 3acell proliferation 3acytochrome c 3acytosol 3aestrogen receptors 3aflow cytometry 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3ahumans 3amitochondria 3aneoplasm cells 3aprotein synthesis 3asmall interfering RNA 3astaining 3atoxicology 0aERα 0aPARP 0aAIF 0aFBS 0aPI 0aCC 0aSRB 0aBSA 0aPMSF 0aα-Mangostin 0aApoptosis 0aHuman breast cancer cells 0aCaspase 0aERα1 aLee, Ju-Hye1 aKwon, Soon-Jae1 aKim, Jae-Yong1 aPark, Ki Hun,1 aYi, Mi-gyŏng,1 aSeo, Kwon-Il0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2014 Apr., v. 66 p.158-165dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2014.01.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245008800168300001800256520095900274592002801233650002101261650002901282650002501311650001101336650001301347650001301360650001801373650001901391650001801410650001501428650002201443650001901465650001201484700001701496700002001513700002001533773014201553856007401695852000901769655001201778IND60670958820221121232833.0191002e20140611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067095882DNAL7 a10.1039/c4tb00175c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNata, Iryanti Fatyasari12aA chitin nanofibril reinforced multifunctional monolith poly(vinyl alcohol) cryogel  ap. 4108-4113.  aA highly porous and spongy monolith cryogel was prepared by a single freeze–thawing cycle of a PVA solution containing chitin nanofibrils (CNFs) as the nanofiller and glutaraldehyde (GA) as the cross-linker. The presence of CNFs significantly reinforced the spongy structure of the cryogel so that repeated squeezing–releasing did not deteriorate its spongy structure. The in situ self-polymerized polydopamine was formed inside the spongy cryogel by soaking the cryogel in a dopamine solution. The polydopamine modified cryogel (PVA–CNF–D) showed a very good antioxidant activity in that approximately 49% of free radicals of DPPH˙ was consumed within 2 min. Silver nanoparticles (SNPs) could be spontaneously reduced from silver nitrate solution and deposited onto the polydopamine modified surface without an exogenous reducing reagent. The SNP incorporated spongy cryogel demonstrated a very effective antibacterial activity against E. coli.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3achitin 3acryogels 3adopamine 3afree radicals 3aglutaraldehyde 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3asilver nitrate 3asoaking1 aWu, Tsai-Mao1 aChen, Jung-Kung1 aLee, Cheng-Kang0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2014 June 11, v. 2, no. 26 p.4108-4113dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4tb00175c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010500173300001600278520122800294592002801522650001901550650001301569650001201582650001601594650001501610650002001625650001801645650001501663650001401678653001601692653001401708653001501722653002301737653002001760700001901780700002501799700002301824700002201847773011801869856008501987852000902072655001202081IND60537099020221118045320.0161106e20160703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053709902DNAL7 a10.1080/10826068.2015.10688052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSukkrom, Katesuda10aBiomass and lipid enhancement in Ankistrodesmus sp. cultured with reused and minimal nutrients media  ap. 467-473.  aMicroalgae are a promising feedstock for biofuel production. Lipid content in microalgae could be enhanced under nutrient depletion. This work investigated the effect of the nutrient on lipid accumulation in Ankistrodesmus sp. culture. Batch cultures were carried out using fresh BG11 medium, and after the harvest, the medium was reused for the next culture; this method was repeated two times. The maximum lipid productivity of 29.75 mg L ⁻¹ day ⁻¹ was obtained from the culture with the second reuse medium. In continuous cultures, Ankistrodesmus sp. was cultured in both fresh and modified BG11 mediums. The modified BG11 medium was adjusted to resemble the content of the first reuse medium. As a comparison between batch and continuous cultures, it was proven that the productivity in the continuous culture was better than in the batch, where the achievable maximum biomass and lipid were 188.30 and 38.32 mg L ⁻¹ day ⁻¹. The maximum lipid content of 34.22% was obtained from the continuous culture at a dilution rate of 0.08 day ⁻¹, whereas the maximum saturated and unsaturated fatty acid productivities of 79.96 and 104.54 mg L ⁻¹ day ⁻¹ were obtained at a dilution rate of 0.16 day ⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnkistrodesmus 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3afatty acids 3afeedstocks 3afuel production 3alipid content 3amicroalgae 3anutrients 0aCultivation 0aeconomics 0amicroalgae 0amodified nutrients 0aphotobioreactor1 aBunnag, Boosya1 aPowtongsook, Sorawit1 aSiangdung, Wipawan1 aPavasant, Prasert0 tPreparative biochemistry & biotechnology.g2016 July 3, v. 46, no. 5 p.467-473dTaylor & Francisx1532-22977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10826068.2015.10688053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03585naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245014300171300001600314500001500330520142500345592002801770650003501798650001501833650001801848650001801866650000901884650001501893650002201908650003201930650003101962650001301993650002002006650001302026650001402039650002102053650002002074650002202094650001802116650001102134650001402145653001802159653001302177653001802190653001002208653001502218653001002233653000802243653000802251653000802259653000702267653000802274653001002282653000802292653000802300653001502308653002202323653000902345653002002354653000902374653000702383653001702390653000902407653001302416653000802429700006002437700002402497700002602521700001902547700001802566773009802584856008802682852000902770655001202779IND60540273020221117202352.0190318e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054027302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoach, Thomas12aA proposed interplay between peroxidase, amine oxidase and lipoxygenase in the wounding-induced oxidative burst in Pisum sativum seedlings  ap. 130-138.  a2019-12-06  aPlant surfaces form the barrier between a plant and its environment. Upon damage, the wound healing process begins immediately and is accompanied by a rapid production of extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), essential in deterring pathogens, signalling responses and cell wall restructuring. Although many enzymes produce extracellular ROS, it is unclear if ROS-producing enzymes act synergistically. We characterised the oxidative burst of superoxide (O2−) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) that follows wounding in pea (Pisum sativum L.) seedlings. Rates of ROS production were manipulated by exogenous application of enzyme substrates and inhibitors. The results indicate significant roles for di-amine oxidases (DAO) and peroxidases (Prx) rather than NADPH oxidase. The burst of O2− was strongly dependent on the presence of H2O2 produced by DAO. Potential substrates released from wounded seedlings included linoleic acid that, upon exogenous application, strongly stimulated catalase-sensitive O2− production. Moreover, a 65kD plasma membrane (PM) guaiacol Prx was found in the secretome of wounded seedlings and showed dependence on linoleic acid for O2− production. Lipoxygenases are suggested to modulate O2− production by consuming polyunsaturated fatty acids in the apoplast. Overall, a O2−-producing mechanism involving H2O2-derived from DAO, linoleic acid and a PM-associated Prx is proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aperoxidase 3alinoleic acid 3atissue repair 3apeas 3acell walls 3ahydrogen peroxide 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3aapoplast 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aguaiacol 3aseedlings 3asuperoxide anion 3aplasma membrane 3aenzyme substrates 3aPisum sativum 3aoxygen 3apathogens 0aAmine oxidase 0aWounding 0aLinoleic acid 0aG6PDH 0aSuperoxide 0aPUFAs 0aROS 0aDPI 0aSOD 0aOH 0aLOX 0aO2− 0aEPR 0aDAO 0aPeroxidase 0aHydrogen peroxide 0aABTS 0aOxidative burst 0aH2O2 0aPM 0alipoxygenase 0aRboh 0aSeedling 0aPrx1 aColville, Louise1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4626-45221 aBeckett, Richard P.1 aMinibayeva, Farida V.1 aHavaux, Michel1 aKranner, Ilse0 tPhytochemistry.g2015 Apr., v. 112 p.130-138dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011000166300001600276520137600292592002801668650001101696650001601707650001501723650001801738650000901756650001501765650002501780650001601805650000901821650001001830650001301840650001501853650002201868653002901890653000801919653001801927653001501945700002601960700002001986700002102006700001802027700001902045773011102064856008202175852000902257655001202266IND60541924820221120175638.0190401e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054192482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2014.01.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelaney, Bryan10aThirteen week rodent feeding study with processed fractions from herbicide tolerant (DP-Ø73496-4) canola  ap. 173-184.  aThe potential health effects of meal and oil processed from seed of genetically modified (GM) canola plants (OECD unique identifier: DP-Ø73496-4; hereafter referred to as 73496 canola) containing an insert that expresses the GAT4621 protein conferring tolerance to nonselective herbicidal ingredient glyphosate were evaluated in a subchronic rodent feeding study. Sprague–Dawley rats (12/sex/group) were administered diets containing dehulled, defatted toasted canola meal (DH meal) and refined/bleached/deodorized canola oil (RBD oil) processed from seed of plants that were untreated (73496), sprayed in-field with glyphosate (73496GLY), the non-transgenic near-isogenic (091; control), or one of four commercially available non-GM reference canola varieties (45H72, 45H73, 46A65, 44A89). All diets were formulated as a modification of the standard laboratory chow PMI® Nutrition International, LLC Certified Rodent LabDiet® 5002 (PMI® 5002). DH canola meal and RBD canola oil replaced all commodity soybean fractions typically incorporated in PMI® 5002. No toxicologically significant differences were observed between the test and control groups in this study. The results reported herein support the conclusion that DH meal and RBD oil processed from seed of 73496 canola are as safe and nutritious as DH meal and RBD oil processed from seed of non-GM canola.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanola 3acanola meal 3acanola oil 3adeodorization 3adiet 3aglyphosate 3aherbicide resistance 3aingredients 3arats 3aseeds 3asoybeans 3atoxicology 3atransgenic plants 0aSubchronic feeding study 0aRat 0aBiotechnology 0aGlyphosate1 aAppenzeller, Laura M.1 aRoper, Jason M.1 aMukerji, Pushkor1 aHoban, Denise1 aSykes, Greg P.0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2014 Apr., v. 66 p.173-184dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2014.01.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245014700207520134200354592002801696650001901724650001101743650001701754650001501771650002101786650001201807650001501819650000901834650001701843650002201860653001601882653001901898653003301917653002801950653001901978700005701997700001802054700002202072700001702094700001702111773011502128856008602243852000902329655001202338IND60736924520221121084834.0220110e20210905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073692452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1260452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTseng, Yi-Ho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5833-041110aSystematic approach to source-sink apportionment of copper in paddy fields: Experimental observation, dynamic modeling and prevention strategy  aThe accumulation of heavy metals in paddy rice severely impacts the health of consumers and plants. In this study, a systematic approach to source-sink apportionment of copper in paddy fields was developed by considering all bioenvironmental interfaces. Experimental data from two experimental fields (namely Field A and Field B) in the first harvest period was collected. Then, mass-balance-based models with dynamic critical loads were established to evaluate the year of excess for copper. The results indicated that irrigation water contributed the highest portion (96.2–98.8%) of total copper inputs. Under the business-as-usual scenario, the soil copper concentration of Field A and Field B might exceed the Taiwanese national standard within 66 and 24 years, respectively. In addition, alternate wet-dry irrigation was found to be one of the total solutions to reducing copper accumulation in soils by 17–48%. It could also provide a significant reduction of water usage in paddy fields by ~25%, thereby increasing the resilience to extreme climate change events. Lastly, based on the field observations, three improvement strategies on sustaining soil quality towards better agricultural environment were proposed. The connection of copper accumulation in soils with dietary and ecological risks was also briefly illustrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acopper 3aharvest date 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3apaddies 3arough rice 3asoil 3asoil quality 3awater utilization 0aHeavy metal 0aYear of excess 0aComprehensive dynamic models 0aWater-saving management 0aClimate change1 aPan, Shu-Yuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2082-40771 aSyu, Wei-Jhan1 aHuang, Hung-Pin.,1 aWei, Chao-Yu1 aHe, Kung-Hui0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Sept. 05, v. 417 p.126045-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1260453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01967naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245007100157300002000228520080700248592002801055650001501083650002101098650001301119650001301132650001401145650001201159650002001171650001101191650002101202653001401223653001201237653000801249653000801257653001301265653001901278700001801297700002001315773012601335856007501461852000901536655001201545IND60527559820221123004451.0160715e20131226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052755982DNAL7 a10.1021/am404174n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Ji Yeon,10aGlucose Sensor using Liquid-Crystal Droplets Made by Microfluidics  ap. 13135-13139.  aMicrometer-sized, 4-cyno-4-pentylbiphenyl (5CB) droplets were developed for glucose detection in an aqueous medium by coating with poly(acrylicacid-b-4-cynobiphenyl-4-oxyundecylacrylate) (PAA-b-LCP) at the 5CB/water interface and covalently immobilizing glucose oxidase (GOx) to the PAA chains.

Administration with BC at 500 mg/kg of body weight in diphenoxylate-induced constipation rats distinctly improved the carmine propulsion rate (83.5 ± 5.2%), shortened the defecating time of the first red feces (249.0 ± 23.3 min), and increased the weight of carmine red feces within 5 h (2.7 ± 1.3 g). The levels of aquaporins (AQP-2, AQP-3, and AQP-4) and inhibitory neurotransmitters (nitric oxide, nitric oxide synthetase, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and arginine vasopressin) in the BC-treated groups reduced by 31.9–40.0% (p < 0.01) and 21.1–67.7% (p < 0.01) compared to those in the constipation group, respectively. However, the secretion of excitability neurotransmitters (substance P and motilin) in the BC-treated groups was increased by 20.0–39.9% (p < 0.01). The activities of ATPases in the colon of constipation rats were significantly weakened by BC administration (p < 0.01). Histological morphology of the colon showed that BC supplementation could effectively increase the length of villus cells and the thickness of colonic mucosa and muscle (p < 0.01). Moreover, BC supplementation could protect colonic smooth muscle cells against apoptosis. All of the findings suggest that BC supplementation effectively relieves constipation in rats and BC would be used as a great promising dietary fiber for alleviating constipation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aapoptosis 3aaquaporins 3aarginine vasopressin 3abody weight 3acellulose 3acolon 3aconstipation 3adietary fiber 3aenzyme activity 3afeces 3ahistology 3amotilin 3amuscles 3amyocytes 3aneurotransmitters 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3arats 3asecretion 3asmooth muscle 3asubstance P 3avasoactive intestinal peptide 3avilli 0aaquaporins 0aATPase activities 0abacterial cellulose 0adiphenoxylate-induced constipation 0aintestinal neurotransmitters1 aLin, Dehui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1591-96291 aZhao, Yan1 aYang, Xingbin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8039-05250 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 Apr. 07, v. 66, no. 16 p.4106-4117dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b003853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011000155300002000265520128600285592002801571650001501599650002401614650003401638650002201672650002101694650001301715650002201728650002901750650001401779700001801793700001701811700001601828700001601844700001601860700001401876700001301890700001701903700001501920700001601935700001601951700001701967700001601984700001602000773012402016856007402140852000902214655001202223IND60696003820221120233043.0200521e20200520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069600382DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra03602a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRan, Aihua12aA gradient screening approach for retired lithium-ion batteries based on X-ray computed tomography images  ap. 19117-19123.  aAccurate and efficient screening of retired lithium-ion batteries from electric vehicles is crucial to guarantee reliable secondary applications such as in energy storage, electric bicycles, and smart grids. However, conventional electrochemical screening methods typically involve a charge/discharge process and usually take hours to measure critical parameters such as capacity, resistance, and voltage. To address this issue of low efficiency for battery screening, scanned X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) cross-sectional images in combination with a computational image recognition algorithm have been employed to explore the gradient screening of these retired batteries. Based on the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) algorithm with 2000 CT images per battery, the calculated CT scores are closely correlated with their internal resistance and capacity, indicating the feasibility of CT scores to sort retired batteries. We find out that when the CT scores are larger than 0.65, there is high potential for a secondary application. Therefore, this pioneering and non-destructive CT score method can reflect the internal electrochemical properties of these retired batteries, which could potentially expedite the battery reuse industry for a sustainable energy future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputed tomography 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectric vehicles 3aelectrochemistry 3aindustry 3alithium batteries 3arenewable energy sources 3ascreening1 aChen, Shuxiao1 aZhang, Siwei1 aLiu, Siyang1 aZhou, Zihao1 aNie, Pengbo1 aQian, Kun1 aFang, Lu1 aZhao, Shi-Xi1 aLi, Baohua1 aKang, Feiyu1 aZhou, Xiang1 aSun, Hongbin1 aZhang, Xuan1 aWei, Guodan0 tRSC advances.g2020 May 20, v. 10, no. 32 p.19117-19123dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra03602a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003600149245008300185300001400268520143700282592002801719650001901747650002201766650001701788650002001805650002301825650002101848650001301869650001101882650002001893650003201913650001801945653001701963653004001980653002502020653003802045653003702083653002102120653001502141700007502156700007102231700002702302700003702329773012702366856008402493852000902577655001202586IND60616823820221116142505.0200128e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061682382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.coesh.2018.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPacheco, Fernando António Leal10aLand degradation: Multiple environmental consequences and routes to neutrality  ap. 79-86.  aDegradation is currently affecting 25% of Earth's land and 40% of Earth's agricultural land. The environmental consequences of land degradation are vast, including amplified soil losses, water quality deterioration, biodiversity decline and degradation of ecosystem services and corresponding values, especially if actual land uses disrespect capability (natural use), in which cases land is in a state of environmental conflict. The global cost of land degradation just looking to agriculture approaches US$ 500 billion/yr. Facing this terrible ecological and economic scenarios, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the “Sustainable Development Goals” in 2015, which comprise a target to combat desertification and restore degraded land. The aim is to achieve land degradation neutrality by 2030. Framework models have already been proposed to unpack this innovative concept and address its operation through the Rio Conventions. While implementing these models, which follow the response hierarchy of avoid > reduce > reverse land degradation, environmental consequences of land degradation should be compensated by sustainable land management practices that render the Earth no net loss of the land-based natural capital relative to a baseline. The ultimate goal is however to attain self sustainability whereby environmental and production potentials are supported by self-regulating processes within the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations 3aagricultural land 3abiodiversity 3adesertification 3aecosystem services 3aland degradation 3aland use 3amodels 3anatural capital 3asustainable land management 3awater quality 0aSoil erosion 0aDegradation of stream water quality 0aBiodiversity decline 0aDegradation of ecosystem services 0aEnvironmental land use conflicts 0aLand degradation 0aNeutrality1 aSanches Fernandes, Luís Filipe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9486-71601 aValle Junior, Renato Farias1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0774-57881 aValera, Carlos Alberto1 aPissarra, Teresa Cristina Tarlé0 tCurrent opinion in environmental science & health.g2018 Oct., v. 5 p.79-86dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26761x2468-58447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coesh.2018.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245013200160520182700292592002802119650001502147650001602162650001502178650001002193650001202203650002002215650001902235653003602254653003602290653002402326653002002350653001902370653001402389700002302403700002002426700002302446700005602469773011202525856008302637852000902720655001202729IND60758459120221117214230.0220103e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075845912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2021.1138342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Xin10aImplementation of biohybrid olfactory bulb on a high-density CMOS-chip to reveal large-scale spatiotemporal circuit information  aLarge-scale multi-site biosensors are essential to probe the olfactory bulb (OB) circuitry for understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of simultaneous discharge patterns. Current ex-vivo biosensing techniques are limited to recording a small set of neurons and cannot provide an adequate resolution, which hinders revealing the fast dynamic underlying the information coding mechanisms in the OB circuit. Here, we demonstrate a novel biohybrid OB-CMOS biosensing platform to decipher the cross-scale dynamics of the OB electrogenesis and quantify the distinct neuronal coding properties. The approach with 4096-microelectrodes offers a non-invasive, label-free, bioelectrical imaging to decode simultaneous firing patterns from thousands of connected neuronal ensembles in acute OB slices. The platform can measure spontaneous and drug-induced extracellular field potential activity with substantially improved spatiotemporal resolution over conventional OB-based biosensors. Also, we employ our OB-CMOS recordings to perform multidimensional analysis to instantiate specific neurophysiological metrics underlying the olfactory spatiotemporal coding that emerged from the OB interconnected layers. Our results delineate the computational implications of large-scale activity patterns in functional olfactory processing. The systematic interplay of the experimental CMOS-base platform architecture and the high-content characterization of the olfactory circuit with various computational analyses endow significant functional interrogations of the OB information processing, high-spatiotemporal connectivity mapping, and global circuit dynamics. Thus, our study can inspire the design of advanced biomimetic olfactory-based biosensors and neuromorphic approaches for diagnostic biomarkers and drug discovery applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abiomimetics 3abiosensors 3adrugs 3aneurons 3aneurophysiology 3aolfactory bulb 0aOlfactory bulb-based biosensors 0aOlfactory spatiotemporal coding 0aBioelectronics nose 0aNeural circuits 0aElectrogenesis 0aCMOS-MEAs1 aKhanzada, Shahrukh1 aKlütsch, Diana1 aCalegari, Federico1 aAmin, Hayder1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6515-29910 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 198 p.113834-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.1138343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245020100168300001800369520118000387592002801567650001501595650002401610650001301634650001301647650001701660650004101677650001601718700001901734700001401753700002501767700002301792773010501815856008601920852000902006655001202015IND60585993220200306000000.0171114e20171114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058599322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.7b017862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhn, Junyoung10aInfluence of the Chain Architecture and the Presence of End-Groups or Branching Units Chemically Different from Repeating Structural Units on the Critical Adsorption Point in Liquid Chromatography  ap. 8720-8730.  aThe critical adsorption point (CAP) of linear and star-shaped polymers was investigated by normal phase and reversed phase liquid chromatography (NPLC and RPLC) and computer simulation. Three sets of polystyrenes (PS) differing in chain architecture and chemically distinct groups were prepared: linear PS (sec-butyl and hydrogen end group), 2-arm PS (linear, two sec-butyl end groups and one silyl group in the middle of the chain) and 4-arm star-shaped PS (four sec-butyl end groups and one silyl group in the center of the star). It was found that the column temperature at CAP, TCAP (linear PS) = TCAP (2-arm PS) > TCAP (4-arm PS) in both RPLC and NPLC which can be attributed to the variation in chain architecture. However, the elution times at CAP of three polymers are all different: In NPLC, tE,CAP (linear) > tE,CAP (2-arm PS) > tE,CAP (4-arm PS) while in RPLC, tE,CAP (4-arm PS) > tE,CAP (2-arm PS) > tE,CAP (linear). The variation of tE,CAP can be explained by the contribution of the chemically distinct groups. The computer simulation results are in good agreement with the chromatography experiments results and support the interpretation of experimental data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acomputer simulation 3ahydrogen 3amoieties 3apolystyrenes 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3atemperature1 aChang, Taihyun1 aWang, Xiu1 aLimpouchová, Zuzana1 aProcházka, Karel,0 tMacromolecules.g2017 Nov. 14, v. 50, no. 21 p.8720-8730dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.7b017863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245011500164520147800279592002801757650004401785650001601829650001401845650002801859650001101887650003701898650001301935650001901948650001401967650001001981650002301991650000902014653003202023653001302055653002802068653002802096700001702124700001402141700005702155773011502212856008602327852000902413655001202422IND60736924820221121084842.0220110e20210905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073692482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1260482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Lu10aGO-Ti3C2 two-dimensional heterojunction nanomaterial for anticorrosion enhancement of epoxy zinc-rich coatings  aMXenes are a unique family of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides and/or nitrides, which have been proven useful for energy storage, water purification, and biomedical applications. Herein, a kind of heterojunction structure was designed by grafting highly conductive MXene (Ti₃C₂) on the graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets， which was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman results. Open circuit potential (OCP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and salt spray measurements corroborated that inclusion of 0.5 wt% Ti₃C₂ or GO-Ti₃C₂ into epoxy zinc-rich coating (ZRC) effectively enhance the cathodic protection capability. Additionally, superior corrosion resistance was achieved by incorporation of GO-Ti₃C₂ into ZRC since GO-Ti₃C₂ in the coating improved the utilization rate of zinc particles and GO provided barrier protection for inhibiting the diffusion of corrosive agents. At the end of immersion, Rc value of ZRC/GO-Ti₃C₂ coating was 3.047 × 10⁴ Ω·cm², which was one order of magnitude higher than that of ZRC coating. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurements demonstrated that ZRC/GO-Ti₃C₂ coating exhibited lower speed of zinc particles oxidation and intact steel substrate. Hence, ZRC/GO-Ti₃C₂ coating exhibited the optimal corrosion resistance among the four kinds of coatings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3acorrosion 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aepoxides 3agraphene oxide 3aoxidation 3asteel 3awater purification 3azinc 0aHeterojunction nanomaterial 0aGO-Ti3C2 0aEpoxy zinc-rich coating 0aSynergistic enhancement1 aZhao, Wenjie1 aWang, Kui1 aXu, Jianguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1104-22010 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Sept. 05, v. 417 p.126048-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1260483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013500166300001800301520119700319592002801516650002201544650002301566650004401589650001901633650002101652650001501673650001101688650002301699700001801722700001101740700001501751700001901766773010501785856008601890852000901976655001201985IND60585993320221119014042.0171114e20171114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058599332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.7b017882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Ziyang10aPolythioamides of High Refractive Index by Direct Polymerization of Aliphatic Primary Diamines in the Presence of Elemental Sulfur  ap. 8505-8511.  aSulfur-containing polymers have renewed widespread attention due to their fascinating properties like high refractive index and semiconducting character. However, examples of direct polymerization involving elemental sulfur are limited. Herein, a new strategy to prepare polythioamide (PTA) by direct polymerization of aliphatic primary diamines in the presence of sulfur is reported. The polymerization of p-xylylenediamine (1) and sulfur at 110 °C in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone afforded PTA1 of high Mw and high yield when the feed ratio of [1]:[S] ranged from 1:2 to 1:3. ¹H NMR and ¹³C NMR spectra confirmed that there are three kinds of structural units among the PTA1 chains. Moreover, different diamines including m-xylylenediamine (2), 1,6-hexanediamine (3), ethylenediamine (4), and 1,4-cyclohexanediamine (5) were copolymerized with 1 in the presence of sulfur to obtain PTA copolymers. With an increase in 5 content, the copolymer PTA1/5 with an alternating sequence in the range of 56%–94% was prepared. Solubility and thermal properties of homopolymers and copolymers were studied. Meanwhile, the copolymers PTA1/3 and PTA1/5 possessed a high refractive index as high as 1.7.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1,6-hexanediamine 3acomposite polymers 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymerization 3arefractive index 3asolubility 3asulfur 3athermal properties1 aHuang, Huahua1 aLi, Le1 aLiu, Lixin1 aChen, Yongming0 tMacromolecules.g2017 Nov. 14, v. 50, no. 21 p.8505-8511dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.7b017883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03901naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245018000162300001200342520234600354592002802700650001802728650001202746650002002758650002002778650002802798650002502826650002602851650001702877650001502894650001602909650001002925650002202935650001702957650001402974650001502988650001803003650002603021650002403047650003503071650002803106650001203134650001603146650001703162773014103179856007803320852000903398655001203407IND60563552920221118004601.0170224e20170210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056355292DNAL7 a10.1139/apnm-2016-07002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoke, Kaitlin10aExploration of the perceived and actual benefits of omega-3 fatty acids and the impact of FADS1 and FADS2 genetic information on dietary intake and blood levels of EPA and DHA  ap. 333.  aFrom a global health perspective, increased intake of omega-3 fatty acids (FAs), in particular eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are beneficial for human health. However, the consumption of EPA- and DHA-rich foods such as fatty fish is low in the Western diet. Therefore, finding new ways to motivate people to increase their consumption of omega-3 FAs is essential. To find effective ways to motivate individuals, understanding people’s awareness of omega-3 FAs and how they obtain their knowledge about nutrition and health is critical. Consequently, we developed an online survey to assess awareness and self-reported intake of omega-3 FAs and supplements in young adults. EPA and DHA are also produced endogenously to a limited extent through a pathway regulated by fatty acid desaturase 1 and 2 (FADS1 and FADS2) genes. Of relevance, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FADS genes influence levels of omega-3 FAs, where minor allele carriers have lower levels compared with major allele carriers. Accordingly, we conducted a clinical trial to investigate FA levels in response to dietary EPA and DHA supplementation in young adults stratified by SNPs in FADS1 and FADS2. The level of reported awareness of omega-3 terminology varied depending on an individual’s field of study and thus providing all participants with the same set of nutrition information could be an effective tool to increase knowledge and motivate behaviour change. Additionally, the variation in FA levels in accordance to SNPs in FADS1 and FADS2 could be used to create tailored nutritional recommendations which may improve lifestyle habits. The results discovered in the first 2 studies regarding awareness of omega-3 FAs and genetic variation were subsequently used to design a nutrigenetics intervention in young adults. Individuals who received their FADS1 genetic information were more aware of different omega-3 FAs and reported fewer barriers to their consumption by the end of the study, compared with those who did not receive their personal genetic information. All participants increased their intake of EPA and DHA, which was reflected in the analyses of red blood cells. Overall, this thesis demonstrates the power of combining nutritional and genetic information as motivators to increase omega-3 consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern diets 3aalleles 3abehavior change 3aclinical trials 3adietary recommendations 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aerythrocytes 3afatty fish 3afood intake 3afoods 3agenetic variation 3ahuman health 3alifestyle 3ametabolism 3anutrigenomics 3anutrition information 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3asurveys 3aterminology 3ayoung adults0 tApplied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism.g2017 Feb. 10, v. 42, no. 3 p.333-333dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2016-07003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03317naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245015700166300001600323520200700339592002802346650003102374650002702405650001102432650001202443650002002455650001302475650001302488650002202501650001402523650001702537650001802554650002502572651001802597651001902615651001202634700001602646700001602662773009102678856008202769990002302851852000902874655001202883IND60094510620221121020448.0141104e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009451062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dsr2.2013.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Arvind10aRevisiting N₂ fixation in the North Atlantic Ocean: Significance of deviations from the Redfield Ratio, atmospheric deposition and climate variability  ap. 148-158.  aThe average oceanic nitrate-to-phosphate molar ratio (NO₃ ⁻:PO₄ ³⁻≈16:1, referred to as the Redfield Ratio) in subsurface waters, which is similar to the average ratio of particulate nitrogen (N)-to-phosphorus (P) in phytoplankton, is the cornerstone in calculating geochemical estimates of N₂ fixation and denitrification rates. Any deviations from this canonical Redfield Ratio in intermediate ocean waters, expressed as N* (a measure of NO₃ ⁻ in excess or deficit of 16×PO₄ ³⁻), provides an integrated estimate of net N fluxes into and out of the ocean. In well-oxygenated ocean basins such as the North Atlantic Ocean, N* estimates are usually positive and can be used to infer that rates of N₂ fixation exceed rates of denitrification. We use this approach to estimate N₂ fixation over the last two decades (1988–2009) based on data collected at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site in the North Atlantic Ocean near Bermuda. Our results indicate that interpretation of the N* tracer as an estimate of N₂ fixation should be undertaken with caution, as N₂ fixation is not the only process that results in a positive N* estimate. The impacts of a locally variable nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio, relative to the fixed Redfield Ratio, in the suspended particulate matter as well as in the subsurface water nutrients and atmospheric N deposition on N* variability were examined. Furthermore, we explored the role of climate modes (i.e., North Atlantic Oscillation and Arctic Oscillation) on N* variability. We found that N* in the subsurface waters was significantly affected by these factors and hence previous estimates of N₂ fixation using this technique might have been substantially overestimated. Our revised estimate of N₂ fixation in the North Atlantic Ocean (0°N–50°N, 20°W–80°W) is 12.2±0.9×10¹¹molNyr⁻¹, and based on long-term BATS data provides better constraints than both earlier indirect and direct estimates N₂ fixation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorth Atlantic Oscillation 3aatmospheric deposition 3abasins 3aclimate 3adenitrification 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3anutrients 3aparticulates 3aphytoplankton 3atime series analysis 3aArctic region 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aBermuda1 aLomas, M.W.1 aBates, N.R.0 tDeep-Sea Research Part II.g2013 Sept., v. 93 p.148-158dElsevier Ltdx0967-06457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2013.04.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011800169300001800287520134300305592002801648650001301676650001501689650001301704650001201717650002301729650002101752650001701773650002201790650002001812650001601832650002301848650001901871700002101890700001701911700001501928700002301943700001601966700002101982773010502003856008602108852000902194655001202203IND60585993420221119020417.0171114e20171114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058599342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.7b018082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSgouros, A.

Our methodology employs efficient algorithms (developed here and from the literature) for fast and reliable simulations of high molar mass polymer melts and is applied to the well-tested molten polyethylene/graphite interface, as well to the free surface of molten polyethylene, using a united atom model for the polymer. The surface thermodynamic properties are obtained for a broad range of molar masses and temperatures and are compared to experimental data, theoretical models, and earlier simulation studies. The individual components of the stress tensor are isolated, and their profiles along the aperiodic dimension are correlated to the orientational and structural features of the polymer chains near the interfaces. The distributions of end segments in free and capped polymer films are obtained for various temperatures and molar masses. The simulation procedure, the adequacy of the models employed for the stress tensor, and the tail corrections to surface thermodynamic properties as well as subtle issues arising in simulations of polymer/solid interfaces are discussed in detail.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aalgorithms 3agraphene 3amelting 3amolecular dynamics 3amolecular weight 3apolyethylene 3apolyethylene film 3asurface tension 3atemperature 3atheoretical models 3athermodynamics1 aVogiatzis, G.

The study considers the benefits obtained from forests and forest-related activities in the form of income and energy sources as key parameters to link the social system (local people) with the ecological system (forest). Qualitative and quantitative analysis of data on land use and socio-economic changes indicates that the transformation strategy improved both the wellbeing of local people and forest cover. In the case of the Philippines, social and ecological linkages were found to be strong, with local people rehabilitating the degraded land while also obtaining a high proportion of their total income from the activity. For the two Bangladesh cases, however, the level of dependency on the forest for livelihood declined as local people used their income from the forest and forest-related activities for diversification to non-forest activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adata analysis 3aenergy 3aforests 3aincome 3aland use 3alivelihood 3apeople 3aquantitative analysis 3asocioeconomics 3aBangladesh 3aPhilippines1 aInoue, Makoto1 aPeras, Rose Jane1 aNath, Tapan Kumar1 aJashimuddin, Mohammed1 aPulhin, Juan M.0 tSmall-scale forestry.g2016 June, v. 15, no. 2 p.213-227dSpringer Netherlandsx1873-76177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11842-015-9318-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03384naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002600168245010100194300001400295520130500309592002801614650001601642650002301658650001101681650001201692650001401704650003401718650001601752650001001768650001101778650001601789650001701805650001001822650000901832650004901841650002601890650006101916650002801977650005202005650000902057650003602066650001102102650002202113650001102135650000902146650002302155650001602178650003502194650003202229650001602261650002602277651001402303653002302317653001202340653001602352653001402368653002802382653001602410700001702426700002502443700002102468773009202489856008402581852000902665655001202674IND50068592920221121050206.0190318e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006859292DNAL7 a238311512pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2013.06.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrichton, Georgina E.10aMediterranean diet adherence and self-reported psychological functioning in an Australian sample  ap. 53-59.  aGiven the reported health benefits of a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and delay in cognitive decline, we aimed to determine the level of adherence to a MedDiet using an 11-point scale and examine relationships with cognitive function and psychological well-being. Cross-sectional analyses were undertaken on data from 1183 Australian adults, aged 40–65. Food frequency questionnaires were used to calculate mean intakes of foods included in a MedDiet and foods typically consumed in an Australian diet. Outcome measures included self-reported cognitive failures, memory, anxiety, stress, self-esteem, general health and physical function. The majority of Australians (71.7%) had a medium adherence to a MedDiet pattern. Overall MedDiet adherence was not related to cognitive function. However, intakes of plant foods associated with a MedDiet were positively associated with physical function and general health, and negatively associated with trait anxiety, depression and perceived stress. A substantial proportion of the diet in this Australian sample came from foods not typically consumed in a MedDiet. This is a major limitation when attempting to compare MedDiet adherence in different populations. Global standardisation of serving sizes and food groups are required for adequate comparison.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAustralians 3aMediterranean diet 3aadults 3aanxiety 3acognition 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood intake 3afoods 3amemory 3aself-esteem 3aserving size 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAnxietyxdiet therapyxprevention & control. 2aCognitionxphysiology 2aCognition Disordersxdiet therapyxprevention & control. 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDepressionxdiet therapyxprevention & control. 2aDiet 2aDiet, Mediterraneanxpsychology 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMemoryxphysiology 2aMiddle Aged 2aPatient Compliancexpsychology 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSelf Report 2aStress, Physiological 0aAustralia 0aMediterranean diet 0aMedDiet 0aPlant foods 0aCognition 0aPsychological wellbeing 0aAustralians1 aBryan, Janet1 aHodgson, Jonathan M.1 aMurphy, Karen J.0 tAppetite.g2013 Nov. 01, v. 70 p.53-59dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2013.06.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010700165300001600272520153100288592002801819650002101847650002401868650002201892650001301914650001201927650001001939650001101949650001501960650001001975650001301985650001801998650001502016650001402031650001202045650001102057650001302068650001002081650001202091650002202103650001002125650001502135651001302150700001902163700001902182700001602201773010002217856008102317852000902398655001202407IND60520162120221122225803.0160514e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052016212DNAL7 a10.1007/s11842-015-9317-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbiyu, Abrham10aTree Planting by Smallholder Farmers in the Upper Catchment of Lake Tana Watershed, Northwest Ethiopia  ap. 199-212.  aTree growing by smallholder farmers is an emerging livelihood strategy in Lake Tana catchment. The objectives of this study were to (1) identify the most important tree species grown, (2) investigate the drivers of the existing pattern, and (3) identify determinants of the number and diversity of tree species and their spatial patterns. Survey data were collected from 200 households. Multiple linear regression was employed to identify the determinants of tree growing behaviour of households and spatial variables affecting the abundance of tree species. Eucalyptus globulus, Acacia decurrens and E. camaldulensis dominate woodlots. Only a fraction of the forest production is used by the households, the rest being sold as poles or charcoal. Location in relation to market centres, number of livestock owned, landholding size and age of household head were found to positively affected the number of tree species and trees grown. Gender affected the species and spatial pattern of trees. Woodlots, farm boundaries and homesteads were found to be important tree growing niches. These results substantiate the proposition that farmers assign their parcels of land to uses that increase the rent value of the land, and this value is affected by access to roads. Woodlots are on the increase at the cost of productive agricultural land. Provision of a tree planting extension service may increase participation of farmers in tree planting, and a management-oriented tree planting extension service may give desirable results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia decurrens 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aagricultural land 3acharcoal 3afarmers 3afarms 3agender 3ahouseholds 3alakes 3aland use 3alinear models 3alivelihood 3alivestock 3amarkets 3aniches 3aplanting 3aroads 3asurveys 3atimber production 3atrees 3awatersheds 3aEthiopia1 aDemel Teketay,1 aGratzer, Georg1 aShete, Maru0 tSmall-scale forestry.g2016 June, v. 15, no. 2 p.199-212dSpringer Netherlandsx1873-76177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11842-015-9317-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245006300163300001600226520117200242592002801414650002401442650001301466650001101479650002401490650003301514650001601547650001101563653001901574653002401593653002501617653003301642700001601675700001801691700005601709700001601765773011401781856008601895852000901981655001201990IND60633849920221119132438.0190725e20190605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063384992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.03.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jin10aReaction yield model of nitrocellulose alkaline hydrolysis  ap. 603-608.  aMilitary nitrocellulose waste is flammable and explosive, and thus requires safe disposal and resource utilization. The alkaline hydrolysis process is a potential treatment method for nitrocellulose waste. In this study, a reaction yield model of nitrocellulose alkaline hydrolysis reaction was studied. For this purpose, a theoretical reaction yield model of nitrocellulose alkaline hydrolysis was developed based on Fick’s law and scanning electron microscopy analysis. Additionally, the reaction yield model was experimentally validated. The results revealed a linear relationship between the nitrocellulose alkaline hydrolysis rate of xNC and the reaction time of t, which is given by t/tf = xNC. The limiting step of the alkaline hydrolysis of nitrocellulose is the rate of diffusion of OH− through the large pore channels. Accordingly, the reaction rate of the nitrocellulose alkaline hydrolysis can be increased by increasing the KOH concentration, reaction temperature, and reducing the size of the nitrocellulose granules. Thus, this model provides theoretical and technical support for the safe disposal and resource utilization of nitrocellulose waste.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline hydrolysis 3agranules 3amodels 3apotassium hydroxide 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3awastes 0aNitrocellulose 0aAlkaline hydrolysis 0aReaction yield model 0aScanning electron microscopy1 aYin, Xiaohu1 aLiu, Zongkuan1 aGu, Chaolin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1033-232X1 aNiu, Jiaxin0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2019 June 05, v. 371 p.603-608dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.03.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002500159245010900184500002200293520112500315592002801440650002101468650002701489650002101516650002401537650001301561650001901574650001201593650001401605650002001619653002601639653002801665653001201693653001801705653001501723700002001738700001801758700002201776773007801798856009301876852000901969655001201978IND60582003620221120164902.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058200362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2017.08.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatti, Sadia Mehmood10aIsolation and characterization of bacteria capable of degrading poly(lactic acid) at ambient temperature  aPre-press version  aFour bacteria, Chryseobacterium sp., Sphingobacterium sp. and two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, capable of degrading poly(lactic acid), PLA, at mesophillic temperatures (∼30 °C) were isolated. Their growth and formation of biofilm on PLA was characterized. To establish the biodegradation role of these bacteria and to assess any possible influence of abiotic factors in the biodegradation of PLA at 30 °C, the biodegradation rate of each strain was measured as the reduction of weight average molecular number (Mn) of PLA. A rapid reduction of PLA Mn was observed when incubated with each strain. Abiotic controls showed very slow degradation rates. Only the P. aeruginosa isolates were able to grow on lactate suggesting that there is a novel mechanism for degradation by Chryseobacterium sp. and Sphingobacterium sp. All four strains were capable of forming biofilm on the surface of PLA films consistent with the observed polymer degradation. This comparative study establishes the role of these isolates in the degradation of PLA at ambient temperature without or minimal assistance from abiotic factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChryseobacterium 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aSphingobacterium 3aambient temperature 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3amanganese 3apolylactic acid 0aBacterial degradation 0aMesophillic temperature 0aBiofilm 0apoly(lactide) 0aComposting1 aShah, Aamer Ali1 aAuras, Rafael1 aMarsh, Terence L.0 tPolymer Degradation and Stability.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2017.08.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009100167300001600258520156200274592002801836650002301864650002201887650002001909650001201929650001501941650001101956650001901967650001801986650002202004650002002026650002002046651001002066700001802076700001702094773010002111856008102211852000902292655001202301IND60520162220221122220248.0160514e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052016222DNAL7 a10.1007/s11842-015-9316-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdhikari, Sunit10aIncentives and Community Participation in the Governance of Community Forests in Nepal  ap. 179-197.  aIncreased participation of local users in decision-making about forests and gaining benefits from these forests are major goals of the community forestry program in Nepal. However, there is a lack of real participation in community forest governance amongst users, particularly by poor and marginalised members. By employing a mixed-method approach, this research explores the issue of participation in the governance of community forests, and in particular the role of incentives in increasing participation. A partial least square approach is undertaken to link the participation indicators to the various incentives. Access to benefits, enforcement of legal property rights and social cohesion through building of local institutions are identified as the key influential incentives that determine the effective participation of users in community forest governance. Other incentive—including income supplements, community infrastructure development or payment for environment services—are insufficient to counter the opportunity cost of participation, and hence have a weak but still significant influence on users’ decisions to participate. Power inequality due to socio-cultural norms, together with poor economic capabilities and weak bargaining power, could undermine the meaningful participation of poor and disadvantaged groups in the governance of community forests, unless the community forestry institutions are strengthened in order to be able to deal with the issues of inequitable access and restricted opportunities at the local level.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity forestry 3acommunity service 3adecision making 3aforests 3agovernance 3aincome 3ainfrastructure 3aleast squares 3aopportunity costs 3aproperty rights 3asocial cohesion 3aNepal1 aKingi, Tanira1 aGanesh, Siva0 tSmall-scale forestry.g2016 June, v. 15, no. 2 p.179-197dSpringer Netherlandsx1873-76177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11842-015-9316-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245020000167300001800367520160400385592002801989650001202017650001202029650001202041650002102053650002302074650001702097650001502114650001902129650002102148650000702169650002102176650002402197650001902221650002702240650001202267700001602279700001702295700002102312700001602333773010502349856008602454852000902540655001202549IND60585993620221119020731.0171114e20171114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058599362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.7b018252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yuanchao10aEnhanced Stability of Surface-Tethered Diblock Copolymer Brushes with a Neutral Polymer Block and a Weak Polyelectrolyte Block: Effects of Molecular Weight and Hydrophobicity of the Neutral Block  ap. 8580-8587.  aWe study the stability of diblock copolymer brushes featuring a bottom neutral block, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) or poly(poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate) (PPEGMA), and a top poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) block on flat silicon substrate. The polymer brushes are prepared by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). We use a combinatorial design featuring a molecular weight gradient in the bottom neutral block to investigate systematically the effect of the molecular weight of that block on the stability of the copolymer brush. We measure variations in dry thickness of the diblock copolymer brush by ellipsometry after different incubation times in aqueous buffer (pH = 9.0) as a function of thickness of the neutral block, indicating degrafting of the mechanically activated copolymer chains via hydrolysis of ester groups in the initiator and/or Si–O bonds that attach the polymer to the substrate. The stability of the diblock copolymer brushes is higher than that of PAA homopolymer brushes of the same molecular weight as the copolymer. Moreover, we establish that increasing the molecular weight of the neutral bottom PMMA block in PMMA-b-PAA brush shows higher stability than increasing the molecular weight of the bottom PPEGMA block in PPEGMA-b-PAA brush. Partial swelling of the bottom PMMA block (due to addition of a small amount of acetone) makes the degrafting of PMMA-b-PAA more pronounced. These findings suggest that the bottom water-insoluble polymer block plays an important role in governing the overall stability of the diblock copolymer brush.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3abrushes 3abuffers 3achemical bonding 3acomposite polymers 3aelectrolytes 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apolyacrylic acid 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3asilicon1 aKo, Yeongun1 aLin, Yiliang1 aKiserow, Douglas1 aGenzer, Jan0 tMacromolecules.g2017 Nov. 14, v. 50, no. 21 p.8580-8587dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.7b018253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245008900171300001800260500001500278520103800293592002801331650001301359650002101372650001401393650002401407650001401431650001401445650001801459650001301477650001401490650000901504650002101513650001601534650001601550650003101566650001801597650000901615650001601624650001601640653001401656653001101670653001701681653001601698700002601714700005701740700006801797773014801865856008002013852000902093655001202102IND60604268120180918000000.0180716e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060426812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b004022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPablos-Tanarro, Alba10aAssessment of the Allergenic Potential of the Main Egg White Proteins in BALB/c Mice  ap. 2970-2976.  a2019-12-06  aThis work aimed to assess the contribution of the major egg white proteins, ovalbumin, ovomucoid, and lysozyme, to the induction and elicitation of allergenic responses. For this purpose, BALB/c mice were orally administered either the individual egg allergens or a mixture of the three proteins in the same proportion, to evaluate their relative allergenicity avoiding their different abundance in egg white. Cholera toxin was used as a T helper 2 (Th2)-polarizing adjuvant. Ovomucoid and lysozyme triggered the most severe anaphylaxis reactions upon oral challenge. In comparison to ovalbumin and ovomucoid, lysozyme was a more active promotor of early immunoglobulin E and immunoglobulin G1 production and stimulated stronger Th2-biased responses from both mesenteric lymph node and spleen cells. These results indicate that lysozyme is highly immunogenic and should be considered as a major allergen, whose clinical usefulness in the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic approaches of egg allergy deserves further consideration.  aPublisher supplied data 3alysozyme 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aadjuvants 3aoral administration 3aovalbumin 3aprognosis 3aallergenicity 3aovomucin 3aallergens 3amice 3aimmunoglobulin E 3asplenocytes 3alymph nodes 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3acholera toxin 3aeggs 3aegg albumen 3aanaphylaxis 0aovomucoid 0aBALB/c 0atherapeutics 0aegg allergy1 aLozano-Ojalvo, Daniel1 aMolina, Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7918-77681 aLópez Fandiño, Rosina,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6979-92580 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 66, no. 11 p.2970-2976dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b004023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245007600166300001600242520132500258592002801583650001601611650002101627650002301648650002101671650001501692650002001707650001301727650001801740650001301758650001701771700001501788700001801803700001401821700001401835700001601849700001201865700001701877700001901894700001301913700001601926700001301942700001401955773008701969856008402056852000902140655001202149IND60591576320221120095714.0180320e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059157632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2016.03.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Yujie10aMultifunctional three-dimensional graphene nanoribbons composite sponge  ap. 133-140.  aGraphene nanoribbons are thin strips of graphene with high aspect ratio similar to carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and have been verified to exhibit excellent chemical and physical properties. Although individual graphene nanoribbons have been produced by longitudinal unzipping of carbon nanotubes or patterned growth in large scale, it is still a challenge to construct these unique structures into macroscopic functional architectures using a cost-effective method. Here, we present an electrophoresis method to introduce graphene nanoribbons into commercial polyurethane sponges to fabricate polyurethane-based graphene nanoribbons sponges, which inherit the three-dimensional network and high porosity from original polyurethane sponges. The composite sponges exhibit outstanding mechanical, electronic and lipophilic–hydrophobic properties. Meanwhile, the graphene nanoribbon composite sponges with enhanced surface area and chemical functionality can serve as supercapacitor electrodes, showing a good cycling stability of 92% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles tested in a three-electrode electrochemical configuration. Our multifunctional graphene nanoribbon composite sponges may find potential applications in many fields such as environmental cleanup, flexible supercapacitors and compression strain sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarbon nanotubes 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrophoresis 3agraphene 3apolyurethanes 3aporosity 3asurface area1 aZhu, Jiaqi1 aWang, Chunhui1 aDai, Bing1 aLi, Yuxin1 aQin, Yuyang1 aXu, Fan1 aPeng, Qingyu1 aYang, Zhenhuai1 aBai, Jie1 aCao, Wenxin1 aYuan, Ye1 aLi, Yibin0 tCarbon.g2016 Aug., v. 104 p.133-140dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2016.03.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03618naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245009600166300001300262520225000275592002802525650001502553650002502568650000902593650001402602650002402616650001302640650001402653650001202667650001102679650001302690650001902703650001602722650001802738653001502756653000902771653001302780653001202793653001102805700002002816700002102836700002202857700002002879700002602899773011402925856007603039852000903115655001203124IND60563553220221118004551.0170224e20160721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056355322DNAL7 a10.1139/er-2016-00062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColotelo, Alison H.12aA comparison of metrics to evaluate the effects of hydro-facility passage stressors on fish  ap. 1-11.  aHydropower is the most common form of renewable energy, and countries worldwide are considering expanding hydropower to new areas. One of the challenges of hydropower deployment is mitigation of the environmental impacts including water quality, habitat alterations, and ecosystem connectivity. For fish species that inhabit river systems with hydropower facilities, passage through the facility to access spawning and rearing habitats can be particularly challenging. Fish moving downstream through a hydro facility can be exposed to a number of stressors (e.g., rapid decompression, cavitation, blade strike and collision, turbulence, and shear forces), which can affect fish survival in direct and indirect ways. Many studies have investigated the effects of hydroturbine passage on fish; however, the comparability among studies is limited by variation in the metrics and biological endpoints used. Future studies investigating the effects of hydroturbine passage should focus on using metrics and endpoints that are easily comparable. This review summarizes four categories of metrics that are used in fisheries research that have application to hydroturbine passage (i.e., mortality, injury, physiological markers, behavior) and evaluates them based on several criteria (i.e., resources needed, invasiveness, comparability among stressors and species, and diagnostic properties). Additionally, these comparisons are put into context of study setting (i.e., laboratory versus field). Overall, injury and physiological markers are ideal for studies in which there is a need to understand the mechanisms of effect, whereas behavior and mortality metrics provide information on the whole body response of the fish. The study setting strongly influences the comparability among studies. In laboratory-based studies, stressors can be controlled by type, intensity, and duration, allowing for easy comparisons among studies. In contrast, field studies expose fish to realistic passage environments but the comparability is limited. Based on these results, future studies, whether lab or field-based, should focus on metrics that relate to mortality for ease of comparison, while some diagnostic capability is important for furthering the science.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3afish 3afisheries 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3amortality 3arearing 3arivers 3aspawning 3aturbulent flow 3awater power 3awater quality 0ahydropower 0afish 0asurvival 0ametrics 0ainjury1 aGoldman, Amy E.1 aWagner, Katie A.1 aBrown, Richard S.1 aDeng, Z.

This study assesses factors responsible for the participation of member households in the planning and implementation process of a CF program in Nepal. Data were collected through a survey of 116 households from six community forest user groups, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions. Simple random sampling was used to collect both qualitative and quantitative information from 10 % of households participating in CF, utilizing a semi-structured questionnaire. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze the factors associated with participation in planning and implementations of CF activities. Six socio-demographic and biophysical explanatory variables were included in the analysis, of which Caste, Sex, Age, and Forest Condition were found statistically significant. The results indicate that if the condition of the community forest is perceived as satisfactory, User Committees receive higher user participation in regards to forest development activities and fund mobilization. The results also suggest activities involving physical work attract younger participants. The existing equal access to forest products does not promote equity. However, promoting women and disadvantaged user participation in CF activities may help achieve higher equitability of CF user groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommittees 3acommunity forestry 3acommunity service 3aforest management 3aforest products 3aforests 3ahouseholds 3ainterviews 3aplanning 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3awomen 3aNepal1 aTimilsina, Yajna P.0 tSmall-scale forestry.g2016 June, v. 15, no. 2 p.257-270dSpringer Netherlandsx1873-76177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11842-015-9321-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02048naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009200172300001600264520065900280592002800939650000800967650002200975650001200997650001001009650000901019650000901028650001201037650001101049650001101060651001201071653001701083653002601100653000901126653002101135653001101156653001201167700001901179700002101198700002201219700001801241700002501259700002701284700002501311700002201336773009101358856008401449852000901533655001201542IND60123070520221120033042.0150325e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012307052DNAL7 a10.2989/00306525.2013.7815512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManaa, Abdessalam10aDiet of Black-shouldered Kite Elanus caeruleus in a farmland area near Algiers, Algeria  ap. 113-117.  aThe diet of the Black-shouldered Kite Elanus caeruleus was analysed in a recently colonised area in Meftah, south-eastern Algiers, Algeria. The diet was determined by analysing 144 pellets. Our data showed that the diet was dominated by rodents with Algerian mouse Mus spretus comprising between 61% and 77% of the diet. Based on relative biomass, rodents were the main prey species, comprising 88.1% of the diet in 2006, 68.4% in 2007 and 52.0% in 2008. Birds were the second-most important prey, comprising as much as 43.4% of the diet in 2008.

Several layered composite materials aimed at such multi-functionality have been conceived and realized: the characterization has been carried out in terms of electromagnetic shielding effectiveness in the range 0.8–8.0 GHz and of energy absorbing capability upon impact of metallic bullets fired at about 400 m/s and 1000 m/s (such velocity allows to explore the low energy range of potential mechanical shocks in aerospace structures). The composite specimens under test are ∼3.5 mm thick tiles made of hybrid multi-scale material: the manufacturing has been performed by integrating several layers of Kevlar fabric and carbon fiber plies within a polymeric matrix reinforced by carbon nanotubes. The electromagnetic shielding effectiveness has been measured by means of a reverberation chamber; the performances of the layered composites approach the metallic behavior with values of shielding up to 80 dB. The impact tests have been carried out by using an in-house built linear electromagnetic accelerator, known as railgun; the results show that a thin and light tile of the designed composite material is able to absorb high energy impacts with local delamination of the layered structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon fibers 3acarbon nanotubes 3acomposite materials 3adelamination 3aelectromagnetic interference 3aenergy 3aepoxides 3amanufacturing 3atiles1 aVricella, A.1 aPastore, R.1 aDelfini, A.1 aGiusti, A.1 aAlbano, M.1 aMarchetti, M.1 aMoglie, F.1 aPrimiani, V.

Here, we present a competitive chemistry strategy, i.e., a systematical regulation on Friedel–Crafts reaction and Scholl coupling reaction through tuning the ratios of monomers. This leads to a series of spirobifluorene-based microporous polymers (Sbf-TMPs) with systematically tuned porosities and N content. Unlike the existing copolymerization strategy by which the synthesized polymers exhibit a monotonic change tendency in the porosities, our networks demonstrate an unusually different trend where the porosity increases first and then decreases with the increasing Ph/Cl ratios for the monomers. This is mainly ascribed to the completion of coexisting reaction routines and the different “internal molecular free volumes” of the repeating units. The as-made networks feature tunable capacities for CO₂ adsorption over a wide range and attractive CO₂/N₂ selectivities. Moreover, these donor–acceptor type frameworks exhibit selective and highly sensitive fluorescence-on or fluorescence-off properties toward volatile organic compounds, which implies their great potential in fluorescent sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acopolymerization 3afluorescence 3anitrogen content 3apolymers 3aporosity 3aporous media 3avolatile organic compounds1 aGuo, Jun1 aHuang, Qiao1 aHe, Jianqiao1 aFu, Yu1 aKuang, Guichao1 aPan, Chunyue1 aYu, Guipeng0 tMacromolecules.g2017 Nov. 14, v. 50, no. 21 p.8512-8520dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.7b018573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245015700167300001600324520114500340592002801485596003601513596002901549596006101578596006101639650001801700650001601718650002201734650002001756650001801776650001901794650001701813650001801830650001001848650001501858650001601873650000901889650001501898650002401913700001801937700001901955700001301974700001801987700001902005773012102024856008302145852000902228655001202237IND60646326520221118044112.0190823e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064632652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-019-02688-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhengjun10aNoninvasive imaging of hepatocyte IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway for evaluating inflammation responses induced by end-stage stored whole blood transfusion  ap. 733-742.  aOBJECTIVE: To monitor the inflammatory storage lesions of end-stage stored whole blood (SWB) using a noninvasive STAT3 signal pathway mouse model. RESULTS: In this study, we present a hydrodynamic transfection-based STAT3-Luc mouse model in which hepatocyte STAT3 signal pathway activation can be monitored by measuring luciferase activity using a noninvasive imaging system. Such a mouse model may reflect systemic IL-6 and inflammation levels by monitoring the activation of STAT3. During end-stage SWB transfusion, in vivo imaging of STAT3-Luc mice showed obvious luciferase activity in the hepatic region, which was consistent with an increase in IL-6 levels in the liver homogenate and circulation. We also confirmed that the mononuclear phagocytic system contributed to the elevation of serum and liver IL-6 after end-stage SWB transfusion. CONCLUSION: The hepatocyte STAT3 signaling pathway, which is activated by end-stage SWB transfusion, is associated with the elevation of systemic IL-6 secreted by macrophages. The STAT3-Luc mouse may serve as a mouse model for monitoring inflammation responses after end-stage SWB transfusion.  aPublisher supplied data  a81800183cYoung Scientists Fund  aAHJ17J002-06cFoundation  a2017ZX10304402-003-011cMega-Project of Science Research  a2017ZX10304402-003-004cMega-Project of Science Research 3aanimal models 3ablood serum 3ablood transfusion 3aenzyme activity 3ahydrodynamics 3aimage analysis 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3aliver 3aluciferase 3amacrophages 3amice 3amonitoring 3asignal transduction1 aZhang, Yulong1 aZhou, Qianqian1 aMa, Ping1 aWang, Xiaohui1 aZhan, Linsheng0 tBiotechnology letters.g2019 July, v. 41, no. 6-7 p.733-742dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-019-02688-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006800167300001600235520100100251592002801252650003401280650002101314650001901335650001301354650001201367650001401379650001201393650001501405650001001420650001601430650001301446650001201459650001601471650001001487650001601497651001801513700001501531700001301546700001801559700002001577700001801597700001601615700001901631700001701650773010801667856008201775961001301857852000901870655001201879IND60520162720221121014424.0191003e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052016272DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-015-9709-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, W.

Plant geneticists and breeders have discovered genes that reduce recalcitrance for biochemical conversion to ethanol and drop-in fuels. Progress has also been made in finding genes that improve production under biotic and abiotic stress from diseases, pests, and climatic variations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgricultural Research Service 3aPanicum virgatum 3aabiotic stress 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acultivars 3aethanol 3afeedstocks 3agenes 3ageneticists 3agenetics 3agrasses 3anew variety 3apests 3aresearchers 3aUnited States1 aSarath, G.1 aEdme, S.1 aCasler, M.

Prf incorporates a protein kinase called Pto as its recognition domain that mimics effector virulence targets, and activates resistance after interaction with specific effectors. Recent findings show that this complex is oligomeric, and reveal how this impacts mechanism. Oligomerisation brings two or more kinases into proximity, where they can phosphorylate each other after effector perception. Effector attack on one kinase activates another in trans, constituting a molecular trap for the effector. Oligomerisation of plant resistance proteins may be a general concept that broadens pathogen recognition and restricts the ability of pathogens to evolve virulence.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisease models 3adisease resistance 3aoligomerization 3apathogens 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aproteins 3atomatoes 3avirulence1 aSaur, Isabel ML1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5610-12601 aConlan, Brendon1 aRathjen, John P0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2014 Aug., v. 20 p.69-74dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl58157x1369-52667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2014.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013500168300001600303520129000319592002801609650002101637650001401658650002101672650002501693650001301718650001101731650002001742650002501762650002501787650001101812700001501823700001701838700001401855773008701869856008401956852000902040655001202049IND60591576720221120110920.0180320e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059157672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2016.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Mengmeng10aEnhancement of cross-plane thermal conductivity and mechanical strength via vertical aligned carbon nanotube@graphite architecture  ap. 157-168.  aA three-dimensional (3D) carbon nanotube/exfoliated graphite block (CNT/EGB) was prepared by growing vertical aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) at the surface of SiO2-coated exfoliated graphite plate (EGP) through chemical vapor deposition followed by hot-pressing. In such 3D CNT/EGB, EGPs were bridged by the VACNTs in the cross-plane direction, and the interface between EGPs and VACNTs was covalently bonded by SiC which formed by reaction of SiO2 and the adjacent carbon of EGPs and VACNTs. The length and growth density of VACNTs were adjusted by the growth time and concentration of catalysts. Thermal conductivity and mechanical strength of CNT/EGB were controlled by the growth states of VACNTs and hot-pressing. CNT/EGB showed a maximum cross-plane thermal conductivity (k⊥) of 38 W/mK, which is more than twice as much as that of EGB (14 W/mK). A remarkable increase in k⊥ was attributed to the efficient heat flow of VACNTs bridging EGPs in the cross-plane direction and the thermal conductive SiC interface between VACNTs and EGPs. Additionally, the increased bending (76 MPa) and compressive strength (59 MPa) of CNT/EGB was due to the combination of strong pull-out effect of high-density nanotubes and the strong covalent interconnections between VACNTs and EGPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3acompression strength 3agraphene 3asilica 3asilicon carbide 3astrength (mechanics) 3athermal conductivity 3avapors1 aFeng, Yiyu1 aJi, Tengxiao1 aFeng, Wei0 tCarbon.g2016 Aug., v. 104 p.157-168dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2016.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013100168520150200299592002801801650001701829650001701846650001601863650001901879650002601898650001501924650001401939650001501953650001201968650002901980650004302009650001402052650001602066653002802082653001802110653002502128653001802153653002402171700001202195700001602207700002202223700001402245700001702259700001802276700001702294700001702311700001602328700001302344700001302357700001702370700001502387700001902402700005702421773011502478856008602593852000902679655001202688IND60736925720221122002603.0220110e20210905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073692572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1260612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Xiaoyan10aKeystone taxa-mediated bacteriome response shapes the resilience of the paddy ecosystem to fungicide triadimefon contamination  aThe increasing input of fungicides has emerged as a global concern for agroecosystem stability and sustainability. Agroecosystem resilience has been linked to microbiome response, however, is not well understood. Focusing on a widespread triazole-class fungicide triadimefon in the paddy ecosystem, we characterized that the soils and sediments were dominant triadimefon reservoirs with the peak level at 195 μg kg⁻¹ and 31.3 μg kg⁻¹, respectively, but essential for the resilience of paddy ecosystem to triadimefon. In paddy simulation models, the half-life of triadimefon in soil-sediment was 8.4–28.9 days, while it was prolonged to 86.6–115.5 days after elimination of resident microbial community. Phospholipid fatty acid profiling and high-throughput sequencing showed that the distinctive bacterial community responses contributed to variable degradation of triadimefon in paddy soils and sediments. Sphingomonas and Xanthomonas were identified as positive responders of the keystone taxa in the responsive bacteriome, whereas Enterobacter were negative responders that declined over time. Synthetic assemblages combined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction further validated that Sphingomonas and Xanthomonas were involved in sustaining soil-sediment resilience to triadimefon contamination. Collectively, our results revealed that the shaping of soil and sediment bacteriomes was responsible for the resilience of the paddy agroecosystem to fungicide contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacter 3aSphingomonas 3aXanthomonas 3aagroecosystems 3abacterial communities 3abacteriome 3ahalf life 3amicrobiome 3apaddies 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asediments 3atriadimefon 0aFungicide contamination 0aAgroecosystem 0aCommunity reassembly 0aKeystone taxa 0aBacteriome response1 aFu, Yan1 aNie, Yanxia1 aMatsumoto, Haruna1 aWang, Yue1 aHu, Tingting1 aPan, Qianqian1 aLv, Tianxing1 aFang, Hongda1 aXu, Haorong1 aWang, Yi1 aGe, Hang1 aZhu, Guonian1 aLiu, Yihua1 aWang, Qiangwei1 aWang, Mengcen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7169-67790 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Sept. 05, v. 417 p.126061-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1260613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245014300208300001600351520145100367592002801818650001601846650001101862650001701873650002701890650002001917650001601937650002301953650002701976650001602003650001002019650002302029650001102052650001502063650002202078650001802100650001202118650001802130650002202148650001502170650001202185650002902197653002302226653002202249653001902271653001402290700001402304700001902318700001802337700001802355700005802373773011402431856008602545852000902631655001202640IND60633850420221120045509.0190725e20190605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063385042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.03.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, Dandan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1544-824110aEnantioselectivity of toxicological responses induced by maternal exposure of cis-bifenthrin enantiomers in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae  ap. 655-665.  aThe maternal transfer and developmental toxicity of chiral contaminants with respect to enantioselectivity have rarely been investigated. Here, the residues and toxicological responses of cis-BF, a typical chiral pesticide, were studied in the progeny of adult zebrafish exposed to cis-BF (0, 20, 100, and 500 ng/L) for 60 days. Cis-BF enantiomers exhibited the equal maternal transfer potentials. GC/MSD analysis showed that parental 1S-cis-BF exposure could disrupt the components of fatty acids in offspring embryos. In transcriptional expression, the whole differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in GO categories, including the processes related to lipid biosynthesis/metabolism. The perturbations of fatty acids suggested that cis-BF has potential negative impacts on embryos’ development. Furthermore, enantioselective growth inhibition and developmental neurotoxicity in larvae were also observed. The mRNA expressions of neuronal development genes were significantly changed in 1S-exposed offspring, so were the levels of the neurotransmitters and larval locomotion. Our results show that the cis-BF induced the growth inhibition and neurotoxicity in zebrafish larvae, which may be mediated by the development interference in embryos related to the disrupted fatty acid composition. Furthermore, the toxicological response to 1S-cis-BF was greater than that to the 1R-enantiomer in the offspring of exposed adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aadults 3abiosynthesis 3adevelopmental toxicity 3aembryo (animal) 3aenantiomers 3aenantioselectivity 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acids 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3alarvae 3alocomotion 3amaternal exposure 3amessenger RNA 3aneurons 3aneurotoxicity 3aneurotransmitters 3apesticides 3aprogeny 3atranscription (genetics) 0aEnantioselectivity 0aMaternal transfer 0aCis-bifenthrin 0aZebrafish1 aQiao, Kun1 aSong, Zhuoying1 aShen, Shuyuan1 aWang, Mengcen1 aWang, Qiangwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5222-846X0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2019 June 05, v. 371 p.655-665dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.03.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02049naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245011400208300001600322520102400338592002801362650001801390650001501408650001201423650001701435650001701452700002001469700001901489700002101508773011201529856008501641852000901726655001201735IND60758460020221117214443.0220517e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075846002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.copbio.2021.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrant, Jason A1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3492-067910aBioengineering applications for hearing restoration: emerging biologically inspired and biointegrated designs  ap. 131-138.  aCochlear implantation has become the standard of care for hearing loss not amenable to amplification by bypassing the structures of the cochlea and stimulating the spiral ganglion neurons directly. Since the first single channel electrodes were implanted, significant advancements have been made: multi-channel arrays are now standard, they are softer to avoid damage to the cochlea and pre-curved to better position the electrode array adjacent to the nerve, and surgical and stimulation techniques have helped to conform to the anatomy and physiology of the cochlea. However, even with these advances the experience does not approach that of normal hearing. In order to make significant advances in performance, the next generation of implants will require novel interface technology. Advances in regenerative techniques, optogenetics, piezoelectric materials, and bioengineered living scaffolds hold the promise for the next generation of implantable hearing devices, and hope for the restoration of natural hearing.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3aelectrodes 3aganglia 3anerve tissue 3aoptogenetics1 aAdewole, Dayo O1 aVitale, Flavia1 aCullen, Daniel K0 tCurrent opinion in biotechnology.g2021 Dec., v. 72 p.131-138dElsevier LtdwJournal:11964x0958-16697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2021.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245009400164520146300258592002801721650001801749650001101767650001901778650001701797650001701814650002001831650002101851650001601872650001801888650001101906650001001917650001701927650002601944650002301970650002001993650002002013653001702033653001102050653002302061653001602084653001802100700001702118700002002135700001502155700001402170700005302184700002002237700002402257700005502281700001502336700005302351700001702404700001802421700005102439700001802490773011402508856008602622852000902708655001202717IND60736925820221121220955.0211106e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073692582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1260692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Guo,10aDetrimental effects of microplastic exposure on normal and asthmatic pulmonary physiology  aConcerns that airborne microplastics (MP) may be detrimental to human health are rising. However, research on the effects of MP on the respiratory system are limited. We tested the effect of MP exposure on both normal and asthmatic pulmonary physiology in mice. We show that MP exposure caused pulmonary inflammatory cell infiltration, bronchoalveolar macrophage aggregation, increased TNF-α level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and increased plasma IgG1 production in normal mice. MP exposure also affected asthma symptoms by increasing mucus production and inflammatory cell infiltration with notable macrophage aggregation. Further, we found co-labeling of macrophage markers with MP incorporating fluorescence, which indicates phagocytosis of the MP by macrophages. A comparative transcriptomic analysis showed that MP exposure altered clusters of genes related to immune response, cellular stress response, and programmed cell death. A bioinformatics analysis further uncovered the molecular mechanism whereby MP stimulated production of tumor necrosis factor and immunoglobulins to activate a group of transmembrane B-cell antigens, leading to the modulation of cellular stress and programmed cell death in the asthma model. In summary, we show that MP exposure had detrimental effects on the respiratory system in both healthy and asthmatic mice, which calls for urgent discourse and action to mitigate environmental microplastic pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aasthma 3abioinformatics 3afluorescence 3ahuman health 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amacrophages 3amicroplastics 3amodels 3amucus 3aphagocytosis 3aprogrammed cell death 3arespiratory system 3astress response 3atranscriptomics 0aMicroplastic 0aAsthma 0aRespiratory system 0aHealth risk 0aTranscriptome1 aLai, Keng Po1 aStoeger, Tobias1 aJi, Shuqin1 aLin, Ziyi1 aLin, Xiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2559-23431 aChan, Ting Fung1 aFang, James Kar-Hei1 aLo, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9613-02181 aGao, Liang1 aQiu, Chen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1668-87731 aChen, Shanze1 aChen, Guobing1 aLi, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4485-19371 aWang, Lingwei0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 416 p.126069-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1260693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03453naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011000163300001600273520149900289592002801788596005501816596006301871596006001934596006901994596006002063650002202123650002502145650002802170650001202198650002202210650002302232650001502255650001402270650002002284650001102304650001702315650001502332650001502347650002402362650001502386650000902401650000702410650001802417650002102435650001602456650001902472700002002491700001602511700001702527700001302544700001502557700001902572700001702591700002002608773010802628856008202736852000902818655001202827IND60520163020221122003830.0191003e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052016302DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-015-9712-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuo, Shuhao10aProcess Analysis of Alkaline Flocculation Harvesting for Chaetoceros muelleri and Scenedesmus quadricauda  ap. 682-690.  aAlkaline flocculation could be an attractive microalgae harvesting method, because it is low-cost, low energy consumption, and non-toxic to microalgal cells, and the high pH effectively sterilizes the microalgal biomass as well as the process water. In this paper, the mechanism of alkaline flocculation process and the difference between the two strains marine diatom Chaetoceros muelleri #862 and freshwater algae Scenedesmus quadricauda #507 were analyzed. The particle size of C. muelleri #862 cells increased linearly with the increasing pH value which increased dramatically by nearly fivefolds after alkaline flocculation. When pH was below 10.5, the absolute value of zeta potential on the surface of C. muelleri #862 increased rapidly, and also the conductivity of the solution declined quickly. The alkaline flocculation of C. muelleri #862 was mainly attributed to the production of Mg(OH)₂ rather than calcium phosphate or calcium hydroxide. For the strain S. quadricauda #507, the cells still existed integrally as normal cells after alkaline flocculation. Firstly, with the increasing of pH in the solution, the absolute value of zeta potential had not declined. When pH was around 10.8, the absolute value of zeta potential had declined abruptly and the solution conductivity was increasing all the time. The cell wall of S. quadricauda #507 with the high content of cellulose Iα and low crystallization degree was good for the next step of saccharification or oil extraction.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014M551519cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  aBK20140540cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province  aSGECS56-2014cState Grid Science and Technology Program  a21206177, 21506084cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aSGECS56-2014cState Grid Science and Technology Program 3aBacillariophyceae 3aChaetoceros muelleri 3aScenedesmus quadricauda 3abiomass 3acalcium hydroxide 3acalcium phosphates 3acell walls 3acellulose 3acrystallization 3aenergy 3aflocculation 3afreshwater 3aharvesting 3amagnesium hydroxide 3amicroalgae 3aoils 3apH 3aparticle size 3asaccharification 3asterilizing 3azeta potential1 aWang, Zhongming1 aZhu, Shunni1 aCui, Fengjie1 aZou, Bin1 aWang, Feng1 aYuan, Zhenhong1 aDong, Renjie1 aZhao, Pengxiang0 tBioEnergy research.g2016 June, v. 9, no. 2 p.682-690dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4138147x1939-12347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-015-9712-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245015200167300001600319520172100335592002802056650000902084650001202093650001002105650000902115650001102124650001202135650001602147650002502163651001502188700002102203773009202224856008202316990002302398852000902421655001202430IND60094511620221121005229.0141104e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009451162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dsr2.2013.03.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKotwicki, Stan10aDetecting temporal trends and environmentally-driven changes in the spatial distribution of bottom fishes and crabs on the eastern Bering Sea shelf  ap. 231-243.  aThis study uses a 30-year time series of standardized bottom trawl survey data (1982–2011) from the eastern Bering Sea shelf to model patterns of summer spatial distribution for various bottom fishes and crabs in response to changes in the areal extent of the cold pool, time lag between surveys, and fluctuations in population abundance. This investigation is the first to include data for the 2006–2010 cold period and to use between-year comparisons of local and shelf-wide spatial indices to test specific responses to three different isothermal boundaries within the cold pool. Distributional shifts in population varied considerably among species and directional vectors for some species were greater in magnitude to the east or west than to the north or south; however, in general, eastern Bering Sea shelf populations shifted southward in response to the increasing cold pool size, and after accounting for differences in temperature and population abundance, there was still a temporal northward shift in populations over the last three decades despite the recent cooling trend. Model results for local and shelf-wide indices showed that survey time lag and cold pool extent had a greater effect on spatial distribution than population abundance, suggesting that density-independent mechanisms play a major role in shaping distribution patterns on the eastern Bering Sea shelf. The area enclosed by the 1°C isotherm most commonly affects both local and shelf-wide spatial indices suggesting that 1°C is a more important boundary for describing temperature preferences of eastern Bering Sea bottom fishes and crabs than is the 2°C isotherm used for designating the physical boundary for the cold pool.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3acooling 3acrabs 3afish 3asummer 3asurveys 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3aBering Sea1 aLauth, Robert R.0 tDeep-Sea Research Part II.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 94 p.231-243dElsevier Ltdx0967-06457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2013.03.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03411naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245017400168300001500342520221200357592002802569650001002597650002202607650002202629650001302651650001302664650001402677650000902691650001302700650001502713650001602728651001902744653001202763653001602775653001902791700002002810773009002830856008402920852000903004655001203013IND60123071020221120170222.0150325e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012307102DNAL7 a10.2989/00306525.2013.8216832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManu, Shiiwua10aDiurnal patterns of mass gain in tropical granivores suggest avoidance of high midday temperatures during foraging, rather than the starvation–predation risk trade-off  ap. 95-100.  aDiurnal patterns of body mass gain in small temperate birds are of theoretical interest because they are largely a consequence of the starvation vs predation risk trade-off. In tropical birds, diurnal variation in body mass may also be influenced by other constraints such as water availability, digestive bottlenecks and the avoidance of periods of high temperature. We recorded body mass and amount of seed eaten with time of day and temperature in three small granivorous species, feeding on baited balances in a savanna habitat in tropical West Africa. Birds fed in the morning and afternoon but almost never visited balances to feed during the middle of the day. Body mass increased with time of day, but with a clear bimodal pattern so that mass was gained in the early morning and was then lost again by the time birds resumed feeding in the afternoon. Mass was then mostly regained at the end of the afternoon. There was a significant, but biologically small, increase in body mass with increasing temperature. When controlling for the effects of time of day, species, year and day, body mass on average increased to a peak at about 24 °C before declining slightly; daily temperature peaked at 27 °C during the midday period when the birds did not feed, and so mass was lost. Body mass gain between consecutive diurnal hours was greatest when the temperature was about 18 °C, during early morning feeding. Gain in body mass decreased as temperature increased by late morning, and stopped or even slightly decreased above 24 °C when birds stopped feeding. The amount of food eaten per visit to the balance was independent of time of day and temperature, confirming that the birds were regulating their mass adaptively, rather than simply reflecting availability of food. Body mass gain was not restricted to the early morning as expected with low predation risk and high starvation risk, nor was it restricted to just late in the day as expected with high predation risk and low starvation risk. Instead, high temperatures around midday may result in a period where foraging is avoided completely for energetic or water conservation reasons, driving the bimodal diurnal pattern of body mass gain.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3adiurnal variation 3afood availability 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3apredation 3arisk 3asavannas 3astarvation 3atemperature 3aWestern Africa 0adiurnal 0amass change 0atropical birds1 aCresswell, Will0 tOstrich.g2013 Aug. 1, v. 84, no. 2 p.95-100dTaylor & Francis Groupx1727-947X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/00306525.2013.8216833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03782naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245014800169300001600317500001500333520240100348592002802749650002602777650001202803650001102815650002702826650000902853650002002862650001202882650002202894650001802916650001402934650002402948651001502972651001102987653002602998700002603024700002103050700002803071700001903099773009203118856008203210990002303292852000903315655001203324IND60094511720221121005107.0141104e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009451172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dsr2.2013.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFriday, Nancy A.10aCetacean distribution and abundance in relation to oceanographic domains on the eastern Bering Sea shelf, June and July of 2002, 2008, and 2010  ap. 244-256.  a2019-12-06  aAs part of the Bering Sea Project, cetacean surveys were conducted to describe distribution and estimate abundance on the eastern Bering Sea shelf. Three marine mammal observers conducted visual surveys along transect lines sampled during the Alaska Fisheries Science Center walleye pollock assessment survey in June and July of 2008 and 2010. Distribution and abundance in 2008 and 2010 (cold years) are compared with results from a similar survey conducted in 2002 (a warm year), as the only three years that the entire survey area was sampled; patterns largely match those previously observed. Abundance estimates for comparable areas in 2002, 2008 and 2010 were as follows: humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae): 231 (CV=0.63), 436 (CV=0.45), and 675 (CV=0.80); fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus): 419 (CV=0.33), 1368 (CV=0.34), and 1061 (CV=0.38); minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata): 389 (CV=0.52), 517 (CV=0.69), and 2020 (CV=0.73); Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli): 35,303 (CV=0.53), 14,543 (CV=0.32), and 11,143 (CV=0.32); and harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena): 1971 (CV=0.46), 4056 (CV=0.40), and 833 (CV=0.66). It should be noted that these abundance estimates are not corrected for biases due to perception, availability, or responsive movement. Estimates for humpback, fin and minke whales increased from 2002 to 2010, while those for harbor and Dall's porpoise decreased; trends were significant for fin whales. It is likely that changes in estimated abundance are due at least in part to shifts in distribution and not just changes in overall population size. Annual abundance estimates were examined by oceanographic domain. Humpback whales were consistently concentrated in coastal waters north of Unimak Pass. Fin whales were broadly distributed in the outer domain and slope in 2008 and 2010, but sightings were sparse in 2002. Minke whales were distributed throughout the study area in 2002 and 2008, but in 2010 they were concentrated in the outer domain and slope. In 2002, Dall's porpoise were sighted on the western edge of the middle domain and in the outer domain and slope, but shifted west out of the middle domain in 2008 and 2010. In 2002 and 2008, harbor porpoise were consistently found in the middle domain with scattered sightings in the outer domain and slope. In 2010, there was a multi-species aggregation between Navarin and Pervenets canyons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBalaenoptera physalus 3asurveys 3awhales 3aMegaptera novaeangliae 3acold 3apopulation size 3acanyons 3aPhocoena phocoena 3acoastal water 3afisheries 3aGadus chalcogrammus 3aBering Sea 3aAlaska 0aTheragra chalcogramma1 aZerbini, Alexandre N.1 aWaite, Janice M.1 aMoore, S.

Space is not available to discuss the various ways in which these studies may be carried out. It is fairly apparent, however, that each variable should be investigated singly and in various combinations. Furthermore, all possible methods of approach should be employed. In addition to long-term field studies at permanent experiment stations, full advantage should be taken of the possibilities of fully controlled laboratory and field experiments. It is especially important that easily measured indices be invented for each of the principal variables, and nation-wide surveys made to evaluate these indices in all of the important agricultural problem areas of the country. These evaluations will form a rational basis for the design of erosion control measures. In the foregoing, it was not intended to infer that research into the fundamental nature of the erosion process constitutes a complete program of soil conservation research. Such a program would involve the study of: 1.The fundamentals of the process 2.Methods of erosion control 3.The reclamation of eroded soils It is clear that only the first phase of a complete program has been here treated. Nevertheless, to repeat the statement made in the introduction, this phase is of first importance, for the rational control of any physical phenomenon requires a clear understanding of the fundamental factors involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeroded soils 3aerodibility 3aerosion control 3afield experimentation 3anational surveys 3aphysical phenomena 3awater erosion0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1937, v. 1, no.

Potato starch and waxy potato starch were oxidised with sodium hypochlorite applied in doses corresponding to 10, 20, and 30gCl/kg starch, and then acetylated with acetic acid anhydride. The carboxyl, carbonyl, acetyl groups were determined in modified starches. Structural properties of starch granules were evaluated based on gelatinisation, crystallinity, specific surface, intrinsic viscosity, and microphotographs by SEM microscope. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were carried out to establish starch susceptibility to radical creation upon chemical modification and UV radiation. The amount of formed radicals was treated as a measure of the starch structure stability. The higher amount of amylose and the highest level of oxidation led to strong starch structure destruction and consequently facilitated radical generation. Study results showed also that amylose content as well as the degree of starch oxidation modified consecutive acetylation process. The different effectiveness of the acetylation processes influenced the morphology and structure of starch granules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic anhydride 3aacetylation 3aamylose 3acarbohydrate structure 3acrystal structure 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3afree radicals 3agelatinization 3amodified starch 3aoxidation 3apotato starch 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium hypochlorite 3astarch granules 3aultraviolet radiation 3aviscosity 0aOxidised starch 0aAcetylated starch 0aStarch structure 0aFree radicals1 aFortuna, Teresa1 aJuszczak, Lesław1 aGałkowska, Dorota1 aBączkowicz, Małgorzata1 aŁabanowska, Maria1 aKurdziel, Magdalena0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Jan., v. 106 p.57-67dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.07.1773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008400171300001800255520178300273592002802056650001202084650002102096650001502117650001502132650001002147650002802157650001202185650001002197650003102207650001402238650001402252650002202266650002602288650001202314650001202326651001102338653001602349653001402365653002202379653002502401653002902426700002002455773011102475856008502586852000902671655001202680IND60537096020221118045130.0160807e20160909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053709602DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2016.11936412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aResende, L.P.A.10aSharing the space: coexistence among terrestrial predators in Neotropical caves  ap. 2107-2128.  aThe subterranean environment has a set of unique characteristics, including low thermic variation, high relative humidity, areas with total absence of light and high dependence on nutrient input from the epigean environment. Such characteristics promote distinct ecological conditions that support the existence of unique communities. In this work, we studied seven caves in the Presidente Olegário municipality, Minas Gerais state, Southeast Brazil, to determine their richness of predatory species, to understand how they are spatially distributed in the cave and whether their distribution is influenced by competition and/or predation. We carried out five surveys of the caves, with each cave divided into sampling plots. We collected fauna within the plots using a manual search method. The collected animals were fixed in 70% ethanol for later identification. We performed a canonical correspondence analysis to verify the spatial distribution and substrate preference of each species, and selected five species for agonistic interaction testing in the laboratory. We found a great richness of predators in the caves, with 79 species distributed among 22 families of spiders, five families of pseudoscorpions, three families of chilopods, two families of opilionids and one family each of scorpions and heteroptera. Spiders were the most species diverse and abundant of all arthropods we found in the caves. We recorded evidence of competition among some pairs of species but, in general, the spatial distribution of the predatory community in the interior of the caves seems to be unrelated to interspecies competition. The laboratory pairings support our field observations that most species merely share space, rather than exhibiting aggressive or predatory behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneae 3aPseudoscorpiones 3aScorpiones 3aarthropods 3acaves 3acorrespondence analysis 3aethanol 3afauna 3alaboratory experimentation 3apredation 3apredators 3arelative humidity 3asubstrate specificity 3asurveys 3atropics 3aBrazil 0aCompetition 0apredation 0aniche segregation 0aspatial distribution 0asubterranean environment1 aBichuette, M.E.0 tJournal of natural history.g2016 Sept. 9, v. 50, no. 33-34 p.2107-2128dTaylor & Francisx1464-52627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222933.2016.11936413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011700161300001600278520134300294592002801637650001501665650001101680650001401691650001601705650001601721650001301737650002001750650001801770650001301788650001901801650001301820650001701833650001601850650000901866650002001875650001001895650000901905650002601914650000901940650001501949650001601964653002401980653001902004653001102023653001902034700002202053700002702075700002702102700002002129700002002149700002402169773011102193856008202304852000902386655001202395IND60541921720221121210800.0190401e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054192172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2014.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuh, Mina10aHigh concentrations of hexavalent chromium in drinking water alter iron homeostasis in F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice  ap. 381-388.  aHexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] induces hematological signs of microcytic anemia in rodents. Considering that Cr(VI) can oxidize ferrous (Fe2+) to ferric (Fe3+) iron, and that only the former is transported across the duodenum, we hypothesize that, at high concentrations, Cr(VI) oxidizes Fe2+ in the lumen of the small intestine and perturbs iron absorption. Herein we report that 90-day exposure to Cr(VI) in drinking water resulted in dose-dependent decreases in Fe levels in the duodenum, liver, serum, and bone marrow. Toxicogenomic analyses from the duodenum indicate responses consistent with Fe deficiency, including significant induction of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1, Slc11a2) and transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1, Tfr1). In addition, at ⩾20mg Cr(VI)/L in drinking water, Cr RBC:plasma ratios in rats were increased and exceeded unity, indicating saturation of reductive capacity and intracellular absorption of Cr(VI) into red blood cells (RBCs). These effects occurred in both species but were generally more severe in rats. These data suggest that high concentrations of Cr(VI) in drinking limit Fe absorption and alter iron homeostasis. Furthermore, some effects observed at high doses in recent Cr(VI) chronic and subchronic bioassays may be explained, at least in part, by iron deficiency and disruption of homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aanemia 3abioassays 3ablood serum 3abone marrow 3achromium 3adivalent metals 3adose response 3adrinking 3adrinking water 3aduodenum 3aerythrocytes 3ahomeostasis 3airon 3airon absorption 3aliver 3amice 3anutrient deficiencies 3arats 3atoxicology 3atransferrin 0aHexavalent chromium 0aIron depletion 0aAnemia 0aToxicogenomics1 aThompson, Chad M.1 aKirman, Christopher R.1 aCarakostas, Michael C.1 aHaws, Laurie C.1 aHarris, Mark A.1 aProctor, Deborah M.0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2014 Mar., v. 65 p.381-388dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2014.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245007400164300001800238500001900256500000900275520144900284592002801733650001401761650001301775650001301788650000901801650001401810650000901824650001901833650002301852651001301875700002501888700002001913773013501933856007802068852000902146655001202155IND60663517220221120174037.0191122e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066351722DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj14.06212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiben, Feyera M.10aDry Soil Planting of Maize for Variable Onset of Rainfall in Ethiopia  ap. 1618-1625.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aFarmers in water-limited environments of the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia (CRVE) practice dry soil planting of maize (Zea mays L.) on Vertisols in response to variable onset of rainfall and because of the difficulties of working on these soils when wet. However, little information is available for improving this practice. Therefore the effect of dry soil planting depth for two maize cultivars was evaluated on Vertisols at Welenchiti and Miesso in the CRVE. Dry soil planting depths were 4, 7, and 10 cm, and with broadcasted seed incorporated to varied depths (BC). There were three soil water deficit scenarios (W1, W2, W3 are soil water deficit regimes with 30, 15, and 0 mm water applied after dry soil planting, respectively, and then 30 mm added at 15, 20, and 25 d after planting). The highest plant survival (90% of planted seeds) at Miesso was with 7-cm planting depth with W3. The lowest survival (31%) was with BC and with W2 soil water deficit regime at Welenchiti. Compared with other dry soil planting depths on Vertisols, maize survival was greatest with planting at 7-cm depth across all soil water deficit scenarios. Maize was more tolerant of W3 compared with W1 and W2 soil water deficit scenarios. Success with dry soil planting of maize on Vertisols can be improved by planting at 7-cm depth compared with the farmers’ variable depth practice, and if timed to reduce the risk of W1 and W2 type conditions occurring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVertisols 3aZea mays 3aagronomy 3acorn 3acultivars 3arain 3arisk reduction 3asoil water deficit 3aEthiopia1 aWortmann, Charles S.1 aTesfaye, Kindie0 tAgronomy journal.g2015 July, v. 107, no. 4 p.1618-1625dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj14.06213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245009600176300001800272500001900290500002000309520140400329592002801733650001901761650001201780650001501792650001301807650001301820650001501833650001501848700002401863700002201887700001901909773012601928856008802054852000902142655001202151IND60708524920221117224426.0200826e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070852492DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0021-8790.2004.00889.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlden, Julian D.,10aContext‐dependent perceptual ranges and their relevance to animal movements in landscapes  ap. 1190-1194.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a1 An animal's perceptual range defines the spatial extent of the landscape for which information is available to make movement decisions. Ecologists studying and modelling animal dispersal have commonly assumed that individual movements arise from a predefined set of local decision rules operating within a static isotropic (i.e. circular) perceptual range. 2 We discuss how this assumption fails to recognize the potential for plasticity in perceptual ranges and present a conceptual model that illustrates how anisotropic perceptual ranges can arise from animal orientation to environmental stimuli. 3 Using model simulations we show how perceptual distance (i.e. greatest Euclidean distance at which habitat patches can be perceived), horizon (i.e. panoramic view or angular degrees of the landscape perceived) and breadth (i.e. areal extent of the landscape perceived), change as a function of increased strength of a hypothetical stimuli. 4 Our results show that anisotropic perceptual ranges can differ substantially from traditional, isotropic perceptual ranges in all three aspects depending on the strength of the stimuli and nature in which it interacts with other elements of the landscape. 5 We highlight the implications of these findings for modelling animal movements in ecological landscapes with the hope that context‐dependent perceptual ranges are considered in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal ecology 3aanimals 3aanisotropy 3ahabitats 3aisotropy 3alandscapes 3aplasticity1 aSCHOOLEY, ROBERT L.1 aMONROE, JEREMY B.1 aPOFF, N.

In plants and bacteria, enzymes for all steps in this pathway are known except the last: transamination of α-ketomethylthiobutyrate to give Met. In mammals, glutamine transaminase K (GTK) and ω-amidase (ω-Am) are thought to act in tandem to execute this step, with GTK forming α-ketoglutaramate, which ω-Am hydrolyzes. Comparative genomics indicated that GTK and ω-Am could function likewise in plants and bacteria because genes encoding GTK and ω-Am homologs (i) co-express with the Met salvage gene 5-methylthioribose kinase in Arabidopsis, and (ii) cluster on the chromosome with each other and with Met salvage genes in diverse bacteria. Consistent with this possibility, tomato, maize, and Bacillus subtilis GTK and ω-Am homologs had the predicted activities: GTK was specific for glutamine as amino donor and strongly preferred α-ketomethylthiobutyrate as amino acceptor, and ω-Am strongly preferred α-ketoglutaramate. Also consistent with this possibility, plant GTK and ω-Am were localized to the cytosol, where the Met salvage pathway resides, as well as to organelles. This multiple targeting was shown to result from use of alternative start codons. In B. subtilis, ablating GTK or ω-Am had a modest but significant inhibitory effect on growth on 5-methylthioribose as sole sulfur source. Collectively, these data indicate that while GTK, coupled with ω-Am, is positioned to support significant Met salvage flux in plants and bacteria, it can probably be replaced by other aminotransferases.  aPublisher supplied data 3atomatoes 3aS-adenosylmethionine 3asulfur 3aArabidopsis 3atransamination 3achromosomes 3aglutamine 3aomega-amidase 3aorganelles 3atransaminases 3acorn 3acytosol 3aplants (botany) 3aBacillus subtilis 3agenomics 3amammals 3astart codon 3abacteria 0aNicotiana tabacum cv.

Changing nutritional habits also has deep-rooted consequences on the environmental burden. The majority of similar previous studies have analyzed the change in greenhouse gas emissions against theoretical modifications in current food consumption. The analysis on the effect of diet on the water footprint is also gaining in importance, since water supply is a critical global issue. Based on current nutritional patterns of a Central European country—Hungary—as well as dietary recommendations and scientific literature, we generated six dietary scenarios and determined the consequences of these on green (originally from precipitation) and blue (sourced from surface or groundwater) water consumption and dietary quality. Compared to the baseline scenario (current local nutritional pattern) of both genders, based on the integrated aspect of water footprint and dietary quality, the most disadvantageous scenario was the ketogenic (ca. -2% in dietary quality, +18% in blue water footprint, and +16% in green water footprint) and the most advantageous was the sustainable scenario (ca. +9% in dietary quality, -42% in green water footprint, and -29% in blue water footprint). As a summary it can be stated, that (1) there is no clear linear relationship between the “healthiness” and water footprint of different diets, but (2) a more balanced diet, which integrates nutritional and environmental considerations could decrease the environmental burden in an efficient way.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet 3adietary recommendations 3aeating habits 3afood consumption 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agroundwater 3aliterature 3anutrients 3anutritional adequacy 3awater footprint 3awater supply1 aLakner, Zoltán 1 aOláh, Judit,1 aPopp, József,1 aKiss, Anna 0 tNutrients.g2020 Aug. 25, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120925783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012700171300001800298520132300316592002801639650001401667650001201681650001801693650001701711650001401728650001401742650002101756650001801777650001101795650001001806650001101816651001301827653003701840653001401877653001401891653002301905653002301928653002801951700001701979700002101996773011102017856008502128852000902213655001202222IND60537096120221118045231.0160807e20160909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053709612DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2016.11936422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRendoš, Michal10aTerrestrial isopods and myriapods in a forested scree slope: subterranean biodiversity, depth gradient and annual dynamics  ap. 2129-2142.  aDiversity, depth distribution and seasonal activity of isopods and myriapods were studied using subterranean traps buried in a forested limestone scree slope in the Čierna Hora Mts, Western Carpathians, Slovakia, throughout the depth gradient from 5 to 95 cm. A total of five isopod, 13 diplopod and 11 chilopod species were identified. Most edaphic species strongly preferred the uppermost organic soil layers. Among the species captured, some represented rare stenoecous Carpathian endemics, namely the isopod Trichoniscus carpaticus , and diplopods Julus curvicornis and Leptoiulus mariae . Others were subterranean forms, partly adapted to hypogean conditions: the isopod Mesoniscus graniger , and diplopods Mecogonopodium carpathicum and Trachysphaera costata . The annual activity in the vast majority of the species ceased completely in winter, and was gradually relaunched in spring. In evaluating the age structure of two predominant diplopods Polydesmus denticulatus and Mecogonopodium carpathicum , both widespread across the depth gradient, a vertical segregation of early post-embryonic stages was found. While P. denticulatus tended to undergo the early stages of development in the soil-filled topmost levels, the early juvenile stage of M. carpathicum was distributed deep in the scree slope profile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiplopoda 3aIsopoda 3aage structure 3abiodiversity 3ajuveniles 3alimestone 3aorganic horizons 3aorganic soils 3aspring 3atraps 3awinter 3aSlovakia 0aSuperficial subterranean habitat 0aOniscidea 0aMyriapoda 0adepth distribution 0acommunity dynamics 0athe Western Carpathians1 aMock, Andrej1 aMiklisová, Dana0 tJournal of natural history.g2016 Sept. 9, v. 50, no. 33-34 p.2129-2142dTaylor & Francisx1464-52627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222933.2016.11936423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03460naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008800166300001600254500001900270520180100289592002802090596006602118596007602184650001102260650002602271650001902297650001202316650001802328650001502346650003502361650002602396650001302422650001502435650002102450651001002471653001002481653001002491653001602501653002302517653001302540700001502553700005502568700005502623700005502678773013002733856008202863852000902945655001202954IND60728821820221122002713.0210224e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072882182DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-05-20-1128-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yuchao10aFungicidal Actions and Resistance Mechanisms of Prochloraz to Penicillium digitatum  ap. 408-415.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicide prochloraz has been widely used in China to control citrus green mold, which is caused by Penicillium digitatum. The 50% effective concentration (EC₅₀) values of prochloraz for 129 isolates of P. digitatum collected in 2017 from citrus groves of four provinces of China ranged from 0.0032 to 0.4582 mg/liter. Analysis of the distribution of natural logarithms of EC₅₀ values indicated that 111 isolates with EC₅₀ values lower than 0.05 mg/liter could be considered sensitive to prochloraz. Relative baseline sensitivity was established based on the 111 sensitive isolates, and the mean EC₅₀ value was 0.0090 ± 0.0054 mg/liter (SD). Prochloraz at 60, 100, and 140 mg/liter provided preventive efficacies of 67.8, 93.0, and 96.4%, respectively. Prochloraz at 0.005 and 0.01 mg/liter disrupted cell membrane integrity of conidia but reduced cell membrane permeability of mycelia. Prochloraz at 0.01 mg/liter reduced ergosterol content in mycelia by 41.8%. Two prochloraz-resistant isolates with EC₅₀ values of 3.97 and 5.68 mg/liter were attained by consecutive subculturing on prochloraz-amended PDA. Studies on the expression levels of three potential target genes, CYP51A, CYP51B, and CYP51C, demonstrated that whether in the absence or presence of prochloraz, only CYP51B in the resistant isolates was overexpressed at least 10-fold higher than that of the sensitive ones. Sequencing of the three genes showed that only CYP51B in the resistant isolates had a 199-bp insertion in the promoter region. In addition, only CYP51B displayed point mutations of G405S, G389C, and Y390S in the coding regions in the resistant isolates. These results were important for understanding the resistance mechanisms of P. digitatum to prochloraz.  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS-26cEarmarked fund for China Agriculture Research System  a2662020ZKPY018cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aCitrus 3aPenicillium digitatum 3acell membranes 3aconidia 3ademethylation 3aergosterol 3amedian effective concentration 3amembrane permeability 3amycelium 3aprochloraz 3apromoter regions 3aChina 0afungi 0afruit 0atree fruits 0adisease management 0achemical1 aZhang, Bao1 aLuo, Chaoxi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9385-98981 aFu, Yanping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4309-74311 aZhu, Fuxing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3759-79580 tPlant disease.g2021 Feb., v. 105, no. 2 p.408-415dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-05-20-1128-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02248naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245009700170500001900267500002000286520111100306592002801417650001401445650001001459650001301469650001101482650001801493650001101511650001201522650001701534650001301551700002301564700002401587700006201611773011401673856007801787852000901865655001201874IND60708525120221117224408.0200826e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070852512DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2020000112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuckingham, Steven D.10aTurning a Drug Target into a Drug Candidate: A New Paradigm for Neurological Drug Discovery?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe conventional paradigm for developing new treatments for disease mainly involves either the discovery of new drug targets, or finding new, improved drugs for old targets. However, an ion channel found only in invertebrates offers the potential of a completely new paradigm in which an established drug target can be re‐engineered to serve as a new candidate therapeutic agent. The L‐glutamate‐gated chloride channels (GluCls) of invertebrates are absent from vertebrate genomes, offering the opportunity to introduce this exogenous, inhibitory, L‐glutamate receptor into vertebrate neuronal circuits either as a tool with which to study neural networks, or a candidate therapy. Epileptic seizures can involve L‐glutamate‐induced hyper‐excitation and toxicity. Variant GluCls, with their inhibitory responses to L‐glutamate, when engineered into human neurons, might counter the excitotoxic effects of excess L‐glutamate. In reviewing recent studies on model organisms, it appears that this approach might offer a new paradigm for the development of candidate therapeutics for epilepsy.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorides 3adrugs 3aepilepsy 3agenome 3aglutamic acid 3ahumans 3aneurons 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity1 aMann, Harry‐Jack1 aHearnden, Olivia K.1 aSattelle, David B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0705-52420 tBioEssays.g2020 Sept., v. 42, no. 9 p.e2000011-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938457x0265-92477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2020000113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01834naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245016000180300001800340520059400358592002800952650001200980650001200992650001201004650001001016650001601026650003301042650001001075651001701085651001401102653001901116653001801135653002001153653001701173653001401190700002701204773011101231856008501342852000901427655001201436IND60537096320221118045216.0160807e20160909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053709632DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2016.11962972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIndicatti, Rafael Prezzi10aPseudonemesia tabiskey, a new species of Pseudonemesia Caporiacco 1955 and new ultramorphological data for the Microstigmatinae (Araneae: Microstigmatidae)  ap. 2153-2167.  aPseudonemesia tabiskey sp. nov. is described from an Andean Forest in Trujillo, Venezuela.

The molecular machinery responsible for protein trafficking is poorly understood in these apicomplexans. One of the most important proteins involved in clathrin-mediated protein trafficking is Epsin, which contains ENTH domain, a conserved domain crucial for membrane bending leading to vesicle formation. We undertook homology searching and phylogenetic analyses to produce a rigorously annotated set of Epsin homologs retrieved from diverse apicomplexan genomes. Genomic and phylogenetic comparisons revealed that apicomplexans contain unusual Epsin homologs that are distinct from those observed in mammals and yeast. Although there are four Epsin genes in mammalian system and five in the yeast genome, apicomplexan parasites consist only a single Epsin gene. The apicomplexan Epsin contains the conserved ENTH domain consisting of phosphoinositide (PtdIns)-binding sites which indicate about their functional significance in the formation of vesicles; however, the absence of ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) suggests a possible different mechanism for protein trafficking. The existence of dileucine motif in Plasmodium, Cryptosporidum parvum and Eimeria tenella Epsins might solve their functionality while lacking a lot of conserved motifs as this motif is known to interact with different adaptor protein complexes (AP1, AP2 and AP3). Other Epsin homologs are also shown to have different peptide motifs reported for possible interaction with α-ear appendage, γ-ear appendage and EH domain present in different adaptors. Bioinformatic and phylogenetic analyses suggest that the apicomplexan Epsins have unusual functionality from that of the mammalian Epsins. This detailed study may greatly facilitate future molecular cell biological investigation for the role of Epsins in these parasites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEimeria tenella 3aPlasmodium 3abioinformatics 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3amammals 3aparasites 3aphylogeny 3aprotein transport 3aproteins 3ayeasts1 aHossain, Mohammad Uzzal1 aOany, Arafat Rahman1 aAhmad, Shah Adil Ishtiyaq0 tParasitology research.g2016 June, v. 115, no. 6 p.2191-2202dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-016-4961-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02081naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011700156300002000273520092200293592002801215650001401243650001301257650002101270650001301291650002001304650001201324650001201336650001601348700001901364700001401383700001401397700001501411700001701426700001501443700001801458773012401476856007401600852000901674655001201683IND60642037920221118025653.0190506e20170704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064203792DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra06027k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Wenyu10aSuppression of degradation for lithium iron phosphate cylindrical batteries by nano silicon surface modification  ap. 33680-33687.  aNano-scale silicon particles were successfully decorated uniformly on a LiFePO₄@C electrode through utilization of spray technique. The electrochemical measured results indicate that the Si surface modification results in improved electrochemical performances for commercial 18 650 cylindrical batteries, especially at elevated temperature, which is attributed to the fact that Si introduction can enable the LiFePO₄ electrodes to suppress cylindrical battery degradation. Based on the analysis of structural characterization, it is revealed that the battery cathode with Si modification retains a better LiFePO₄ phase and exhibits less Li⁺ loss. In addition, the negative electrode of the battery contains a better graphite carbon structure and a thinner thickness of SEI film due to Si decoration. Furthermore, the related high-temperature aging and degradation mechanisms of the batteries were discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3airon phosphates 3alithium 3asilicon 3atemperature1 aWang, Zhisheng1 aChen, Lei1 aChen, Yue1 aZhang, Lin1 aLin, Yingbin1 aLi, Jiaxin1 aHuang, Zhigao0 tRSC advances.g2017 July 04, v. 7, no. 53 p.33680-33687dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra06027k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02155naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245006200170500001900232500002000251520104500271592002801316596004401344650000801388650002001396650003201416650000801448650001301456650001301469650002001482650001301502650001601515700006101531773011401592856007801706852000901784655001201793IND60708525220221117224333.0200826e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070852522DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2019002342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSundaram, Rajivgandhi10aStructural Basis of Nucleosome Recognition and Modulation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aChromatin structure and dynamics regulate key cellular processes such as DNA replication, transcription, repair, remodeling, and gene expression, wherein different protein factors interact with the nucleosomes.

The molecular details of the recognition of a nucleosome by different viral proteins, remodeling enzymes, histone post‐translational modifiers, and RNA polymerase II, have been explored in the recent past. The present review puts forth critical insights into the basic mechanisms of nucleosome recognition by the various protein factors and the role of distinct surface epitopes on a nucleosome. These determinants of the underlying specificity include features such as the acidic patch, arginine anchor, histone post‐translational modifications, core DNA, DNA lesions, and linker DNA.  aPublisher supplied data  cInstitute of Life Sciences, Bhubaneswar 3aDNA 3aDNA replication 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aRNA 3aarginine 3aepitopes 3agene expression 3ahistones 3anucleosomes1 aVasudevan, Dileep1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5568-628X0 tBioEssays.g2020 Sept., v. 42, no. 9 p.e1900234-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938457x0265-92477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2019002343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002200149245016800171300001600339520143400355592002801789650002001817650001601837650002501853650001801878650001701896650001101913650002001924650001201944650002801956650002301984650001102007650001902018651001102037773009902048856008502147852000902232655001202241IND4457677220221123044511.0141112e20110610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445767722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2011.03.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoussos, Peter A.10aPhytochemicals and antioxidant capacity of orange (Citrus sinensis (l.)

There were not any significant differences concerning either the carbohydrates’ or organic acids’ concentrations of the juice. Similar results were obtained concerning the total phenol, the total o-diphenol and the total flavonoid concentration of the juice, while neither hesperidin nor narirutin differentiated significantly. However, β-carotene concentration was detected in higher concentration in organically produced fruit (0.43mgL⁻¹). Juice extracted from both integrated and organically produced fruits exhibited similar antioxidant capacity values (based on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl and ferric reducing/antioxidant power assays), while correlation analysis revealed the significant contribution of phenolic compounds to antioxidant capacity (r=0.75–0.86). Most of the amino acids determined were quantified in similar concentration in the juice of both organic and integrated produced fruits (approximately 1600mgL⁻¹).

The results showed that nine sesquiterpenes were moderately active against Candida albicans and Hormodendrum compactum with MIC values ranging from 32 to 256μg/ml, while the diterpenes were more active; One of these exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity against C. albicans and Pyricularia oryzae with MIC values of 16μg/ml.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzadirachta indica 3aCandida albicans 3aMagnaporthe oryzae 3aX-ray diffraction 3aXylaria 3aantifungal properties 3aculture media 3aditerpenoids 3aendophytes 3afungi 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3asesquiterpenoids 3aspectral analysis 0aAzadirachta indica 0aXylaria sp. 0aSesquiterpene 0aDiterpene 0aGuaiane 0aIsopimarane 0aAntifungal activity1 aHe, Jian1 aLi, Xiao-Nian1 aHuang, Rong1 aSong, Fei1 aChen, You-Wei1 aMiao, Cui-Ping0 tPhytochemistry.g2014 Sept., v. 105 p.197-204dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014100162300001800303500001500321520129200336592002801628650001601656650002001672650001501692650002601707650001901733650001901752650002001771650001001791650004301801650002101844650001101865650001701876650000701893650003301900650001401933650001201947650001701959650002801976653001402004700001402018700002102032700001502053700001602068700001802084773009602102856008102198852000902279655001202288IND60555992820221121024930.0161030e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055599282DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-016-0495-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Jing10aElectrochemical Determination of Tert-Butyl Hydroquinone in Edible Oil Samples at Poly (Crystal Violet) Modified Glassy Carbon Electrode  ap. 3044-3052.  a2019-12-06  aThe synthetic phenolic antioxidant tert-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ) is frequently associated to adverse health effects. A polymerized film of crystal violet (CV) was prepared on the surface of a glass carbon electrode (GCE) by electropolymerization in alkaline solution, and then the modified electrode was successfully used to determine TBHQ. This electrode was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical impedance spectra. The voltammetric behavior of TBHQ over an extended pH range using cyclic voltammetry at poly (crystal violet) modified glassy carbon electrode (PCV/GCE) was also studied. The resulting electrode exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of TBHQ, and this was confirmed by the observed increased redox peak currents and shifted potentials. The electrochemical sensor can be applied to the quantification of TBHQ with a linear range covering 5 × 10⁻⁷–1 × 10⁻⁴ mol · L⁻¹ (with a correlation coefficient of 0.9969) and the limit detection was 3 × 10⁻⁸ mol · L⁻¹(S/N = 3). The recovery was between 97.1 and 102 % in edible oil samples. The electrochemical sensor method was also compared with a HPLC method, which proves its capability in commercial market surveillance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3amonitoring 3acooking fats and oils 3apolymerization 3agentian violet 3aadverse effects 3aglass 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aelectrochemistry 3acarbon 3ahydroquinone 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aoxidation 3amarkets 3aantioxidants 3aglassy carbon electrode 0aimpedance1 aWang, Wei1 aZheng, Shengbiao1 aZhang, Yan1 aWei, Jumeng1 aWang, Jianfei0 tFood analytical methods.g2016 Nov., v. 9, no. 11 p.3044-3052dSpringer USx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-016-0495-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01470naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245009800155300001800253520045600271592002800727650001100755650001300766650002100779650001300800700001800813700001300831700001600844700001700860700001800877700001300895773014100908856007401049852000901123655001201132IND60670956020221117165854.0191002e20140514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067095602DNAL7 a10.1039/c4tb00098f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yao10aNovel fibers fabricated directly from chitin solution and their application as wound dressing  ap. 3427-3432.  aFor the first time, pure chitin fibers with relatively high strength, lustrous surface and circular cross section were spun directly from chitin solution dissolved in an NaOH–urea aqueous system with freezing.

The aim of this research was to investigate the ability of fungi isolated from Tehran oil refinery area in removing crude oil and to evaluate their enzymatic activities. Plant root samples were collected from the polluted and control areas, and rhizospheral fungi were isolated and determined using the laboratory methods and taxonomic keys. Seven fungal species were isolated and then cultured in potato dextrose agar (PDA) media containing 0–15% (v/v) crude oil. Oil removal was determined after a one-month growth of fungal colonies and then compared with the control media. The results showed that the studied fungi were able to remove crude oil from the media. The highest removal efficiency was observed in Aspergillus sp. Total protein content and enzymatic activity (of peroxidase and catalase) increased with increasing crude oil pollution. The highest enzymatic activity was evaluated in Aspergillus sp. growing in media containing 15% petroleum and the lowest activity was found in non-polluted groups. Results showed that there is a direct correlation between oil-removing potency and enzymatic activity. Aspergillus sp. showed the highest enzyme activity and also the highest petroleum removal efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aagar 3acatalase 3aenzyme activity 3afungi 3agrowing media 3alaboratory techniques 3amicrobial colonization 3aoil spills 3aoils 3aperoxidase 3apetroleum 3aprotein content 3asoil pollution 3ataxonomic keys 0aPetroleum 0apollution 0arhizospheral fungi 0aoil removal 0aenzymatic activity1 aShirkhani, Zohreh0 tSoil & sediment contamination.g2016 July 3, v. 25, no. 5 p.536-551dTaylor & Francisx1549-78877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15320383.2016.11730123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03521naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002800153245011900181300001400300520177500314592002802089650002102117650001702138650001602155650001302171650001402184650001402198650002802212650001902240650001102259650001502270650001602285650002202301650002202323650001002345650001002355650000802365650001602373650001202389653001102401653002302412653003502435653001602470653001302486653001602499653002402515653000902539700005902548700003502607700004402642700003002686700002102716773009702737856008802834852000902922655001202931IND60540270820221117203051.0190318e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054027082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.04.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchimpl, Flávia Camila10aMolecular and biochemical characterization of caffeine synthase and purine alkaloid concentration in guarana fruit  ap. 25-36.  aGuarana seeds have the highest caffeine concentration among plants accumulating purine alkaloids, but in contrast with coffee and tea, practically nothing is known about caffeine metabolism in this Amazonian plant. In this study, the levels of purine alkaloids in tissues of five guarana cultivars were determined. Theobromine was the main alkaloid that accumulated in leaves, stems, inflorescences and pericarps of fruit, while caffeine accumulated in the seeds and reached levels from 3.3% to 5.8%. In all tissues analysed, the alkaloid concentration, whether theobromine or caffeine, was higher in young/immature tissues, then decreasing with plant development/maturation. Caffeine synthase activity was highest in seeds of immature fruit. A nucleotide sequence (PcCS) was assembled with sequences retrieved from the EST database REALGENE using sequences of caffeine synthase from coffee and tea, whose expression was also highest in seeds from immature fruit. The PcCS has 1083bp and the protein sequence has greater similarity and identity with the caffeine synthase from cocoa (BTS1) and tea (TCS1). A recombinant PcCS allowed functional characterization of the enzyme as a bifunctional CS, able to catalyse the methylation of 7-methylxanthine to theobromine (3,7-dimethylxanthine), and theobromine to caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine), respectively. Among several substrates tested, PcCS showed higher affinity for theobromine, differing from all other caffeine synthases described so far, which have higher affinity for paraxanthine. When compared to previous knowledge on the protein structure of coffee caffeine synthase, the unique substrate affinity of PcCS is probably explained by the amino acid residues found in the active site of the predicted protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaullinia cupana 3aactive sites 3aamino acids 3acaffeine 3acultivars 3adatabases 3aexpressed sequence tags 3ainflorescences 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3amethylation 3aplant development 3aprotein structure 3aseeds 3astems 3atea 3atheobromine 3atissues 0aAmazon 0aVenezuelan guarana 0aPaullinia cupana var. sorbilis 0aSapindaceae 0aCaffeine 0aTheobromine 0aRecombinant protein 0aSeed1 aKiyota, Eduardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6322-34611 aMayer, Juliana Lischka Sampaio1 aGonçalves, José Francisco de Carvalho1 aSilva, José Ferreira da,1 aMazzafera, Paulo0 tPhytochemistry.g2014 Sept., v. 105 p.25-36dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.04.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009400169300001400263520126800277592002801545650003101573650001701604650002401621650002001645650001001665650002201675650001201697650001401709650000901723650001101732650001501743650001801758650002101776650002601797650001301823650001501836650001501851653000701866653000701873653000701880653000801887653000801895653000901903653000701912653000701919653000801926653000901934653001401943653001101957653001201968653002301980653000802003653002402011700001602035700002102051700001702072700002602089700002102115700002102136700002402157773010902181856008202290852000902372655001202381IND60541922320221121234142.0190401e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054192232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2014.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiuliani, Cesidio14aThe flavonoid quercetin inhibits thyroid-restricted genes expression and thyroid function  ap. 23-29.  aQuercetin is the most abundant flavonoid present in a broad range of fruit and vegetables. Furthermore, quercetin is available as dietary supplements that are based on its antioxidant, antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory properties. However, concerns have been raised about the potential toxic effects of excessive intake of quercetin, and several studies have demonstrated that flavonoids, included quercetin, can interfere with thyroid function. In a previous report, we showed that quercetin inhibits thyroid-cell growth and iodide uptake. The latter effect was associated with down-regulation of sodium/iodide symporter gene expression. In the present study, we have evaluated the effects of quercetin on the expression of other thyroid-restricted genes, and we show that quercetin decreases the expression of the thyrotropin receptor, thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin genes. We further investigated the inhibitory effects of quercetin on thyroid function in vivo through evaluation of radioiodine uptake in the Sprague–Dawley rat, which was significantly decreased after 14days of quercetin treatment. These data confirm that quercetin can act as a thyroid disruptor, and they suggest that caution is needed in its supplemental and therapeutic use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3adietary supplements 3agene expression 3agenes 3aiodide peroxidase 3aiodides 3aquercetin 3arats 3asodium 3asymporters 3athyroglobulin 3athyroid function 3athyrotropin receptors 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3avegetables 0a5H 0a6H 0aip 0aMHC 0aNIS 0aPI3K 0aSD 0aTG 0aTPO 0aTSHR 0aQuercetin 0aFRTL-5 0aThyroid 0aRadioiodide uptake 0aRat 0aEndocrine disruptor1 aBucci, Ines1 aDi Santo, Serena1 aRossi, Cosmo1 aGrassadonia, Antonino1 aPiantelli, Mauro1 aMonaco, Fabrizio1 aNapolitano, Giorgio0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2014 Apr., v. 66 p.23-29dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2014.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245008700178300001400265520096800279592002801247650001201275650002601287650002501313650002501338650001701363650001101380650001901391650001301410650000901423650002401432650002601456650002201482653001201504653001301516653002601529653002701555653001301582653001101595653003401606653002501640653001801665700001701683773009601700856008801796852000901884655001201893IND60540270920221117203121.0190318e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054027092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.04.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSato-Masumoto, Naoko10aTwo types of alcohol dehydrogenase from Perilla can form citral and perillaldehyde  ap. 12-20.  aStudies on the biosynthesis of oil compounds in Perilla will help in understanding regulatory systems of secondary metabolites and in elucidating reaction mechanisms for natural product synthesis. In this study, two types of alcohol dehydrogenases, an aldo–keto reductase (AKR) and a geraniol dehydrogenase (GeDH), which are thought to participate in the biosynthesis of perilla essential oil components, such as citral and perillaldehyde, were isolated from three pure lines of perilla. These enzymes shared high amino acid sequence identity within the genus Perilla, and were expressed regardless of oil type. The overall reaction from geranyl diphosphate to citral was performed in vitro using geraniol synthase and GeDH to form a large proportion of citral and relatively little geraniol as reaction products. The biosynthetic pathway from geranyl diphosphate to citral, the main compound of citral-type perilla essential oil, was established in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPerilla 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aamino acid sequences 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acitral 3aessential oils 3ageraniol 3aoils 3areaction mechanisms 3asecondary metabolites 3asequence analysis 0aPerilla 0aLabiatae 0aAldo–keto reductase 0aGeraniol dehydrogenase 0aGeraniol 0aCitral 0aSequential enzymatic reaction 0aBiosynthetic pathway 0aEssential oil1 aIto, Michiho0 tPhytochemistry.g2014 Aug., v. 104 p.12-20dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.04.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010700165300001600272500001500288520172800303592002802031650003102059650003302090650001902123650001402142650002202156650001302178650001102191650002202202650001402224650002002238650001102258650001102269650000902280650001402289650002002303650001802323650002902341650001802370650001102388650001902399650001102418653001302429700001802442700002002460773009702480856004802577852000902625655001202634IND50072587720221120234235.0140201e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007258772DNAL7 a10.1007/s10498-013-9211-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoo, Young Ji10aGlobal Nitrogen Cycle: Pre-Anthropocene Mass and Isotope Fluxes and the Effects of Human Perturbations  ap. 477-500.  a2019-12-05  aWe present a nitrogen cycle model for pre-industrial times based on an extensive literature database. The model consists of 18 reservoirs in the domains of the atmosphere, land, and ocean. The biotic reservoirs on land and in the ocean (N-fixing plants, non-N-fixing plants, and marine biota) interact with atmospheric N₂ and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN, consisting of N₂, NO₃ ⁻, and NH₄ ⁺) in the ocean and soil waters. Marine DIN is taken up by marine biota and transformed from ocean particulate organic matter to dissolved organic nitrogen and the ocean sediment. The atmosphere, the largest nitrogen reservoir, supplies N₂ to the system by N fixation, deposition, and dissolution, and these input fluxes are balanced by denitrification and volatilization back to the atmosphere. The land and ocean domains are linked by river transport, which carries both dissolved and particulate nitrogen to the oceanic coastal zone. The isotope–mass balances of the N reservoirs are calculated from the isotopic composition of the reservoirs and the fractionation factors accompanying the fluxes between the reservoirs based on reported values from different natural conditions. The model sensitivity was tested for different biouptake rates and was run with various human perturbations, including fertilization, nitrous oxide emissions, population-related sewage disposal, land-use changes, and temperature-dependent rate kinetics. The new N mass–isotope cycle model provides the basis for assessment of the impact of artificial fertilization between 1700 and 2050. The perturbation experiments in this study suggest that land-use change is the key factor altering the N mass cycle since industrialization.  aPublisher supplied data 3adissolved organic nitrogen 3adissolved inorganic nitrogen 3avolatilization 3asediments 3anitrogen fixation 3aisotopes 3acoasts 3aindustrialization 3adatabases 3aland use change 3ahumans 3amodels 3asoil 3aemissions 3adenitrification 3anitrous oxide 3adissolved organic matter 3afractionation 3arivers 3anitrogen cycle 3asewage 0anitrogen1 aLi, Darcy Dan1 aLerman, Abraham0 tAquatic geochemistry.g2013 Nov., v. 19, no. 5-6 p.477-500dSpringer-Verlagx1380-61657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-013-9211-x  aDNAL 7aarticle05531naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245008900169300001200258500001900270520346800289592002803757596013903785650000803924650002403932650001003956650001703966650001203983650001803995650001404013650001604027650002204043650002104065650001404086650001504100650001804115650001004133650002204143650001604165650001704181650003304198650001304231650001304244650001404257650003004271650003004301650001904331650001504350650001604365650002204381650002204403650001704425651001104442653001704453653002304470700001804493700002004511700001704531700001904548700005604567773013004623856008304753852000904836655001204845IND60728822420221121190846.0210224e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072882242DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-06-20-1171-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStevanović, M.10aFirst Report of Powdery Mildew of Blackberry Caused by Podosphaera aphanis in Serbia  ap. 503.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBlackberries (Rubus L. subgenus Rubus Watson) are popular wild fruits with a high content of antioxidants and thus beneficial effect on human health (Reyes-Carmona et al. 2005). In July 2019 and May 2020, plants with typical powdery mildew symptoms were collected in the blackberry cultivar ‘Triple Crown’ orchard (2 ha) in the vicinity of Pakovraće (Moravica District, Serbia). The symptoms observed in 2019 included mild chlorotic spots on both old and young leaves accompanied by white powdery mildew colonies on the surface of the leaves, visible on both primocanes and floricanes. In 2020, even more intensive symptoms occurred on fruit-bearing shoots, which were covered with dense white fungal growth. Heavily infected leaves turned necrotic along the edges, followed by defoliation. Disease incidence was calculated by randomly counting and rating 100 plants in four replications and estimated to be over 90%, and disease severity was estimated to be over 40%. Morphological characteristics were assessed using bright-field and phase-contrast microscopy (Jankovics et al. 2011) and revealed the presence of unbranched, erect conidiophores (n = 50, 75 to 200 μm) with a cylindrical foot cell and up to five short cells. Conidia were unicellular, hyaline, and ellipsoid-barrel-shaped (n = 50, 22.5 to 35.5 × 12.5 to 15 μm) containing fibrosin bodies (in 3% KOH). All observed characteristics resembled Podosphaera spp. (Braun and Takamatsu 2000). The presence of chasmothecia was not recorded. Further molecular identification was conducted using internal transcribed spacer sequence analysis of two isolates, 420G-19 and 30G-20, sampled in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Total DNA was extracted directly from epiphytic mycelium on the leaves using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing were performed with primers ITS1F and ITS4 (Takamatsu et al. 2010). The nucleotide sequence of the representative isolates 420G-19 (530 bp) and 30G-20 (530 bp) (accession nos. MN914995 and MT514661) shared 100% identity, and both shared 99.49 to 99.81% nt identity with 32 Podosphaera aphanis strawberry and raspberry isolates in GenBank (the highest 99.81% with GU942455, Harvey and Xu 2010), confirming that powdery mildew of blackberry in Serbia is caused by P. aphanis. To fulfill Koch’s postulates, 10 rooted, healthy blackberry plants (cv. Triple Crown) were dusted with conidia of isolate 30G-20 and incubated at 23°C under high relative humidity in the glasshouse. Healthy blackberry plants incubated in the same conditions served as a negative control. Minute white fungal colonies sharing the same microscopic features with the original isolate were visible 7 to 8 days postinoculation on all inoculated plants. No fungal growth was observed in the negative control. Serbia is the fourth largest blackberry producer in the world (Strik et al. 2007), and the occurrence of P. aphanis causing powdery mildew as a new pathogen is of utmost importance. P. aphanis is described as a strawberry and raspberry powdery mildew pathogen with a population expressing substantial genetic diversity (Harvey and Xu 2010). The molecular data on blackberry-originating isolates of P. aphanis are missing. Our study showed that P. aphanis could be destructive for blackberry in Serbia, thus representing a threat for the production of these valuable crops.  aPublisher supplied data  a451-03-68/2020-14/200116a451-03-68/2020-14/200010cMinistry of Education, Science and Technical Development of the Republic of Serbia 3aDNA 3aPodosphaera aphanis 3aRubus 3ablackberries 3aconidia 3aconidiophores 3acultivars 3adefoliation 3adisease incidence 3adisease severity 3aepiphytes 3afloricanes 3afungal growth 3afungi 3agenetic variation 3agreenhouses 3ahuman health 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amycelium 3aorchards 3apathogens 3aphase-contrast microscopy 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apowdery mildew 3aprimocanes 3araspberries 3arelative humidity 3asequence analysis 3astrawberries 3aSerbia 0asmall fruits 0apathogen detection1 aVojvodić, M.1 aKovačević, S.1 aAleksić, G.1 aŽivković, S.1 aBulajić, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7680-96640 tPlant disease.g2021 Feb., v. 105, no. 2 p.503-503dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-06-20-1171-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04461naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006800153245009100221520252300312592002802835650003002863650002302893650002002916650001302936650001602949650001802965650002002983650002903003650002303032650001503055650002303070650002103093650001503114650002003129650002203149650002003171650001803191650001703209650002903226650001903255650001503274650002303289650001203312650001303324650002503337650002703362653002503389653001303414653001403427653001903441653001903460653002903479700001603508700002203524700003203546700003003578773011803608856008803726852000903814655001203823IND60683495820221119183321.0200330e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068349582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1370192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarín-Benito, Jesús M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8801-738910aModelling herbicides mobility in amended soils: Calibration and test of PRZM and MACRO  aAddition of organic residues to soil is a current farming practice but it is not considered in the modelling studies for pesticide risk assessment at regulatory level despite its potential impact on the pesticide dynamics in soil. Thus, the objective of this work was to examine and to compare the ability of PRZM and MACRO pesticide fate models to simulate soil water content, and bromide (Br⁻, tracer), chlorotoluron and flufenacet concentrations in the soil profiles (0–100 cm) of one agricultural soil, unamended (control soil, S), amended with spent mushroom substrate (S + SMS) or amended with green compost (S + GC). Based on a two-year field-scale dataset, the models were first calibrated against measurements of water and solutes contents in the soil profiles (first year) and then tested without any further model calibration by comparison with the field observations of the second year. In general, the performance of MACRO to simulate the whole dataset in the three soil treatments was higher than that of PRZM. MACRO simulated satisfactorily the water dynamics along the soil profiles whereas it was poorly described by the capacity model PRZM. Both models predicted very well the Br⁻ mobility in control and amended soils after dispersion parameters were fitted to observations. No calibration was necessary to reproduce correctly herbicides vertical distribution in the control soil profile. In the amended soils, MACRO simulations were highly correlated to the observed vertical distribution of flufenacet and chlorotoluron, but calibration of the Kd of chlorotoluron was needed. On the contrary, modelling with PRZM required calibration of Kd and DT₅₀ of both herbicides to obtain an acceptable agreement between observations and predictions in the amended soils. Kd and DT₅₀ calibration was based on the initial dissolved organic carbon contents (DOC) of amended soils. It allowed to take into account the processes that decrease the herbicides sorption on the soil and enhance their bioavailability, but that are not described in PRZM and MACRO (such as the formation of herbicide-DOC mobile complexes). This work showed that models such as PRZM and MACRO are able to simulate the fate of pesticides in amended soils. However, before using these models as predictive tools in large amended soil conditions, and especially in the regulatory context, further modelling studies should focus on other pedoclimatic-pesticides-organic residues combinations, and on longer periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPesticide Root Zone Model 3aagricultural soils 3abioavailability 3abromides 3acalibration 3achlorotoluron 3adata collection 3adissolved organic carbon 3aenvironmental fate 3aflufenacet 3aherbicide residues 3amodel validation 3aprediction 3arisk assessment 3asimulation models 3asoil amendments 3asoil profiles 3asoil quality 3asoil transport processes 3asoil treatment 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asolutes 3asorption 3aspatial distribution 3aspent mushroom compost 0aPesticide fate model 0aMobility 0aHerbicide 0aBromide tracer 0aSoil amendment 0aDissolved organic carbon1 aMamy, Laure1 aCarpio, María J.1 aSánchez-Martín, María J.1 aRodríguez-Cruz, M.

The fermentation was performed with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (BB 12) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus LGG ATCC 53013. Fermentation culture activities produced substantial amounts of SCFAs, which were detected and quantitated using a HPLC-UV technique. Using HPLC-UV, we were able to detect low concentrations of lactate and SCFAs from fermented samples; lactate, acetate, propionate and butyrate were detected at 10.10, 12.06, 14.80 and 18.06 μg/mL, respectively. The retention time of all SCFAs and lactic acid were similar to the standard quality control (±0.05), and average recovery ranged between 89.73 and 91.03 %. The experimental conditions and sample preparation were applied to preparative HPLC to isolate and purify SCFAs with concentration range between 0.09 and 2.86 mg/mL. The purity of extracted SCFAs was confirmed using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization/mass spectrometry by determining the molecular masses of target purified compounds. The scaled up validated analytical HPLC-UV method will further enhance and improve the use of this approach to produce purified large-scale SCFAs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aacetates 3aatmospheric pressure 3abutyrates 3afermentation 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainulin 3aionization 3alactic acid 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3apropionic acid 3aquality control 3areconstituted milk 3ashort chain fatty acids 3askim milk1 aVasiljevic, T.1 aRavikumar, M.1 aApostolopoulos, V.1 aDonkor, O.0 tFood analytical methods.g2016 Nov., v. 9, no. 11 p.3069-3079dSpringer USx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-016-0471-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245009500178300001600273520114900289592002801438650001701466650002501483650001201508650001601520650001301536650003101549650001701580650002301597650000901620650001801629650001101647650002201658650002101680650001001701650001001711650001101721650000901732653002601741653003201767653002001799653002101819653002301840700001901863700002201882773010701904856008502011852000902096655001202105IND60537096920221118045100.0160807e20160703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053709692DNAL7 a10.1080/15320383.2016.11746682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanda, Swati Sucharita10aEffects of Chromium Ore Tailings on Growth and Physiological Activities of Mesua ferrea L.  ap. 563-572.  aA greenhouse pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of using a native ornamental plant, Mesua ferrea L. as phytostabilizer for chromium ore tailings (COT) and to assess the metal accumulation capacity. Different ratios of soil and COT were taken in pots and sowed with seeds of M. ferrea . Plants were harvested at various intervals and separated into roots and shoots for analysis of metal concentrations and physiological characteristics of the plants. The study revealed that the plant has great tolerance and stronger ability to accumulate Cr. The results suggested an increase in growth, chlorophyll content, antioxidant activities, as well as metal accumulation capacity of M. ferrea with increasing proportion of COT in the soil. This indicates the plant's efficiency to overcome any stress generated due to excess of chromium as well as other heavy metals. The order of accumulation of heavy metals was observed to be Fe>Cr>Ni>Cd>Co. The accumulation of Cr was higher in root compared to that in shoot. M. ferrea has found to be potential as a native species candidate for phytostabilization of chromium mine tailings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMesua ferrea 3aantioxidant activity 3acadmium 3achlorophyll 3achromium 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aheavy metals 3aindigenous species 3airon 3amine tailings 3anickel 3aornamental plants 3aphytoremediation 3aroots 3aseeds 3ashoots 3asoil 0aChromium ore tailings 0aenvironmental contamination 0aMesua ferrea L. 0aphytoremediation 0aphytostabilization1 aBasu, Aradhana1 aDhal, Nabin Kumar0 tSoil & sediment contamination.g2016 July 3, v. 25, no. 5 p.563-572dTaylor & Francisx1549-78877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15320383.2016.11746683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002500166245014600191300001600337520146300353592002801816650002801844650001001872650001001882650001901892650001701911650002601928650001201954650001201966650003001978650001302008650001302021650001102034650004302045650004402088650004002132650002002172650002502192650002602217650003202243650008302275700002302358700002202381700002602403700002902429773012002458856004802578852000902626655001202635IND50063976120221123043821.0130325e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006397612DNAL7 a232331212pmid7 a10.1007/s11274-012-1228-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrompamorn, Piyanuch10aRapid identification and differentiation of Vibrio parahaemolyticus from Vibrio spp. in seafood samples using developed monoclonal antibodies  ap. 721-731.  aMonoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to Vibrio parahaemolyticus were successfully generated. According to the specificity of V. parahaemolyticus, MAbs can be classified into 5 groups. The MAbs VP-2D and VP-11H were specific to the O2 and O4 groups of V. parahaemolyticus, respectively. The MAb VP-11B reacted with 11 out of 30 isolates of V. parahaemolyticus used in this study. The MAb VP-516 bound to 27 out of 30 isolates of V. parahaemolyticus and cross reacted with all 10 isolates of V. alginolyticus. The MAb VP-618 demonstrated positive reactivity to 29 out of 30 isolates of V. parahaemolyticus and demonstrated slight cross reactivity to 3 out of 30 isolates of V. harveyi. The sensitivity of the MAbs ranged from 10⁸ to 10⁷ c.f.u. ml⁻¹ for V. parahaemolyticus obtained from pure cultures and depended on the group of MAbs. However, the detection capability could be improved to be equivalent to that of the PCR technique following pre-incubation of the samples in alkaline peptone water (APW). Using these MAbs along with MAbs specific to V. alginolyticus (VA-165), V. cholerae (VC-63), V. harveyi (VH-9B and VH-20C) and Vibrio spp. (VC-201) from previous studies, V. parahaemolyticus could be identified and differentiated from Vibrio spp. in various seafood samples including shrimp, green mussels, blood clams and oysters by a simple dot blot immunoassay without the requirement for bacterial isolation or biochemical characterization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3ablood 3aclams 3across reaction 3aimmunoassays 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amussels 3aoysters 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asampling 3aseafoods 3ashrimp 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxdiagnostic use. 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalxdiagnostic use. 2aBacteriological Techniquesxmethods 2aCross Reactions 2aImmunoassayxmethods 2aSeafoodxmicrobiology 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aVibrio parahaemolyticusxclassificationximmunologyxisolation & purification.1 aLongyant, Siwaporn1 aPengsuk, Chalinan1 aSithigorngul, Paisarn1 aChaivisuthangkura, Parin0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2013 Apr., v. 29, no. 4 p.721-731dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-012-1228-6  aDNAL 7aarticle03520naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009800169300001600267520223600283592002802519650001502547650001802562650001902580650001802599650001602617650001802633650001602651650001502667650001702682650001102699650001302710650001602723650001402739651000902753700002602762700002302788700002702811700002202838700002702860773009702887856008102984852000903065655001203074IND50072587920221120234311.0150212e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007258792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10498-013-9214-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrupp, Patrick S.10aComparison of CO2 Dynamics and Air–Sea Gas Exchange in Differing Tropical Reef Environments  ap. 371-397.  aAn array of MAPCO₂buoys, CRIMP-2, Ala Wai, and Kilo Nalu, deployed in the coastal waters of Hawaii, have produced multi-year high temporal resolution CO₂records in three different coral reef environments off the island of Oahu, Hawaii. This study, which includes data from June 2008 to December 2011, is part of an integrated effort to understand the factors that influence the dynamics of CO₂–carbonic acid system parameters in waters surrounding Pacific high-island coral reef ecosystems and subject to differing natural and anthropogenic stresses. The MAPCO₂buoys are located on the Kaneohe Bay backreef, and fringing reef sites on the south shore of Oahu, Hawaii. The buoys measure CO₂and O₂in seawater and in the atmosphere at 3-h intervals, as well as other physical and biogeochemical parameters (conductivity, temperature, depth, chlorophyll-a, and turbidity). The buoy records, combined with data from synoptic spatial sampling, have allowed us to examine the interplay between biological cycles of productivity/respiration and calcification/dissolution and biogeochemical and physical forcings on hourly to inter-annual time scales. Air–sea CO₂gas exchange was also calculated to determine whether the locations were sources or sinks of CO₂over seasonal, annual, and interannual time periods. Net annualized fluxes for CRIMP-2, Ala Wai, and Kilo Nalu over the entire study period were 1.15, 0.045, and −0.0056 mol C m⁻² year⁻¹, respectively, where positive values indicate a source or a CO₂flux from the water to the atmosphere, and negative values indicate a sink or flux of CO₂from the atmosphere into the water. These values are of similar magnitude to previous estimates in Kaneohe Bay as well as those reported from other tropical reef environments. Total alkalinity (AT) was measured in conjunction with pCO₂, and the carbonic acid system was calculated to compare with other reef systems and open ocean values around Hawaii. These findings emphasize the need for high-resolution data of multiple parameters when attempting to characterize the carbonic acid system in locations of highly variable physical, chemical, and biological parameters (e.g., coastal systems and reefs).  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinity 3acalcification 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonic acid 3achlorophyll 3acoastal water 3acoral reefs 3aecosystems 3agas exchange 3aoxygen 3aseawater 3atemperature 3aturbidity 3aOahu1 aDe Carlo, Eric Heinen1 aMackenzie, Fred T.1 aSabine, Christopher L.1 aFeely, Richard A.1 aShamberger, Kathryn E.0 tAquatic geochemistry.g2013 Nov., v. 19, no. 5-6 p.371-397dSpringer-Verlagx1380-61657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-013-9214-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245010000161500001900261500002000280520100700300592002801307596003701335650001601372650001601388650001601404650001501420650001501435650003101450650000901481650001201490650001401502700002501516700005901541700002601600773011401626856007801740852000901818655001201827IND60708525820221117224336.0200826e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070852582DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2019001162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoepp, Marie10aCell Cycle Synchronization of the Murine EO771 Cell Line Using Double Thymidine Block Treatment  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study shows that double thymidine block treatment efficiently arrests the EO771 cells in the S‐phase without altering cell growth or survival. A long‐term analysis of cell behavior, using 5(6)‐carboxyfluorescein diacetate N‐succinimidyl ester (CFSE) staining, show synchronization to be stable and consistent over time. The EO771 cell line is a medullary breast‐adenocarcinoma cell line isolated from a spontaneous murine mammary tumor, and can be used to generate murine tumor implantation models. Different biological (serum or amino acid deprivation), physical (elutriation, mitotic shake‐off), or chemical (colchicine, nocodazole, thymidine) treatments are widely used for cell synchronization. Of the different methods tested, the double thymidine block is the most efficient for synchronization of murine EO771 cells if a large quantity of highly synchronized cells is recommended to study functional and biochemical events occurring in specific points of cell cycle progression.  aPublisher supplied data  cLigue nationale contre le cancer 3aamino acids 3ablood serum 3acell growth 3acell lines 3acolchicine 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3amice 3amitosis 3athymidine1 aLe Guennec, Delphine1 aRossary, Adrien1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8311-24191 aVasson, Marie‐Paule0 tBioEssays.g2020 Sept., v. 42, no. 9 p.e1900116-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938457x0265-92477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2019001163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03182naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245009200166520160400258592002801862650001201890650001101902650002301913650002001936650003101956650002201987650001702009650000902026650002102035650001902056650000702075650000902082650000902091650001602100650001002116650001602126650000902142653002402151653000702175653001202182653002602194653002302220700002002243700001902263700001602282700001302298700005802311700005602369773011802425856008802543852000902631655001202640IND60683496020221119183133.0200330e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068349602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1370212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Ping10aTime-dependent evolution of Zn(II) fractions in soils remediated by wheat straw biochar  aBiochar is a cost-effective and multifunctional carbon material, which can be used to immobilize heavy metal (HM) in soil. To date, the immobilization of different HM by various biochars are well-studied, however, little is known about the release condition of the immobilized HM. As the released HM may bring a threat to the soil environment, it is critical to understand the release pattern of biochar-sorbed HM in soil. Herein, six wheat straw-derived biochars (WBs) pyrolyzed under different temperature and duration time were loaded with zinc(Zn (II)), and the evolution of Zn(II) fractions in soils remediated by WBs over time was investigated by Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) three-step sequential extraction method. The main Zn(II) species sorbed on WBs were the Zn(II) sorbed on the acidic functional groups of WB and that sorbed on WB surface via electrostatic interaction. Generally, Zn(II) sorbed on high-temperature WB was more mobile than that sorbed on low-temperature WB. In the red soil, the soluble and exchangeable Zn(II) (i.e., Zn(II) in Fraction 1) in WB was inclined to transform to organic matter associated-Zn(II) (i.e., Zn(II) in Fraction 3) and residual Zn(II) (i.e., Zn(II) in Fraction 4). In the yellow-brown soil, the soluble and exchangeable Zn(II) in WB was prone to convert into amorphous Fe/Mn oxide associated-Zn(II) (i.e., Zn(II) in Fraction 2) and residual Zn(II). These results imply that Zn(II) sorbed by WB has the risk to be released into the soil environment, and WB produced at low temperature are more suitable to remediate soils with low/neutral pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3acarbon 3acost effectiveness 3aedaphic factors 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aexchangeable zinc 3aheavy metals 3airon 3amanganese oxides 3aorganic matter 3apH 3arisk 3asoil 3atemperature 3awheat 3awheat straw 3azinc 0aWheat straw biochar 0aZn 0aRelease 0aPyrolysis temperature 0aEnvironmental risk1 aQian, Ting-Ting1 aFan, Ting-Ting1 aZhang, Ying1 aLiu, Cun1 aZhou, Dong-Mei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0363-99451 aWang, Yurun,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0921-01220 tScience of the total environment.g2020 May 15, v. 717 p.137021-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1370213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012100168300001600289500001900305520120500324592002801529650002501557650002901582650002301611650002501634650001601659650001501675650001801690650002201708650001301730650002001743650001401763650005001777650003101827650002201858650001301880650001201893651001201905700002101917700002101938700002401959700001901983700002002002700001602022700001902038700002402057700002102081700005602102773011302158856008202271852000902353655001202362IND60726172820221119142044.0210202e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072617282DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-020-04878-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDinh, Phat Xuan10aPorcine circovirus genotypes and their copathogens in pigs with respiratory disease in southern provinces of Vietnam  ap. 403-411.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study was conducted to investigate the genetic diversity of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and its coinfecting pathogens in pigs with respiratory disease in Vietnam. Samples from 127 clinical cases were obtained from different southern provinces of Vietnam from January 2018 to January 2020 for PCR and sequence analysis. The infection rate of PCV2 was 78.8%, and the major pathogens found in coinfections with PCV2 were porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, and Haemophilus parasuis. Forty-three PCV2-positive clinical samples were selected for amplification and sequencing of the ORF2 region. Phylogenetic analysis of PCV2 ORF2 showed that five of the sequences belonged to PCV2b (11.6%) and 38 belonged to PCV2d (88.4%), indicating that PCV2d strains were predominant in southern provinces of Vietnam. Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences of the PCV2 capsid protein revealed polymorphic sites in the antibody recognition regions. This study demonstrates the prevalence of the PCV2d genotype in southern Vietnam and presents a comprehensive overview of the coinfecting pathogens associated with PCV2 in young pigs with respiratory disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemophilus parasuis 3aMycoplasma hyopneumoniae 3aPorcine circovirus 3aPorcine circovirus-2 3aamino acids 3aantibodies 3acoat proteins 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3amixed infection 3aphylogeny 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asequence analysis 3avirology 3aviruses 3aVietnam1 aNguyen, Minh Nam1 aNguyen, Hien The1 aTrần, Vũ Hoàng,1 aTran, Quy Dinh1 aDang, Kim Hoang1 aVo, Dai Tan1 aLe, Hien Thanh1 aNguyen, Nam Thi Thu1 aNguyen, Toan Tat1 aDo, Duy Tien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-26230 tArchives of virology.g2021 Feb., v. 166, no. 2 p.403-411dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6093x0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-020-04878-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245009400164300001800258500001900276500000900295520157900304592002801883650002001911650001101931650001801942650002201960650001301982650002501995650001102020650001602031650002602047650001502073650000902088650001402097650001702111650002402128650001502152650001802167650001702185650002502202650001102227650001702238700002102255700001902276773013602295856007802431852000902509655001202518IND60663518120221121010534.0191122e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066351812DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj14.05112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachado, Stephen10aNo-Tillage Cropping Systems Can Replace Traditional Summer Fallow in North-Central Oregon  ap. 1863-1877.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aWinter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)–summer fallow (WW–SF) using conventional tillage (CT), the predominant cropping system in eastern Oregon, has increased soil erosion and depleted soil organic carbon (SOC). This research evaluates no-tillage (NT) systems designed to reduce these negative impacts on soil. In this long-term experiment (2004–2010), WW–SF using CT was compared with annual winter wheat (WW–WW), annual spring wheat (SW–SW), annual spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (SB–SB), winter wheat–chemical fallow (WW–CF), winter wheat–winter pea (Pisum sativum L.) (WW–WP), and winter wheat–spring barley–chemical fallow rotation (WW–SB–CF), using NT. Measurements included, phenology, plant population, grain yield and yield components, residues, SOC, soil moisture, and precipitation. Water-use efficiency (WUE) was derived from precipitation and yield data. Under annual cropping, WW–WP and SB–SB produced higher yields than WW–WW and SW–SW. Grain yields in rotations with fallow (WW–SF, WW–CF, and WW–SB–CF) were not significantly different. On an annual basis, SB–SB and WW-WP produced the highest and lowest yields, respectively. The WUEs of fallow rotations, SB–SB, and SW–SW, were not different but were higher than WUEs of WW–WP and WW–WW. Residue cover and SOC were highest under annual cropping systems and lowest following peas in WW–WP and SF in WW–SF. We conclude that rotations with fallow using NT (WW–CF and WW–SB–CF) can replace the traditional WW–SF system without yield penalty.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aOregon 3aPisum sativum 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagronomy 3aconventional tillage 3afallow 3agrain yield 3along term experiments 3ano-tillage 3apeas 3aphenology 3asoil erosion 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil water 3aspring barley 3aspring wheat 3awater use efficiency 3awinter 3awinter wheat1 aPritchett, Larry1 aPetrie, Steven0 tAgronomy journal.g2015 Sept., v. 107, no. 5 p.1863-1877dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj14.05113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245006000165300001600225520124800241592002801489650001001517650002501527650000901552650002001561650001301581650001101594650001001605653001201615653001101627653001201638653001301650700001701663700001801680700002301698700001701721700001501738700001801753700001701771700001801788700001601806700001701822700001601839700001501855773012601870856008301996852000902079655001202088IND60697965920221122092638.0210305e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069796592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.japr.2020.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButler, L.D.10aCobb 700 response to increasing lysine by growth phase  ap. 479-488.  aThe Cobb MV × Cobb 700 male broiler was evaluated for BW and feed conversion ratio (FCR) when fed diets of increasing levels of digestible lysine (Lys) and ME within each growing phase (0–12 D, 12–26 D, 26–35 D, and 35–55 D). Male BW was highest (P < 0.0001) at 12 D of age for birds fed 1.24% digestible Lys and 3,194 ME vs. birds fed 1.20% digestible Lys and 3,084 ME. Male BW were also highest (P < 0.0001) at 26 D of age for birds fed 1.23% digestible Lys and 3,194 ME. However, birds were able to compensate with increased FCR (P < 0.0001) when fed diets with lower levels of digestible Lys and ME from 26 to 55 D to achieve similar BW (P > 0.05) compared with the birds on the highest level and duration of digestible Lys and ME. The control group, that is, industry standard digestible Lys and ME levels, had the lowest levels of digestible Lys and ME for the duration of the experiment and had the highest (P < 0.0001) FCR and the lowest (P < 0.0001) BW. The results for BW and FCR suggest that the digestible Lys needs are higher than previously established. More investigations within each growing phase should be performed to better define the requirements of the Cobb MV × Cobb 700 broiler for digestible Lys.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3adevelopmental stages 3adiet 3afeed conversion 3aindustry 3alysine 3amales 0abroiler 0alysine 0aprotein 0aCobb 7001 aScanes, C.G.1 aRochell, S.J.1 aMauromoustakos, A.1 aCaldas, J.V.1 aKeen, C.A.1 aMaynard, C.W.1 aBolden, S.A.1 aBrister, R.D.1 aSmith, P.A.1 aLatham, R.E.1 aOwens, C.M.1 aKidd, M.T.0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2020 June, v. 29, no. 2 p.479-488dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.japr.2020.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008100158300002000239520132600259592002801585650004401613650002001657650001401677650001601691650001901707650002501726650002001751650001701771650001201788650001101800650002101811650002501832650001901857650001101876650001401887650003301901650001001934650002101944650001301965650002201978700001402000700001702014700001602031700001802047700001402065700001602079773012402095856007402219852000902293655001202302IND60642038820221118025810.0190506e20170721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064203882DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra06052a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Weijing10aPreparation, characterization and thermal analysis of urea-formaldehyde foam  ap. 36223-36230.  aUrea formaldehyde foam (UFF) possesses outstanding properties of fire resistance, low smoke emission, low toxicity, and excellent insulation. These properties make it suitable for thermal insulation in buildings. UFFs were prepared in this work via a foaming technology using hexane as a physical-blowing agent. By the use of varying dosages of hexane, the effect of hexane on the properties of UFF was investigated. Increased hexane dosage was shown to cause an adverse effect on the properties including compression strength, pulverization rate and limiting oxygen index. Foam microstructure was analyzed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM); cell sizes were determined and the mean cell size increased with increasing hexane dosage. This work further investigated the relationship between the physical properties and density of UFF. Furthermore, the pyrolysis behaviour of UFF and the corresponding evolution of gaseous products were examined by using a thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (TG-FTIR). Gaseous products during the pyrolysis such as HNCO, NH₂CN, HCN, H₂O and CO₂ were found in the infrared spectra. And possible formation pathways for the main pyrolysis products were tentatively presented. The flammability of UFF was measured by cone calorimetry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadverse effects 3abuildings 3acalorimetry 3acarbon dioxide 3acompression strength 3afire resistance 3aflammability 3afoaming 3ahexane 3ahydrogen cyanide 3ainsulating materials 3amicrostructure 3aoxygen 3apyrolysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asmoke 3athermogravimetry 3atoxicity 3aurea formaldehyde1 aLi, Decai1 aShen, Yunwen1 aJiang, Yang1 aZhang, Yanhua1 aGu, Jiyou1 aTan, Haiyan0 tRSC advances.g2017 July 21, v. 7, no. 58 p.36223-36230dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra06052a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011000160300001600270520193800286592002802224650001702252650002202269650001002291650001402301650001302315650001702328650001202345650001302357650002302370650002102393650002002414650002402434650001202458650001802470650001102488650001602499651001802515700002002533700001902553773010602572856008102678852000902759655001202768IND60555993520221121024803.0161030e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055599352DNAL7 a10.1007/s12230-016-9524-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yi12aA Historical Look at Russet Burbank Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) Quality Under Different Storage Regimes  ap. 474-484.  aRusset Burbank is the predominant potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) cultivar grown and stored for fresh market and frozen processing (French fry) use in North America. Multi-year assessments of potato tuber quality under different storage regimes can provide information about a cultivar’s ability to retain process quality when challenged with seasonal variations across multiple years. The objective of a 15-year study initiated in 1999 was to evaluate the quality of Russet Burbank tubers grown and stored at the Kimberly Research and Extension Center. Potatoes were measured for specific gravity at harvest and stored for eight months under three temperatures (5.6, 7.2 and 8.9 °C) and periodically sampled throughout the storage season to determine dormancy length, sugar content, fry color and mottling severity (a quality issue), and weight loss. The year in which the crop was grown significantly (p < 0.001) affected all quality characteristics except specific gravity (average ranged between 1.071 and 1.081). Tubers held during the 2011–2012 and 2013–2014 storage seasons exhibited generally higher glucose, darker fry color, more severe mottling, and higher weight loss. Average sucrose content at 7.2 °C and 8.9 °C across the 15 years significantly decreased over the eight-month storage while average glucose content remained consistent after first month of storage. Average percent weight loss across the 15 years was 6.1 % after eight months in storage. This 15-year study emphasized that variation of post-harvest storage quality from year to year was likely a result of variable seasonal growing conditions. Storage temperatures between 7.2 and 8.9 °C were the optimum range for storing fry processing Russet Burbank potatoes and the warmer temperature of 8.9 °C appears to ameliorate the seasonal effects on glucose content and fry color to maintain better processing quality throughout storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrench fries 3aSolanum tuberosum 3acolor 3acultivars 3adormancy 3afresh market 3aglucose 3apotatoes 3aseasonal variation 3aspecific gravity 3astorage quality 3astorage temperature 3asucrose 3asugar content 3atubers 3aweight loss 3aNorth America1 aBrandt, Tina L.1 aOlsen, Nora L.0 tAmerican journal of potato research.g2016 Oct., v. 93, no. 5 p.474-484dSpringer USx1099-209X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12230-016-9524-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008400169300001600253520168500269592002801954650002601982650001102008650001902019650001202038650001502050650001402065650001202079650001802091650001502109650001102124650001402135700001802149700002202167700001802189700002502207700002102232700001902253773009702272856004802369852000902417655001202426IND50072588120221123000543.0140201e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007258812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10498-013-9218-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRégnier, Pierre,10aModelling Estuarine Biogeochemical Dynamics: From the Local to the Global Scale  ap. 591-626.  aEstuaries act as strong carbon and nutrient filters and are relevant contributors to the atmospheric CO₂ budget. They thus play an important, yet poorly constrained, role for global biogeochemical cycles and climate. This manuscript reviews recent developments in the modelling of estuarine biogeochemical dynamics. The first part provides an overview of the dominant physical and biogeochemical processes that control the transformations and fluxes of carbon and nutrients along the estuarine gradient. It highlights the tight links between estuarine geometry, hydrodynamics and scalar transport, as well as the role of transient and nonlinear dynamics. The most important biogeochemical processes are then discussed in the context of key biogeochemical indicators such as the net ecosystem metabolism (NEM), air–water CO₂ fluxes, nutrient-filtering capacities and element budgets. In the second part of the paper, we illustrate, on the basis of local estuarine modelling studies, the power of reaction-transport models (RTMs) in understanding and quantifying estuarine biogeochemical dynamics. We show how a combination of RTM and high-resolution data can help disentangle the complex process interplay, which underlies the estuarine NEM, carbon and nutrient fluxes, and how such approaches can provide integrated assessments of the air–water CO₂ fluxes along river–estuary–coastal zone continua. In addition, trends in estuarine biogeochemical dynamics across estuarine geometries and environmental scenario are explored, and the results are discussed in the context of improving the modelling of estuarine carbon and CO₂ dynamics at regional and global scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3aestuaries 3afilters 3ahydrodynamics 3ametabolism 3amodels 3anutrients1 aArndt, Sandra1 aGoossens, Nicolas1 aVolta, Chiara1 aLaruelle, Goulven G.1 aLauerwald, Ronny1 aHartmann, Jens0 tAquatic geochemistry.g2013 Nov., v. 19, no. 5-6 p.591-626dSpringer-Verlagx1380-61657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-013-9218-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245017600159300001800335520125400353592002801607650001501635650001501650650002101665650002001686650002901706650002801735650001301763650001201776650001301788650001501801650001601816650002401832650001201856700001401868700001401882700001501896700001701911700001601928773014001944856007402084852000902158655001202167IND60670956620221117180454.0191002e20140507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067095662DNAL7 a10.1039/c4tb00115j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuo, Bangrong13aAn electrochemiluminescence biosensor for sensitive and selective detection of Hg²⁺ based on π–π interaction between nucleotides and ferrocene–graphene nanosheets  ap. 3263-3270.  aA solid-state electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor based on a DNA-modified electrode platform that depends on the variation of π–π interaction before and after the binding of target analytes is put forward. The single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probe was successfully assembled on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE), which was pre-modified with Ru(bpy)₃²⁺ complex and gold nanoparticles (GNPs). The ssDNA probe could strongly adsorb graphene due to the strong π–π interaction between nucleotides and graphene (GN), while in the presence of Hg²⁺, the conformational transformation of DNA from a single-stranded to a double-stranded structure resulted in inhibited adsorption of GN. With thymine (T)-rich ssDNA as a Hg²⁺ probe, we prepared the ECL biosensor by using ferrocene–graphene (Fc–GN) as a quenching unit to quench the ECL emission of Ru(bpy)₃²⁺, and the Hg²⁺ can be detected by quenching efficiency transformation when the Fc–GN gets away from Ru(bpy)₃²⁺. The biosensor exhibited a sensitive response to various ranges of concentration of Hg²⁺ with a detection limit of 18 pM. The ECL biosensor held great promise in the highly sensitive and selective detection of Hg²⁺ in natural water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiosensors 3achemical species 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aglassy carbon electrode 3agraphene 3amercury 3ananogold 3ananosheets 3anucleotides 3asingle-stranded DNA 3athymine1 aLi, Yuqin1 aZhang, An1 aLu, Fushen1 aChen, Yaowen1 aGao, Wenhua0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2014 May 7, v. 2, no. 21 p.3263-3270dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4tb00115j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011600167300001600283500001500299520141400314592002801728650001301756650002101769650001301790650003901803650001801842650003101860650001401891650002101905650002701926650001901953650002401972650002801996650002002024650001902044650001902063653001602082653003302098653003002131653003002161653002702191653001702218700001502235700001802250700001402268700001602282773011102298856008502409852000902494655001202503IND60537097220221118045240.0160807e20160902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053709722DNAL7 a10.1080/09540105.2015.11296022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Huijing10aComparative study of four physical approaches about allergenicity of soybean protein isolate for infant formula  ap. 604-623.  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this study was to investigate the influences of microwaving, high-intensity ultrasound (HIU), high-pressure homogenization (HPH) and high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) on the allergenicity and structural properties of soy protein isolate (SPI) for infant formula. Microwaving, HIU, HPH and HHP reduced allergenicity by 24.7%, 18.9%, 29.8% and 46.6%, respectively. Western blotting (WB) results indicated the allergens for Chinese soy-allergic childrens encompass 130 kD, 115 kD, lipoxidase, α and γ subunit of β-conglycinin, Chain A of glycinin, P34, 30 kD, 28 kD, Chain B of glycinin. SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) (with 2-ME) and WB patterns did not show significant differences among the native and modified SPIs. These four approaches influenced molecular interactions such as free sulfhydryl, hydrophobicity and zeta potential, compositions of secondary structures containing helices, strands, turns and unordered, and structural parameters including helices and strands (per 100 residues), average length of helices and strands. The epitopes of SPI allergens could be closely related to α-helix and β-sheet. In case of magnitude of secondary structure composition and parameter changes, HHP ranked top compared with other three methods. Therefore, the allergenicity reducing efficiency of HHP is much higher than those of other three treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepitopes 3abeta-conglycinin 3aglycinin 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aallergenicity 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3aallergens 3aWestern blotting 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3ahydrophobicity 3asoy protein isolate 3ahigh pressure treatment 3ainfant formulas 3azeta potential 3ahomogenization 0aMicrowaving 0ahigh-pressure homogenization 0ahigh-intensity ultrasound 0ahigh hydrostatic pressure 0aSPI for infant formula 0alipoxygenase1 aZhu, Kexue1 aZhou, Huiming1 aPeng, Wei1 aGuo, Xiaona0 tFood and agricultural immunology.g2016 Sept. 2, v. 27, no. 5 p.604-623dTaylor & Francisx1465-34437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09540105.2015.11296023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245003400165300001600199500001900215500001100234520100700245592002801252596004001280596003901320650001601359650001001375650002001385650001701405650001001422650002001432650001701452650001401469650001301483650001501496650001701511650001601528650001301544700001801557700002101575700006001596773011301656856008201769852000901851655001201860IND60726173020221119141518.0210202e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072617302DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-020-04891-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKohil, Amira10aViral meningitis: an overview  ap. 335-345.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aMeningitis is a serious condition that affects the central nervous system. It is an inflammation of the meninges, which is the membrane that surrounds both the brain and the spinal cord. Meningitis can be caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal infections. Many viruses, such as enteroviruses, herpesviruses, and influenza viruses, can cause this neurological disorder. However, enteroviruses have been found to be the underlying cause of most viral meningitis cases worldwide. With few exceptions, the clinical manifestations and symptoms associated with viral meningitis are similar for the different causative agents, which makes it difficult to diagnose the disease at early stages. The pathogenesis of viral meningitis is not clearly defined, and more studies are needed to improve the health care of patients in terms of early diagnosis and management. This review article discusses the most common causative agents, epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and pathogenesis of viral meningitis.  aPublisher supplied data  aQUST-2-BRC-2018-1cQatar University  aQUHI-BRC-20/21-1cQatar University 3aEnterovirus 3abrain 3aearly diagnosis 3aepidemiology 3afungi 3ahealth services 3ainflammation 3ainfluenza 3ameninges 3ameningitis 3apathogenesis 3aspinal cord 3avirology1 aJemmieh, Sara1 aSmatti, Maria K.1 aYassine, Hadi M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7592-27880 tArchives of virology.g2021 Feb., v. 166, no. 2 p.335-345dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6093x0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-020-04891-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03845naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245013800171300001600309520196400325592002802289650002402317650001002341650001502351650001502366650001202381650001602393650001302409650001502422650001702437650001302454650002102467650001302488650001102501650002202512650001202534650002802546650001102574650001402585650001202599650001802611650004102629650001402670650001402684653002402698653001902722653002202741653001502763653002102778653002002799700001902819700002702838700001802865700002102883700002202904700002202926700001902948700002002967773009902987856008803086852000903174655001203183IND60540271220221117203109.0190318e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054027122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParveen, Ifat10aScreening for potential co-products in a Miscanthus sinensis mapping family by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detection  ap. 186-196.  aSociety is demanding more green chemicals from sustainable sources. Miscanthus is a potential source of platform chemicals and bioethanol through fermentation. Miscanthus sinensis (M. sinensis) has been found to contain particularly high levels of soluble phenols (hydroxycinnamates and flavonoids) which may have application in the nutraceutical, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Here, we describe the first study on the identification and quantification of phenols from the leaf tissue of a bi-parental M. sinensis mapping family. Parents and progeny showed complex profiles of phenols with highly related structures which complicated characterisation of individual phenotypes. Separation of semi-purified extracts by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, coupled with detection by diode array and ESI-MS/MS, enabled distinction of different profiles of phenols. Ten hydroxycinnamates (O-cinnamoylquinic acids) and several flavones (one mono-O-glycosyl flavone, eight mono-C-glycosyl flavones, two di-C-glycosyl flavones, five O-glycosyl-C-glycosyl flavones and nine 2″-O-glycosyl-C-glycosyl flavones) were identified and quantified in leaf tissue of two hundred progeny and maternal and paternal plants during the seedling stage. Progeny exhibiting high, moderate and low amounts of hydroxycinnamates and flavonoids and both parents were selected and screened at seven months’ growth to determine the abundance of these phenols at their highest biomass and compared with seedlings. Concentrations of phenols generally decreased as leaves matured. Several flavone-glycosides were identified. This technique can be used for rapid screening of plants in a mapping family to identify genotypes with high phenol content to add value in the biorefinery chain. This comparative study provides information on the content of potentially valuable compounds from readily renewable resources and possible biomarkers for identification in breeding programmes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiscanthus sinensis 3aacids 3abioethanol 3abiomarkers 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3abreeding 3acoproducts 3afermentation 3aflavones 3afunctional foods 3agenotype 3aleaves 3amass spectrometry 3aparents 3apharmaceutical industry 3aphenol 3aphenotype 3aprogeny 3arapid methods 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3ascreening 3aseedlings 0aMiscanthus sinensis 0aMapping family 0aHydroxycinnamates 0aFlavonoids 0aLC-DAD–ESI-MSn 0aGreen chemicals1 aWilson, Thomas1 aThreadgill, Michael D.1 aLuyten, Jakob1 aRoberts, Ruth E.1 aRobson, Paul R.H.1 aDonnison, Iain S.1 aHauck, Barbara1 aWinters, Ana L.0 tPhytochemistry.g2014 Sept., v. 105 p.186-196dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007900165300001400244520125100258592002801509650001101537650001401548650001301562650001401575650002401589650002201613650001501635650001001650653002401660653001901684653002501703700001701728700002001745700001501765700001701780773010901797856008201906852000901988655001201997IND60541922820221121234026.0190401e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054192282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2014.01.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFicheux, A.S.10aProbabilistic assessment of exposure to nail cosmetics in French consumers  ap. 36-43.  aThe aim of this study was to assess probabilistic exposure to nail cosmetics in French consumers. The exposure assessment was performed with base coat, polish, top coat and remover. This work was done for adult and child consumers. Dermal, inhalation and oral routes were taken into account for varnishes. Exposure evaluation was performed for the inhalation route with polish remover.The main route of exposure to varnishes was the ungual route. Inhalation was the secondary route of exposure, followed by dermal and oral routes. Polish contributed most to exposure, regardless of the route of exposure. For this nail product, P50 and P95 values by ungual route were respectively equal to 1.74mg(kgbwweek)−1 and 8.55mg(kgbwweek)−1 for women aged 18–34years. Exposure to polish by inhalation route was equal to 0.70mg(kgbwweek)−1 (P50) and 5.27mg(kgbwweek)−1 (P95). P50 and P95 values by inhalation route were respectively equal to 0.08mg(kgbwweek)−1 and 1.14mg(kgbwweek)−1 for consumers aged 18–34years exposed to polish remover. This work provided current exposure data for nail cosmetics, and a basis for future toxicological studies of the uptake of substances contained in nail cosmetics in order to assess systemic exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abreathing 3achildren 3acosmetics 3aexposure assessment 3aexposure pathways 3atoxicology 3awomen 0aExposure assessment 0aNail cosmetics 0aProbabilistic method1 aMorisset, T.1 aChevillotte, G.1 aPostic, C.1 aRoudot, A.C.0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2014 Apr., v. 66 p.36-43dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2014.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04922naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005900149245009600208300001200304500001900316520299500335592002803330596007703358650001103435650001903446650000803465650002503473650001303498650001503511650001603526650001603542650001503558650002003573650001203593650001803605650001203623650001003635650004503645650001603690650001303706650003303719650001303752650001803765650001403783650001403797650003003811650002203841650002503863650001103888651001003899651001803909653002803927653001603955653002403971700001903995700002004014700001604034773013004050856008304180852000904263655001204272IND60728822920221121154721.0210224e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072882292DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-06-20-1221-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Sheng-Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8871-216510aFirst Report of Colletotrichum siamense Causing Anthracnose on Photinia × fraseri in China  ap. 510.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPhotinia × fraseri Dress is mainly distributed in the southeast and east of Asia and North America and has been widely cultivated in China. In summer 2018, an anthracnose disease of P. × fraseri was found in a park in Nanjing City, China. Diseased leaves showed small, round, light reddish-brown spots in the early stage of infection that gradually expanded into round spots, with light gray in centers and brown edges. Fresh lesions were cut into 2- to 3-mm² sections, sterilized with 75% ethanol for 30 s followed by 1% NaClO for 90 s, washed with sterile water three times, and placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) with 0.1 mg/ml of ampicillin at 25°C. Colonies of representative strain HDSN2-1 were white to greenish gray, and the daily growth rate was 9.5 to 10.5 mm/day. Aerial mycelium was grayish white, dense, and cottony, with visible conidial masses at the inoculum point. Conidia were one-celled, smooth-walled, hyaline, with obtuse to rounded ends, with a size of 12.8 to 18.4 × 4.5 to 6.8 µm. Appressoria were one-celled, brown, thick-walled, ellipsoidal, and 7.3 to 10.3 × 5.4 to 6.97 µm. The morphological characteristics of HDSN2-1 matched those of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex (Weir et al. 2012). For further identification, DNA was extracted from HDSN2-1 mycelium, and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and partial sequences of β-tubulin (TUB2), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), chitin synthase (CHS-1), and calmodulin (CAL) genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced with primers ITS1/ITS4,TubF1/TubR1,GDF/GDR, CHS-79F/CHS-345R, and CAL1C/CAL2C, respectively (Weir et al. 2012). The sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession nos. MN889417, MN894596, MN894597, MN894598, and MN894599). A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum-likelihood method with concatenated sequences (ITS, TUB2, GAPDH, CHS-1, and CAL) (Zhu et al. 2019). Analyses conducted in MEGA7 placed HDSN2-1 in the C. siamense clade, which includes ex-type ICMP 18578. Pathogenicity of HDSN2-1 was verified on leaves from seven healthy 8-year-old P. × fraseri and inoculated with either 5-mm mycelial plugs from the edge of 5-day-old cultures on PDA or 10 μl of spore suspension (10⁶ conidia/ml). Fifteen healthy plants (8 years old) were used in five repetitions (five for control, and 10 for the pathogenicity test) in the same way. Controls were treated with PDA plugs or sterile dH₂O. The leaves were incubated at 25°C, and the inoculated plants were kept in a greenhouse (relative humidity >85%, 25 ± 1°C). Symptoms were not observed on control plants. Fungal isolates from the symptomatic plants showed the same morphological characteristics as HDSN2-1. C. siamense is a common fungal pathogen of many plants. For example, it was previously reported infecting apples and citrus fruits (Abirami et al. 2019). This is the first report of anthracnose of P. × fraseri caused by C. siamense in China.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0600104cNational Key Research and Development Programme of China 3aCitrus 3aColletotrichum 3aDNA 3aGlomerella cingulata 3aPhotinia 3aampicillin 3aanthracnose 3aappressoria 3acalmodulin 3achitin synthase 3aconidia 3aculture media 3aethanol 3afungi 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3agreenhouses 3ainoculum 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amycelium 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arelative humidity 3astatistical analysis 3asummer 3aChina 3aNorth America 0aColletotrichum siamense 0anew disease 0aPhotinia × fraseri1 aChen, Hao-Dong1 aZhao, Ying-Juan1 aLi, Yan-Jun0 tPlant disease.g2021 Feb., v. 105, no. 2 p.510-510dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-06-20-1221-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006300144245006000207500001900267500002000286520103900306592002801345596005701373596007601430650001201506650002001518650001201538650001001550650001301560650002701573773011401600856007801714852000901792655001201801IND60708526220221117224359.0200826e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070852622DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2020001202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuminiecki, Łukasz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1943-445012aA Contemporary Message from Mendel's Logical Empiricism  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe gene is one of the most fundamental concepts in life sciences, having been developed in the mold of the Mendelian paradigm of heredity, which shaped genetics across 150 years. How could Mendel possibly be so prophetic in the middle of 19ᵗʰ century, using only the small garden of the monastery as his experimental breeding field? I believe that we are indebted to Mendel's mastery of the scientific method, which was far ahead of his time. Although his experimental technology was literally garden‐variety, Mendel's excellence in the method of science, algebra, and logical analysis helped him in designing the right experiment and in interpreting the results insightfully. This may be valuable to recall in today's technology‐focused culture, where the center of interest tends to be on the generation and description of high‐throughput datasets from specialized genomics screens. As Mendel's story suggests, progress in 21ˢᵗ century genetics may also depend on the development of robust concepts and generalizations.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016/21/P/NZ2/03926cNational Science Centre, Poland  a665778cEuropean Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme 3aalgebra 3adata collection 3agardens 3agenes 3agenomics 3ainheritance (genetics)0 tBioEssays.g2020 Sept., v. 42, no. 9 p.e2000120-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938457x0265-92477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2020001203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005800153245014600211520114900357592002801506650001701534650002401551650001101575650002201586650001601608650001701624651001401641653001001655653001001665653000901675653001101684653002001695653002401715773011801739856008801857852000901945655001201954IND60683496420221119183412.0201023e20200510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068349642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1370252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahri, Muhamad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8751-073710aAnalysis of the water, energy, food and land nexus using the system archetypes: A case study in the Jatiluhur reservoir, West Java, Indonesia  aThis paper applies the system archetypes to investigate water, energy, food, and land nexus (WEFLN) in the Jatiluhur reservoir, the largest reservoir in Indonesia. The Jatiluhur reservoir has multiple functions such as hydropower supply and water supply for different end users. Multiple functions and multiple users mean there are tradeoffs in fulfilling the needs of different end users. Through feedback loops, the system dynamics tools concern on the interdependencies and the complexities of the nexus elements. It is found that growth engines such as industrial development and residential development support industrial and residential sectors. However, water availability will be a crucial issue as water supply can bound the growth engines. This situation is called the limits to growth archetype. Another system archetype named the success to successful is also identified. The success to successful archetype reminds us to distribute water and energy properly to sustain the growth in all sectors. Finally, outputs of this study can be a basis to develop a computer model and to support sustainable functions of the other reservoirs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acomputer simulation 3aenergy 3aindustrialization 3awater power 3awater supply 3aIndonesia 0aNexus 0aWater 0aFood 0aEnergy 0aSystem dynamics 0aJatiluhur reservoir0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 May 10, v. 716 p.137025-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1370253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03410naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100001300162245009900175300001400274520115700288592002801445650002501473650002501498650002701523650002201550650001701572650002501589650003401614650002201648650002301670650002001693650001001713650002101723650004301744650002601787650002101813650002101834650002301855650002301878650003401901650002301935650002901958650001601987650003802003650003002041650003002071650003202101650003402133650002902167650002802196650002802224650003302252650003002285650002702315650005202342650002802394651001102422700002402433700001802457700001902475700001802494773009602512856008302608852000902691655001202700IND4478328520221123032724.0120503e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447832852DNAL7 a222288162pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/tpr1302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDutt, M.10aEvaluation of four phloem-specific promoters in vegetative tissues of transgenic citrus plants  ap. 83-93.  a‘Mexican’ lime (Citrus aurantifolia Swingle) was transformed with constructs that contained chimeric promoter-gus gene fusions of phloem-specific rolC promoter of Agrobacterium rhizogenes, Arabidopsis thaliana sucrose-H+ symporter (AtSUC2) gene promoter of Arabidopsis thaliana, rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) promoter and sucrose synthase l (RSs1) gene promoter of Oryza sativa (rice). Histochemical β-glucuronidase (GUS) analysis revealed vascular-specific expression of the GUS protein in citrus. The RTBV promoter was the most efficient promoter in this study while the RSs1 promoter could drive low levels of gus gene expression in citrus. These results were further validated by reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting. Southern blot analysis confirmed stable transgene integration, which ranged from a single insertion to four copies per genome.

Host resistance represents an economically suitable and long term approach for the management of the disease; however, the relationship between root and tuber symptoms may vary across potato genotypes. To assess susceptibility differences among genotypes, 30 potato cultivars and 83 advanced clones with varying skin type (market class) were evaluated for powdery scab and root gall formation. Five field experiments were conducted during 2011 and 2012 on naturally infested soils in Minnesota and North Dakota. Differences among genotypes in the degree of susceptibility to tuber and root symptoms were observed (P < 0.001, n = 33 to 80). Higher powdery scab pressure (P < 0.001, n = 90) was observed in North Dakota locations across years. Environmental conditions influenced the formation of root galls and the expression of powdery scab, with greatest variability among white- and red-skinned genotypes. Under high disease pressure, the estimates of broad-sense heritability for powdery scab incidence and severity were 0.76 and 0.63, respectively. Across environments, russet-skinned genotypes resulted in less disease on tubers, but yielded similar levels of root galls as red-skinned genotypes. Tuber scab and root gall formation indices were significantly associated (r = 0.42, P < 0.001, n = 80); however, high levels of disease in roots were observed in genotypes ranked resistant to powdery scab. Cultivars Dakota Trailblazer, Dakota Russet and Karu ranked highly resistant, whereas Shepody, Kennebec and Red LaSoda were highly susceptible to both phases of the disease. Cultivar selection is highly recommended for disease management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aSpongospora subterranea 3aclones 3acultivars 3adisease control 3aenvironmental factors 3afield experimentation 3agenotype 3aheritability 3amarkets 3apotatoes 3aroot galls 3aroots 3asoil 3atubers 3aMinnesota 3aNorth Dakota1 aThompson, Asunta L.1 aGudmestad, Neil C.1 aSecor, Gary A.0 tAmerican journal of potato research.g2016 Oct., v. 93, no. 5 p.497-508dSpringer USx1099-209X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12230-016-9526-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02262naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005900153245008900212300001600301520088700317592002801204650001701232650002201249650001201271650001001283650001101293650002001304650000701324650001901331650003701350653003401387653002501421653001401446653001301460653003501473700002401508700002701532700001701559700002101576700002301597773009901620856008801719852000901807655001201816IND60540271520221117203046.0190318e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054027152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Joana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9996-146310aGrape anthocyanin oligomerization: A putative mechanism for red color stabilization?  ap. 178-185.  aThe equilibrium forms of malvidin-3-O-glucoside trimer present in grape skins were studied in aqueous solution at different pH values through UV–Visible spectroscopy. It was observed that the reactivity of this compound is strongly dominated by acid–base chemistry (pKa1=3.61±0.03; pKa2=6.83±0.06), with the reaction sequence hydration–tautomerization–isomerization accounting less than 10% of the overall reactivity. The decrease of hydration of this flavylium cation derivative when compared to the original anthocyanins results from the formation of a cluster of the pigment with a high-energy of solvation that inhibits the access of water molecules to the flavylium cation core preventing by this way the hydration reactions. Overall of these results raise the hypothesis that polymerization may be a natural stabilization mechanism for the red color of anthocyanins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3aaqueous solutions 3acations 3acolor 3agrapes 3aoligomerization 3apH 3apolymerization 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aMalvidin-3-O-glucoside trimer 0aIonization reactions 0aHydration 0aStacking 0aMolecular dynamics simulations1 aBrás, Natércia F.1 ada Silva, Mara Alhinho1 aMateus, Nuno1 aParola, A.

In nonâglacierized basins, snowmelt and rainfall generate river discharge, which provides first order control over fluxes. Further factors include the seasonality of precipitation, seasonal active layer development, and permafrost disturbance. These controls were evaluated in terms of sedimentary and biogeochemical fluxes from paired catchments at Cape Bounty, Melville Island, Nunavut during 2006â2009. Results indicate that the source of runoff can be more important than the amount of runoff for sediment, solutes, and organic yields. Although the snowmelt period is typically the most important time for these yields, heavy late summer precipitation events can create disproportionately large yields. Rainfall increases yields because it hydrologically connects areas otherwise isolated. Inorganic solute yields from late summer rainfall are higher because the thick active layer maximizes hydrologic interactions with mineral soils and generates high solute concentrations. Results also indicate that while the catchments are broadly similar, subtle topographic differences result in important interâcatchment differences in runoff and suspended and dissolved loads. The East watershed, which had less extensive permafrost disturbance, consistently had higher concentrations of dissolved solids. These higher dissolved fluxes cannot therefore be explained by thermokarst features, but rather by deeper active layer development, due to a greater proportion of southâfacing slopes. Although warm temperatures in 2007 led to extensive active layer disturbance in the West watershed, because the disturbances were largely hydrologically disconnected, the total disturbed area was small, and interâannual variability in discharge was high, there was no detectable response in dissolved loads to disturbances. Sediment availability increased after 2007, but yields have largely returned to preâdisturbance levels. Results indicate that seasonality and frequencyâmagnitude characteristics of projected increases in precipitation must be considered along with active layer changes to predict the fluvial sedimentary and biogeochemical response to regional climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aislands 3alandscapes 3amineral soils 3apermafrost 3arain 3arivers 3arunoff 3asediments 3asolutes 3asummer 3atemperature 3awatersheds 3aArctic region 3aNunavut1 aLafreniÃ¨re, Melissa J.1 aLamoureux, Scott F.0 tHydrological processes.g2012 June 30, v. 26, no. 13 p.2003-2018dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.8335  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245008600166300001600252520149000268536015301758592002801911596012501939650001002064650002502074650000902099650001602108650001502124650001102139650001502150650001402165650001702179650001602196650001902212700002202231700001702253773013302270856008002403852000902483655001202492IND60645344220221121220327.0190528e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064534422DNAL7 a10.1177/1098612X187661542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolbak, Susanna10aInfluence of needle gauge used for venipuncture on measures of hemostasis in cats  ap. 143-147.  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different needle sizes used to obtain blood via jugular venipuncture in cats on routine measures of hemostasis. This was a prospective, observational, randomized, clinical study carried out at a university teaching hospital. Twenty healthy, client-owned cats were used. Each cat had blood collected via direct venipuncture from both jugular veins. Sampling of the right and left jugular vein was randomized to be collected with either a 22 G or a 25 G needle, respectively, and routine coagulation variables and platelet count were performed on all samples. Values were analyzed for differences in needle size, and site of sample collection. There was no difference between the two needle gauges in activated partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, fibrinogen degradation products, or fibrinogen, or between sampling from the left and right jugular vein. Prothrombin time (PT) was significantly higher when drawn from a 25 G needle (11.7 s) compared with a 22 G needle (11.4 s) (P = 0.01), but not different in left vs right jugular vein samples. Bland–Altman analysis of PT comparing for 25 G minus 22 G needle vs the average, calculated a mean bias (95% limits of agreement) of 0.49 s (–1.4 s to 2.4 s). This study of 20 healthy cats found that the use of either a 25 G or 22 G needle for jugular venipuncture did not introduce any clinically meaningful difference in routine coagulation variables or platelet count.  aFunding This project was supported by the Center for Companion Animal Health (CCAH), School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015-42-RcThe Center for Companion Animal Health (CCAH), School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis 3ablood 3ablood platelet count 3acats 3acoagulation 3afibrinogen 3agauges 3ahemostasis 3ahospitals 3ajugular vein 3aprothrombin 3athromboplastin1 aEpstein, Steven E1 aHopper, Kate0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g2019 Feb., v. 21, no. 2 p.143-147dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1532-27507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612X187661543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009000169300001600259520139200275592002801667650001201695650002301707650001501730650001001745650001101755650001301766650002501779650001701804650001001821651001301831653001401844653001201858653002401870653001101894700002001905700001901925700002701944700001701971700001501988700002002003773011702023856008502140852000902225655001202234IND60087125120221120153927.0190416e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008712512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2012.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes, Jacinto10aDetection of Theileria and Babesia infections amongst asymptomatic cattle in Portugal  ap. 148-151.  aPiroplasmosis caused by tick-borne hemoprotozoans of several Theileria and Babesia species has a major impact on livestock production worldwide. A reverse line blotting assay that includes genus- and species-specific probes for Theileria and Babesia species was used to assess the occurrence of these parasites in blood samples collected from 1407 healthy bovines throughout mainland Portugal. The global prevalence of piroplasm-infected animals was 36.8%, although significant differences were found between various regions. Higher prevalence was found in the southern regions (42.4% in Lisbon and Tagus Valley, 51.6% in Alentejo, and 40.0% in Algarve) compared to central (23.1%) and northern (12.8%) Portugal. Theileria annulata was the most frequently found species with a prevalence of 21.3%. The prevalence values of this pathogenic species were higher in the southern regions. The second most prevalent species was T. buffeli that infected 10.1% of the bovines. A low prevalence was found for Babesia infections (7.9%) with B. bigemina as the most frequent species. Some animals were infected with T. ovis and B. occultans. Veterinary practitioners and stakeholders should be made aware of the existence of a relatively high prevalence of carrier animals infected with T. annulata in Portugal, given the potential threat this pathogenic parasite represents to the cattle industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBabesia 3aTheileria annulata 3ababesiosis 3ablood 3acattle 3aindustry 3alivestock production 3astakeholders 3aticks 3aPortugal 0aTheileria 0aBabesia 0aTick-borne diseases 0aCattle1 aSoares, Ricardo1 aSantos, Marcos1 aSantos-Gomes, Gabriela1 aBotelho, Ana1 aAmaro, Ana1 aInácio, João,0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2013 Feb., v. 4, no. 1-2 p.148-151dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2012.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010400167300001600271520122100287592002801508650001501536650001501551650002201566650001201588650001101600650001101611650001901622650002201641650000901663650002001672650001901692650001801711650001101729650001701740650001801757650001601775650001101791650001101802650002001813653001101833653002001844653001501864653001901879653001401898700005701912700001801969700001801987700005902005700005802064773011302122856008602235852000902321655001202330IND60633847620221119132737.0190325e20190505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063384762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.02.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHwang, Juri12aA remotely steerable Janus micromotor adsorbent for the active remediation of Cs-contaminated water  ap. 416-422.  aWe report the development of magnetically steerable self-propelled micromotors that selectively remove radioactive Cs from contaminated water. Mesoporous silica microspheres were functionalized with the highly Cs-selective copper ferrocyanide, and half of the adsorptive particle surface was then coated with ferromagnetic Ni and catalytic Pt layers to fabricate Janus micromotors. The micromotor adsorbent displayed random propulsion in an H2O2 solution via catalytic bubble evolution from the Pt surface, and the micromotor adsorbent self-propulsion resulted in an 8-fold higher Cs removal compared to the stationary adsorbent within one hour. The ferromagnetism of the Ni layer allowed the micromotor adsorbent to be magnetically and remotely steerable, and the propulsion speed under a magnetic field was ˜11-fold greater than it was in the absence of the magnetophoretic force. The adsorption of Cs by the self-propelling micromotor adsorbent and the subsequent magnetic recovery of the adsorbent enabled the successful removal of radioactive 137Cs from aqueous solutions. More than 98% of the radioactive 137Cs ions were removed from solution, even in the presence of competing ions, such as Na+ (1000 ppm).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abubbles 3acesium 3acopper 3aferromagnetism 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aions 3amagnetic fields 3amicroparticles 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3aporous media 3aradionuclides 3aremediation 3asilica 3asodium 3awater pollution 0aCesium 0aSelf-propulsion 0aMicromotor 0aJanus particle 0aAdsorbent1 aYang, Hee-Man1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5554-99471 aLee, Kune-Woo1 aJung, Yang-Il1 aLee, Kyung-Jin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6709-32351 aPark, Chan Woo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9805-512X0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2019 May 05, v. 369 p.416-422dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.02.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245005800129300001600187500024000203520128500443650001401728650000901742650001001751650001601761650001201777650000901789650001501798773008001813852000901893939003301902946001301935655001201948IND9203800520221118100156.0920615e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920380052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReynolds, C.K.10aMetabolism of nitrogenous compounds by ruminant liver  ap. 850-854.  aPresented at the 32nd Annual Ruminant Nutrition Conference on "Hepatic Metabolism of Organic Acids in Ruminants" held at the 75th Annual Meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, April 21, 1991, Atlanta.  aRuminants absorb substantial amounts of ammonia nitrogen and very little glucose. Ammonia absorbed is removed by the liver and converted to urea, which can be recycled to the digestive tract and add to the pool of ammonia absorbed. When ammonia absorption and liver urea production are increased by changes in nitrogen intake, an associated increase in liver alpha-amino nitrogen removal has been observed. Reasons for the increase in liver removal of amino acids with greater ureagenesis are uncertain, but the aspartate/glutamate requirement of ureagenesis and the complex relationships between ureagenesis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, glucogenesis, liver energy metabolism and redox state all may be involved. Amino acids represent potential sources of carbon for liver glucogenesis and precise reckonings of the contributions of amino acid carbon to glucogenesis are needed for ruminants fed differing diets. There is evidence for the involvement of peptides in liver nitrogen exchanges and amino acids in peptides represent a potential source of carbon for glucogenesis and nitrogen for ureagenesis. A number of endocrine factors have an impact on liver nitrogen metabolism in ruminants. Growth hormone decreases liver urea release and increases liver glutamate release. 3aruminants 3adiet 3aliver 3aamino acids 3aammonia 3aurea 3ametabolism0 tJournal of nutrition.g1992 Mar., v. 122, no. 3S p.850-854x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02715naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002600136245011700162300001600279500002400295500001500319520157800334650001401912650001101926650001101937650001701948650001601965650001701981650002301998650001202021651002002033653001602053653001602069700003002085700002102115700002502136773010802161852000902269856003902278655001202317IND4415741420221118095352.0090130e20090130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441574142DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.71062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLivingston, Joanne M.10aFloodplain stratigraphy of the ice jam dominated middle Yukon River: a new approach to long-term flood frequency  ap. 357-371.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFloodplain stratigraphy is used as a new method for reconstructing ice jam flood histories of northern rivers. The method, based on reconstruction of the sedimentary record of vertically-accreting floodplains, relies on stratigraphic logging and interpretation of floodplain sediments, which result from successive ice jam floods, and radiocarbon dating of inter-flood organic material for chronology. In a case study along a reach of the Yukon River that straddles the Yukon-Alaska border, the method is used to develop a record of ice jam flooding for the last 2000 years. Detailed chronostratigraphic logs from three sites along the Yukon River indicates that the long-term recurrence interval varies depending on location, but ranges from approximately once in 25 years to once in 38 years (or a probability of ca 3-4% in any given year). This is broadly similar to the 4·5% probability of recurrence calculated from archival and gauged data at Dawson City, Yukon Territory, for the period 1898-2006. Two of the three study locations, with sufficient chronology, suggest a decrease in flood frequency in the last several hundred years relative to the preceding period at each site, broadly corresponding to the Little Ice Age, suggesting climate exerts some control over long-term ice jam flood frequency. This study demonstrates that the floodplain sedimentary record offers the potential to extend records of ice jam flooding in remote, ungauged northern rivers and provides a broader temporal context for assessing the frequency and variability of ice jam flooding. 3asediments 3arivers 3afloods 3astratigraphy 3afloodplains 3acase studies 3aradiocarbon dating 3aclimate 3aYukon Territory 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aSmith, D.

In this study, we report the genetic basis for the hierarchical interaction between L genes and Tobamovirus pathotypes. We cloned L(3) using map-based methods, and L(1), L(1a), L(1c), L(2), L(2b), and L(4) using a homology-based method. L gene alleles encode coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-type resistance proteins with the ability to induce resistance response to the viral coat protein (CP) avirulence effectors by themselves. Their different recognition spectra in original pepper species were reproduced in an Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated transient expression system in Nicotiana benthamiana. Chimera analysis with L(1), which showed the narrowest recognition spectrum, indicates that the broader recognition spectra conferred by L(2), L(2b), L(3), and L(4) require different subregions of the LRR domain. We identified a critical amino acid residue for the determination of recognition spectra but other regions also influenced the L genes' resistance spectra. The results suggest that the hierarchical interactions between L genes and Tobamovirus spp. are determined by the interaction of multiple subregions of the LRR domain of L proteins with different viral CP themselves or some protein complexes including them. 3aplant viruses 3ahot peppers 3asweet peppers 3aTobamovirus 3aalleles 3agene-for-gene relationship 3achimerism 3aplant proteins 3ainterspecific variation 3aprotein structure 3agenetic resistance 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3adisease resistance 3aCapsicum 3apathotypes 3acoat proteins 3ahost plants 3ainduced resistance 3amicrobial genetics 3aleucine 3atransgenic plants 3aDNA-binding proteins 0aspecies differences 0aresistance genes 0aviral proteins 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens 0aviral effectors1 aSekine, Ken-Taro1 aMizumoto, Hiroyuki1 aSakamoto, Masaru1 aMurai, Jun1 aKiba, Akinori1 aHikichi, Yasufumi1 aSuzuki, Kazumi1 aKobayashi, Kappei0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2011 Jan., v. 24, no. 1 p.108-117dAPS Pressx0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-06-10-01273Available from publisher's Web site  a20110404b20110507c00000000  aINDd2CTe2011/01/25  aOther US 7aarticle01960naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007300128300001600201500021700217520093900434650001401373650001001387650002601397650001701423700001701440700001701457700002101474700001601495773008001511852000901591939003301600946001301633655001201646IND9203800620221118095400.0920615e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920380062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollier, R.J.10aImpact of somatotropins on nutrient requirements in domestic animals  ap. 855-860.  aPresented at a minisymposium on "Effect of Partitioning Agents on Nutrient Requirements" given at the 75th Annual Meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, April 24, 1991, Atlanta.  aSomatotropins increase nitrogen retention, decrease carcass fat and increase lean/fat ratio in growing ruminants and swine. However, responses are much more variable in growing ruminants. Maintenance requirements in both ruminants and swine are increased slightly with somatotropin treatment in conjunction with increased lean mass. This is associated with increases in partial efficiency of protein accretion, resulting in increased efficiency of growth. Additional information is required to accurately assess effects of somatotropin on nutrient requirements for growing ruminants and swine. Future studies should target degradable and nondegradable protein requirements for growing ruminants and the impact of somatotropin on these requirements; definition of dose, pattern and formulation of somatotropin for both ruminants and swine and interaction of somatotropin with other factors affecting feed intake in swine and ruminants. 3aruminants 3aswine 3anutrient requirements 3asomatotropin1 aVicini, J.L.1 aKnight, C.D.1 aMcLaughlin, C.L.1 aBaile, C.A.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1992 Mar., v. 122, no. 3S p.855-860x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02362naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245010100132300001600233500001500249520145100264650003001715650002301745650001801768650001201786650001901798650002101817650001101838651002101849651001501870653001301885773007101898852000901969939003301978946001302011655001202024IND9203803020221118095327.0920615e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920380302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHershkovitz, M.A.10aLeaf morphology and taxonomic analysis of Cistanthe tweedyi (nee Lewisia tweedyi; Portulacaceae)  ap. 220-238.  a2019-12-04  aCistanthe tweedyi (Portulacaceae) is a rare perennial herb endemic to the Cascade Mountains of northern Washington and adjacent British Columbia. It has heretofore been classified in Lewisia, probably because of the persistent, yet erroneous, characterization of its fruit dehiscence as circumscissile, as in Lewisia, rather than valvate, as in most other Portulacaceae. Cladistic affinity of C. tweedyi to Cistanthe is evidenced by its unequal inflorescence bracts (a synapomorphy of the genus) and by the presence of several characters that show homoplasy in Portulacaceae but do not occur in combination outside of Cistanthe, including wide-petiolate leaves, festooned brochidodromous venation, an apically diminished primary vein, predominantly brachyparacytic and similar stomata, and strophiolate seeds with colliculate sculpture and micropylax hooks. Cistanthe tweedyi lacks sinuous and ribbon-like veins, which are otherwise rarely absent in Cistanthe. Cistanthe tweedyi lacks other characteristics plausibly synapomorphic for all or part of Lewisia, including glandulardentate sepals and bracts, cladodromous leaf venation, and laterocytic stomata. The chromosome base number Cistanthe tweedyi, n = 46, is possibly based on n = 11--a number common in Cistanthe, but rare in Lewisia. Cistanthe tweedyi constitutes a monotypic sect. Strophiolum within Cistanthe. Its precise phylogenetic position and biogeographic origin remain uncertain. 3ageographical distribution 3anumerical taxonomy 3aPortulacaceae 3aLewisia 3aultrastructure 3aplant morphology 3aleaves 3aBritish Columbia 0aWashington 0asynonyms0 tSystematic botany.g1992 , v. 17, no. 2 p.220-238x0363-64457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02246naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008800126300001600214500019700230500001500427520121600442650002301658650001201681650001501693650001501708650000901723653001401732653002501746700001401771773008001785852000901865939003301874946001301907655001201920IND9203799420221118095340.0920615e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920379942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFavus, M.J.14aThe use of pharmacologic agents to study mechanisms of intestinal calcium transport  ap. 683-686.  aPresented at a symposium on "Current Concepts of Calcium Absorption" given at the 75th Annual Meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, April 22, 1991, Atlanta.  a2019-12-04  aThe mechanism of vitamin D-dependent intestinal calcium transport has been explored in experimental animals in vivo and in vitro with the aid of pharmacologic agents that inhibit steps in the translocation process. Glucocorticoids in vivo, but not in vitro, inhibit the mucosal-to-serosal flux (Jms) of calcium and thus reduce net calcium absorption. Chronic metabolic acidosis inhibits calcium transport in vivo through inhibition of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25(OH)2D3) production and by a direct effect in vitro on the enterocyte to decrease calcium Jms. Cellular functions that may be involved in the transport process have been inhibited in vitro, including brush border calcium uptake by calcium channel blockers; calmodulin-dependent Ca-activated ATPase by trifluoperazine; calcium binding to vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein (CaBP, calbindin) by theophylline and acidic lysosomal vesicle function by quinacrine, chloroquine and ammonium chloride. The results of these studies demonstrate the consequences of selectively inhibiting steps thought to be involved in calcium transport and suggest new directions for further research in elucidating mechanisms of cellular calcium transport. 3anutrient transport 3acalcium 3aintestines 3acalcitriol 3arats 0avitamin D 0anutrition physiology1 aTembe, V.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1992 Mar., v. 122, no. 3S p.683-686x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01700naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245002300133300002000156300002800176500002300204500001500227520058200242650002400824650002700848650002900875650002300904650001100927650002500938650001200963650001600975650001300991653001501004653002301019653002101042700001701063700001601080773009401096852001301190939003301203945000801236946001301244852000901257655001201266991630373760742620221118095825.0911115e199106  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910034712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJackson, M.Y.10aObesity prevention  ap. 1625S-1630S.  ap. 1625S-1630S. charts.  aLiterature review.  a2019-12-05  aGiven the increased risk of overweight and the fact that many weight-related behaviors acquired during childhood and adolescence are likely to be maintained into adulthood, minority teenagers are a key group to target for obesity-prevention efforts.

Methods From 2000 to 2002, mailed questionnaires were used to obtain information on aspirin, ibuprofen, and other NSAID use and subsequent breast cancer events. A total of 270 recurrences (local, regional, and distant disease and new primary breast cancers) were reported and verified by medical record review. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for age at diagnosis, race, cancer stage, tamoxifen treatment, chemotherapy use, body mass index, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) inhibitor use. Results Current, regular use (at least three days per week at time of questionnaire administration) of ibuprofen (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.32-0.98), but not aspirin (RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.74-1.61), was associated with a statistically significant decreased risk of breast cancer recurrence. The combination of ibuprofen and other non-aspirin NSAIDs such as naproxen and sulindac reflected a similar reduction in risk (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.33-0.95). No association was found for the non-NSAID analgesic acetaminophen. Conclusion Our findings provide support for an inverse association between current, regular ibuprofen use and breast cancer recurrence. 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3abreast neoplasms 3arelapse 3achemoprevention 2aAged 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidalxtherapeutic use 2aAspirinxtherapeutic use 2aBreast Neoplasmsxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aChemoprevention 2aCohort Studies 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIbuprofenxtherapeutic use 2aMiddle Aged 2aProspective Studies 2aRisk 2aSecondary Prevention 2aSurvivors 0aCaliforniaxepidemiology. 0aNon-steroidal1 aHabel, Laurel A. 1 aSlattery, Martha L. 1 aCaan, Bette 0 tCancer causes & control.g2007 Aug., v. 18, no. 6 p.613-620dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0957-52437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-007-9003-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070729b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02548naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245007800129300001600207520172200223650001301945650002101958650001301979650001801992650000902010650001502019650002802034653001902062773008702081852000902168930003302177945001302210946001102223655001202234IND2035618520221118095411.0931101s1992    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203561852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMortvedt, J.J.10aCrop response to level of water-soluble zinc in granular zinc fertilizers  ap. 249-255.  aMany industrial by-products containing Zn are being processed and sold as Zn fertilizers. Some baghouse dusts and flue dusts which contain ZnO may be used as fertilizers or may be partially acidulated with H2SO4 to form Zn oxysulfates (various mixtures of ZnO and ZnSO4). Spent H2SO4 by-products of several industries, especially the galvanizing industry, also may be processed into ZnSO4 fertilizers. The level of water-soluble Zn (as a percentage of total Zn) in these fertilizers is mainly related to the relative contents of ZnSO4 (water soluble) and ZnO (water insoluble). Other published results have shown that availability to plants of most nutrients in a granular fertilizer is related to their water solubility. Response of corn (Zea mays L.) to fine and granular Zn fertilizers varying in level of water-soluble Zn was determined on a limed Zn-deficient Crowley silt loam (Typic Albaqualf) in three greenhouse pot experiments. Dry matter production and Zn uptake by corn were similar with several finely ground (< 0.15 mm) Zn fertilizers varying from 0 to 100% of their total Zn in water-soluble form. Crop response to granular (1.7 to 2.4 mm, - 8 + 12 mesh) Zn fertilizers increased with level of water-soluble Zn in several ZnSO4 fertilizers made from spent acids, Zn oxysulfates, and ZnO by-product fertilizers. Corn dry matter production and Zn uptake were significantly lower with fertilizers containing < 40% water-soluble Zn. Crop response to granular mixtures varying in proportion of reagent grade ZnSO4 and ZnO gave similar results in two experiments.

To evaluate if these reports may influence peoples' sun protective behavior, knowledge, and attitudes to the impact of sun protection on vitamin D. Methods Within a population-based survey in Queensland, Australia (5,611 participants, mean age 50.7 years (range 20-75); 48.2% men), agreement with the statement that sun protection may result in not having enough vitamin D as well as factors associated with agreement were assessed. Results Overall, 837 (15.0%) participants agreed that sun protection may result in not having enough vitamin D, 2,163 (38.7%) neither agreed nor disagreed, and 2,591 (46.3%) disagreed with this statement. Factors associated with agreement included older age, darker skin color, and attempt to develop a suntan within the past year. Conclusion These results suggest that future sun protection campaigns may need to address the issue of vitamin D and present ways to achieve sufficient vitamin D levels without increasing sun exposure at least in countries with high UV radiation throughout the year. 3avitamin D 2aAdult 2aAged 2aConfidence Intervals 2aDose-Response Relationship, Radiation 2aEnvironmental Exposurexstatistics & numerical data 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInterviews as Topic 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOdds Ratio 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 2aSkin Neoplasmsxetiologyxprevention & control. 2aSkin Pigmentation 2aSunburnxetiologyxprevention & control. 2aSunlightxadverse effects 2aVitamin D Deficiencyxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 0aSun protection 0aSkin cancer prevention1 aKimlin, Michael 1 aWhiteman, David 1 aAitken, Joanne 1 aNeale, Rachel 0 tCancer causes & control.g2007 Nov., v. 18, no. 9 p.1015-1019dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0957-52437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-007-9042-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20070812b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02777naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245005100182300001800233500001500251520128900266650001901555650002501574650002001599650001001619650000901629650002201638650006901660650001901729650002301748650001101771650001101782650005401793650000901847650001601856650002601872650001701898651003301915653001701948700003301965700002901998773011802027852000902145856008502154930003302239946001102272655001202283IND4395487220221118095755.0070930e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439548722DNAL7 a176828312pmid7 a10.1007/s10552-007-9045-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToh, Sengwee 10aUse of antidepressants and risk of lung cancer  ap. 1055-1064.  a2019-12-05  aObjective To evaluate the effect of antidepressant use on lung cancer risk. Methods We conducted a case-control study nested in a cohort of patients 40-84 year-old in 1995-2004, without a prior diagnosis of cancer using The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database in the UK. Cases comprised 4,336 patients with a first diagnosis of primary lung cancer. A sample of 10,000 controls was frequency-matched to the cases for age, sex, and the calendar year of diagnosis. The index date for exposure definition was one year before the diagnosis for cases and one year before a random date for controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using conditional logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders. Results Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use during the year preceding the index date with treatment duration of at least one year had an OR of 0.59 (95% CI 0.41, 0.86). The corresponding OR was 1.23 (95% CI 0.96, 1.58) for tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Conclusions SSRI use did not increase the lung cancer risk and might be associated with a reduced risk. However, residual confounding might explain the apparent protective effect found for SSRI use, as well as the marginally elevated risk observed among TCA users. 3alung neoplasms 3acase-control studies 3aantidepressants 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAntidepressive Agentsxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aCohort Studies 2aDatabases, Factual 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLung Neoplasmsxchemically inducedxepidemiology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aRetrospective Studies 2aRisk Factors 0aGreat Britainxepidemiology. 0aepidemiology1 aGarcía Rodríguez, Luis A. 1 aHernández-Díaz, Sonia 0 tCancer causes & control.g2007 Dec., v. 18, no. 10 p.1055-1064dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0957-52437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-007-9045-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20070930b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03351naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245008400191300001800275520164300293650001701936650001501953650001001968650000901978650002201987650001902009650002202028650001102050650002502061650000902086650001602095650003302111650003002144650003202174650002402206650001702230650001702247650002102264653002102285653002002306653001602326700001802342700002102360700002302381700002402404700001802428700001902446700002302465700001802488773011702506852000902623856008502632930003302717946001102750655001202761IND4394011520221118095818.0070812e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439401152DNAL7 a176653122pmid7 a10.1007/s10552-007-9043-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrasak, Alexander M. 10aSerum uric acid and risk of cancer mortality in a large prospective male cohort  ap. 1021-1029.  aObjective To examine the prognostic role of serum uric acid (SUA) for cancer mortality in apparently healthy men across a wide age range. Methods Prospective data from a large cohort of 83,683 male Austrian adults with a median follow-up of 13.6 years was analyzed. Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for established risk factors, were calculated to evaluate SUA as a predictive marker for fatal cancer events. Results High SUA (>6.71 mg/dl) was independently associated with increased risk of mortality from all cancers, showing a clear dose-response relationship (p for trend < 0.0001); the adjusted hazard ratio for the highest versus lowest quintile of SUA was 1.41 (1.22-1.62). In subgroup analyses this hazard ratio increased to 1.53 (1.29-1.80) for participants aged <65 years. When considering the time interval between baseline SUA measurement and subsequent death, SUA levels were more predictive for “late deaths”, occurring 10 or more years after screening (HR 1.65 [1.35-2.03], p < 0.0001), in comparison to deaths within 10 years after SUA measurement. In cancer site-specific analyses, SUA was significantly associated with deaths from malignant neoplasms of digestive organs (p = 0.03) and respiratory system and intrathoracic organs (p < 0.0001). Elevated SUA was further independently related to an increased risk of all-cause mortality (p < 0.0001). Conclusions Our results are contrary to the proposed antioxidant, inhibitory effect of SUA against cancer and rather suggest high SUA to be a valuable long-term surrogate parameter, indicative for a life-style at increased risk for the development of cancer. 3aepidemiology 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aCohort Studies 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNeoplasmsxbloodxmortality. 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aProspective Studies 2aRisk Factors 2aTime Factors 2aUric Acidxblood 0aCancer mortality 0aSerum uric acid 0aRisk factor1 aRapp, Kilian 1 aHilbe, Wolfgang 1 aOberaigner, Willi 1 aRuttmann, Elfriede 1 aConcin, Hans 1 aDiem, Günter 1 aPfeiffer, Karl P. 1 aUlmer, Hanno 0 tCancer causes & control.g2007 Nov., v. 18, no. 9 p.1021-1029dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0957-52437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-007-9043-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20070812b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02974naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245009700186300001600283520142100299650002101720650001201741650001201753650002401765650002001789650003501809650001901844650001901863650002501882650001101907650001101918650001401929650001601943650002601959650003101985650003202016650002402048650001702072650002602089653001402115700001902129700002302148700002602171773012102197852000902318856008502327930003302412946001102445655001202456IND4393557920221118095805.0070729e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439355792DNAL7 a174104772pmid7 a10.1007/s10552-007-9001-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmquist, Martin 10aSerum calcium and breast cancer risk: results from a prospective cohort study of 7,847 women  ap. 595-602.  aExperimental and epidemiological studies suggest that calcium-regulating hormones--parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D--may be associated with breast cancer risk. No prospective cohort study has investigated the association between pre-diagnostic calcium levels and subsequent risk of breast cancer. We have examined this in a cohort of 7,847 women where serum calcium levels and established risk factors for breast cancer had been assessed at baseline. During a mean follow-up of 17.8 years, 437 incident breast cancer cases were diagnosed. Incidence of breast cancer was calculated in different quartiles of serum calcium levels and a Cox's proportional hazards analysis was used to obtain corresponding relative risks (RR), with a 95% confidence interval (CI), adjusted for potential confounders. In premenopausal women, serum calcium levels were inversely associated with breast cancer risk in a dose-response manner. The adjusted RR (95% CI) of breast cancer was in the 2nd calcium quartile 0.91 (0.65-1.30), in the 3rd quartile 0.89 (0.60-1.31), and in the 4th quartile 0.56 (0.32-0.98), as compared to the 1st calcium quartile. In postmenopausal overweight women (BMI > 25), breast cancer risk was higher in calcium quartiles 2-4 as compared to the 1st quartile. Our findings may have implications for primary prevention of breast cancer and for the management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism. 3abreast neoplasms 3acalcium 3aobesity 3aparathyroid hormone 2aBody Mass Index 2aBreast Neoplasmsxepidemiology 2aCalciumxblood 2aCohort Studies 2aConfidence Intervals 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMenopause 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxepidemiology 2aParathyroid Hormonexblood 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aProspective Studies 2aRisk Factors 2aVitamin Dxmetabolism 0aVitamin-D1 aManjer, Jonas 1 aBondeson, Lennart 1 aBondeson, Anne-Greth 0 tCancer causes & control.g2007 Aug., v. 18, no. 6 p.595-602dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0957-52437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-007-9001-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20070729b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02755naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245010500183300001600288520113000304650002101434650003501455650001001490650005601500650001101556650001501567650003801582650001301620650001101633650007301644650001501717650003601732650005801768650001701826653000801843653000901851700001801860700001401878700002601892700002501918700002201943700002501965773012101990852000902111856008502120930003302205946001102238655001202249IND4393558220221118095802.0070729e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439355822DNAL7 a173876212pmid7 a10.1007/s10552-007-9004-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCox, David G. 14aThe p53 Arg72Pro and MDM2 -309 polymorphisms and risk of breast cancer in the nurses' health studies  ap. 621-625.  aCandidate gene association studies to detect breast cancer susceptibility loci have yielded few positive associations. Therefore, it is more likely that variants in many genes along related biological pathways combine to influence breast cancer risk. A strong candidate pathway is that of p53-mediated cell-cycle control, DNA repair, and apoptosis. The two major proteins along this pathway are p53 and its negative regulator MDM2. Functional polymorphisms in both genes have been identified. The -309 SNP in MDM2 is associated with increased MDM2 transcription. The Arg72Pro polymorphism of p53 alters the transcription of p53 target genes and modifies the apoptotic potential of cells. Both polymorphisms have been studied with respect to breast cancer risk, with inconclusive results. We have genotyped both polymorphisms in the breast cancer cases and controls nested within the Nurses' Health Study and Nurses' Health Study II. Neither SNP is independently associated with overall breast cancer risk. Some indication of gene-by-gene interaction was observed; however, no consistent direction of interaction was apparent. 3abreast neoplasms 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aAdult 2aBreast Neoplasmsxepidemiologyxetiologyxgenetics. 2aFemale 2aGenes, p53 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aIntracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aOdds Ratio 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2xgeneticsxphysiology. 2aRisk Factors 0ap53 0aMDM21 aDeer, Dwayne 1 aGuo, Qun 1 aTworoger, Shelley S. 1 aHankinson, Susan E. 1 aHunter, David J. 1 aDe Vivo, Immaculata 0 tCancer causes & control.g2007 Aug., v. 18, no. 6 p.621-625dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0957-52437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-007-9004-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070729b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02533naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002100137245013100158300002200289500002400311520108700335650002701422650001301449650001201462650001401474650002101488650001001509650002401519650001801543650002101561651001201582653002401594653001601618700002601634700002101660700002201681700001701703700001801720773018001738852000901918856007701927930003302004945002502037946001302062655001202075IND4447355520221118095753.0110114e20101208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444735552DNAL7 a10.1021/jf10303452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCherif, Aicha O.10aComparison of the Concentrations of Long-Chain Alcohols (Policosanol) in Three Tunisian Peanut Varieties (Arachis hypogaea L.)  ap. 12143–12148.  aIncludes references  aPolicosanol (PC) is a mixture of high molecular weight aliphatic primary alcohols. Literature about the contents and compositions of PC derived from peanut varieties is scarce. Total PC composition and content in whole peanut grain samples from three varieties of peanut (two cultivars, AraC and AraT, and a wild one, AraA) were identified using a gas chromatograph system coupled with a mass spectrophotometer. The results show that, qualitatively, 21 components of peanut aliphatic alcohols were identified (C14−C30). Besides (C18=), the results exhibited a previously unreported mixture of PC compositions in the peanuts: the unsaturated PC (UPC), which are (C20=), (C21=), (C22=), and (C24=). The main components of total PC in Tunisian peanut kernels are docosanol (C22), (Z)-octadec-9-en-1-ol (C18=), hexadecanol (C16), and octadecanol (C18). Quantitatively, the total PC content of the whole peanut samples varied from 11.18 to 54.19 mg/100 g of oil and was higher than those of beeswax and whole sugar cane, which are sources of dietary supplements containing policosanol. 3achemical concentration 3aalcohols 3apeanuts 3acultivars 3aArachis hypogaea 3aseeds 3adietary supplements 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3aTunisia 0along-chain alcohols 0apolicosanol1 aBen Messaouda, Mhamed1 aKaabi, Belhassen1 aBoukhchina, Sadok1 aPepe, Claude1 aKallel, Habib0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Dec. 8, v. 58, no. 23 p.12143–12148-12143–12148dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf10303453Available from publisher's Web site  a20110512b20110603c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/04/29  aOther US 7aarticle02868naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245012200185300001600307520141200323650001201735650002001747650001701767650001001784650001801794650000901812650002201821650002001843650001801863650001101881650001101892650003001903650001601933650003801949651004501987653001402032653000902046700002502055700002402080700002202104773012202126852000902248856008502257930003302342946001102375655001202386IND4392874220221118095750.0070702e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439287422DNAL7 a175690152pmid7 a10.1007/s10552-007-9019-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCohen, Sarah S. 10aObesity and recent mammography use among black and white women in the Southern Community Cohort Study (United States)  ap. 765-773.  aObjective To examine the relationship between obesity and mammography use in a large population of black and white women. Methods Baseline data from 18,756 black and 6,304 white women enrolled in the Southern Community Cohort Study were used to examine the association between body mass index categories (healthy weight: 18.5-24.9 kg/m², overweight: 25-29.9 kg/m², and obesity classes I: 30-34.9 kg/m², II: 35-39.9 kg/m², and III: 40+ kg/m²) and mammogram use in the past two years. Cross-sectional analyses were conducted using logistic regression controlling for socioeconomic measures, medical conditions, insurance coverage, and lifestyle factors. Results Among white women, obesity class III was associated with a reduced likelihood of recent mammography compared to healthy weight women (OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.56-0.87) that appeared unrelated to income and insurance coverage. A deterring effect of obesity was not evident among black women; instead, overweight and obesity were associated with small elevations in mammography use compared to healthy weight. Conclusions In light of rising obesity rates and known associations between obesity and breast cancer risk and prognosis, a deterring effect of extreme obesity on mammography screening for white women is a concern that should be addressed by screening programs and by further directed research into the factors underlying this association. 3aobesity 3abody mass index 3aepidemiology 2aAdult 2aBlack People. 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aBody Mass Index 2aWhite People. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMammographyxutilization. 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxepidemiologyxethnology. 0aSoutheastern United Statesxepidemiology 0aMammogram 0aRace1 aSignorello, Lisa B. 1 aGammon, Marilie D. 1 aBlot, William J. 0 tCancer causes & control.g2007 Sept., v. 18, no. 7 p.765-773dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0957-52437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-007-9019-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20070702b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02773naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001900137245011400156300002200270500002400292500001500316520122400331650002101555650002201576650001701598650002101615650001401636650001901650650002701669650001401696650001401710650001801724650002101742650003001763653002501793653001901818653003001837700001601867700001901883700001801902700002201920773018001942852000902122856007702131930003302208945002502241946001302266655001202279IND4447355020221118095933.0110114e20101208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444735502DNAL7 a10.1021/jf103576r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jian-Nan10aIn Vitro Antitumor and Immunomodulatory Effects of the Protein PCP-3A from Mushroom Pleurotus citrinopileatus  ap. 12117–12122.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA nonlectin glycoprotein (PCP-3A) newly isolated from the fruit body of edible golden oyster mushroom Pleurotus citrinopileatus has been shown to be growth inhibitory against human myeloid leukemic U937 cells in a previous report. There is a well-recognized relation between antitumor activity and immunomodulation. The immunomodulatory activity of PCP-3A was therefore assessed in the present study. Human mononuclear cells (MNC) and the CD4+ T lymphocytes isolated from them were stimulated separately with PCP-3A for various durations and then filtered to obtain the conditioned media (CM). The conditioned medium from MNC (MNC-CM) was proved effective in inhibiting the growth of U937 cells. Increased secretion of cytokines TNF-α, IL-2, and IFN-γ from the stimulated MNC and CD4+ T cells was found in CM. The antibody neutralization test of MNC-CM revealed that the growth inhibition on leukemic U937 cells was related to the elevation in cytokine concentration. We propose that PCP-3A stimulated human MNC to secrete cytokines TNF-α, IL-2, and IFN-γ, which subsequently inhibit the growth of U937 cells, and that PCP-3A may be a possible material for developing into an antileukemia ingredient in health food. 3ahuman cell lines 3avegetable protein 3acell culture 3aimmunomodulators 3acytokines 3aplant extracts 3aamino acid composition 3amushrooms 3aPleurotus 3aglycoproteins 3ain vitro studies 3aanticarcinogenic activity 0abioactive properties 0aPCP-3A protein 0aPleurotus citrinopileatus1 aMa, Chia-Yu1 aTsai, Pei-Feng1 aWang, Yuh-Tai1 aWu, James Swi-Bea0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Dec. 8, v. 58, no. 23 p.12117–12122-12117–12122dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf103576r3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110512b20110603c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/04/29  aOther US 7aarticle03453naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245006100187300001600248500001500264520184800279650002502127650002002152650001202172650001002184650000902194650002002203650002502223650002502248650001702273650001102290650001102301650002402312650005102336650000902387650001602396650004202412650001502454650001702469651002802486653001302514700001602527700002302543700002302566700002202589700002902611773012102640852000902761856008502770930003302855946001102888655001202899IND4393558820221118100033.0070729e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439355882DNAL7 a174840692pmid7 a10.1007/s10552-007-9013-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiu, Brian C.-H. 10aObesity and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (United States)  ap. 677-685.  a2019-12-05  aObjective Few studies have explored the potential association between body mass index (BMI) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) according to histologic subtypes, or have evaluated BMI at different periods in the subject's life, and the results of these studies have been inconsistent. Subjects A population-based, case-control study of 387 patients with NHL and 535 controls conducted in Nebraska between 1999 and 2002. Methods Information on usual adult weight, weight at the ages 20-29, 40-49, and 60-69 years, height, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors was collected by telephone interview. A self-administered semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to collect dietary intake. Risk was estimated by odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for age, total energy intake, physical activity, and other confounding factors. Results Higher adult BMI was associated with risk of NHL (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 0.9-2.0) comparing the obese group (BMI >= 30.0 kg/m²) with the normal weight group (BMI = 18.5-24.9 kg/m²). The risk was higher for those who were class 2 obese (BMI >= 35.0 kg/m², OR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.0-2.9). The positive association was similar among men and women. An excess risk of NHL was associated with high BMI at ages 40-49 years (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.0-2.5), and to a lesser extent, at ages 20-29 years (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 0.8-2.5). Obesity at ages 40-49 years was also associated with a higher risk of small lymphocytic lymphoma (OR = 4.5; 95% CI = 1.5-13.3), diffuse large B-cell NHL (OR = 1.8; 95% CI = 0.9-3.9) and follicular NHL (OR = 1.8; 95% CI = 0.9-3.5). Conclusion Obesity is associated with risk of NHL overall. Obesity at ages 40-49 years is also associated with a higher risk of NHL overall, and particularly small lymphocytic, follicular, and diffuse large B-cell NHL. 3anon-Hodgkin lymphoma 3abody mass index 3aobesity 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBody Mass Index 2aCase-Control Studies 2aConfidence Intervals 2aDiet Records 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInterviews as Topic 2aLymphoma, Non-Hodgkinxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxcomplicationsxepidemiology. 2aOdds Ratio 2aRisk Factors 0aNebraskaxepidemiology. 0alymphoma1 aSoni, Lori 1 aGapstur, Susan M. 1 aFought, Angela J. 1 aEvens, Andrew M. 1 aWeisenburger, Dennis D. 0 tCancer causes & control.g2007 Aug., v. 18, no. 6 p.677-685dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0957-52437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-007-9013-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20070729b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02431naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245013900153300002200292500002400314520084700338650002601185650001401211650001501225650002301240650002601263650001701289650001701306650000801323650000901331650001801340650002501358650001601383650001801399650002101417650001701438653003501455700002001490700001901510700002001529700001901549700002001568773018001588852000901768856007701777930003301854945002501887946001301912655001201925IND4447354620221118095948.0110114e20101208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444735462DNAL7 a10.1021/jf102784t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Hee Uk10aQuantitative Detection of Glyphosate by Simultaneous Analysis of UV Spectroscopy and Fluorescence Using DNA-Labeled Gold Nanoparticles  ap. 12096–12100.  aIncludes references  aA sandwich-type immunosensor composed of antigen−double target/probe DNA-coated gold nanoparticles (NPs) was developed for the measurement of fluorescence intensity and quantitative analysis of single-stranded DNA based on the concentration of free glyphosate.

In contrast, consumption of cream soups (P-trend = 0.01), jello (P-trend = 0.01), ice cream (P-trend = 0.01), and pudding (P-trend < 0.001) were positively associated with multiple myeloma. Furthermore, there was a suggestion that carbohydrate intake may be positively associated, whereas vitamin D and calcium intake may be inversely associated, with multiple myeloma risk. Despite very limited data on dietary factors in relation to multiple myeloma, the findings from this study concur with previously published studies, suggesting an inverse association for consumption of fish, cruciferous vegetables and green vegetables, and a positive association for some dairy products. 3amyeloma 3adiet 3arisk factors 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aCalciumxadministration & dosage 2aCohort Studies 2aDietxadverse effects 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aMiddle Aged 2aMultiple Myelomaxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRegistries 2aRisk Factors 2aVitamin Dxadministration & dosage 0aConnecticutxepidemiology. 0aCase-control1 aBaris, Dalsu 1 aZahm, Shelia Hoar 1 aZheng, Tongzhang 1 aCross, Amanda J. 0 tCancer causes & control.g2007 Dec., v. 18, no. 10 p.1065-1076dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0957-52437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-007-9047-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070930b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03077naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245011400183300001600297520140200313650002501715650001901740650002501759650002301784650001901807650003901826650002601865650001101891650001901902650001901921650001101940650003501951650001401986650002302000650001602023650002402039650003202063650002002095650001702115651003302132653001802165700002602183700002502209700002302234700001902257773012102276852000902397856008502406930003302491946001102524655001202535IND4393559720221118100154.0070729e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439355972DNAL7 a176050832pmid7 a10.1007/s10552-007-9030-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrayer, Lori 10aDietary carbohydrate, glycemic index, and glycemic load and the risk of colorectal cancer in the BCDDP cohort  ap. 853-863.  aBackground There is considerable support for associations between insulin and IGF-I levels and colorectal cancer. Diet may relate to colorectal cancer through this mechanism, for example, diets high in glycemic index, glycemic load and/or carbohydrate are hypothesized to increase insulin load and the risk of insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia. Case-control studies support this hypothesis, but prospective cohorts have had mixed results. Methods In the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project (BCDDP) follow-up cohort of 45,561 women, we used Cox proportional hazards regression to assess the distribution of 490 incident cases of colorectal cancer ascertained during 8.5 years of follow-up across quintiles of carbohydrate intake, glycemic index, and glycemic load. We also stratified by combined BMI and physical activity levels. Results We found reductions in colorectal cancer risk for diets high in carbohydrate (RR for Q5 vs. Q1 = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.50-0.97) and glycemic index (0.75, 95% CI: 0.56-1.00), and no significant association for glycemic load (0.91, 95% CI: 0.70-1.20). Inverse associations were weakest in normal weight active persons. The inverse association for glycemic index was strongest for the portion from dairy food. Conclusions These results do not support an association between diets high in carbohydrate, glycemic index or glycemic load and colorectal cancer. 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aglycemic index 3adietary carbohydrate 3ainsulin resistance 2aCohort Studies 2aColorectal Neoplasmsxepidemiology 2aDietary Carbohydrates 2aFemale 2aGlycemic Index 2aHealth Surveys 2aHumans 2aHyperinsulinismxcomplications 2aIncidence 2aInsulin Resistance 2aMiddle Aged 2aProspective Studies 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Assessment 2aRisk Factors 0aUnited Statesxepidemiology. 0aGlycemic load1 aJacobs, David R.

  1 aDe Beer, M.14aThe Effect of Different Feed Restriction Programs and Dietary L-Carnitine Supplementation on Reproductive Performance, Efficiency, Frame Size and Uniformity in Broiler Breeder Hens  ap. 409-425.  aTwo experiments were conducted to determine the effect of Everyday (ED) or Skip-a-day (SK) feed restriction programs and L-carnitine supplementation on breeder reproductive performance. In Experiment 1 a 2 x 2 factorial design was used to compare feeding regimens (ED vs. SK) and L-carnitine supplementation (0 vs 50 mg /kg). L-carnitine supplementation began at day 1 and lasted throughout the 45 week experimental period. SK feeding programs were implemented from 28 days of age to 5% production. Feed allocation was adjusted to ensure equal BW between groups. At 21 weeks, 60 pullets from each treatment combination were housed individually. Feeding ED improved the feed conversion ratio by 0.24 units for 21 week pullets, resulted in 3 days earlier attainment of Sexual Maturity (SM), produced 4.6 more total eggs and 5.0 more settable eggs than SK fed pullets. Uniformity was less for ED fed pullets (2.07 higher CV). Egg size was increased by 1.16g dietary L-carnitine. Body composition was not affected by either feeding regimen or L-carnitine. In Experiment 2, the same effects were tested but a low density grower diet was used from 4-18 weeks. L-carnitine was supplemented from day 1 and SK programs began at day 28 and extended to 5% production. Feed allocation was adjusted to maintain equal BW and 80 pullets per treatment were individually housed at 21 weeks. L-carnitine and ED feeding through 21 wk improved the FCR by 0.06 and 0.12 units, respectively. Feeding ED resulted in 5.8 days earlier SM, 4.7 more total eggs and 4.4 more settable eggs than SK. Uniformity was not affected by feeding regimen or L-carnitine. Carcass fat was reduced and carcass ash was increased by L-carnitine supplementation at 22 weeks. It was concluded that ED fed breeders are more productive than SK fed breeders primarily because of earlier SM. ED fed breeders are more efficient than SK breeder pullets because there are less nutrients wasted for tissue replenishment. Feeding breeder pullets ED with low energy density diets helped eliminate uniformity differences for pullets fed ED and SK feeding regimens. Breeders fed L-carnitine during 21 wk rearing period improved the FCR by 0.06 units for both Experiment 1 and 2. While, the effect of L-carnitine on total egg production was not significant, L-carnitine supplemented birds produced 3.9 and 2.7 more total eggs at 45 weeks than non-supplemented birds in Experiments 1 and 2 respectively. The consistency of the results and the associated p-values (p = 0.12; p = 0.13) for total egg production in the two experiments suggest that L-carnitine may have some beneficial effects on egg production. Breeders fed carnitine also showed significant increases in EW in experiment 1 and near significant (p = 0.13) increases in EW for the second experiment. Carnitine was unable to attenuate the negative effects of SK feeding associated with the lengthy fasting periods. 3abroiler breeders 3ahens 3arestricted feeding 3ahen feeding 3afeed supplements 3acarnitine 3afecundity 3adosage 3adose response 3abody weight 3afeed conversion 3afeed rations 3aegg hatchability 3aage at first egg 3acarcass quality 3aash content 3acarcass composition 3aegg weight1 aCoon, C.N.0 tInternational journal of poultry science.g2009, v. 8, no. 5 p.409-425x1682-83567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.pjbs.org/ijps/back.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/01  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02250naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245010700159300001600266520094000282650001401222650001101236650001901247650001101266650002101277650001601298650002301314650001801337650002001355650002001375650002001395650001401415650001801429700001201447700001601459700001901475700001801494773009201512852000901604856007501613930003301688945002501721946001101746990002301757655001201780IND4427645620221118095936.0091023s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442764562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBolu, S.A.10aEffect of Graded Level of Alphamune G on Performance, Blood Chemistry and Histology of Cockerel Chicks  ap. 397-400.  aA study was conducted to determine the response of day-old cockerel chicks to graded levels of Alphamune G (0.00, 0.04, 0.05 and 0.06%). The experiment which was conducted for 8 weeks employed a completely randomized design. Feed intake and nutrient retention were not significantly influenced (p>0.05) by dietary inclusion levels of Alphamune G. However, weight gain and feed to gain ratio were significantly improved (p<0.05) for cockerel chicks fed 0.06% inclusion level when compared with the control. The values were 7.78 and 4.58 g/bird/week, respectively. Haematology and serum indices did not show any significant effect as a result of the graded levels of dietary Alphamune G. Histological characteristics revealed slight morphological changes in specific organs of birds fed Alphamune G supplemented diet vis-a viz the control diet. Inclusion of Alphamune G at 0.06% in the diets of cockerel chicks gave the best performance. 3acockerels 3achicks 3afeed additives 3adosage 3aherbal medicines 3afeed intake 3anutrient retention 3astarter diets 3aliveweight gain 3afeed conversion 3ablood chemistry 3ahistology 3aanimal organs1 aOjo, V.1 aOluyemi, O.1 aBabawale, O.I.1 aAwodele, O.A.0 tInternational journal of poultry science.g2009, v. 8, no. 4 p.397-400x1682-83567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.pjbs.org/ijps/back.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/02  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02826naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245016600171300001600337500002400353520156600377650004101943650001601984650002502000650001402025650001002039650001402049650002602063650002602089650001002115650001902125650001302144650000902157650001002166650000902176650001002185700002502195700002102220773009902241852000902340856005502349655001202404IND4450179220221118095628.0110304e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445017922DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3059.2010.02375.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcMillan, V.E.10aEvidence that wheat cultivars differ in their ability to build up inoculum of the take-all fungus, Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, under a first wheat crop  ap. 200-206.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of wheat cultivar on the build-up of take-all inoculum during a first wheat crop was measured after harvest using a soil core bioassay in field experiments over five growing seasons (2003-2008). Cultivar differences in individual years were explored by analysis of variance and a cross-season Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) variance components analysis was used to compare differences in those cultivars present in all years. Differences between cultivars in the build-up of inoculum were close to or at significance in two of the five trial years (2004 P < 0·05; 2006 P < 0·07), and current commercially listed cultivars were represented at both extremes of the range. In 2007 and 2008, when environmental conditions were most favourable for inoculum build-up, differences were not significant (P < 0·3). In 2005 the presence of Phialophora spp. at the trial site restricted the build-up of take-all inoculum under all cultivars. The cross season REML variance components analysis detected significant differences (range: 3·4-47·8% roots infected in the soil core bioassay; P < 0·01) between the nine cultivars present in all years (excluding 2005). This is the first evidence of relatively consistent differences between hexaploid wheat cultivars in their interactions with the take-all fungus, and this could give an indication of those cultivars that could be grown as a first wheat crop, in order to reduce the risk of damaging take-all in a second wheat crop. This phenomenon has been named the take-all inoculum build-up (TAB) trait. 3aGaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici 3aPhialophora 3aanalysis of variance 3abioassays 3acrops 3acultivars 3aenvironmental factors 3afield experimentation 3afungi 3agrowing season 3ainoculum 3arisk 3aroots 3asoil 3awheat1 aHammond-Kosack, K.E.1 aGutteridge, R.J.0 tPlant pathology.g2011 Apr., v. 60, no. 2 p.200-206dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0032-08627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2010.02375.x 7aarticle02089naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001300137245011100150300002200261500002400283520072400307650001401031650002801045650001701073650002101090650002401111650003701135650001701172653002501189653002301214700001601237700001801253700002101271700001901292700001901311773018001330852000901510856007701519930003301596945002501629946001301654655001201667IND4447358620221118095637.0110114e20101208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444735862DNAL7 a10.1021/jf102842r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Qi10aSynthesis and Insecticidal Activities of Novel Anthranilic Diamides Containing Modified N-Pyridylpyrazoles  ap. 12327–12336.  aIncludes references  aIn order to look for novel insecticides targeting the ryanodine receptor, four new series of anthranilic diamides containing modified N-pyridylpyrazoles were designed and synthesized.

In the first stage, cellulose and ethanol were recovered by physical separation, multi-enzymes hydrolysis with yeast fermentation, and in the second stage diosgenin was separated using ethanol-modified supercritical carbon dioxide extraction. The new approach could not only recover 95% of diosgenin production, 95% of ethanol and 75% of cellulose, but also efficiently reduce 88% of COD in wastewater compared with the conventional method, which only extract diosgenin with discharging 80,000mg/l of COD into public sewers. The research indicates that the proposed system could be a clean and technological-efficient alternative to conventional processing of D. zingiberensis C.H. Wright tubers in industry. 3acellulose 3achemical oxygen demand 3adiosgenin 3aethanol 3afermentation 3ahydrolysis 3aindustry 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3atubers 3awastewater 3ayeasts 2aCellulosexchemistry 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDiosgeninxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aEcology 2aEthanolxchemistry 2aOxygenxanalysis 2aPlantsxmetabolism 2aWaterxchemistry1 aZhao, Huazhang1 aNi, Jinren1 aZuo, Hang1 aQiu, Linli1 aLi, Hua1 aLi, Hui0 tBioresource technology.g2008 Oct., v. 99, no. 15 p.7407-7411dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2008.01.015 7aarticle02939naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002000137245010200157300002200259500002400281520145500305650000901760650000901769650002101778650002701799650002101826650002001847650001701867650001601884650001601900650001801916650002101934650002301955650002601978650002302004653002102027700001602048700002202064700001702086700001702103773018002120852000902300856007702309930003302386945002502419946001302444655001202457IND4447357620221118095514.0110114e20101208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444735762DNAL7 a10.1021/jf103039k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yueqiang10aIron and Zinc Concentrations in Grain and Flour of Winter Wheat As Affected by Foliar Application  ap. 12268–12274.  aIncludes references  aHuman deficiencies of iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) are worldwide problems. Biofortification of wheat could reduce Fe and Zn deficiencies in societies that depend on wheat consumption. This study investigated the effects of foliar application of Fe with or without Zn on the concentrations of Fe and Zn in grain and especially in flour of three wheat cultivars. On average, grain Fe concentration was increased significantly from 29.5 mg kg−1 in the control to 37.8, 35.9, or 34.9 mg kg−1 by application of FeSO4, ferric citrate plus ZnSO4, or ferric citrate, respectively. As expected, grain Zn concentration was increased from 29.0 mg kg−1 in the control to 45.7 or 39.6 mg kg−1 by application of ferric citrate plus ZnSO4 or a complex of micronutrients. Although the Fe and Zn concentrations in flour were inherently lower than in bran and shorts made by experimental mill, the concentrations in flour were simultaneously increased from 10.4 to 12.4 mg kg−1 for Fe and from 11.8 to 17.4 mg kg−1 for Zn by application of ferric citrate plus ZnSO4. Importantly, Fe was peripherally localized within grain fractions and strictly limited to transport to endosperm, making it more difficult to increase the quantity of Fe in flour products by foliar Fe application, but the situation with Zn is promising because Zn is more readily transported to the endosperm than Fe. The current study increases the understanding of agronomic biofortification. 3airon 3azinc 3adietary minerals 3achemical concentration 3anutrient content 3anutritive value 3awinter wheat 3agrain foods 3awheat flour 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3anutrient solutions 3anutrient availability 3afoliar application 0abiofortification1 aShi, Rongli1 aRezaul, Karim Md.1 aZhang, Fusuo1 aZou, Chunqin0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Dec. 8, v. 58, no. 23 p.12268–12274-12268–12274dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf103039k3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110512b20110603c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/04/29  aOther US 7aarticle02865naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002200137245018500159300002200344500002400366520110100390650001501491650001701506650001901523650001801542650002101560650001301581650001501594650003901609650001501648650001901663650002601682650001301708650001801721650002201739650002601761650001701787653003101804653005101835700002201886700002001908700002801928700002301956700001901979773018001998852000902178856007702187930003302264945002502297946001302322655001202335IND4447358220221118095509.0110114e20101208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444735822DNAL7 a10.1021/jf103009r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGebriel, Mohammed10aCod (Gadus morhua) Muscle Proteome Cataloging Using 1D-PAGE Protein Separation, Nano-Liquid Chromatography Peptide Fractionation, and Linear Trap Quadrupole (LTQ) Mass Spectrometry  ap. 12307–12312.  aIncludes references  aBecause Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) has high economic value and its protein-rich muscle tissue is a food source, an increased understanding of the effects and consequences of environmental, nutritional, biological, and industrial factors on meat quality is necessary. To gain insight into cod muscle tissue protein composition, a large-scale proteomics approach has been used. One-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, nanoflow liquid chromatography peptide separation, and linear trap quadrupole mass spectrometry were used to identify 4804 peptides, which retrieved 9113 cod expressed sequence tags (ESTs), which in turn were mapped to 446 unique proteins. The same data set identified 3924 proteins from the zebrafish protein database, which highlights the complementary value of the two approaches. The generated data sets will act as a foundation for studies related to physiological status assessment of cod under different environmental conditions, screening for diseases, and biomarker identification for assessment of fish quality during industrial processing and preservation. 3acod (fish) 3aGadus morhua 3amuscle protein 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aseparation 3ananotechnology 3aliquid chromatography 3apeptides 3afractionation 3amass spectrometry 3aequipment performance 3afood quality 0a1D-PAGE protein separation 0alinear trap quadrupole (LTQ) mass spectrometry1 aUleberg, Kai-Erik1 aLarssen, Eivind1 aBjørnstad, Anne Hjelle1 aSivertsvik, Morten1 aMøller, S.

Each of the five steps in the sequence was established by feeds of 17-(13)C,(3)H-labeled kauranoids to cubes from the cortex of elongating internodes, to homogenates from the cortex of elongating internodes, and/or to homogenates from dark-grown seedlings. The (13)C-metabolites were identified by Kovats retention indices (KRI) and full-scan capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Five substrates and the final product in this sequence were shown to be native by the isotopic dilution of 17-(13)C,(3)H-labeled substrates added as internal standards to extracts obtained from elongating internodes. Evidence for the isotopic dilution was obtained by KRI and full-scan capillary GC-MS. Thus, we document the presence in young maize shoots of the metabolic steps, ent-kaurene leads to ent-kaurenol leads to ent-kaurenal leads to ent-kaurenoic acid leads to ent-7 beta-hydroxykaurenoic acid leads to gibberellin A12-aldehyde. 3achemical composition 3aZea mays 3abiosynthesis 3aquantitative analysis 3aradiolabeling 3abiochemical pathways 3agibberellins 3aaldehydes 3ametabolites 3ashoots 0ametabolism 0akaurene1 aYamane, H.1 aSpray, C.R.1 aGaskin, P.1 aMacMillan, J.1 aPhinney, B.O.0 tPlant physiology.g1992 Feb., v. 98, no. 2 p.602-610x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02359naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001500169245011300184300001800297500002400315520087800339650003001217650001901247650001301266650002501279650001401304650001101318650003201329650001901361650001201380650001301392650002401405650000701429650001801436650001701454650002301471650004201494650002201536650001701558650002401575650002501599650003101624700001801655700002001673773009801693852000901791856005301800655001201853IND4409058620221118095748.0080815e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440905862DNAL7 a184856982pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2008.03.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJo, Ji Hye14aThe effects of pH on carbon material and energy balances in hydrogen-producing Clostridium tyrobutyricum JM1  ap. 8485-8491.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of pH on hydrogen fermentation of glucose by newly isolated H₂-producing bacterium Clostridium tyrobutyricum JM1 were investigated in batch cultivations.

The most probable metabolic pathways of C. tyrobutyricum JM1 were determined through an accurate analysis of stoichiometry and the consistency of the experimental data, checked by high carbon recovery. The carbon material and energy balances were adequately applied to estimate the carbon-flow distribution.

  1 aAyuk, E.A.10aGrowth and Haematological Response of Broiler Chicks Fed Graded Levels of Sweet Potato (Ipomoea batata) Meal as Replacement for Maize  ap. 485-488.  aThe study was conducted to find out the performance and haematological response of broiler birds fed different levels of sweet potato meal (SPM). The levels of sweet potato meal in the different treatment rations were 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50%, respectively. There was a curvilinear decline in growth rate (from 27.9 to 23.3 g/day) as the maize was replaced by sweet potato root meal with a pronounced reduction in performance overall of 17% when all the maize was replaced by sweet potato meal. All haematological parameters assessed only showed minor numerical (P>0.05) differences, falling within the ranges stated in literature. It is concluded that sweet potato root meal can replace maize meal in the diet of broilers over the weight range 50 to 1400 g, with only a slight reduction in growth rate (17% with complete substitution of maize), which may be compensated by the lower cost of the sweet potato meal. The substitution also did not have any deleterious effect on haematological and by extension, the health status of the birds. 3abroiler chickens 3abroiler feeding 3achicks 3asweet potatoes 3afeed rations 3acorn meal 3aanimal growth 3ablood chemistry 3acost analysis 3aanimal health1 aEssien, A.0 tInternational journal of poultry science.g2009, v. 8, no. 5 p.485-488x1682-83567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.pjbs.org/ijps/back.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/01  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03093naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002300144245007400167300001600241520159900257650002101856650002301877650001201900650002501912650002201937650001801959650002201977650001801999650001902017650000902036650002602045650001202071650001402083650001002097650001902107650001402126650002202140650002002162650001102182651001202193653001002205700002102215700001302236700002202249773009202271852000902363856007502372930003302447945002502480946001102505990002302516655001202539IND4427648620221118095752.0091023s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442764862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aOvwigho, Bishop O.10aComparison of Constraints to Poultry Producers in Delta State Nigeria  ap. 480-484.  aThe study was an inter-disciplinary one designed to investigate the constraints relevant to different poultry production systems. The sample size was 241 poultry farmers made up of extensive (210), semi-intensive (5) and intensive (26). A four-point rating scale was used to measure the constraints. Mean, Analysis of variance and correlation matrix were used in data analysis. The constraints faced by the extensive poultry farmers were inability to diagnose sick birds (M = 3.45), lack of market for eggs (M = 2.52), egg cracking (M = 2.98), lack of finance (M = 3.44) and loss of birds/eggs to thieves, predators and hazards (M = 3.17). The constraints faced by semi-intensive poultry producers were inability to diagnose sick birds (M = 4.00), lack of feeds (M = 3.00), transportation difficulties(M = 2.80), loss of birds and eggs to predators, thieves and hazards(M = 2.60), lack of finance(M = 3.80) and egg cracking (M = 3.40). The constraints to intensive poultry producers were mortality of adult bids (M = 2.85), diseases out-break (M = 2.58), lack of feeds (M = 2.88), transportation difficulties (M = 3.23), lack of finance (M = 2.65.), feather pecking/cannibalism (M = 3.00) and difficulties in sourcing for day-old chicks (M = 2.65). Lack of finance was a common constraint in the three systems of poultry production. There was a significant difference (p<0.05) in the responses of the extensive, semi-intensive and intensive poultry farmers to the constraints facing poultry production in the study area. Adequate finance is needed to boost poultry production in the study area. 3abroiler chickens 3apoultry production 3afarmers 3afree range husbandry 3aintensive farming 3aanimal health 3adisease diagnosis 3amarket access 3afood marketing 3aeggs 3aprocessing technology 3afinance 3apredation 3afeeds 3afood transport 3amortality 3adisease outbreaks 3afeather pecking 3achicks 3aNigeria 0atheft1 aMmereole, F.U.C.1 aUdeh, I.1 aAkporhuarho, P.O.0 tInternational journal of poultry science.g2009, v. 8, no. 5 p.480-484x1682-83567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.pjbs.org/ijps/back.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/01  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01677naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245007500131300001400206520076500220650001300985650001200998650001301010650001301023650001101036650002301047650002401070653003301094700001901127700001401146700002301160773007801183852000901261930003301270945001301303946001101316655001201327IND2035544820221118100236.0931026s1993    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203554482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiranoudis, C.T.10aEquilibrium moisture content and heat of desorption of some vegetables  ap. 55-74.  aThe equilibrium moisture content of potato, carrot, tomato, green pepper and onion was determined within the range of 10 to 90% water activity at three different temperatures (30, 45 and 60 degrees C), using the standard static gravimetric method developed by the European Cooperation Project COST 90.

In this study, maximum-likelihood and population genetics-based methods were used to investigate the population structure, genetic diversity, and sources of genetic variation in field isolates of Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) from peanut in North Carolina and Virginia. Selected regions of the nucleocapsid, movement, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes were amplified and sequenced to identify haplotypes and infer genetic relationships between isolates of TSWV with heuristic methods. The haplotype structure of each locus consisted of 1 or 2 predominant haplotypes and >100 haplotypes represented by a single isolate. No specific haplotypes were associated with geographic area, peanut cultivar, or year of isolation. The population was panmictic at the regional level and high levels of genetic diversity were observed among isolates. There was evidence for positive selection on single amino acids in each gene on a background of predominant purifying selection acting upon each locus. The results of compatibility analyses and the persistence of specific gene sequences in isolates collected over three field seasons suggest that recombination was occurring in the population. Estimates of the population mutation rate suggest that mutation has had a significant effect on the shaping of this population and, together with purifying selection, these forces have been the predominant evolutionary forces influencing the TSWV population in peanut in North Carolina and Virginia. 3aplant viruses 3apeanuts 3aplant diseases and disorders 3ahaplotypes 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aArachis hypogaea 3apopulation structure 3aTomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus 3asequence analysis 3aevolution 3astrain differences 3aamino acid sequences 3amicrobial genetics 3aloci 3aepidemiology 3ageographical variation 3apopulation genetics 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic variation 3aVirginia 3aNorth Carolina 0amolecular sequence data 0aTomato spotted wilt virus1 aMoyer, J.W.1 aParks, E.J.1 aCarbone, I.1 aCubeta, M.A.0 tPhytopathology.g2011 Jan., v. 101, no. 1 p.147-153dAmerican Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-01-10-00353Available from publisher's Web site  a20110416b20110507c00000000  aINDd2CTe2011/03/04  aOther US 7aarticle02132naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245006100146300001600207520096300223650002401186650001601210650002001226650001201246650002101258650005101279650004601330650003301376650003301409650001601442650002301458650002901481650000901510653001601519653002201535700002101557773006601578852000901644930003301653945001301686946001101699655001201710IND2180585520221118100208.0981021e199706  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218058552DNAL7 a92180942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimpson, S.J.10aGeometric analysis of macronutrient selection in the rat  ap. 201-213.  aA conceptual framework is introduced which has been derived from work on insects. The scheme is intended to integrate studies of diet selection, regulation of amounts eaten, nutrient utilization, body composition and animal performance. Aspects of the framework are illustrated with published data on macronutrient selection in the rat. An animal is viewed as moving through a multidimensional nutrient space, which is bounded by axes representing each required nutrient and within which lie optimal points of intake and nutrient allocation ("targets"). The aim is first to estimate the location of these functional optima experimentally, and then to interpret the responses of animals which are constrained from reaching them ("decisions of best compromise"). The framework can then be used to interpret data from animals reared under differing environmental conditions and to compare animals of differing developmental stage, genotype or nutritional state. 3amathematical models 3afood intake 3anutrient intake 2aAnimals 2aBody Composition 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aFood Preferencesxphysiology 2aHomeostasis 2aNonlinear Dynamics 2aNutritional Requirements 2aRats 0arat feeding 0aconceptual scheme1 aRaubenheimer, D.0 tAppetite.g1997 June, v. 28, no. 3 p.201-213x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03084naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002500144245010500169300001600274500002400290500001500314520149000329650001101819650002501830650003001855650002701885650002001912650002001932650001501952650001901967650000901986650002701995650001302022650002002035650002502055650002102080650002502101651001802126651001002144651002102154651001202175653002502187653001602212653002202228700001902250773010902269852000902378856008402387930003302471945002502504946001302529655001202542IND4448668620221118100203.0110201e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444866862DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-05-10-01372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeresford, Robert M.10aIdentification of Regional Climatic Conditions Favorable for Development of European Canker of Apple  ap. 135-146.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMonths of the year with high risk of European canker (Neonectria galligena) development in areas of the United States, Chile, England, and Northern Ireland were determined from published data. Moving-window analysis of long-term climatic data was used to classify disease risk in these areas in relation to rainfall and temperature conditions using the degree of agreement statistic. Greatest agreement occurred when it both rained on >30% of days/month and there was an average of >8 h/day with temperature of 11 to 16°C. When these thresholds were applied in eight validation areas in New Zealand, Australia, the United States, The Netherlands, and Denmark, areas with reported higher risk of disease tended to be areas where the thresholds were exceeded more often and by greater amounts. Areas at higher latitudes (>52°) with frequent summer rainfall appeared to be most prone to European canker, including the fruit rot phase of the disease, probably because summer temperatures were more favorable than at lower latitudes. The climatic thresholds derived for European canker could be useful for studies of disease establishment risk, surveillance, eradication, climate change impact assessment, and, possibly, for disease risk forecasting. The methods used in this study allowed conditions favorable for disease development to be identified even though quantitative regional disease data were lacking, and they could be useful for similar geoclimatic studies of other diseases. 3aapples 3aNeonectria ditissima 3afungal diseases of plants 3ageographical variation 3aair temperature 3arisk assessment 3aplant rots 3aclimate change 3arain 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3alatitude 3aMalus domestica 3aenvironmental impact 3aclimatic factors 3adisease surveillance 3aUnited States 3aChile 3aNorthern Ireland 3aEngland 0aNeonectria galligena 0aNectriaceae 0aNectria galligena1 aKim, Kwang Soo0 tPhytopathology.g2011 Jan., v. 101, no. 1 p.135-146dAmerican Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-05-10-01373Available from publisher's Web site  a20110416b20110507c00000000  aINDd2CTe2011/03/04  aOther US 7aarticle02197naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245008000143300001600223500001500239520078600254650001101040650001601051650000801067650001101075650001901086650001701105650001401122650002001136650001001156650001701166650001101183650003401194650001001228650001101238650000901249650001601258650001901274650001501293650003201308650001101340651001301351651001301364653000901377653001001386653001501396653001201411653001001423700002101433700002101454773006601475852000901541930003301550945001301583946001101596655001201607IND2196024720221118095637.0981216e199804  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219602472DNAL7 a95734492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJack, F.R.10aPerception and role of fruit in the workday diets of Scottish lorry drivers  ap. 139-149.  a2019-12-05  aForty-six lorry drivers working for two haulage firms in central Scotland took part in a study to determine their perception and the role of fruit in their diets on working days. A focus group session provided initial insights, with repertory grid being used to provide further understanding. Eating while at work was characterized by a pattern of extensive and irregular snacking. The snack foods tended to be branded items obtained from garage kiosks, forecourts, motorway service areas and truck stops. Fruit as a snack, although perceived as healthy, did not feature highly because it was considered both inconvenient and expensive. The study identifies a major role to be played by the roadside catering and retailing industries in supplying healthy snacks to their customers. 3ahunger 3afood intake 3amen 3asnacks 3aprepared foods 3afood choices 3alifestyle 3adietary surveys 2aAdult 2aDiet Surveys 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behaviorxpsychology. 2aFruit 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMotor Vehicles 2aPerception 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aTravel 3aScotland 0aScotland 0adiet 0afruit 0aperception 0adrivers 0ashops1 aPiacentini, M.G.1 aSchroder, M.J.A.0 tAppetite.g1998 Apr., v. 30, no. 2 p.139-149x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02367naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245005800146300001600204500001500220520093500235650002001170650001601190650001801206650001801224650001001242650001601252650002201268650000901290650001201299650001301311650002301324650002101347650001201368650002301380650001801403650003301421650001101454650002201465650001101487650001101498650003201509650000901541653001001550653001601560653002801576653002001604653001301624700002001637773006601657852000901723930003301732945001301765946001101778655001201789IND2196008820221118095645.0981215e199710  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219600882DNAL7 a93444282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPearcey, S.M.10aFood intake and meal patterns of one year old infants  ap. 201-212.  a2019-12-05  aNutrient intakes and meal patterns of 8.6 to 15.6 month old infants were investigated by analysing data collected by the caregivers of 29 infants. The caregivers maintained a 7-day diary which included everything the infant ate and other factors including people present during meal time and time of meals. Daily intake and meal size increased as age increased for the infants. A high level of variability in meal size was found, however, the variability in daily intake was much lower indicating an ability to adjust intake at meals to maintain a relatively stable daily intake. Infants were found to be responsive to their stomach contents, however, the circadian rhythm of intake was absent and social facilitation of intake was blunted. It is suggested that these differences are due to the fact the infants have not yet learned to respond to the social and environmental factors which markedly influence the intake of adults. 3anutrient intake 3afood intake 3aeating habits 3aenergy intake 3agirls 3abody weight 3afeeding frequency 3aboys 3aweaning 3aduration 3asocial environment 3acircadian rhythm 3ainfants 2aEatingxphysiology 2aEnergy Intake 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant Behaviorxphysiology 2aMale 0ameals 0agrowth rate 0apremeal stomach content 0aage differences 0abehavior1 aDe Castro, J.M.0 tAppetite.g1997 Oct., v. 29, no. 2 p.201-212x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02260naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245004300127300001600170500012800186500001500314520107000329650001201399650002101411650002501432650002301457650001301480650002301493650001101516650001201527650002101539650002001560650001401580653002601594653002301620653001701643653002101660653001301681773006601694852000901760930003301769945001301802946001101815655001201826IND2196008120221118095655.0981215e199710  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219600812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSclafani, A.10aLearned controls of ingestive behavior  ap. 153-158.  aPaper presented at the 25th Anniversary Symposium of the Columbia University Seminar on Appetitive Behavior, March 6, 1997.  a2019-12-05  aDuring the 25 year history of the Columbia Appetitive Seminar there have been many notable developments in ingestive behavior research. One area of rapid progress concerns learned controls of feeding behavior. During the 1960's and 1970's most research related to food learning focused on conditioned flavor aversions. While it was assumed that animals also learned to prefer foods based on their positive nutritive consequences, there were few experimental demonstrations of this effect. Examples often cited involved animals learning to prefer a flavor associated with recovery from illness or a vitamin deficiency. There were isolated reports in the 1960's of nutrient infusions increasing flavor preference and acceptance, but it wasn't until the 1970's that nutrient-based learning was firmly established, and not until the 1980's and 1990's investigated in detail. This brief review highlights some of the major findings of nutrient-based learning. Other important aspects of food learning (social, cultural, ecological, environmental) are not discussed here. 3ahistory 3anutrient content 3aconditioned behavior 3anutrition research 3alearning 3afood acceptability 3aflavor 3asatiety 3afood composition 3abehavior change 3aingestion 0anutrient conditioning 0aliterature reviews 0afood choices 0aappetite control 0abehavior0 tAppetite.g1997 Oct., v. 29, no. 2 p.153-158x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03214naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245009700144300001600241520182400257650001702081650001302098650001902111650002002130650001002150650001602160650001102176650000802187650001002195650001402205650001002219650000902229650001402238650002002252650001102272650001302283650001102296650003302307650001102340650000902351650001802360650001602378650003202394650001602426650002102442653002502463700001302488700001502501773006602516852000902582930003302591945001302624946001102637655001202648IND2196028020221118095155.0981216e199704  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219602802DNAL7 a91588472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLetarte, A.10aSimilarities and differences in affective and cognitive origins of food likings and dislikes  ap. 115-129.  aIn a field study, 355 French-Canadian adults (Caucasians; 119 men, 236 women; average age of 40) freely stated the food item they liked and disliked the most, the reasons for their attitude and the context of their last consumption of these two food items. Content analysis revealed that the origins of food likes and dislikes are at the same time very similar and very different. They are similar in terms of the overwhelming influence of affective factors, in particular sensory experience, in the formation of both positive and negative attitudes toward food. Similarity between origins of food likes and dislikes in the same subjects is higher when they are from affective sources than when they are from cognitive sources. Food likes and dislikes are also similar in terms of the high salience of the social dimension in subjects' memories of consumption contexts. Results also show that food likes and dislikes also differ in many ways. Subjects can more easily elicit attitude bases and consumption contexts for food likes than they do for food dislikes. Beside taste as their common and most frequent base, results show that dislikes originate from more specific (e.g. texture, smell, appearance) and more intense sensory experiences than likes. Further, physiological consequences that contribute to food likes and dislikes are not the same: likes originate from positive nutritional value whereas dislikes follow from negative physiological responses, in particular nausea. Also, specific factors contribute uniquely to likes and dislikes. Functional aspects (e.g. flexibility, preparation) were the second most important reasons for food likes while having almost no influence on dislikes. in contrast, food symbolism was the third most important reason for food dislikes with almost no effect on food likes. 3afood choices 3aemotions 3ahuman behavior 3asocial behavior 3ataste 3ainformation 3aadults 3amen 3awomen 3acognition 2aAdult 2aAged 2aCognition 2aData Collection 2aEating 2aEmotions 2aFemale 2aFood Preferencesxpsychology 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMental Recall 2aMiddle Aged 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSex Factors 2aUrban Population 0alearning experiences1 aDube, L.1 aTroche, V.0 tAppetite.g1997 Apr., v. 28, no. 2 p.115-129x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02758naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245007300144300001600217500001500233520128800248650001101536650001601547650001301563650001601576650002701592650001201619650001101631650002101642650001101663650001001674650002301684650002501707650000901732650001201741650003301753650001101786650003301797650001101830650001001841650000901851650001601860650001601876650002301892651001901915653001701934653001301951700001601964700001101980700001601991700001702007773006602024852000902090930003302099945001302132946001102145655001202156IND2197588320221118095143.0990317e199810  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219758832DNAL7 a97927302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinch, G.M.10aAppetite changes under free-living conditions during Ramadan fasting  ap. 159-170.  a2019-12-05  aDuring the fasting month of Ramadan, Muslims abstain from food and drink from sunrise until sunset. This change of eating pattern provides an opportunity to investigate factors controlling hunger and thirst. A group of healthy Muslims (15 men and 26 women) living in Reading, U.K. made hourly ratings of their hunger, mood and thirst, and recorded their food and drink intake on specified days before, during and after Ramadan between January and March 1996. There were no significant changes in body weight over Ramadan. Rated hunger increased substantially during the daily fast, and hunger was higher for the women than the men during the earlier days of Ramadan, whereas later, on average, fasting levels of hunger were very similar for both sexes (significant gender x day interaction, p < 0.001). During Ramadan, the men tended to spend much of their time away from home, and may therefore have largely avoided eating-related cues during the daily fast. The women, however, were frequently involved in preparing food to be eaten later after sunset, which suggests an explanation for the results based on the external cue control of hunger. That is, unreinforced exposure to food cues in this context may have led to a decrease in the capacity of these cues to stimulate hunger. 3ahunger 3afood intake 3aemotions 3abody weight 3areligious dietary laws 3afasting 3athirst 3acircadian rhythm 3aadults 2aAdult 2aAffectxphysiology 2aAppetitexphysiology 2aCues 2aFasting 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aFemale 2aFood Preferencesxphysiology 2aHumans 2aIslam 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aSex Factors 2aThirstxphysiology 3aUnited Kingdom 0afluid intake 0aappetite1 aDay, J.E.L.1 aRazak.1 aWelch, D.A.1 aRogers, P.J.0 tAppetite.g1998 Oct., v. 31, no. 2 p.159-170x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02091naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006700128300001600195520115000211650001001361650002301371650001201394650001101406650001601417650001101433650001001444650001401454653001701468700001701485700004501502700001601547700002201563773006601585852000901651930003301660945001301693946001101706655001201717IND2197587920221118095204.0990317e199808  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219758792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuinard, J.X.10aSensory determinants of the thirst-quenching character of beer  ap. 101-115.  aThe purpose of this study was to find which sensory characteristics are significant determinants of the thirst-quenching character of beer. The sensory attributes and thirst-quenching characteristics ("thirst quenching", "refreshing", "drinkability") of 18 beers were evaluated by a panel of 12 judges. The only significant positive determinants of the "thirst-quenching" character of the beers in the design were carbonation and bubble density. Significant negative determinants were foam, overall aroma and flavor, color, viscosity, malty, hoppy, burnt, bitterness, acidic, metallic, astringency and aftertaste. The same correlations (both in terms of direction and significance level) were observed between descriptive attributes and the "refreshing" and "drinkability" factors. A principal component analysis (PCA) of the mean ratings indicated that variability among beers was mostly along a thirst-quenching dimension (72%) of the variance). Procrustes analysis performed on the individual ratings showed that, for one of the judges, the interpretation of the thirst-quenching concept differed from that shown by PCA for the overall panel. 3abeers 3asensory evaluation 3asatiety 3athirst 3acarbonation 3aflavor 3aodors 3aviscosity 0afluid intake1 aSouchard, A.1 aPicot, Michel Pierre Joseph,d1770-1841.1 aRogeaux, M.1 aSieffermann, J.M.0 tAppetite.g1998 Aug., v. 32, no. 1 p.101-115x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03241naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245009100144300001600235500001500251520177600266650002002042650001802062650001602080650002502096650001802121650001202139650001702151650000902168650003302177650001202210650003002222650006602252650005702318650001802375650002102393650000902414650002202423650000902445650002502454653001602479653001302495700001602508700001302524700001502537700001502552773006602567852000902633930003302642945001302675946001102688655001202699IND2197588120221118095120.0990317e199810  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219758812DNAL7 a97927282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, B.K.10aPreferential fat intake increases adiposity but not body weight in Sprague-Dawley rats  ap. 127-139.  a2019-12-05  aIt is not known whether an inherent preference for dietary fat promotes obesity in animals allowed to self-select the proportions of fat and carbohydrate consumed. To address this question, Sprague-Dawley rats were given a choice between two diets containing either 78% fat (by energy) or 78% carbohydrate; both diets were equicaloric for protein (22%). The entire study lasted 12 weeks. After an adaptation period, macronutrient preferences were determined by measuring 24 h intake of the two diets for 5 days: fat-preferring animals were classified as those that consumed greater than 60% of total energy from the fat/protein source, and carbohydrate-preferring rats as those that consumed less than 40%. Rats with intermediate macronutrient intakes were excluded. Initial body weight was not different between preference groups. Caloric intakes and body weights were then recorded at approximate weekly intervals, and fat depots were weighed at the time of sacrifice. Measures of energy intake and body weight did not differ between the two preference groups over time. In addition, baseline macronutrient preferences remained stable across the study period. Despite similar body weights, mean epididymal fat depot weight was significantly higher in fat-preferring rats than in carbohydrate-preferring rats (12.6 vs. 10.0 g); also, mean inguinal fat depot weight in fat-preferrers was greater although not reliably different compared to carbohydrate-preferring rats (12.9 vs. 10.9 g). Thus, the preferential intake of fat led to a greater deposition of both subcutaneous and visceral fat without an increase in body weight. These data lead us to conclude that the increased fat deposition was due primarily to the ingestion of fat rather than to excess caloric intake. 3anutrient intake 3aenergy intake 3adietary fat 3adietary carbohydrate 3afat thickness 3aobesity 3afood choices 3arats 2aAdipose Tissuexdrug effects 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aEnergy Intake 2aFood Preferences 2aMale 2aObesityxetiology 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 0abody weight 0abody fat1 aKelly, L.A.1 aPina, R.1 aYork, D.A.1 aBray, G.A.0 tAppetite.g1998 Oct., v. 31, no. 2 p.127-139x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01777naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009100126300001400217500001500231520080600246650000801052650001101060650001001071650001201081650002401093650002301117650001101140650001201151650001701163650001601180651001101196653001001207653001601217700001601233773006401249852000901313930003301322945001301355946001101368655001201379IND2197587620221118094647.0990317e199808  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219758762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBjork, C.C.10a"Extravagances" during weight reduction, an analysis of food preferences and selection  ap. 93-99.  a2019-12-05  aAs part of a behavioural modification programme for weight reduction in outpatients, obese clients [body mass index (BMI) 41.5 +/- 5.9 kg/m2], planned to eat once a week, an "extravagance", defined as a highly desired food in controlled quantities.

Both bowls contained purified diets, one bowl with one of various levels of sodium (as NaCl) and the other bowl a sodium-deficient diet (0.1 g Na/Kg). Neither sodium-replete nor depleted kittens showed a choice of the diet containing 2 g Na/kg over the deficient diet. Both groups of kittens showed significant aversion to a diet containing 10 g Na/kg diet, with no change in total food intake. Kittens previously exposed to a diet containing 10 g Na/kg diet appeared to have a learned aversion to sodium in subsequent choice tests. We conclude that kittens do not possess an innate sodium appetite and that a sodium appetite is not induced in sodium-depleted kittens. 3asodium chloride 3asalt preference 2aAnimals 2aAppetitexphysiology 2aCats 2aDiet 2aEating 2aFemale 2aFood Preferencesxphysiology 2aMale 2aNutritional Status 2aSodiumxdeficiency 2aSodium, Dietary1 aRogers, Q.R.1 aMorris, J.G.0 tAppetite.g1997 Aug., v. 29, no. 1 p.1-10x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01997naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010500127300001600232520116600248650002101414650001801435650001701453650003001470650001501500651001001515700002001525773008201545852000901627930003301636945001301669946001301682655001201695IND2035615320221118094950.0931029e199306  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203561532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, L.M.10aBionomics of Phrydiuchus tau (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) associated with Mediterranean sage in Idaho  ap. 704-708.  aThe bionomics of Phrydiuchus tau Warner associated with the rangeland weed Mediterranean sage, Salvia aethiopis L. (Lamiaceae), in Idaho was evaluated. The phenology of P. tau was closely synchronized with that of Mediterranean sage. Adults emerged from pupation in May or June and fed on the rapidly growing foliage of the plant rosettes until mid-June. Estivation occurred throughout the summer when plants were dormant, and adults emerged in the autumn to feed and reproduce. Oviposition occurred from November to April with eggs oviposited singly or in groups of two to four externally in the leaf axils, on the petioles, or on the leaf or crown surfaces. Larvae developed through three instars inside the crown or leaf axil. Pupation occurred in earthen cells between May and June. Larvae often completely destroyed the crown and associated meristematic tissues, resulting in the growth of new shoots and prolonging the longevity of the plant. Larvae were found in plants ranging in size from 1.6 to 43.1 mm crown diameter. Up to 35 larvae were recovered from a single crown. Smaller-crowned plants were attacked less frequently than larger-crowned plants. 3aSalvia aethiopis 3aCurculionidae 3aweed control 3abiological control agents 3arangelands 3aIdaho1 aMcCaffrey, J.P.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1993 June, v. 22, no. 3 p.704-708x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle02323naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245011200129300002000241520124000261650001101501650000901512650002001521650001701541650001901558650001201577650001701589650001901606650001701625650002301642650000901665650002001674653001501694700001601709700001101725700001101736773009801747852000901845930003301854945001301887946001301900655001201913IND2035614020221118095003.0931029e199306  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203561402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeenen, F.H.H.10aEffects of dietary sodium on central and peripheral ouabainlike activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats  ap. H2051-H2055.  aHigh dietary Na+ intake enhances pressor and sympathoexcitatory responses in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) but not Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. To evaluate the possible contribution of central ouabainlike activity (OLA), brain and peripheral OLA was assessed in SHR vs. WKY rats at 4 wk of age and after 2 and 4 wk of high vs. control Na+ intake started at 4 wk of age. In SHR, hypertension developed with maturation and was exacerbated by high Na+ intake. With control Na+ intake, SHR showed higher OLA at 4, 6, and 8 wk of age in the pituitary and hypothalamus and also by 8 wk in the adrenals and left ventricle but not in plasma. High Na+ intake increased OLA in all tissues examined in both WKY rats and SHR. After 2 wk on high Na+, only OLA in hypothalamus and pituitary was higher in SHR vs. WKY rats; after 4 wk on high Na+, peripheral (i.e., adrenals, left ventricle, and plasma) OLA was also higher. These results indicate that in SHR the development of hypertension is associated early on with increases in central OLA and in a later phase with increases in peripheral OLA as well. High Na+ intake increases OLA in both SHR and WKY rats, but the higher OLA may affect sympathetic activity and blood pressure only in SHR. 3asodium 3adiet 3anutrient intake 3ahypertension 3ablood pressure 3aouabain 3ahypothalamus 3aadrenal glands 3ablood plasma 3astrain differences 3arats 3apituitary gland 0aventricles1 aHarmsen, E.1 aYu, H.1 aOu, C.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1993 June, v. 264, no. 6:pt.2 p.H2051-H2055x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a19931201b19931207c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01764naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245018900124300001600313520083800329650002701167650000901194650002301203650001801226650003001244650001601274650002201290773008201312852000901394930003301403945001301436946001301449655001201462IND2035611920221118095255.0931029e199306  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203561192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, L.10aEffect of humidity on life history characteristics of Anisopteromalus calandrae (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) parasitizing maize weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) larvae in shelled corn  ap. 618-624.  aAnisopteromalus calandrae (Howard) was reared at constant humidities of 75, 56, and 43% RH at 30 degrees C (14.6, 12.8 and 11.6% grain moisture content) and a 12:12 (L:D) h photoperiod.

In order to determine the amount of HVI 60E to be applied with an emulsifiable concentrate of I (IE) a factorial herbicidal assay involving six concentrations of I and five concentrations of HVI 60E (both sets including zero concentration) was conducted to obtain response surfaces of herbicidal activity. The total selectivity of IE in broad-leaf species remained for all HVI 60E concentrations. The activity against grass weeds, except Poa annua L., increased markedly with increasing HVI 60E concentration and enhancement of performance of IE by HVI 60E in broad-leaf crops could be pursued without fear of crop phytotoxicity. However, the increases in activity against grass weeds were accompanied by increases in phytotoxicity against cereal crops. The response surfaces of Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beauv. and Zea mays L. were coincident and this result terminated further testing in this outlet. However, the response surfaces of Avena fatua L. and Triticum aestivum L. were reasonably well separated. Further tests in this outlet and in broad-leaf crops are planned around optimum cost-performance ratios derived from combinations with cost-response surfaces. The results of a further test showed that both components (oil and emulsifier) of HVI 60E were approximately equivalent in adjuvant enhancement activity and so, on cost grounds, a crop oil (low emulsifier content) would be preferred over a crop oil concentrate (high emulsifier content). 3aweed control 3aadjuvants 3aphytotoxicity 3aemulsifiable concentrates 3anew products 3aherbicides 3afield crops 3aoils 3aemulsifiers 3aweeds 3achemical control 3aapplication rate 0aefficacy 0acrops1 aWebb, J.D.1 aPack, S.E.0 tPesticide science.g1993, v. 37, no. 2 p.127-131x0031-613X7nnas  aDNAL  a19931201b19931207c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle03507naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245013100146300001800277520183400295650001002129650000902139650001502148650001502163650001902178650002002197650002002217650001402237650001602251650002602267650001202293650002102305650002602326650003502352650001702387650003002404650002502434650001102459650000902470650002802479650006902507650005402576650002902630650001202659650003002671653002002701700002002721700001802741700001702759773008502776852000902861930003302870945001302903946001302916655001202929IND2035620520221118095018.0931101e199306  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203562052DNAL7 a83258032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGlone, J.J.14aThe development of pain in young pigs associated with castration and attempts to prevent castration-induced behavioral changes  ap. 1441-1446.  aFour experiments were conducted to examine the development of castration-induced behavioral changes, the effects of castration age on pig weight gain, and the efficacy of common analgesics for use in castrated pigs. In Exp. 1, behavioral changes associated with castration of pigs at 1, 5, 10, 15, or 20 d of age were evaluated. Castration caused measurable changes (reduced suckling, reduced standing, and increased lying times, P < .05) in the behavior of young pigs compared with that of intact pigs at all ages tested. Effects of age and interactions between age and castration treatment were not significant (P > .10) for any behaviors evaluated. In Exp. 2, the performance of pigs castrated at 1 d of age was compared with the performance of those castrated on d 14 and female littermates. Birth weights, weaning weights, and mortality were recorded. Pigs that were castrated on d 14 were heavier (P = .05) at weaning and had a higher (P < .05) weight gain during lactation compared to pigs castrated on d 1 of age. Pig mortality was similar among the treatments. In Exp. 3 and 4, the efficacies of pain-reducing drugs (non-narcotic analgesics) were evaluated for effectiveness in reducing castration-induced behavioral changes in 8-wk-old pigs. Although castration reduced (P < .05) feeding time and weight gain, neither aspirin nor butorphanol influenced behavioral changes associated with castration. We conclude that pigs show similar behavioral changes (and probably pain perception) when castrated from 1 to 20 d of age. However, pig performance data favored castration at 14 d rather than at 1 d of age. Among older pigs, which show much greater behavioral effects of castration, analgesics (aspirin and butorphanol), used at recommended doses, provided no measurable effect on castration-induced behavioral changes. 3aswine 3apain 3acastration 3aanalgesics 3aanimal welfare 3aanimal behavior 3aliveweight gain 3amortality 2aAge Factors 2aAnalgesiaxveterinary 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aAspirinxpharmacology 2aBehavior, Animalxdrug effects 2aBirth Weight 2aButorphanolxpharmacology 2aCase-Control Studies 2aFemale 2aMale 2aOrchiectomyxveterinary 2aPain, Postoperativexetiologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aSwinexgrowth & developmentxphysiologyxsurgery. 2aSwine Diseasesxetiology 2aWeaning 2aWeight Gainxdrug effects 0aage differences1 aNicholson, R.I.1 aHellman, J.M.1 aHerzog, D.N.0 tJournal of animal science.g1993 June, v. 71, no. 6 p.1441-1446x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a19931201b19931207c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02950naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128072000900137100001800146245012800164300001600292500002400308500002300332520157800355650001601933650001801949650001701967650002301984650002302007650001902030650001402049650001602063650001102079650002302090700001802113700001702131700001702148700001902165773012702184852000902311856009102320930003302411945002502444946001102469655001202480IND4448649320221118094603.0110130e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444864932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aL500 0aL600 0aR3001 aOuellet, D.R.10aEffect of corn particle size and soybean meal treatment on performance of finishing beef steers fed corn-silage-based diets  ap. 555-562.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aIn the first experiment, 39 medium-frame beef steers (456 ± 41 kg) were used in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments to evaluate the effect of different feeding strategies to maximize energy and protein deposition on finishing performance and plasma amino acid profile of beef steers fed corn silage ad libitum for 99 d. To achieve this goal, steers were individually supplemented with either 6.6 kg DM d-1 of cracked corn (CC) or ground corn (GC) in combination with 540 g DM d-1 of either solvent extracted (SS) or lignosulfonate-treated soybean meal (Soypass SP). Dry matter intake, average daily gain and feed to gain ratio were not affected by treatments or by their interaction (P > 0.10). When compared with SS, SP tended to increase (P = 0.07) grade fat (1.3 and 2.2 ± 0.5 mm, respectively). The CC diets reduced the plasma concentration of branched-chained amino acids (P = 0.03) and leucine (P = 0.01), and tended to decrease that of isoleucine (P = 0.06) compared with the GC diets. No effect of diet was observed on plasma urea-N concentration. In the second experiment, four steers were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design to evaluate digestibility and N balance of the diets used in exp. 1. Reducing particle size of corn increased apparent digestibility of starch (P = 0.01) and tended to reduce apparent digestibility of NDF (P = 0.07). In conclusion, formulating diets with ground or cracked corn in combination with solvent extracted or lignosulfonate-treated soybean meal does not appear to influence steer performance or digestion parameters. 3acorn silage 3aparticle size 3asoybean meal 3aanimal performance 3aruminant nutrition 3acattle feeding 3afinishing 3abeef cattle 3asteers 3arumen fermentation1 aFaucitano, L.1 aPellerin, D.1 aD'Amours, M.1 aBerthiaume, R.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2010 Dec., v. 90, no. 4 p.555-562dAgricultural Institute of Canada.x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/aic-journals/cjas.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110406b20110507c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/02/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02201naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001100137245005700148300001600205500002400221500002300245500001500268520092800283650001501211650001601226650002301242650001401265650001701279650002201296650001501318650002101333653001001354700001801364700001701382700002901399700001901428773012701447852000901574856009101583930003301674945002501707946001101732655001201743IND4448649720221118094554.0110130e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444864972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aL8401 aLi, S.10aFree endotoxins in the feces of lactating dairy cows  ap. 591-594.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-06  aA survey was conducted on 300 lactating dairy cows on 10 dairy farms to determine how risk factors for and symptoms of excessive grain feeding and subacute ruminal acidosis are associated with the concentrations of endotoxins in feces measured with the Limulus amoebocyte lysate test.

The five farms with a dietary neutral detergent fibre (NDF) content higher than 33.8% of DM had lower (P < 0.01) fecal endotoxin than those with a dietary NDF content lower than 33.8% of DM (31 790 vs. 69 276 endotoxin units (EU) g-1 of wet feces, P < 0.01). Parity, milk yield, milk fat percentage, milk protein percentage, the blood plasma concentration of serum amyloid A, and the dietary content of physically effective fibre were not associated with the fecal endotoxin concentration. 3adairy cows 3afeed grains 3aruminant nutrition 3alactation 3arisk factors 3afeces composition 3aendotoxins 3aruminal acidosis 0afeces1 aKhafipour, E.1 aKrause, D.O.1 aRodriguez-Lecompte, J.C.1 aPlaizier, J.C.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2010 Dec., v. 90, no. 4 p.591-594dAgricultural Institute of Canada.x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/aic-journals/cjas.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110406b20110507c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/02/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03047naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128072000900137100001600146245016700162300001600329500002400345500002300369520144700392650002301839650001401862650001901876650001901895650001401914650001201928650001901940650002201959650001001981650001801991650002402009650002302033653003102056653002002087700001602107700001502123700001802138700001802156700001602174700001902190773012702209852000902336856009102345930003302436945002502469946001102494655001202505IND4448649620221118094619.0110130e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444864962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aR300 0aW0001 aLopez, M.C.10aDetermination of the proportion of the ingested gross energy lost as exhaled methane by dairy goats consuming contrasting concentrate ingredients in mixed rations  ap. 585-590.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aTwelve 2-yr-old, dry Murciano-Granadina dairy goats were selected and divided into four equal groups based on similar body weight (38.41 ± 0.78 kg). The four treatments were mixed diets with approximately 600 g kg-1 alfalfa hay chopped to 2.5-cm particle size, and 400 g kg-1 of concentrate. The concentrate has 250 g kg-1 of cereal grain (corn or barley) and 150 g kg-1 of protein (sunflower meal or green peas). Experimental diets were isoenergetic with an average value of 18.9 MJ gross energy (GE) kg-1 of dry matter (DM). Apparent digestibility, intake, metabolic energy and methane (CH4) production were obtained. The effect of cereal grain was significant for crude protein (P < 0.001) and acid detergent fiber (P < 0.049) digestibility. The effect of protein source was significant for DM (P < 0.025), organic matter (P < 0.031) and DEI (P < 0.016) digestibilities. CH4 exhaled was determined by an open-circuit mask calorimeter system. An average value of 0.8 L CH4 h-1 was found for these mixed rations. When this was expressed as the proportion of the ingested GE lost as exhaled methane, the average value was 4.6. Because of the non-significant differences observed among these mixed diets studied to determine exhaled CH4 by non-productive dairy goats, diets based on barley and sunflower meal are recommended. These crops are cheaper than corn and peas because they are produced in Spain and not imported from other countries. 3aruminant nutrition 3aingestion 3aenergy content 3aenergy balance 3abreathing 3amethane 3aanimal feeding 3afeed concentrates 3agoats 3adairy animals 3atotal mixed rations 3aexperimental diets 0aingested gross energy lost 0aexhaled methane1 aRodenas, L.1 aPiquer, O.1 aMartínez, E.1 aCerisuelo, A.1 aCervera, C.1 aFernández, C.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2010 Dec., v. 90, no. 4 p.585-590dAgricultural Institute of Canada.x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/aic-journals/cjas.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110406b20110507c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/02/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02467naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002200123024001900145040001800164072000900182072000900191072000900200100001900209245008900228300001600317500002400333500001500357506007600372520082800448506003701276650002501313650002601338650001701364650001801381650003101399650001001430650001001440650002101450650001301471653002201484653001801506653003101524653002701555700002401582773008301606852000901689856008101698856008701779930003301866945002501899946001301924655001201937IND4448647320221207141246.0110130e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444864732DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.5.7.120952doi7 aPMC31150412pmcid7 a204849902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF400 0aF2001 aPrasad, Kalika10aShaping up the fruit: Control of fruit size by an Arabidopsis B-sister MADS-box gene  ap. 899-902.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe final size and shape of fruits is determined by organogenesis. Organogenesis is the coordination of cell growth, cell differentiation and pattern formation. Individual genes have been identified that affect lateral organ growth. A majority of these characterized growth genes in Arabidopsis affect all lateral plant organs and few of these have been placed into a regulatory network controlling organ growth. We have recently characterized GORDITA (GOA), a MADS-box transcription factor, which represses cell expansion specifically in fruits and affects overall fruit size.1 Here we provide insights into a possible regulatory network in which GOA can function to regulate fruit growth. We further suggest how duplicated B-sister genes; GOA and TRANSPARENT TESTA 16 (TT16) could have acquired distinct regulatory roles.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atranscription factors 3aplant growth 3amorphogenesis 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ashape 3aplant morphology 3afruiting 0aplant development 0aGORDITA genes 0aTRANSPARENT TESTA 16 genes 0afruits (plant anatomy)1 aAmbrose, Barbara A.0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2010 July, v. 5, no. 7 p.899-902x1559-23247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.5.7.120953Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/psb/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110406b20110507c00000000  aINDd9CTe2011/02/10  aOther US 7aarticle02523naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245009200146300001600238520134300254650001601597650002601613650001301639650001601652650001101668650001501679650001001694650001601704650000901720650001001729650002501739650001101764650001801775650003301793650001101826650000901837650001601846650001501862650002901877700001501906773006601921852000901987930003301996945001302029946001102042655001202053IND2180585820221118095332.0981021e199706  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218058582DNAL7 a92180962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcFarlane, T.10aIncreasing willingness to taste novel foods: effects of nutrition and taste information  ap. 227-238.  aThis study was designed to examine the effects of various kinds of information on willingness to ingest novel foods in individuals varying in the extent to which they reported that nutritional concerns affected their food choices. Male and female volunteers ranging in age from 10 to 79 (N = 401), saw six familiar and six novel foods, and received no information, taste likability information, general nutrition information, or specific nutrition information about the whole set of foods. They rated their willingness to taste each food, with the clear implication that their willingness ratings would determine which foods they would taste later in the study. On a separate questionnaire, they also rated the factors influencing their food everyday choices, and these ratings were used to compute an "importance of nutrition" score for each individual. Results indicated that older subjects were generally more willing to try novel foods than younger ones, that general nutrition information was effective for high school and college students, and that specific nutrition information was influential for young adults. It was also found that general nutrition information increased willingness to taste novel food in subjects for whom nutrition is important and decreased such willingness in subjects for whom nutrition is not important. 3anovel foods 3anutrition information 3achildren 3aadolescents 3aadults 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aAged 2aChild 2aExploratory Behavior 2aFemale 2aFood Labeling 2aFood Preferencesxpsychology 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMotivation 2aNutritional Requirements1 aPliner, P.0 tAppetite.g1997 June, v. 28, no. 3 p.227-238x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01519naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245007200131300001600203300002400219520072700243650002400970650003100994650002001025653001901045700001901064773008501083852000901168939003301177945000801210946001101218655001201229991630342800742620221118095327.0880610s1987    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880011432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMills, B.C.10aFood behaviors of young children: cognitive and attitudinal factors  ap. 321-330.  ap. 321-330. charts.  aA statistical study assessed the effects of the nutrition knowlege and food attitudes of mothers on the nutrition knowledge and food behavior of 159 children of ages 7-9 years old.

The pts locus encodes a DNA invertase homologue. PCR-RFLP analysis showed the two potential tail fiber regions of the pts locus present DNA inversions. Electron microscopy revealed a phage tail-like particle, related to the R-type family and named R-photorhabdicin, in the culture supernatant of P. luminescens. Mass spectrometry analysis of two sub-units of R-photorhabdicin revealed that they are encoded by the pts locus.

In spite of the high similarity in the organisation of mitochondrial DNAs among examined strains, differences could be easily recognised by applying molecular markers, such as the different intron content of the cox1 genes, the sequence of the intergenic regions between the Met- and His-tRNA genes and downstream of the tRNA-Gly gene. Intraspecific mitochondrial transfers between the heterokaryon incompatible mitochondrial oligomycin-resistant A. niger strain, as the donor, and other A. niger-sensitive strains bearing different RFLP patterns resulted in oligomycin-resistant progeny possessing either rearranged or unchanged donor mitochondrial DNA and recipient nuclei. Since the intergenic marker sequences of mitochondrial DNAs turned out to be identical in the donor and the progeny, it can be assumed that the oligomycin-resistant progeny inherit the mitochondrial DNA of the donor strain; this may either remain unchanged or may be modified by a mobile intron of the cox1 gene of the recipient mitochondria. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aAspergillus niger 3amitochondrial DNA 3aintraspecific variation 3aheterokaryon 3amitochondria 3aintergenic DNA 3aprogeny 3aintrons 3agenetic markers 2aAspergillus nigerxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aMitochondriaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhysical Chromosome Mapping 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0agenes1 aToth, B.1 aBeer, Z.1 aGacser, A.1 aKucsera, J.1 aPfeiffer, I.1 aJuhasz, A.1 aKevei, F.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2003 Apr. 11, v. 221, no. 1 p.63-71aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02715naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001300127245015900140300001400299500001500313520156400328650004701892650002401939650003001963650001101993650002802004650002702032650002402059653003002083653002402113700001602137700001902153773013602172852000902308945002502317946001102342655001202353IND4362176220221118095631.0040420e20040312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436217622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aToda, T.10aDevelopment of specific PCR primers for the detection of Rhizoctonia solani AG 2-2 LP from the leaf sheaths exhibiting large-patch symptom on zoysia grass  ap. 67-74.  a2019-12-05  aDetection of Rhizoctonia solani AG 2-2 LP isolates causing large-patch disease on zoysia grass was done using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specific primers were designed based on an amplified region using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR. Fifteen primers and three cultural types of R. solani AG 2-2 (types IIIB, IV and LP) were used for RAPD-PCR. The banding patterns by RAPD-PCR showed that the three cultural types were clearly distinguishable. A dendrogram constructed from the results of RAPD-PCR showed that the three cultural types of AG 2-2 clustered separately. The sequence of one PCR-amplified region which appeared only in LP isolates using primer A09 was selected for designing specific primers. Primer pair A091-F/R gave a single product from pure fungal DNA of LP isolates but not from those of the other two types (IIIB and IV), R. solani AG 1, 2-1, 2-3, 2-tulip, 3-10 and BI isolates and other turfgrass fungal pathogens. Primer pair A091-F/R also gave a single product from diseased leaf sheaths and this product was in accordance with those of pure fungal DNA of LP isolates. Primer pair A091-F/R did not yield PCR product from healthy leaf sheaths. The frequencies of detection of LP isolates from leaf sheaths of zoysia grass using PCR with primer pair A091-F/R were higher than those of the conventional isolation technique. These results showed that the PCR-based technique using specific primers A091-F/R is useful for the rapid detection of LP isolates from leaf sheaths of zoysia grass exhibiting large-patch symptoms. 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3awarm season grasses 3afungal diseases of plants 3aZoysia 3apathogen identification 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3amicrobial detection 0apolymerase chain reaction 0alarge-patch disease1 aMushika, T.1 aHyakumachi, M.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2004 Mar. 12, v. 232, no. 1 p.67-74aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  aINDdGHKe2004/04/27  aNon-US 7aarticle01784naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001400127245010600141300001400247500001500261520100500276650001401281653002601295653001701321773013501338852000901473945002501482946001101507655001201518IND4361390020221118095616.0040226e20040209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436139002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The cyclic bacterial culture was well adapted to different feed compositions as evidenced by the lack of accumulation of benzoate or pyruvate in the chemostat. Both the benzoate-degrading capabilities and the in vitro catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23DO) activities of the cyclic bacterial cultures were in direct proportion to the flux through the chemostat of the substrate degraded by the pathway containing C23DO, with some exceptions. The quantity of C23DO showed a transient decrease during the initial portion of the aerobic period before returning to the level present during the anoxic period. That decrease was most likely caused by the production of H2O2 by the cells upon being returned to aerobic conditions. 3abenzoates 0aaromatic hydrocarbons 0acontaminants0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2004 Feb. 9, v. 231, no. 1 p.59-65aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  aINDdGHKe2004/03/12  aNon-US 7aarticle01833naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001900161245010900180300001600289520075400305650001901059650001601078650001301094650002601107650001701133650001901150650001801169653003001187700002101217700002001238700001801258773013801276852000901414945002501423946001101448655001201459IND4361925920221118095634.0040405e20040319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436192592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Gold-conjugated pullulanase was used as the specific probe for this purpose. No cell wall pullulan-like material was detected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in any morphological form of this fungus, although intracellular electron transparent material bound this probe. When silver enhancement of this gold-conjugated pullulanase probe was used, the data strongly suggested that only swollen cells and chlamydospores, and neither hyphae nor unicellular blastospores, often held responsible for pullulan formation, appeared to produce pullulan-like material. 3afungal anatomy 3apullulanase 3apullulan 3abiological production 3abiosynthesis 3aultrastructure 3acytochemistry 0acytochemical localization1 aSiddique, A.B.M.1 aMcDougall, B.M.1 aSeviour, R.J.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2004 Mar. 19, v. 232, no. 2 p.225-228aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  aINDdGHKe2004/04/06  aNon-US 7aarticle01957naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001600144245010100160300001600261520099400277650001901271650002301290650002801313651001001341700002001351700002001371700001501391700001401406700001701420773013701437852000901574945002501583946001101608655001201619IND4362080620221118095620.0040414e20040401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436208062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Four strains from seafood, six from beef and one from a clinical case of bloody diarrhoea were positive for Shiga toxins Stx1 and Stx2 and also for stx1 and stx2 genes. The seafood isolates produced either Stx2 alone or both Stx1 and Stx2, while the beef isolates produced Stx1 alone. The stx1 gene of all the beef STEC was found to be of recently reported stx1c type. All STEC strains and one non-STEC strain isolated from clam harboured EHEC-hlyA. Interestingly, though all STEC strains were negative for eae gene, two STEC strains isolated from seafood and one from a patient with bloody diarrhoea possessed STEC autoagglutinating adhesion (saa) gene, recently identified as a gene encoding a novel autoagglutinating adhesion. 3afood pathogens 3afood contamination 3amicrobial contamination 3aIndia1 aKayunasagar, I.1 aKarunasagar, I.1 aTeizou, T.1 aShima, K.1 aYamasaki, S.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2004 Apr. 1, v. 233, no. 1 p.173-178aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  aINDdGHKe2004/04/15  aNon-US 7aarticle01196naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099245005300117300001000170520050000180650003200680650002100712651001800733653001900751653001800770653003300788773005900821852000900880939003300889945000800922655001200930991630341200742620221118095620.0780901e197711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894834112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aControversy: attacks on target for American diet  ap. 4.  aThe report on dietary goals for the United States as prepared by the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs is critically examined.

Virulence bioassays, performed by direct plug mycelial inoculation on bean plant leaves, showed that B. cinerea CCg425 displays less fungal aggressivity than B. cinerea CKg54, a virulent fungal strain that is not infected by dsRNA mycoviruses. B. cinerea CCg425 also showed lower laccase activity and conidiation rate than B. cinerea CKg54. Furthermore, infection of B. cinerea CKg54 with viral particles purified from B. cinerea CCg425 resulted in diminished virulence of the infected fungus.

This is the first report of such proteins to be characterized in a conifer species. Sp-AMP1 was identified in a substructured cDNA library of root tissue infected with the root rot fungus Heterobasidion annosum and encodes a mature peptide of 79 amino acid residues. Three additional members of the Sp-AMP family (Sp-AMPs 2-4) encode cysteine-rich proteins of 105 amino acids, each containing an N-terminal region with a probable cleavage signal sequence. Northern analysis confirmed that Sp-AMP expression is elevated in Scots pine roots upon infection with H. annosum. These peptides share 64% amino acid identity with a mature protein from Macadamia integrifolia (MiAMP1), which allowed us to build a homology model for preliminary analysis. Southern analyses further confirmed that several copies of the gene are present in the Scots pine genome. The potential significance of Sp-AMP in the H. annosum¡conifer pathosystem is discussed. 3aantimicrobial peptides 3agenes 3aamino acid sequences 3aforest pests 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aroot rot 0amolecular sequence data1 aChoi, W.1 aLi, G.1 aNahalkova, J.1 aDean, R.A.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2003 Nov. 7, v. 228, no. 1 p.27-31aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  aINDdGHKe2004/02/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02213naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001600144245013500160300001600295500001500311520094100326650003001267650002801297650003001325650004201355650002101397650001801418650001101436650002001447650002201467650001301489650001101502653001401513700001601527700001901543700001701562700001701579773013801596852000901734945002501743946001101768655001201779IND4361327320221118100209.0040220e20031024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436132732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The clone pRVE4-ADRC displayed toxicity against fourth-instar larvae of Aedes aegypti, the highest ever achieved in cyanobacteria. It was about 2.5-fold more toxic than the respective clone without cyt1Aa [Wu et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 63 (1997) 4971-4975]. Cyt1Aa synergized the combination of Crys by about five-fold.

This clone may become a useful biological control agent which reduces the probability of resistance development in the target organisms [Wirth et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

  1 aCheng, J.10aProduction, survival and efficacy of Coniothyrium minitans conidia produced in shaken liquid culture  ap. 127-131.  aConiothyrium minitans is a fungal biocontrol agent of the plant pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Growth and sporulation of 21 strains of C. minitans were examined on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and compared with that in potato dextrose broth (PDB) in shaken culture after 12 days at 20 °C, to identify strains with potential for inoculum production in liquid culture. Four strains that produced high numbers of pycnidia in PDA also formed pycnidia on mycelial strands in PDB and 10⁷ conidia ml-1 broth were produced. The other strains formed pellets during shaking, resulting in production of less than 10⁵ conidia ml-1. Conidia from shaken PDB culture had the same ability to infect and rot sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum as conidia produced routinely on PDA, and survived well in dry kaolin dust for 6 months at temperatures less than 8 °C with less than 1 log10 colony forming units mg-1 loss. These results suggest that it might be possible to identify useful strains of C. minitans for future commercial conidial production in liquid fermentation systems based on morphological characteristics on agar. 3abiological control agents 3abiological control 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3abiological production1 aJiang, D.1 aYi, X.1 aFu, Y.1 aLi, G.1 aWhipps, J.M.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2003 Oct. 10, v. 227, no. 1 p.127-131aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  aINDdGHKe2004/02/23  aNon-US 7aarticle01824naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245012400158300001600282500001500298520072600313650002401039650002301063650002001086650002501106650002901131650002801160653002501188653001201213653003901225700001501264773013801279852000901417945002501426946001101451655001201462IND4361360820221118100134.0040225e20040130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436136082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Bap2p undergoes a starvation-induced degradation depending upon ubiquitination and the functions of N- and C-terminal domains of Bap2p. Here we show that the N-terminal domain of Bap2p is phosphorylated in response to rapamycin treatment when both the N- and C-termini of Bap2p are fused to glutathione S-transferase. The phosphorylation is dependent on Ser/Thr kinase Npr1p. In npr1 cells, Bap2p becomes slightly more susceptible to the rapamycin-induced degradation, suggesting that Npr1p counteracts the degradation system for Bap2p. 3aprotein degradation 3anutrient transport 3aprotein kinases 3amicrobial physiology 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aprotein phosphorylation 0aamino acid permeases 0aenzymes 0abranched-chain amino acid permease1 aKodama, Y.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2004 Jan. 30, v. 230, no. 2 p.227-234aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  aINDdGHKe2004/02/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02471naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245010200147300001400249500001500263520071500278650002700993650001401020650000901034650001401043650002101057650002101078650001301099650001001112650001201122650001701134650006101151650003001212650003501242650003101277650002101308650004001329650002801369650005701397650001301454650002701467650004001494650007201534650001401606653002701620700001701647700002101664700001801685773013601703852000901839930003301848945001301881946001101894655001201905IND2331121720221118091842.0030303e20030121ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233112172DNAL7 a125838992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlatero, R.A.10aMutations in sit B and sit D genes affect manganese-growth requirements in Sinorhizobium meliloti  ap. 65-70.  a2019-12-05  aTwo transposon-induced mutants of Sinorhizobium meliloti 242 were isolated based on their inability to grow on rich medium supplemented with the metal chelator ethylenediamine di-o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (EDDHA) and either heme-compounds or siderophores as iron sources. Tagged loci of these mutants were identified as sitB and sitD genes. These genes encode components of an ABC (ATP-binding cassette) metal-type permease in several Gram-negative bacteria. In this work, the phenotypes of these two mutants were compared with those of two siderophore-mediated iron transport mutants. The results strongly implicate a role of the sit genes in manganese acquisition when this metal is limiting in S. meliloti. 3aGram-negative bacteria 3amanganese 3aloci 3aphenotype 3achelating agents 3aEnsifer meliloti 3amutation 3agenes 3amutants 3asiderophores 2aATP-Binding Cassette Transportersxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aEthylenediaminesxpharmacology 2aGenes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aIronxmetabolism 2aIron Chelating Agentsxpharmacology 2aManganesexpharmacology 2aMedicago sativaxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aMutation 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSiderophoresxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSinorhizobium melilotixgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSymbiosis 0aSinorhizobium meliloti1 aJaureguy, M.1 aBattistoni, F.J.1 aFabiano, E.R.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2003 Jan. 21, v. 218, no. 1 p.65-70aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02476naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245009000143300001600233500001500249520093100264650002101195650001601216650001701232650002101249650002401270650002201294650002601316650001401342650002001356650001601376650001301392650001301405650003201418650001701450650001801467650005001485650004901535650003801584653002801622653003001650653001601680700001401696700001801710700001401728773013801742852000901880930003301889945001301922946001101935655001201946IND2331262720221118092024.0030307e20030128ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233126272DNAL7 a125864032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Y.S.10aGrowth promotion of the edible fungus Pleurotus ostreatus by fluorescent pseudomonads  ap. 271-276.  a2019-12-05  aBacteria were isolated from the mycelial surface of Pleurotus ostreatus and their role in fruiting body induction (fructification) of the edible mushroom P. ostreatus was investigated.

In particular, the population size of fluorescent pseudomonads increased during fruiting body induction. An experiment showed that inoculation of pure cultures of the mycelium with strains of fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. isolated from the mycelial plane of commercially produced mushrooms promoted the formation of primordia and enhanced the development of the basidiome of P. ostreatus.

In the present study we provide evidence that the utilization of glutathione can occur in the absence of gamma-GT. When disruptions in the CIS2 gene encoding gamma-GT were created in met15delta strains, which require organic sulfur sources for growth, the cells were able to grow well with glutathione as the sole sulfur source suggesting that a gamma-GT-independent pathway for glutathione degradation exists in yeast cells. The CIS2 gene was strongly repressed by ammonium and derepressed in glutamate medium, and was found to be regulated by the nitrogen regulatory circuit. The utilization of glutathione as a sulfur source was, however, independent of the nitrogen source in the medium, further underlining that the two degradatory pathways were distinct. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3agamma-glutamyltransferase 3agenes 3aglutamic acid 3aglutathione 3anitrogen 3asulfur 3ayeasts1 aSharma, R.1 aBachhawat, A.K.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2003 Feb. 28, v. 219, no. 2 p.187-194aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03119naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245012500147300001600272520134200288650002201630650002701652650002001679650001001699650000901709650001201718650001501730650002101745650001401766650001401780650002401794650002001818650002401838650001601862650002901878650002101907650001601928650003101944650003001975650002102005650006002026650001302086650002602099650001302125650003202138650003302170653001102203653001902214653001402233700002302247700001502270700001602285773013802301852000902439930003302448945001302481946001102494655001202505IND2331646820221118092015.0030328e20030228ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233164682DNAL7 a126206262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrondsted, L.10akdpE and a putative RsbQ homologue contribute to growth of Listeria monocytogenes at high osmolarity and low temperature  ap. 233-239.  aThe kdp locus of Listeria monocytogenes encodes products with homology to structural proteins of a high-affinity potassium uptake system and to a two-component signal transduction system commonly involved in controlling gene expression. We have investigated the role of kdpE, encoding the transcriptional response regulator, as well as of the downstream gene, orfX, in adaptation of L. monocytogenes EGD to NaCl and low temperature. When grown in chemically defined medium the addition of NaCl to 2% decreased the growth rate of a mutant with an insertional inactivated kdpE, while mutants carrying in-frame deletions of either kdpE or orfX were unaffected by high osmolarity. Transcriptional analysis of kdpE and orfX revealed that their products are encoded by the same transcript. Thus, our data indicate that the absence of both KdpE and OrfX influences growth under osmotic pressure. Interestingly, OrfX contains a conserved domain of alpha/beta-hydrolases and resembles RsbQ that in Bacillus subtilis participates in the activation cascade of the general stress sigma factor SigB. When shifted to low temperature the deletion mutant lacking orfX resumed growth slightly faster than the wild-type. This phenotype was shared by a mutant carrying an in-frame deletion of sigB supporting the notion that OrfX could be a RsbQ homologue. 3aBacillus subtilis 3aListeria monocytogenes 3agene expression 3agenes 3aloci 3amutants 3aosmolarity 3aosmotic pressure 3aphenotype 3apotassium 3asignal transduction 3asodium chloride 3astructural proteins 3atemperature 3atranscription (genetics) 2aCold Temperature 2aDNA Primers 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aEscherichia coli Proteins 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aListeria monocytogenesxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aMutation 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aPlasmids 2aSodium Chloridexmetabolism 2aTrans-Activatorsxphysiology 0astress 0aosmotic stress 0akdp locus1 aKallipolitis, B.H.1 aIngmer, H.1 aKnochel, S.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2003 Feb. 28, v. 219, no. 2 p.233-239aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02452naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245014000147300001600287520102500303650002701328650001801355650001001373650002501383650002301408650001401431650001601445650001801461650001301479650007201492650002701564650002201591650002801613650003201641650001401673650004501687650002701732700001701759700001501776773013701791852000901928930003301937945001301970946001101983655001201994IND2330600620221118092111.0030128e20021105ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233060062DNAL7 a124354942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamsubhag, A.10aPartial 16S rRNA gene sequence diversity and numerical taxonomy of slow growing pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.

Hadar field strains were tested against each other for growth suppression activity by their ability to suppress the multiplication of low counts of minority cultures inoculated into them as nalidixic acid-resistant mutants. All strains showed profound growth suppression. Four S. Hadar strains were selected and further tested for their ability to suppress growth of S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium, S. Virchow and S. Saintpaul. One of the four strains (S. Hadar 18) was randomly selected for further studies. Precolonization of chicken with S. Hadar 18 prevented superinfection with any of the serovars mentioned above. From more than 1000 TnphoA mutants of S. Hadar 18 screened against the parent strain anaerobically in vitro, four were non-suppressive with TnphoA insertions in dapF, aroD, sgaT or tatA.

A. hydrophila showed antibacterial activity against one or more indicator microorganisms, but the activity emerged only with non-phylogenetically related genera or species. In particular all A. hydrophila showed antibacterial activity against one or more of the tested Staphylococcus strains, five against Listeria spp. (Listeria seeligeri, Listeria welshimeri and Listeria ivanovii), and eight presented a weak antagonistic activity towards Streptococcus agalactiae and Lactobacillus spp. Inhibitory activity was not observed against the other Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua and Enterococcus spp.) and Gram-negative tested strains, including Aeromonas sobria, Aeromonas caviae and the same A. hydrophila, when used as indicator. Anti-staphylococcal activity was observed with a gradual increase of the inhibition zone during incubation and seemed to be influenced by A. hydrophila hemolytic expression. Extrachromosomal analysis showed the presence, in 70% of the strains, of one to five plasmids with molecular masses ranging from 2.1 to 41.5 MDa, but it was not possible to relate this result with BLS production. 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aAeromonas punctata 3aAeromonas sobria 3aEnterococcus 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aLactobacillus 3aListeria innocua 3aListeria ivanovii 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aListeria seeligeri 3aListeria welshimeri 3aStaphylococcus 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3aantibacterial properties 3afood pathogens 3amolecular weight 3aplasmids 2aAeromonas hydrophilaxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aBacteriocinsxbiosynthesisxpharmacology. 2aEscherichia colixdrug effects 2aFood Microbiology 2aGram-Negative Bacteriaxdrug effects 2aGram-Positive Bacteriaxdrug effects 2aListeriaxdrug effects 2aPlasmids 2aPseudomonasxdrug effects 2aStaphylococcusxdrug effects 2aWater Microbiology1 aGuerrieri, E.1 aBondi, M.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2003 Mar. 14, v. 220, no. 1 p.121-125aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02925naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245012300146300001600269520112600285650003101411650001101442650001801453650001001471650001201481650002901493650001801522650002101540650001301561650001301574650002401587650001501611650002401626650001801650650001101668650004301679650001801722650001801740650004201758650004401800650002101844650003501865650004101900650002801941650001301969650003001982650002302012650002402035650002702059700001802086700001502104773013802119852000902257930003302266945001302299946001102312655001202323IND2332098820221118092127.0030421e20011218ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233209882DNAL7 a117508282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchulz, A.A.10aNitrogen and carbon regulation of glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase in Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032  ap. 361-367.  aThe effect of nitrogen and carbon status on the regulation of glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamate synthase (GOGAT) were investigated in Corynebacterium glutamicum 13032. Under carbon-sufficient, nitrogen-limiting conditions, GS and GOGAT activities were five- and seven-fold higher, respectively, and transcription of the corresponding genes (glnA and gltBD) was similarly induced. GS activity was also induced in complete medium with added glucose, while GOGAT activity was unaffected. Under carbon-limiting, nitrogen-limiting conditions, the level of GS induction was reduced approximately three-fold, whereas GOGAT activity did not respond. Disruption of the hkm gene, encoding a putative histidine kinase upstream of gltBD, reduced the levels of GOGAT activity two-fold under both nitrogen-rich and nitrogen-limiting conditions. Promoter studies using a hkm-chloramphenicol acetylase fusion plasmid revealed that transcription of hkm is moderately induced (ca. 1.5-fold) by nitrogen starvation, indicating that the Hkm protein may play a role in signal transduction of the nutritional status of the growth medium. 3aCorynebacterium glutamicum 3acarbon 3aculture media 3agenes 3aglucose 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aglutamic acid 3ahistidine kinase 3anitrogen 3aplasmids 3asignal transduction 3astarvation 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCarbon 2aCorynebacteriumxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aCulture Media 2aGene Deletion 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGlutamate Synthasexmetabolism 2aGlutamate-Ammonia Ligasexmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNitrogen 2aProtein Kinasesxgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 2aSignal Transduction 2aTranscription, Genetic1 aCollett, H.J.1 aReid, S.J.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2001 Dec. 18, v. 205, no. 2 p.361-367aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03512naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072001700168072001700185100001500202245011300217300001600330500001500346520201800361650002402379650001802403650002302421650001502444650001702459650002002476650002302496650000902519650002602528650000702554650001502561650002802576653002202604653002602626700001402652700001302666700001602679700001502695700002102710700001402731773007002745852000902815856008902824930003302913945002502946946001102971655001202982IND4375395020221118091945.0051021e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437539502DNAL7 a220612192pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.05.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aZamora, F.10aSerine peptidase inhibitors, the best predictor of beef ageing amongst a large set of quantitative variables  ap. 730-742.  a2019-12-05  aFor consumers, tenderness is the most important sensory attribute of beef meat and, though to a lesser extent, of pork. Tenderness is therefore by far the most common cause of its unacceptability. The major challenge for the beef industry is to evaluate the toughness of the meat as soon as possible after death. In this context, the aim of the present work was to develop an equation to predict the myofibrillar ultimate resistance of raw meat. The study was done on the Longissimus muscle from twenty three 19 months-old Charolais bulls grown in the same INRA farm. Muscles excised within 1 h post-mortem were vacuum packed and stored at 15 degrees C during 24 h and then transferred to 4 degrees C until used. The activities of lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase and myofibrillar Mg-Ca dependent ATPase, the levels of lactate dehydrogenase enzyme, myoglobin, myosin types I, IIa and IIb, cysteine and serine peptidase inhibitors, the pH, the osmolarity, the expressible juice, mu-calpain, m-calpain and calpastatin and meat toughness were measured. According to the physical method used here, the force measured on raw meat represents the resistance of the myofibillar structure. Stepwise linear regression was used to determine the best equation (p < 0.05) for predicting toughness at 6 days post-mortem. A 6-variables predictive equation including serine peptidase inhibitors (partial R2 = 0.4), the rate (partial R2 = 0.25), and the extent of pH decline (partial R2 = 0.03), the at death LDH activity (partial R2 = 0.24), the extent of increase in osmotic pressure (partial R2 = 0.13), and the rate of mu-calpain activity loss (partial R2 = 0.09), explained 70% of the variability in meat toughness at 6 days post-mortem. This equation was developed from 20 animals and the other 3 animals, chosen randomly, were used to validate it. The absolute need for a predictive model of meat toughness and the nature of the serine peptidase inhibitors together with their potential target enzymes are discussed. 3aprotein degradation 3alinear models 3aserine proteinases 3asarcomeres 3abeef quality 3ameat tenderness 3alongissimus muscle 3abeef 3aproteinase inhibitors 3apH 3ameat aging 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 0alongissimus dorsi 0abiochemical compounds1 aAubry, L.1 aSayd, T.1 aLepetit, J.1 aLebert, A.1 aSentandreu, M.A.1 aOuali, A.0 tMeat science.g2005 Dec., v. 71, no. 4 p.730-742x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.05.0213Available from publisher's Web site  a20060818b20060906c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/10/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03560naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072001700168072001700185072001700202072001700219100001500236245012100251300001600372500001500388520183400403650001102237650001702248650001702265650001302282650001002295650001502305650002302320650001202343650002102355650002102376650002002397650002302417650001602440650001702456650002302473650001102496650001502507650002202522650002802544650001302572650002002585653002202605653001702627653002302644700001502667700001502682773007002697852000902767856008902776930003302865945002502898946001102923655001202934IND4374749420221118091941.0050927e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437474942DNAL7 a220609222pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.04.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMonson, F.10aInfluence of breed and ageing time on the sensory meat quality and consumer acceptability in intensively reared beef  ap. 471-479.  a2019-12-05  aThe meat market is very concerned about the influence of ageing on beef quality. However, not many studies have analysed the possible influence of the intrinsic factors (individual, age, sex, body condition, breed, etc.), on the development of the ageing process. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of breed on the sensory characteristics of the meat throughout the ageing time, using a trained sensory panel and a consumer test. Forty entire males of four breeds, which represented different biotypes (dairy: 10 Spanish Holstein; dual purpose: 10 Brown Swiss; meat type: 10 Limousin; high muscularity: 10 Blonde d'Aquitaine) were analysed. Animals were weaned at seven months on average (except Holstein calves, which were weaned earlier), and fed intensively. Each breed was slaughtered at its usual commercial live weight, according to the market requirements. The m. Longissimus thoracis et lumborum (between T6 and L6) was cut, vacuum packaged and aged for 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 35 days. Cooked samples were evaluated by 8 panellists and 200 consumers. Breed had a significant influence on tenderness (p < 0.001) and on the quantity of residue after chewing for panellists (p < 0.01), but there was a significant interaction between breed and ageing time for tenderness. Long ageing times (more than seven days) tend to reduce differences among breeds in textural characteristics. Ageing had a very important effect on tenderness (p < 0.01) and also on some odour and flavour characteristics evaluated by the panel. Taking into account the results obtained in the consumer test, the consumption of the Limousin meat may be recommended at shorter ageing times, meanwhile Blonde d'Aquitaine, Holstein and Old Brown Swiss meats would need a longer ageing period to obtain an optimum acceptance by the consumer. 3agender 3abeef quality 3adairy cattle 3aHolstein 3aodors 3aanimal age 3asensory evaluation 3atexture 3aslaughter weight 3avacuum packaging 3acooking quality 3afood acceptability 3aBrown Swiss 3astorage time 3alongissimus muscle 3aflavor 3ameat aging 3abreed differences 3aLimousin (cattle breed) 3abiotypes 3ameat tenderness 0alongissimus dorsi 0adairy breeds 0asensory properties1 aSanudo, C.1 aSierra, I.0 tMeat science.g2005 Nov., v. 71, no. 3 p.471-479x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.04.0263Available from publisher's Web site  a20051017b20051102c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/09/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02755naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072001700168072001700185100001800202245008700220300001600307500001500323520140300338650002301741650002601764650001701790650001601807650002001823650002301843650000901866650002201875650001201897650001501909653002201924700002601946700001501972700001601987700001402003700001902017773007002036852000902106856008902115930003302204945002502237946001102262655001202273IND4374750920221118091932.0050927e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437475092DNAL7 a220609302pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.04.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGeesink, G.H.10aQuantification of calpastatin using an optical surface plasmon resonance biosensor  ap. 537-541.  a2019-12-05  aAn immunological biosensor for calpastatin was developed on a surface plasmon resonance based system (Biacore Q). The performance of the biosensor assay was evaluated using ovine and bovine muscle and heart extracts with known calpastatin activity. In addition, the relationship between immunologically detectable calpastatin at 1 day postmortem and shear force at 14 days postmortem was investigated for bovine longissimus dorsi. Calpastatin biosensor results for several experiments were linearly related to calpastatin activity measurements with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.51 to 0.99. The intra- and inter-assay CVs were <6% (n = 12). During postmortem storage, the amount of immunologically detectable calpastatin decreased faster than the inhibitory activity in the enzymatic assay. Probably, the epitope recognized by the antibody is degraded faster than the inhibitory sites of calpastatin during postmortem storage. Calpastatin content at 1 day postmortem was correlated to shear force at 14 days postmortem (r = 0.75). It is anticipated that developments in the near future will allow for at-line calpastatin determinations in beef plants. At present, the calpastatin biosensor assay appears suitable for research purposes where large numbers of samples need to be processed for breed evaluation or selection programs because this assay requires less labor than other methods. 3apostmortem changes 3aquantitative analysis 3abeef quality 3acalpastatin 3ameat tenderness 3alongissimus muscle 3abeef 3aoptical equipment 3acalpain 3abiosensors 0alongissimus dorsi1 aPalen, J.G.P. van der1 aKent, M.P.1 aVeiseth, E.1 aHemke, G.1 aKoohmaraie, M.0 tMeat science.g2005 Nov., v. 71, no. 3 p.537-541x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.04.0373Available from publisher's Web site  a20051017b20051102c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/09/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03168naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072001700168072001700185072001700202100001800219245015700237300001400394500011800408500001500526520160900541650002102150650002202171650001802193650002302211650001402234650001702248650001302265650001002278650001302288650001902301650002702320650002602347650002202373650001402395653002902409773006902438852000902507856008902516930003302605945002502638946001102663655001202674IND4373450920221118091938.0050819e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437345092DNAL7 a220640522pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Hunt.  a2019-12-05  aShiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) cause sporadic or epidemic food- or water-borne illness whose clinical spectrum includes diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and the potentially fatal hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Over 200 STEC serotypes have now been implicated in human disease. Serotype O157:H7 is associated most outbreaks and most cases of HUS. Other serotypes are also associated with outbreaks and HUS but less commonly than serotype O157:H7, and some cause HUS but are typically non-epidemic. Many STEC serotypes have been associated with diarrhea, but not with outbreaks or HUS, while others, isolated from cattle, have never been linked to human disease. The only proven virulence strategies for STEC are Stx production and, in some strains, a characteristic attaching and effacing cytopathology on enterocyte that is mediated by factors encoded on a pathogenicity island (PAI) known as the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). But Stx subtypes and LEE cannot fully explain the apparent differences in virulence between STEC subgroups. However, publication of the genome sequences of two E. coli O157:H7 strains has revealed new candidate PAIs and has stimulated the use of novel approaches for assessing differences in virulence potential between groups of strains. This paper highlights the clinico-pathological features and pathogenesis of STEC infection, new information arising from E. coli O157:H7 genome sequences, and progress in the use of of comparative genomics for assessing potential differences in virulence and public health significance between STEC subgroups. 3aanimal pathology 3aShiga-like toxins 3apublic health 3amicrobial genetics 3aserotypes 3apathogenesis 3apandemic 3agenes 3agenomics 3afood pathogens 3aEscherichia infections 3aEscherichia coli O157 3afoodborne illness 3avirulence 0aEscherichia coli O157:H70 tMeat science.g2005 Sept., v. 71, no. 1 p.62-71x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.03.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20060130b20060202c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/08/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02834naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072001700168072001700185072001700202072001700219100001600236245016300252300001600415500011800431520121900549650002001768650001301788650001601801650003801817650002001855650001701875650003701892650001301929650002701942650001901969650002401988650001802012700001602030700001502046700001402061700001502075773007102090852000902161856008902170930003302259945002502292946001102317655001202328IND4373453920221118091125.0050819e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437345392DNAL7 a220640602pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Hunt.  aAs global populations and economies change, the dynamics of global trade and policy change as well. In analyzing the past trends and projections for global populations, economic developments, animal product production and consumption, global trade policy, and current issues being faced, one can begin to make some predictions or projections as to how the global red meat and poultry infrastructure will change and, more importantly, point to areas where a proactive approach is necessary to shape these changes to meet the most globally beneficial end. Many issues face the global red meat industry, from food safety to animal disease, and are becoming more and more complicated as consumer knowledge increases and as politics intervene. Internationalized science is key and vital in the future of global trade policy as science can address the more informed consumer in a manner, which reduces anxiety over unknowns. The role of the industry is to provide the information and knowledge to the consumer necessary to convey the validity of globally accepted standards, which relate to ensuring consumer safety, animal welfare, and provide assurances that these standards are being met within the production sector. 3ameat production 3ared meat 3afood safety 3ainternational policy and programs 3adecision making 3atrade policy 3abovine spongiform encephalopathy 3azoonoses 3aagricultural forecasts 3aanimal welfare 3aconsumer protection 3aglobalization1 aClayton, P.1 aStuart, B.1 aMyers, K.1 aSeng, P.M.0 tMeat science.g2005 Sept., v. 71, no. 1 p.150-157x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.04.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20060130b20060202c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/08/31  aNon-US 7aarticle03040naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072001700168072001700185072001700202100001500219245011800234300001600352520156700368650001001935650001401945650002001959650001501979650002101994650001802015650002702033651001002060651001902070651001202089651001202101700001602113700002202129700001502151700001602166700001702182700002302199700001702222700001902239700001502258773007002273852000902343856008902352930003302441945002502474946001102499655001202510IND4373444420221118091118.0050819e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437344442DNAL7 a220642242pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Concentrate fed lambs, as Spanish lambs, displayed the highest proportions of linoleic acid (C18:2), while Uruguayan lambs, reared under extensive grazing conditions, showed the highest proportions of linolenic acid (C18:3), due to the great concentration of this fatty acid in grass. German and British lambs, which were fed grass and concentrate, displayed intermediate proportions of linolenic acid (C18:3). Heavy Uruguayan lambs had higher intramuscular fat content (5.92%) than German (4.25%) and British (4.32%) lambs, and this content was twofold higher than light lambs (Spanish (2.41%) and light Uruguayan (3.05%)). Heavy Uruguayan, German and British lambs had a low polyunsaturated/saturated (P/S) ratio due to their high saturated fatty acid (SFA) content and proportion. Principal component analysis was performed to study the relationship between fatty acids. Spanish lambs were clearly separated from the other types and were situated close to the proportions of short chain and n - 6 fatty acids and n - 6/n - 3 ratio in the data plot for fatty acid proportions. Light Uruguayan lambs were located close to long chain fatty acids, and heavy Uruguayan and British lambs were placed near the antithrombotic potential (ATT), stearic acid (C18:0), SFA and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) proportions. German lambs were located between Spanish lambs and the other types. 3alambs 3alamb meat 3ameat production 3acastration 3aanimal husbandry 3alipid content 3afatty acid composition 3aSpain 3aUnited Kingdom 3aGermany 3aUruguay1 aAlvarez, I.1 aFuente, J. de la.1 aSanudo, C.1 aCampo, M.M.1 aOliver, M.A.1 aFont i Furnols, M.1 aMontossi, F.1 aSan Julian, R.1 aNute, G.R.0 tMeat science.g2005 Oct., v. 71, no. 2 p.256-263x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.03.0203Available from publisher's Web site  a20050920b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/09/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02832naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072001700168072001700185072001700202072001700219100001400236245009100250300001600341520124600357650001601603650001801619650001001637650002301647650001901670650002101689650002101710650002001731650002401751650001101775650001401786650004401800650002601844650001001870650002301880650001201903650001001915650001901925650001401944650001401958650001401972650001701986700001402003773007002017852000902087856008902096930003302185945002502218946001102243655001202254IND4373444920221118091121.0050819e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437344492DNAL7 a220642292pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.03.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLee, E.J.10aQuality characteristics of irradiated turkey breast rolls formulated with plum extract  ap. 300-305.  aThe effects of adding 1%, 2% and 3% plum extract on the quality characteristics of vacuum-packaged, irradiated ready-to-eat turkey breast rolls were determined. Turkey breast rolls were sliced, packaged and irradiated at 0 or 3 kGy using a Linear Accelerator. Lipid oxidation, volatile profiles, color, texture, proximate analysis and sensory characteristics of sliced turkey breast rolls were determined at 0 and 7 days of storage. Addition of plum extract had no detectable effect on the proximate analysis of turkey breast rolls. Plum extract increased a* and b* values, and decreased L* value of turkey breast rolls due to the original color of plum extract. Addition of >2% plum extract to turkey breast rolls was effective in controlling lipid oxidation of irradiated meat and the production of aldehydes (hexanal, heptanal, octanal, and nonanal) in non-irradiated meat at Day 0. Texture of turkey breast rolls was not influenced, but juiciness was increased by plum extract. Therefore, addition of 3% or higher of plum extract is recommended to improve mouth-feel and antioxidant effect in irradiated turkey breast rolls. However, the color of turkey breast rolls with 3% plum extract was dark and might not be appealing to consumers. 3aturkey meat 3abreast muscle 3arolls 3aready-to-eat foods 3afood packaging 3avacuum packaging 3afood irradiation 3agamma radiation 3aoxidative stability 3alipids 3aoxidation 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3aproximate composition 3acolor 3avolatile compounds 3atexture 3aplums 3afruit extracts 3aoff odors 3ajuiciness 3amouthfeel 3aantioxidants1 aAhn, D.U.0 tMeat science.g2005 Oct., v. 71, no. 2 p.300-305x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.03.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20050920b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/09/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02686naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072001700168072001700185072001700202072001700219100002000236245012900256300001600385500001500401520121400416650001501630650001601645650001801661650002301679650002101702650002701723650002301750650002501773650000801798650001801806650001001824650002001834650001501854650001201869650001001881653002501891700001501916773007001931852000902001856008902010930003302099945002502132946001102157655001202168IND4373444720221118091124.0050819e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437344472DNAL7 a220642272pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.03.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCarrapiso, A.I.10aInstrumental colour of Iberian ham subcutaneous fat and lean (biceps femoris): Influence of crossbreeding and rearing system  ap. 284-290.  a2019-12-05  aThe influence of crossbreeding (Iberian vs Iberian x Duroc 50% pigs) and rearing system (Montanera vs Pienso) on the instrumental colour of Iberian ham (subcutaneous fat and biceps femoris muscle) and the relationships to sensory appearance and chemical composition were researched by using a factorial design. In subcutaneous fat, a significant effect (p < 0.05) of crossbreeding and rearing system was found: b* and chroma were larger in hams from Iberian pigs than from Iberian x Duroc (50%) pigs, and L*, a* and chroma were larger in Pienso hams than in Montanera hams. CIEL*a*b* variables of subcutaneous fat were closely related to subcutaneous fatty acid composition, the largest correlationships involving L* (L* and 18:0, 0.652, p < 0.001; L* and 18:1, -0.616, p < 0.001). Instrumental colour variables and sensory appearance were also correlated (L* and fat pinkness, -0.539, p < 0.001). In lean (biceps femoris), instrumental colour data was not affected by crossbreeding and rearing system. CIEL*a*b* variables were not related to chemical composition (moisture, NaCl, intramuscular fat and pigment content), although they were correlated to sensory appearance (L* and marbling, 0.419, p = 0.014). 3adried meat 3acured meats 3alipid content 3asensory evaluation 3aanimal husbandry 3afatty acid composition 3asensory properties 3aappearance (quality) 3aham 3awater content 3acolor 3asodium chloride 3acrossbreds 3abackfat 3aswine 0achemical composition1 aGarcia, C.0 tMeat science.g2005 Oct., v. 71, no. 2 p.284-290x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.03.0243Available from publisher's Web site  a20050920b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/09/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02136naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072001700168072001700185100002000202245009500222300001600317520101200333650001701345650001501362650001901377650002001396650001801416650001401434650001701448650002501465700002301490773007001513852000901583856008901592930003301681945002501714946001101739655001201750IND4373448320221118091129.0050819e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437344832DNAL7 a220642382pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.04.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMaikhunthod, B.10aHeat and ultrafiltration extraction of broiler meat carnosine and its antioxidant activity  ap. 364-374.  aThis study examined the effects of extraction and further ultrafiltration on the carnosine content, antioxidant activity and total iron content of chicken muscle extracts. Fresh breast meat had 7-fold higher carnosine than fresh thigh meat (2900 versus 419 microgram/g meat, respectively). Carnosine extracts of breast and thigh were prepared by heating at 60, 80 and 100 degrees C, and ultrafiltration (UF) using a 5000 MW cut-off. At increasing temperatures, protein concentrations decreased while carnosine, total iron and antioxidant activity increased. Antioxidant abilities of the 80 and 100 degrees C-heated extracts were greater than that of the 60 degrees C extract (p < 0.05). The ultrafiltrate from the 80 degrees C-heated extract had approximately 20% higher carnosine, but 40% lower protein and 10-30% lower iron than the 80 degrees C-heated ultrafiltrate. However, compared in terms of carnosine concentration, the meat extracts had greater antioxidant activity than pure carnosine (p < 0.05). 3achicken meat 3aextraction 3aheat treatment 3aultrafiltration 3ameat extracts 3acarnosine 3aantioxidants 3aantioxidant activity1 aIntarapichet, K.O.0 tMeat science.g2005 Oct., v. 71, no. 2 p.364-374x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.04.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20050920b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/09/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02483naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072001700168072001700185072001700202072001700219072001700236072001700253100001400270245005200284300001600336500001500352520096200367650002501329650000901354650002001363650001601383650001401399650001601413650001801429650001701447650001701464650002001481650000901501650003101510650002101541650001501562650001901577650001101596650001201607653001801619700001501637700001601652773007001668852000901738856008901747930003301836945002501869946001101894655001201905IND4373447120221118091130.0050819e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437344712DNAL7 a220642342pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aThiem, I.10aExtraction of meat juices for isotopic analysis  ap. 334-341.  a2019-12-05  aSo far no standard procedure exists to obtain water of meat for isotopic 18O/16O-water analysis. Fast extraction via heating the tissues is possible when considering certain boundary conditions. A specially designed vessel was tested with water and was then used for meat juice extraction. The reproducibility (sigma) of delta18O-values was 0.12 per thousand. Meat samples of six different species were analysed. Water of pork samples was extracted after open storage. Here, decreases in meat weight correspond to decreases in extract yield and to an increase in the 18O/16O-ratio. The mean water contents in extracts was almost constant [93.2 +/- 0.05 wt% (p > 0.05)]. The technique offers an opportunity to develop an automatic, mobile extraction device and to obtain extracts with no further influences on their quality. This method could also be useful for the determination of meat quality attributes as cooking loss or drip without evaporative losses. 3aproduct authenticity 3apork 3acooking quality 3atemperature 3adrip loss 3ameat juices 3ameat extracts 3ameat quality 3afood storage 3aprocessed foods 3abeef 3aisotope dilution technique 3afood composition 3aextraction 3aheat treatment 3aoxygen 3apoultry 0ameat products1 aLüpke, M.1 aSeifert, H.0 tMeat science.g2005 Oct., v. 71, no. 2 p.334-341x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.04.0233Available from publisher's Web site  a20050920b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/09/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03142naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001900144245016200163300001600325500001500341520199800356650002102354650001402375650001702389650002302406650000902429650002002438650001502458650002302473650001002496653002202506700001802528700002002546700001802566773007002584852000902654930003302663945002502696946001102721655001202732IND4373444520221118090803.0050819e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437344452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBaublits, R.T.10aEffects on enhancement with varying phosphate types and concentrations, at two different pump rates on beef biceps femoris instrumental color characteristics  ap. 264-276.  a2019-12-05  aThe effect of enhancing beef biceps femoris muscles (n = 45) with solutions comprising 2.0% sodium chloride and either sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP), sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), or tetrasodium pyrophosphate (TSPP) at either 0.2% or 0.4% of product weight on instrumental color during simulated retail display was investigated. All solutions were injected into muscle samples at either 112% (12% pump) or 118% (18% pump) of raw product weight. Muscles treated with all three phosphate types had lower (P < 0.05) L* and b* values compared to untreated muscles (CNT). Steaks enhanced with STPP had similar (P > 0.05) a* values as CNT, whereas SHMP- and TSPP-treated steaks generally had lower a* values than CNT. Across phosphate type, excluding day 3 of display, steaks treated with phosphate at 0.4% had similar (P > 0.05) a* values as CNT, whereas those with 0.2% phosphate addition had lower (P < 0.05) a* values than CNT. Across five days of display, STPP maintained higher (P < 0.05) a* values than steaks treated only with sodium chloride, whereas SHMP did not differ (P > 0.05) from sodium chloride-treated steaks. While STPP maintained a similar (P > 0.05) saturation index as CNT, SHMP and TSPP generally had decreased (P < 0.05) vividness during display. Additionally, excluding day 3 of display, phosphate concentration at 0.4% maintained similar vividness as CNT, whereas 0.2% phosphate concentration caused decreased (P < 0.05) vividness, compared to CNT. The 630/580 nm ratio results indicated that SHMP had less (P < 0.05) oxymyoglobin than CNT throughout display. Disregarding day 3 of display, both STPP and TSPP had similar (P > 0.05) oxymyoglobin proportions as CNT. These results indicate that STPP was the most effective phosphate type for maintaining color. Additionally, 0.4% phosphate concentrations can maintain color better than 0.2% phosphate concentrations. However, none of the phosphate/salt combinations produced superior color, compared to untreated steaks. 3asodium phosphate 3amyoglobin 3abeef quality 3alongissimus muscle 3abeef 3asodium chloride 3amarinating 3asalt concentration 3acolor 0alongissimus dorsi1 aPohlman, F.W.1 aBrown, A.H.

For the total trial, WSC resulted in a 4% increase (P < .01) in ADG vs GC, and supplemental fiber resulted in increased (P < .01) DMI and ADG vs the control diet. Experiment 2 was conducted using 12 Targhee and Polypay crossbred wether lambs (initial BW 25 +/- 7 kg) to determine the effects of corn processing and fiber source in high-concentrate diets on diet digestibility and N retention using the same diets as in Exp. 1. Lambs fed WSC had greater (P < .001) apparent N digestion, true N digestion, and N retention (P < .01) than those fed GC. The apparent digestibilities of DM, OM and NDF were greater (P < .001) for WSC than for GC diets. Peanut hulls resulted in decreased (P < .01) DM, OM, and NDF apparent digestibilities compared with the control and SBH diets. Starch digestion was not affected (P > .10) by diet. Whole corn resulted in improved DM, OM, NDF, and N digestibility compared with GC. Overall, both the SBH and PH diets resulted in greater DMI and ADG than the control diet, which lacked supplemental fiber. 3alambs 3anitrogen metabolism 3acorn 3aweight 3adigestibility 3asoybean hulls 3afeed intake 3aliveweight gain 3afeed conversion 3apelleted feeds 3aconcentrates 3aorganic matter 3aprocessing technology 3adietary fiber 3aanimal organs 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aDietary Fiber 2aDigestion 2aFemale 2aFood Handling 2aMale 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aOrgan Size 2aSheepxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aViscera 2aZea mays 0anitrogen retention 0apeanut husks 0agrowth 0aperformance1 aFluharty, F.L.1 aPerley, J.E.1 aLoerch, S.C.1 aLowe, G.D.0 tJournal of animal science.g1999 Mar., v. 77, no. 3 p.507-515x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02629naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245010000148300001600248500001500264520120500279650001101484650001001495650002001505650001401525650001401539650001801553650001901571650000901590650001901599650002401618650002601642650002701668650001201695650002101707650000901728650001401737650003901751650002001790650000901810653002501819653002601844653001601870700001901886700001401905700001701919773008301936852000902019930003302028945001302061946001302074655001202087IND2201017820221118090746.0991008e199903  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220101782DNAL7 a102293632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHendriks, W.H.10aHeat processing changes the protein quality of canned cat foods as measured with a rat bioassay  ap. 669-676.  a2019-12-05  aThe purpose of this study was to determine the influence of increasing heat treatment on the protein quality of a canned cat food. A standard recipe cat food was canned and heat-treated for different times in a laboratory autoclave to obtain experimental diets containing different lethality values. Estimates of the lethality value of the different diets were calculated using the temperature-time relationship recorded with a data logger positioned at the center of the can. The experimental diets were analyzed for crude protein, amino acids, and reactive lysine (fluorodinitrobenzene and O-methylisourea) and were used in a rat bioassay for the determination of the true ileal digestibility of amino acids. The heat treatment of the cat food resulted in experimental diets with lethality values of 5.3, 8.6, 17.2, and 24.3 min. There was no decrease in the amino acid content of diet with increasing heat treatment. The reactive lysine content of diets also showed no change with heat treatment. There were significant (P < .05) changes in the true ileal digestibility of all amino acids and amino acid nitrogen, and the digestibility of most amino acids decreased with increasing heat treatment. 3alysine 3aileum 3anutritive value 3abioassays 3apet foods 3adigestibility 3aamino nitrogen 3arats 3aheat treatment 3aprotein composition 2aAmino Acidsxanalysis 2aAnimal Feedxstandards 2aAnimals 2aBiological Assay 2aCats 2aDigestion 2aFood Handlingxmethodsxstandards. 2aHot Temperature 2aRats 0achemical composition 0aprocessing technology 0aamino acids1 aEmmens, M.M.A.1 aTrass, B.1 aPluske, J.R.0 tJournal of animal science.g1999 Mar., v. 77, no. 3 p.669-676x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02790naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245008300146300001600229500001500245520126600260650001601526650001501542650001301557650002101570650001801591650002101609650001201630650001101642650001601653650001201669650002601681650003001707650002301737650002901760650003801789650001101827650002301838650002301861650003601884650000901920650003401929650002501963653002001988653001202008653001502020700001902035700001902054773008302073852000902156930003302165945001302198946001302211655001202224IND2201017920221118090733.0991008e199903  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220101792DNAL7 a102293642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarren, L.K.14aThe influence of betaine on untrained and trained horses exercising to fatigue  ap. 677-684.  a2019-12-05  aBecause exercise fatigue has been associated with the accumulation of lactic acid, factors that influence lactate metabolism during exercise can potentially enhance performance. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of supplemental betaine on eight mature Thoroughbred horses before and after 8 wk of conditioning. The effects of betaine were tested in two cross-over design experiments, allowing each horse to receive both the control and betaine treatments at each fitness level. Ingestion of 80 mg of betaine/kg of BW for 14 d before exercise testing did not alter plasma lactate, glucose, free fatty acids (FFA), or triglyceride concentrations during exercise in the untrained or trained horses. A time x treatment interaction (P < .05) was observed for plasma lactate in untrained horses during recovery from exercise, and plasma lactate concentrations were lower (P < .05) at 60 min after exercise when untrained horses received betaine. Plasma FFA concentrations were lower (P < .05) before exercise and at 720 min after exercise when untrained horses received betaine. These data indicate that betaine may influence lactate metabolism following exercise in untrained horses; however, betaine does not seem beneficial for trained horses. 3afatty acids 3ametabolism 3aexercise 3aphysical fitness 3ablood glucose 3atriacylglycerols 3abetaine 3ahorses 3alactic acid 2aAnimals 2aBetainexpharmacology 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aCross-Over Studies 2aFatiguexphysiopathology 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFemale 2aHorsesxphysiology 2aLactic Acidxblood 2aLipotropic Agentsxpharmacology 2aMale 2aPhysical Conditioning, Animal 2aTriglyceridesxblood 0ablood chemistry 0afatigue 0aevaluation1 aLawrence, L.M.1 aThompson, K.N.0 tJournal of animal science.g1999 Mar., v. 77, no. 3 p.677-684x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03648naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245014100143300001600284500001500300520214700315650002302462650002402485650002402509650003702533650001702570650002002587650002502607650006002632650001202692650005202704650002302756650002402779650003102803650001402834650002302848653001502871653001102886653002202897653001502919653002402934700001802958700001502976773008302991852000903074930003303083945001303116946001303129655001203142IND2201015620221118090721.0991008e199903  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220101562DNAL7 a102293502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGates, P.10a"Quasi-REML" correlation estimates between production and health traits in the presence of selection and confounding: a simulation study  ap. 558-568.  a2019-12-05  aPerformance of the "quasi-REML" method for estimating correlations between a continuous trait and a categorical trait, and between two categorical traits, was studied with Monte Carlo simulations. Three continuous, correlated traits were simulated for identical populations and three scenarios with either no selection, selection for one moderately heritable trait (Trait 1, h(2) = to .25), and selection for the same trait plus confounding between sires and management groups. The "true" environmental correlations between Traits 2 (h(2) = .10) and 3 (h(2) = .05) were always of the same absolute size (.20), but further data scenarios were generated by setting the sign of environmental correlation to either positive or negative. Observations for Traits 2 and 3 were then reassigned to binomial categories to simulate health or reproductive traits with incidences of 15 and 5%, respectively. Genetic correlations (r(g12), r(g13), and r(g23)) and environmental correlations (r(e12), r(e13), and r(e23)) were estimated for the underlying continuous scale (REML) and the visible categorical scales ("quasi-REML") with linear multiple-trait sire and animal models. Contrary to theory, practically all "quasi-REML" genetic correlations were underestimated to some extent with the sire and animal models. Selection inflated this negative bias for sire model estimates, and the sign of r(e23) noticeably affected r(g23) estimates for the animal model, with greater bias and SD for estimates when the "true" r(e23) was positive. Transformed "quasi-REML" environmental correlations between a continuous and a categorical trait were estimated with good efficiency and little bias, and corresponding correlations between two categorical traits were systematically overestimated. Confounding between sires and contemporary groups negatively affected all correlation estimates on the underlying and the visible scales, especially for sire model "quasi-REML" estimates of genetic correlation. Selection, data structure, and the (co)variance structure influences how well correlations involving categorical traits are estimated with "quasi-REML" methods. 3aMonte Carlo method 3amathematical models 3agenetic correlation 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aheritability 3aanimal breeding 3aartificial selection 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aAnimals 2aBreedingxmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aModels, Biological 2aModels, Statistical 2aMultifactorial Inheritance 2aPhenotype 2aSelection, Genetic 0aevaluation 0atraits 0aselection program 0asimulation 0avariance components1 aJohansson, K.1 aDanell, B.0 tJournal of animal science.g1999 Mar., v. 77, no. 3 p.558-568x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle04320naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245013100145300001600276520240600292650001802698650001602716650001202732650001702744650002302761650001302784650001402797650001002811650002202821650002002843650001602863650001302879650001302892650001102905650002002916650002002936650001702956650001102973650001102984650001902995650002003014650001103034650002003045650001103065650001803076650001003094650001403104650001603118650003003134650004703164650001203211650001603223650003303239650000903272650000903281650001203290653001503302653001903317700001903336700001503355700001703370700001803387700001803405773008303423852000903506930003303515945001303548946001303561655001203574IND2200790420221118091109.0990928e199902  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220079042DNAL7 a101006582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMyers, S.E.10aPerformance and carcass traits of early-weaned steers receiving either a pasture growing period or a finishing diet at weaning  ap. 311-322.  aA 2-yr study was conducted to evaluate 1) steers fed ad libitum high concentrate after weaning (CONC), or 2) steers grown on pasture for 82 d, followed by high-concentrate finishing (PAST), on the performance and carcass traits of 74 early-weaned (117 d of age) steers. Potential breed differences were evaluated using crossbred steers of three types: 1) 3/4 Angus X 1/4 Simmental (BRI), 2) 3/4 Simmental X 1/4 Angus (CON), and 3) 1/2 Wagyu X 1/4 Angus X 1/4 Simmental (WAG). Steers were randomly assigned within breed to the two treatments. There was no interactions (P > .10), so the data were pooled over years. The CONC steers had an ADG that was .17 kg/d higher (P = .0001), intake 1.09 kg/d lower (P = .0001), and gain:feed ratio .013 unit better (.190 vs .177, P = .008) than PAST steers overall. Growing treatment did not affect total concentrate consumed (P = .97). The BRI steers required 31 d less than did CON steers (P = .008), and 23 d less than WAG steers (P = .05) when fed to a constant fat end point (1.1 cm). The BRI steers exhibited an ADG .16 kg/d higher (P = .0003), tended (P = .07) to have an ADG intake .49 kg/d higher, and exhibited gain:feed .01 unit better (.189 vs 180) than WAG steers. When compared with CON steers, BRI steers consumed 310 kg less total concentrate (P = .0003). No differences (P > .38) were observed between growing treatments for carcass characteristics or sensory attributes except that CONC steers tended (P = .11) to improve percentage of steers grading Average Choice or higher by 47% over PAST steers. The WAG steers had a 76-unit higher marbling score (1,000 = Small00, 1,100 = Modest00) (P = .006) than BRI steers, resulting in 19% more (P = .09) steers grading greater than or equal to Choice and 82% more (P = .03) grading greater than or equal to Average Choice. Liver (P = .15) and rumen (P = .01) weights as a percentage of hot carcass weight were reduced for CONC steers. The CONC steers had higher gain, lower intake, better efficiency, reduced liver and rumen weights, and consumed the same amount of total concentrate when compared with PAST steers. The BRI steers had less finishing days and lower daily intake compared with CON steers. The WAG steers had more days finishing, lower gain, lower intake, more undesirable efficiencies, consumed the same amount of total concentrate, and improved quality grades compared with BRI steers. 3awater content 3abeef cattle 3agrazing 3aconcentrates 3aad libitum feeding 3acrossing 3aSimmental 3aWagyu 3abreed differences 3aliveweight gain 3afeed intake 3afeedlots 3aduration 3aheight 3afeed conversion 3acarcass quality 3abeef quality 3asteaks 3aflavor 3ashear strength 3aprotein content 3alipids 3adigestive tract 3aweight 3aearly weaning 3aAngus 3afinishing 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aCattlexgrowth & development 2aMale 2aMeat 2aWeaning 0atenderness 0acooking losses1 aFaulkner, D.B.1 aNash, T.G.1 aBerger, L.L.1 aParrett, D.F.1 aMcKeith, F.K.0 tJournal of animal science.g1999 Feb., v. 77, no. 2 p.311-322x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a19991031b19991104c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03723naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002100129245012700150300001600277500017900293500001500472520223000487650002102717650001802738650001902756650001802775650002402793650002902817650001602846650002102862650003202883650001902915650001202934650001802946650001802964650002902982650000903011650001703020653001003037653002403047653001903071773008303090852000903173930003303182945001303215946001303228655001203241IND2200791420221118091102.0990928e199902  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220079142DNAL7 a101006652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLauderdale, J.W.10aWhat is the pharmaceutical industry doing, and what does the pharmaceutical industry want from animal science departments?  ap. 367-371.  aPaper presented at a symposium titled "What Should Animal Science Departments Be Doing to Address Contemporary Issues", at the ASAS 89th Annu. Mtg., July 1997, Nashville, TN.  a2019-12-05  aPerceived contemporary issues are 1) food safety and food healthfulness, 2) environment, 3) sustainability, 4) biotechnology, 5) animal well-being, 6) animals as food, and 7) research funding. Food safety is the paramount contemporary issue, and environment and sustainability issues can be considered as a single issue. Biotechnology, animal wellbeing, and animals as food are addressed in this paper as separate issues, but they can be considered as components of food safety and healthfulness. The pharmaceutical industry addresses these issues by providing safe and effective products to the livestock industry. These products are used to treat and prevent disease and to increase livestock production efficiency. These products contribute to a safe food supply, enhance protection of the environment, and increase the sustainability of animal agriculture through increased efficiency of livestock production. The pharmaceutical industry wants the following from animal science departments: 1) students skilled in deductive and inductive thinking and communicating to peers and the public; 2) regional research on food safety, such as irradiation, steaming of carcasses, E. colli contamination, antibiotic resistance, production facilities, and carcass contamination; 3) improved research to identify the food values of animal products and effective communication of that research to the public; 4) research on topics having the greatest potential to increase efficiency of animal production consistent with a positive impact on the environment and sustainability of animal production; 5) leadership in developing and using technologies such as biotechnology, not only as descriptors of biological processes, but as technologies to test hypotheses leading to new understandings of biology; 6) research on animal wellbeing and production facilities that foster animal wellbeing; 7) research and education on ethical and moral aspects of animals as food through encouragement of one or more staff members to become effective animal science department spokespersons; and 8) active participation in activities such as FAIR 95, Federation of Animal Science Societies, and multidepartmental and (or) interdisciplinary programs. 3aveterinary drugs 3adrug residues 3aanimal welfare 3abiotechnology 3auniversity research 3aenvironmental protection 3afood safety 3aresearch support 2aAnimal Husbandryxeducation 2aAnimal Welfare 2aAnimals 2aBiotechnology 2aDrug Industry 2aFood Industryxstandards 2aMeat 2aUniversities 0adrugs 0anon-food industries 0asustainability0 tJournal of animal science.g1999 Feb., v. 77, no. 2 p.367-371x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a19991031b19991104c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01113naa a2200229 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100001700117245001100134300001300145520053200158650001100690650001400701710005000715773005600765852000900821939003300830945000800863655001200871991630327780742620221118090735.0780201e196809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7794437282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeelig, R.A.10aGrapes  ap. 1-28.  aA review of the marketing of fresh grapes is presented.

During 2 yr, peripubertal heifers (n = 52) and cows (n = 327) received either 1) MGA for 18 d (d 0 = 1st d of MGA) plus an injection of P(4) and E(2) in sesame oil (vehicle) on d 11 to regress persistent ovarian follicles (MGA+P(4)), 2) MGA for 18 d plus vehicle on d 11 (MGA), or 3) two injections of PGF(2alpha) 10 d apart (d 7 and 17, PG). Concentration of P(4) was assessed in blood samples obtained on d 0, 7, and 17 to indicate estrual status (anestrual or estrual) during treatment to induce estrus synchrony. Observations for detection of estrus occurred every 6 h for 180 h following treatment cessation. Females showing estrus were inseminated 6 to 12 h after estrus detection. Conception to AI was determined by ultrasonography 35 to 40 d later. Conception rate was greater (P < .05) in females in the PG than in those in the MGA group but did not differ from conception rate of females, in the MGA+P(4) group. Among anestrual females, estrus synchrony rates were greatest (P < .10) among females treated with MGA+P(4). Among females that were estrual before treatment cessation, estrus synchrony rates were greater (P < .10) among females treated with MGA+P(4) or PG than among those given MGA. Pregnancy rates were greater (P > .05) among females that were anestrual before treatment cessation and treated with MGA or MGA+P(4) than among those treated with PG. Estrus synchronization using MGA+P(4) and E(2) differentially improves estrus synchronization and pregnancy rates among anestrual and estrual beef cattle while maintaining conception rate similar to those of PGF(2alpha)-treated females. 3abeef cows 3aestrous cycle 3amelengestrol 3aprogesterone 3aestradiol 3aovarian follicles 3aartificial insemination 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDrug Combinations 2aEstradiolxbloodxpharmacology. 2aEstrus Synchronizationxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aInsemination, Artificialxveterinary 2aMelengestrol Acetatexpharmacology 2aOvarian Folliclexdrug effects 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Rate 2aProgesteronexpharmacology 2aProgesterone Congenersxpharmacology 0asynchronized females1 aWehrman, M.E.1 aLindsey, B.R.1 aBergfeld, E.G.1 aMelvin, E.J.1 aQuintal, J.A.1 aZanella, E.L.1 aKojima, F.N.1 aKinder, J.E.0 tJournal of animal science.g1999 Mar., v. 77, no. 3 p.715-723x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02525naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001300129245007900142300001600221500001500237520120800252650002501460650001701485650001801502650001101520650001401531650002201545650001201567650002101579650002301600650005301623650003901676650002101715650002101736650002101757653001701778653001001795700001401805700001501819700001601834700001501850700001501865773008301880852000901963930003301972945001302005946001302018655001202031IND2201019320221118091440.0991008e199903  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220101932DNAL7 a102293742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDohi, H.10aSeparation of deterrents to ingestive behavior of cattle from cattle feces  ap. 756-761.  a2019-12-05  aFeeding-deterrent chemicals were extracted from cattle feces and then separated with three chromatographic methods. Behavioral two-choice test bioassays with cattle were used to examine the deterrent properties of the fractions. Cattle feces were extracted with diethyl ether, and the extracts were separated into neutral, acidic, and basic fractions. Of the three fractions, only the neutral fraction was a deterrent. Separation of the ether-soluble neutral chemicals was conducted with an open column of silica gel using four carrier solutions consisting of pentane and ether. Fraction B (eluted with the carrier solution; pentane:ether = 90:10) was the most effective deterrent among the four fractions. This fraction was divided into 10 fractions by liquid chromatography. Fractions 6, 7 and 8 seemed to deter cattle from feeding. The combined Fractions 6, 7, and 8 were separated into 15 fractions with HPLC. Deterrent activities were detected in Fractions 2, 3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, suggesting that deterrents were separated into two groups using HPLC. These results suggested that several specific chemicals in feces are involved in inhibiting cattle from ingesting grass near cattle feces. 3achemical composition 3aantifeedants 3afractionation 3acattle 3abioassays 3afeces composition 2aAnimals 2aBiological Assay 2aCattlexphysiology 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxveterinary 2aChromatography, Liquidxveterinary 2aFecesxchemistry 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFood Preferences 0adung patches 0afeces1 aOgura, S.1 aKosako, T.1 aHayashi, Y.1 aYamada, A.1 aShioya, S.0 tJournal of animal science.g1999 Mar., v. 77, no. 3 p.756-761x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle04758naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001200129245012300141300001600264500001500280520242700295650003302722650002002755650001102775650002002786650001102806650001602817650002502833650002002858650003502878650001802913650001502931650001602946650001202962650001602974650001202990650000903002650001403011650001203025650001903037650001803056650001403074650002803088650002403116650001903140650001203159650001603171650001103187650004003198650003303238650004903271650001903320650004303339650001403382650001103396650001603407650003103423650001403454650001103468650002403479650002303503650001703526650003003543653002103573653001703594653001903611653003103630653002403661700001403685700001903699700001603718700001903734773008303753852000903836930003303845945001303878946001303891655001203904IND2201018720221118091426.0991008e199903  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220101872DNAL7 a102293702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, J.10aReproductive, metabolic, and endocrine responses to feed restriction and GnRH treatment in primiparous, lactating sows  ap. 724-735.  a2019-12-05  aThe current experiment was carried out to determine whether exogenous GnRH treatment in primiparous, lactating sows undergoing feed restriction would improve reproductive performance after weaning. Sows were allocated to one of three treatments: AA sows (n = 8) were fed to appetite throughout a 28-d lactation, AR (n = 12) and AR + GnRH (n = 12) sows were fed as AA sows from farrowing to d 21 of lactation, and feed intake was reduced to 50% of the ad libitum intakes from d 22 to 28. The AR + GnRH sows received 800 ng of GnRH i.v. every 6 h from d 22 to 28 of lactation, and AA and AR sows received saline. Sow weight, backfat, and litter weight were recorded weekly. Within 2 d after farrowing, litter size was standardized to 8 to 10. At d 17 of lactation, an indwelling jugular catheter was surgically implanted in each sow. Blood samples were taken for characterization of plasma LH, FSH, insulin, IGF-I, and leptin by RIA at d 21 and before and after weaning on d 28 of lactation. After weaning, all sows were given ad libitum access to feed, checked for onset of standing estrus twice daily with mature vasectomized boars, and inseminated 12 and 24 h after onset of standing estrus with pooled semen from the same fertile boars (3 x 10(9) sperm/AI). After breeding, feed allowance was reduced to NRC (1988) requirements for gestation. At d 28 +/- 3 of gestation, sows were killed and ovulation rate and embryo survival were determined. Restricted sows lost most weight during lactation than AA sows (P < .02). During the period of feed restriction, plasma IGF-I and postprandial insulin and leptin in AR and Ar + GnRH sows, and LH pulse frequency in AR sows, were lower than those in AA sows (P < .04). Associations (P < .004) between plasma insulin and leptin and between leptin and mean LH concentrations were established. The LH pulse frequency in AR + GnRH sows did not differ from that in AA sows before weaning. After weaning, maximum, mean, and minimum LH concentrations in the AA and AR sows, and FSH concentrations in AR sows, increased (P < .05) in response to weaning. Paradoxically, GnRH treatment in lactation seemed to suppress the expected LH and FSH responses to weaning. Ovulation rate and embryo survival were not different among the three groups. In conclusion, although exogenous GnRH therapy restored LH secretion in feed-restricted sows, it did not improve overall reproductive performance. 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3aanimal proteins 3aleptin 3aembryo (animal) 3aestrus 3alitter size 3anutrition physiology 3ablood chemistry 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3aembryogenesis 3ametabolism 3abody weight 3aweaning 3afeed intake 3ainsulin 3asows 3amortality 3abackfat 3apregnancy rate 3alitter weight 3alactation 3aartificial insemination 3aluteinizing hormone 2aAdipose Tissue 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aFemale 2aFollicle Stimulating Hormonexblood 2aFood Deprivationxphysiology 2aGonadotropin-Releasing Hormonexpharmacology 2aInsulinxblood 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixanalysis 2aLactation 2aLeptin 2aLitter Size 2aLuteinizing Hormonexblood 2aOvulation 2aParity 2aProgesteronexblood 2aProteinsxanalysis 2aReproduction 2aSwinexbloodxphysiology. 0afood restriction 0areproduction 0aovulation rate 0ainsulin-like growth factor 0asexual reproduction1 aZak, L.J.1 aCosgrove, J.R.1 aShostak, S.1 aFoxcroft, G.R.0 tJournal of animal science.g1999 Mar., v. 77, no. 3 p.724-735x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle04261naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245017400147300001600321500001500337520254200352650001402894650002202908650001402930650001602944650001402960650001502974650001702989650001903006650001803025650001603043650001203059650003103071650002103102650003003123650004503153650002203198650007703220650003403297650001103331650002803342650005903370650002403429653001803453700001803471700001903489700001403508700002203522773008303544852000903627930003303636945001303669946001303682655001203695IND2201192220221118091404.0991020e199904  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220119222DNAL7 a103283612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHampton, J.H.10aRetention of a functional corpus luteum and peripheral concentrations of 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F2 alpha following metestrus administration of Syncro-Mate B  ap. 948-953.  a2019-12-05  aThis study was conducted to examine the effects of metestrus administration of SyncroMate-B (SMB) on PGF2alpha secretion and corpus luteum (CL) development. In a study replicated over 2 yr, cows were observed for spontaneous estrus in yr 1, and cows received an injection of 25 mg of PGF2alpha and were observed for subsequent estrus in yr 2. At standing estrus (estrus = d 1), cows were randomly allotted to receive either the standard SMB regimen (n = 40) on d 3 of the estrous cycle or no treatment (n = 8). Fifty percent (n = 20) of SMB-treated cows were administered PGF2alpha on d 10 of the estrous cycle 48 h prior to implant removal. Twice-daily blood samples were collected in the morning (AM) and evening (PM) from d 2 AM through d 14 AM of the treated estrous cycle and subsequently analyzed for progesterone (P4) and PGF2alpha metabolite (PGFM). Prior to statistical analysis, SMB- and SMB/PGF2alpha-treated cows were sorted according to P4 concentration at d 10 of the treated estrous cycle to either a CL functional group (P4 greater than or equal to 1 ng/mL; n = 20) or a CL nonfunctional group (P4 < 1 ng/mL; n = 17). Following d 10 AM administration of PGF2alpha, functional and nonfunctional groups were further subdivided based on treatment. The groups were as follows: untreated control cows (n = 8); SMB-treated cows retaining a functional CL (SMB-F; n = 8); SMB-treated cows with a nonfunctional CL (SMB-N; n = 11); SMB/PGF2alpha-treated cows retaining a functional CL (SMB/PG-F; n = 12); and SMB/PGF2alpha-treated cows with a nonfunctional CL (SMB/PG-N; n = 6). Of all SMB-treated cows, 54% retained a functional CL through d 10 AM of the treated estrous cycle. Mean serum P4 concentrations increased for cows in all groups until d 7, after which P4 concentrations increased for cows in SMB/PG-F, SMB-F, and control groups and decreased for cows in SMB/PG-N and SMB-N groups. Following PGF2alpha administration on d 10, mean serum P4 concentrations remained < 1 ng/mL for cows in SMB/PG-N and SMB-N groups, decreased to < 1 ng/mL for cows in the SMB/PG-F group, and remained > 1 ng/mL for cows in SMB-F and control groups. Mean serum PGFM concentrations tended (P = .06) to increase in cows with nonfunctional CL compared with control cows on d 8 AM and were greater (P < .05) in cows with functional CL on d 8 PM through d 9 PM. These results indicate that retention of a functional rather than a nonfunctional CL following metestrus administration of SMB is dependent on a premature release of uterine PGF2alpha. 3aestradiol 3ahormone secretion 3abeef cows 3ablood serum 3ametestrus 3aluteolysis 3aprogesterone 3aprostaglandins 3acorpus luteum 3ametabolites 2aAnimals 2aCattlexbloodxphysiology. 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aCorpus Luteumxphysiology 2aDinoprostxanalogs & derivativesxblood. 2aDrug Combinations 2aEstradiolxadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aEstrus Synchronizationxblood 2aFemale 2aMetestrusxdrug effects 2aPregnenedionesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aProgesteronexblood 0aestrous cycle1 aSpitzer, J.C.1 aHenricks, D.M.1 aHix, B.S.1 aHidgon, H.L.

Hydrophobic Bi2S3 nanoparticles were successfully introduced into the PLGA nanocapsules via a facile and efficient water/oil/water (W/O/W) emulsion strategy. The elastic polymeric PLGA shell provides the excellent capability of ultrasound contrast imaging to the Bi2S3/PLGA. Meanwhile, the potential of these microcapsules to enhance the high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy was demonstrated. Importantly, this research provided the first example of both in vitro and in vivo to demonstrate the radiosensitization effect of Bi2S3-embedded PLGA hybrid nanocapsules against prostate cancer under external X-ray irradiation. Thus, the successful integration of the Bi2S3 and PLGA nanocapsules provided an alternative strategy for the highly efficient ultrasound guided HIFU/RT synergistic therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aemulsions 3ahydrophobicity 3aimage analysis 3airradiation 3ananocapsules 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aradiotherapy 3aultrasonography 0aNanocapsule 0aHIFU 0aRadiotherapy 0aPLGA1 aMa, Ming1 aChen, Yu1 aJia, Xiao-qing1 aXu, Guang1 aXu, Hui-xiong1 aChen, Hang-rong1 aWu, Rong0 tBiomaterials.g2014 Sept., v. 35, no. 28 p.8197-8205dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03897naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006400147245006700211300001800278500001100296520183300307592002802140596006102168596003602229596004602265596005802311596004602369650002402415650002702439650002002466650002802486650001302514650003102527650001302558650001502571650002902586650001302615650001402628650001602642650001302658650002002671650001902691650001202710650002102722650001302743650001402756650003202770650001602802650001702818650001302835700006202848700001902910700006602929700006002995773013703055856008203192852000903274655001203283IND60675889920221117182427.0210731e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067588992DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-018-1882-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValenzuela, Pedro L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1730-336910aSupplements with purported effects on muscle mass and strength  ap. 2983-3008.  aReview  aPURPOSE: Several supplements are purported to promote muscle hypertrophy and strength gains in healthy subjects, or to prevent muscle wasting in atrophying situations (e.g., ageing or disuse periods). However, their effectiveness remains unclear. METHODS: This review summarizes the available evidence on the beneficial impacts of several popular supplements on muscle mass or strength. RESULTS: Among the supplements tested, nitrate and caffeine returned sufficient evidence supporting their acute beneficial effects on muscle strength, whereas the long-term consumption of creatine, protein and polyunsaturated fatty acids seems to consistently increase or preserve muscle mass and strength (evidence level A). On the other hand, mixed or unclear evidence was found for several popular supplements including branched-chain amino acids, adenosine triphosphate, citrulline, β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate, minerals, most vitamins, phosphatidic acid or arginine (evidence level B), weak or scarce evidence was found for conjugated linoleic acid, glutamine, resveratrol, tribulus terrestris or ursolic acid (evidence level C), and no evidence was found for other supplements such as ornithine or α-ketoglutarate (evidence D). Of note, although most supplements appear to be safe when consumed at typical doses, some adverse events have been reported for some of them (e.g., caffeine, vitamins, α-ketoglutarate, tribulus terrestris, arginine) after large intakes, and there is insufficient evidence to determine the safety of many frequently used supplements (e.g., ornithine, conjugated linoleic acid, ursolic acid). CONCLUSION: In summary, despite their popularity, there is little evidence supporting the use of most supplements, and some of them have been even proven ineffective or potentially associated with adverse effects.  aPublisher supplied data  aFPU14/03435cMinisterio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte  aFPI2016cUniversidad de Alcalá  a2017/UEM05cUniversidad Europea de Madrid  a2017/RM03cCátedra Real Madrid–Universidad Europea  aPI15/00558cInstituto de Salud Carlos III 3aTribulus terrestris 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadverse effects 3aalpha-ketoglutaric acid 3aarginine 3abranched chain amino acids 3acaffeine 3acitrulline 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3acreatine 3aglutamine 3ahypertrophy 3aminerals 3amuscle strength 3amuscle tissues 3amuscles 3amuscular atrophy 3anitrates 3aornithine 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aresveratrol 3aursolic acid 3avitamins1 aMorales, Javier S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3255-32461 aEmanuele, Enzo1 aPareja-Galeano, Helios1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5780-27121 aLucia, Alejandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3025-20600 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2019 Dec., v. 58, no. 8 p.2983-3008dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949855x1436-62077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-018-1882-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245013700164300001600301520143700317592002801754650002101782650001301803650001101816650001601827700002301843700002001866700001601886773011001902856004802012852000902060655001202069IND4449586820221119213152.0121003e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444958682DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-010-1101-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKacelnik, Alex10aDarwin’s “tug-of-war” vs. starlings’ “horse-racing”: how adaptations for sequential encounters drive simultaneous choice  ap. 547-558.  aCharles Darwin aided his private decision making by an explicit deliberation, famously deciding whether or not to marry by creating a list of points in a table with two columns: “Marry” and “Not Marry”. One hundred seventy-two years after Darwin’s wedding, we reconsider whether this process of choice, under which individuals assign values to their options and compare their relative merits at the time of choosing (the tug-of-war model), applies to our experimental animal, the European Starling, Sturnus vulgaris. We contrast this with the sequential choice model that postulates that decision-makers make no comparison between options at the time of choice. According to the latter, behaviour in simultaneous choices reflects adaptations to contexts with sequential encounters, in which the choice is whether to take an opportunity or let it pass. We postulate that, in sequential encounters, the decision-maker assigns (by learning) a subjective value to each option, reflecting its payoff relative to background opportunities. This value is expressed as latency and/or probability to accept each opportunity as opposed to keep searching. In simultaneous encounters, choice occurs through each option being processed independently, by a race between the mechanisms that generate option-specific latencies. We describe these alternative models and review data supporting the predictions of the sequential choice model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSturnus vulgaris 3alearning 3amodels 3aprobability1 aVasconcelos, Marco1 aMonteiro, Tiago1 aAw, Justine0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2011 Mar., v. 65, no. 3 p.547-558dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-010-1101-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005700140245009300197300001800290500002000308520100900328592002801337596005701365650002801422650002401450650001301474650002301487650000801510650001301518650002501531650002001556650001201576650001601588700006001604700001901664700001801683773015301701856007401854852000901928655001201937IND60656002320221122051710.0190808e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065600232DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.141882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHilbig, Jonas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8325-648714aThe influence of exopolysaccharide‐producing lactic acid bacteria on reconstructed ham  ap. 2763-2769.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe influence of in‐situ‐formed exopolysaccharides (EPS) by lactic acid bacteria (LAB; Lactobacillus sakeiTMW 1.411 and Lactobacillus plantarumTMW 1.1478) on the yield and texture of reconstructed ham was investigated. No differences in yield (P > 0.05) were observed but weight loss during storage was significantly higher (P < 0.05) for hams produced with L. sakei 1.411. Furthermore, the produced EPS decreased the hardness (P < 0.05; 50.22 N for control compared to 44.81 N) but did not influence the cohesiveness (P > 0.05) of hams. Products with L. plantarum 1.1478 showed no significant differences in comparison to the control. This could be attributed to the lower amount of EPS formed during ripening. L. sakei 1.411 produced 194.49 ± 5.34 mg kg⁻¹ EPS, whereas L. plantarum 1.1478 formed 60.26 ± 2.96 mg kg⁻¹ EPS. Thus, the use of the examined LAB is not recommended in reconstructed ham, since they have no or even a negative influence on the product quality.  aPublisher supplied data  aAiF 18357NcForschungskreis der Ernährungsindustrie 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aLactobacillus sakei 3acohesion 3aexopolysaccharides 3aham 3ahardness 3alactic acid bacteria 3aproduct quality 3atexture 3aweight loss1 aLoeffler, Myriam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3133-49061 aHerrmann, Kurt1 aWeiss, Jochen0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2019 Sept., v. 54, no. 9 p.2763-2769dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.141883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245007500173300001600248520133400264592002801598650001201626650002801638650001301666650001901679650001801698650003001716650001701746650001601763650001401779650002501793650001401818650001601832653002701848653002001875653001301895653002201908653001401930653002901944700002401973700002301997700002502020700002102045700003102066700003802097700001902135773011302154856008602267852000902353655001202362IND60555391720221120072856.0180831e20161120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055539172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.07.1362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehrali, Mohammad13aAn ecofriendly graphene-based nanofluid for heat transfer applications  ap. 555-566.  aHerein, a new ecofriendly approach to generate a graphene-based nanofluid was established. Specifically, a novel mode of graphene oxide reduction through functionalization with polyphenol extracted from red wine was introduced. Comprehensive characterization methods were employed to confirm and understand the reduction process of graphene oxide in the red wine polyphenol solution. It was noted, that the deoxygenation level of the reduced graphene oxide is comparable with the levels obtained by conventional and non-ecofriendly methods. The physical and thermal properties of the generated nanofluid including chemical stability, viscosity, wettability, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity were investigated in a comprehensive manner. A significant thermal conductivity enhancement amounting to 45.1% was obtained for a volume fraction of 4%. In addition, the convective heat transfer coefficient of the nanofluid in a laminar flow regime with uniform wall heat flux was investigated to estimate its cooling capabilities. These results, firmly confirm that the generated graphene-based nanofluid is a formidable transporter of heat and yet ecofriendly. Therefore, it's anticipate that the generated nanofluid will open a new avenue in the pursuit of ecofriendly thermal conductors for heat transfer applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3aelectrical conductivity 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3aheat transfer 3aheat transfer coefficient 3alaminar flow 3apolyphenols 3ared wines 3athermal conductivity 3aviscosity 3awettability 0aReduced graphene oxide 0aGreen reduction 0aRed wine 0aFunctionalization 0aNanofluid 0aHeat transfer properties1 aSadeghinezhad, Emad1 aAkhiani, Amir Reza1 aTahan Latibari, Sara1 aTalebian, Sepehr1 aDolatshahi-Pirouz, Alireza1 aMetselaar, Hendrik Simon Cornelis1 aMehrali, Mehdi0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Nov. 20, v. 137 p.555-566dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.07.1363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245017300172300001600345520117200361592002801533650001101561650001301572650001401585650001101599650001401610650001301624650001201637650001101649650001201660650002401672650001301696650001101709650001201720650002301732653001001755653002101765653001901786653001901805700001501824700001801839700001801857700002301875700002101898700001801919700001901937773011601956856008502072852000902157655001202166IND60485930920221116145439.0160218e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048593092DNAL7 a10.1080/15538362.2015.11267002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSofla, H.

We crossed two late ripening high quality apple cultivars (i.e., Golden Smoothie and Red Spur) as maternal parents with two Iranian domestic early ripening apple cultivars (i.e., Golab-e Kohanz and Shafi Abadi) as pollen parents in 2005 to breed new early ripening apple cultivars. We then measured qualitative and quantitative traits of 360 off spring during 2010 and 2011. Results of recorded traits on the 5th and 6th year of growth of the progeny showed that during two evaluation years, flowering and fruit ripening time, titrable acidity, SSC/acid ratio, and fruit weight had the highest coefficients of phenotypic variations. Progenies were classified in three groups: early, mid, and late ripening. Some of the selected progeny were better than their early ripening parental cultivars being earlier in the ripening, with larger fruit size and better texture and flavor. Genotypes A31, A32, I5, I23, and I57 were in the early ripening category, B11 and A34 were in the middle, and B77 and E21 were in the late ripening categories. These characteristics were considered to present an improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapples 3acrossing 3acultivars 3aflavor 3aflowering 3agenotype 3aparents 3apollen 3aprogeny 3aquantitative traits 3aripening 3aspring 3atexture 3atitratable acidity 0aApple 0acontrolled cross 0aearly ripening 0afruit firmness1 aZamani, Z.1 aTalaei, A.

This approach has mainly been demonstrated by using datasets originating from the same area A, with similar geopedological conditions, to build, validate and test prediction models. The objective of this study was to analyse how MIRS performs when applied to predict SOC and SIC contents, from a calibration database collected over a region A, to predict over a region B, where A and B have no common area and different soil and climate conditions. This study used a French MIRS soil dataset including 2178 topsoil samples to calibrate SIC and SOC prediction models with partial least squares regression (PLSR), and a Tunisian MIRS topsoil dataset including 96 soil samples to test them. Our results showed that when using the French MIRS soil database, i) the SOC and SIC of French validation samples were successfully predicted using global models (R²ᵥₐₗ = 0.88 and 0.98, respectively), ii) the SIC of Tunisian samples was also predicted successfully both using a global model and using a selection of spectral neighbours from the French calibration database (R²ₜₑₛₜ of 0.96 for both), iii) the SOC of Tunisian samples was predicted moderately well by global model (R²ₜₑₛₜ of 0.64) and a transformation by natural logarithm of the calibration SOC values significantly improved the SOC prediction of Tunisian samples (R²ₜₑₛₜ of 0.97), and iv) a transformation by natural logarithm of SOC values provided more benefit than a selection of spectral neighbours from the French calibration database for predicting Tunisian SOC values. Therefore, in the future, MIRS might replace conventional physico-chemical analysis techniques, or at least be considered as an alternative technique, especially when optimally exhaustive calibration databases will become available.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adatabases 3amodels 3aprediction 3areflectance spectroscopy 3asoil inorganic carbon 3asoil organic carbon 3atopsoil 0aSoil organic and inorganic carbon 0aMid-infrared reflectance spectroscopy 0aNatural logarithm transformation 0aLocal and global calibration 0aPartial least squares regression (PLSR) 0aNational dataset1 aChevallier, Tiphaine1 aMoulin, Patricia1 aBouferra, Imane1 aHmaidi, Kaouther1 aArrouays, D.q(Dominique),1 aJolivet, Claudy1 aBarthès, Bernard G.0 tGeoderma.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 375 p.114469-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.1144693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03508naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245008600166520192100252592002802173650001902201650002102220650001202241650002402253650002902277650002602306650001602332650002502348650001702373650001602390650000902406650000902415650001902424650002502443650002102468653002502489653002702514653001602541653001802557653001802575700001202593700001602605700001602621700001902637700001802656700001602674700001902690700001602709700001302725773011902738856008802857852000902945655001202954IND60756427020221116162320.0211227e20220210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075642702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1514352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yin10aPlastic mulch debris in rhizosphere: Interactions with soil-microbe-plant systems  aLarge amounts of plastic mulch debris (PMD) accumulated in the soil can endanger agroecosystems. However, little is known about the interactions between PMD and soil-microbe-plant systems. In this study, a pot experiment (four replicates) in tropical greenhouse was conducted to investigate the effects of PMD (polyethylene) at different concentrations (0, 0.4, 0.8, 4.0, 6.0 g kg⁻¹) on soil nutrients, rhizosphere bacterial communities and rice growth. This study further explored the interactive mechanisms between PMD and environmental factors based on correlation analysis and previous studies. The results showed that PMD continuously reduced the soil capabilities to store nutrients (C, N, P, humic-like substances) and increased the proportion of P and biodegradable dissolved organic matter (DOM). At the full ripening stage of rice growth, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in all PMD treatments significantly decreased by 60.86, 52.51 and 34.83% respectively as compared to CK (p < 0.05). Furthermore, PMD increased the total abundance of bacteria but reduced the diversity and evenness of bacterial communities, which further affected microbial metabolic functions. Total OTUs and Shannon decreased 0.02–17.05% and 0.69–7.55% in treatments. At harvest-time, PMD reduced the biomass and yield of rice with 11.34 and 19.24% (all treatments on average) lower than CK. Under the influence of PMD, the order of correlation size between PMD and one environmental factor was PMD-soil > PMD-microbe > PMD-plant, and the order of correlation between two environmental factors was soil-microbe > microbe-plant > soil-plant. Over all, PMD had the most significant negative effects on soil nutrients storage, followed by the change of microbial community structure and microbial metabolic functions. The negative effects of PMD on crops were relatively weak.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecosystems 3abiodegradability 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3adissolved organic matter 3aenvironmental factors 3agreenhouses 3aplastic film mulches 3apolyethylene 3arhizosphere 3arice 3asoil 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal organic carbon 3atotal phosphorus 0aPlastic mulch debris 0aRhizosphere microbiome 0aRice growth 0aSoil nutrient 0aAgroecosystem1 aHu, Wen1 aHuang, Qing1 aQin, Jiemin1 aZheng, Yingrui1 aWang, Junfeng1 aLi, Xiaohui1 aWang, Qingqing1 aGuo, Genmao1 aHu, Shan0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Feb. 10, v. 807 p.151435-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1514353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01346naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002200188245004700210300001800257520022900275592002800504650001500532650002200547650001600569650001300585650001200598650001500610650001500625650003400640650004800674650004200722773009500764856008100859990002300940852000900963655001200972IND60093945420221119224433.0141104e20120911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009394542DNAL7 a229749922pmid7 aPMC40906952pmcid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStarr, Daniel A.10aLaminopathies: Too Much SUN Is a Bad Thing  ap.

This study describes the structural organization of the chloroplast genome of M. balbisiana Colla and its phylogenetic relationship with other wild progenitors of the domesticated banana cultivars. The M. balbisiana chloroplast genome was sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, followed by a combination of de novo short‐read assembly and reference‐guided mapping of contigs to generate complete plastome sequence. The M. balbisiana chloroplast genome is 169,503 bp in length, exhibits a typical quadripartite structural organization with a large single‐copy (LSC; 87,828 bp) region and a small single‐copy (SSC; 11,547 bp) region interspersed between inverted repeat (IRa/b; 35,064 bp) regions. Overall, its gene content, size, and gene order were identical to that of M. acuminata Colla with extensive expansion of the inverted repeat–small single‐copy (IR‐SSC) junctions. Comparative analyses revealed the conserved IRa‐SSC expansion in three wild Musa species and members of the order Zingiberales. In contrast, IRb‐SSC expansion was conspicuously absent in the sister taxon M. textilis Nee and related species of Zingiberales. Interestingly, phylogenomic assessment based on whole‐plastome and protein‐coding gene sets have provided robust support for the association of M. balbisiana and M. textilis as a sister group, despite the variation in IRb‐SSC expansion. Although the current study substantiates the infrageneric IRb‐SSC fluctuations in Musaceae, extensive taxon sampling is necessary to confirm whether the accessions of section Musa have undergone independent IRb‐SSC expansion relative to section Callimusa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMusa balbisiana 3abananas 3achloroplast DNA 3achloroplast genome 3acultivars 3agene order 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny1 aMd Shah, Maria Ulfa1 aMakale, Kavyashree1 aMohd‐Yusuf, Yusmin1 aKhalid, Norzulaani1 aOthman, Rofina Yasmin0 tThe plant genome.g2016 July, v. 9, no. 2 p.eplantgenome2015.09.0089-dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4288766x1940-33727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3835/plantgenome2015.09.00893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245015700190300001400347520160600361592002801967650001101995650001602006650001102022650002502033650001202058650001702070650001102087650001902098650002102117650001402138650002602152650001402178650001702192700001702209700002602226700002702252700002202279700002002301700002302321700001502344700001502359773009802374856008102472852000902553655001202562IND60082064120221119023813.0141016e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008206412DNAL7 a249658672pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-014-1929-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCebada-Sánchez, S.10aDistribution of peptidergic populations in the human dentate gyrus (Somatostatin [SOM-28, SOM-12] and Neuropeptide Y [NPY]) during postnatal development  ap. 25-41.  aThe postnatal development of the human hippocampal formation establishes the time and place at which we start autobiographical memories. However, data concerning the maturation of the neurochemical phenotypes characteristic of interneurons in the human hippocampus are scarce. We have studied the perinatal and postnatal changes of the dentate gyrus (DG) interneuron populations at three rostrocaudal levels. Immunohistochemically identified neurons and fibers for somatostatin (SOM-12 and SOM-28) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) and the co-localization of SOM-28 and NPY were analyzed. In total, 13 cases were investigated from late pregnancy (1 case), perinatal period (6 cases), first year (1 case), early infancy (3 cases), and late infancy (2 cases). Overall, the pattern of distribution of these peptides in the DG was similar to that of the adult. The distribution of cells was charted, and the cell density (number of positive cells/mm²) was calculated. The highest density corresponded to the polymorphic cell layer and was higher at pre- and perinatal periods. At increasing ages, neuron density modifications revealed a decrease from 5 postnatal months onward. In contrast, by late infancy, two immunoreactive bands for SOM-28 and NPY in the molecular layer were much better defined. Double-immunohistochemistry showed that NPY-positive neurons co-localized with SOM-28, whereas some fibers contained only one or other of the neuropeptides. Thus, this peptidergic population, presumably inhibitory, probably has a role in DG maturation and its subsequent functional activity in memory processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3ahippocampus 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainfancy 3ainterneurons 3amemory 3aneuropeptide Y 3aperinatal period 3aphenotype 3apostnatal development 3apregnancy 3asomatostatin1 aInsausti, R.1 aGonzález-Fuentes, J.1 aArroyo-Jiménez, M.

European countries are gradually taking action towards the Farm to Fork Strategy, embracing a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) perspective to promote the sustainability of food production and consumption. Although LCA enables the comprehensive assessment of environmental impacts, diet-related human health and animal welfare impacts are often underrepresented. This study proposes integrating additional indicators into LCA to evaluate the sustainability of diets under the One Health (OH) approach, which holistically considers interlinked complex health issues between humans, animals and the environment. Human health loss is estimated according to risk factors for non-communicable diseases; while animal welfare is measured as animal life years suffered, loss of animal lives and loss of morally-adjusted animal lives. The extended LCA framework is applied to men and women's reference diets in the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW); compared to three optimized dietary scenarios under nutritional constraints: 1) the national dietary guidelines, 2) a vegan diet (VD) and 3) a Mediterranean diet (MD). Men's reference diet causes greater impacts than women's across OH dimensions due to the higher food consumption, especially of ready-to-eat meals, sausages, meat, and sweetened and alcoholic beverages. Both reference diets are associated with risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, stroke and neoplasms. Besides meat, consumption of honey, fish and seafood has the greatest impact on animal welfare, because of the high number of individuals involved. Alternative diets improve the sustainability of food consumption in NRW, although trade-offs arise: MD worsens animal suffering due to the higher fish intake; water use increases in both VD and MD due the higher intake of nuts and vegetables.

This study aims to substantiate the therapeutic efficacy of γ-EV as an anti-inflammatory agent in a dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced colitis porcine model. Colitis symptoms were observed after intra-gastric infusion of DSS for five days, followed by five days of administration of saline or γ-EV. γ-EV supplementation reduced DSS-induced weight loss and clinical signs, while preserving colonic architecture and intestinal permeability. Colonic production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 were reduced to a level observed in animals without DSS treatment. The colonic gene expression of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and interferon (IFN)-γ were also mitigated by γ-EV treatment, thus indicating γ-EV can restore immune homeostasis by attenuating inflammation. Our findings suggest that γ-EV supplementation may be a promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of intestinal inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3acolitis 3adextran 3adigestive system 3agene expression 3ahomeostasis 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3amodels 3apermeability 3asodium sulfate 3aswine 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avaline 3aweight loss 0aγ-EV 0aCaSR 0aDSS 0aROS 0aGI 0aIBD 0aIFN 0aIL 0aTNF 0aPBS 0aRT-PCR 0aPMSF 0aHBSS 0aH&E 0aβ-NAD 0aMPO 0aChronic inflammation 0aColitis 0aAnti-inflammatory activity 0aγ-glutamyl valine1 aKodera, Tomohiro1 aEto, Yuzuru1 aMine, Yoshinori0 tJournal of functional foods.g2016 June, v. 24 p.558-567dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2016.04.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024002200123024001900145040001800164100002800182245012000210300001600330506007600346520083000422592002801252506003701280650001701317650003401334650001301368650001501381650001801396650002601414650002001440653000901460653001201469653002801481653001501509653001301524700001801537700001701555700002101572700002201593700001801615773013001633856007501763852000901838655001201847IND60624541720221207094337.0181204e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062454172DNAL7 a10.1093/bfgp/elv0372doi7 aPMC58637702pmcid7 a264436132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColeman, Jonathan R.

However, there is a paucity of guidance for best practice in conducting such analyses. For the results of a study to be valid and replicable, multiple biases must be addressed in the course of data preparation and analysis. In addition, standardizing methods across small, independent studies would increase comparability and the potential for effective meta-analysis. This article provides a discussion of important aspects of quality control, imputation and analysis of genome-wide data from a low-coverage microarray, as well as a straight-forward guide to performing a genome-wide association study.

This limitation can complicate identification and characterization of genes located within presence–absence variations (PAVs). In this study, we present the draft de novo genome assembly of ‘PHJ89’, an ‘Oh43’‐type inbred line of maize (Zea mays L.). From three separate reference genome assemblies (‘B73’, ‘PH207’, and PHJ89) that represent the predominant germplasm groups of maize, we generated three separate whole‐seedling gene expression profiles and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) matrices from a panel of 942 diverse inbred lines. We identified 34,447 (B73), 39,672 (PH207), and 37,436 (PHJ89) transcripts that are not present in the respective reference genome assemblies. Genome‐wide association studies were conducted in the 942 inbred panel with both the SNP and expression data values to map Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) resistance. Highlighting the impact of alternative reference genomes in gene discovery, the GWAS results for SCMV resistance with expression values as a surrogate measure of PAV resulted in robust detection of the physical location of a known resistance gene when the B73 reference that contains the gene was used, but not the PH207 reference. This study provides the valuable resource of the Oh43‐type PHJ89 genome assembly as well as SNP and expression data for 942 individuals generated from three different reference genomes.  aPublisher supplied data  a2012‐67013‐19460cthe National Research Initiative for Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program  aDE‐FC02‐07ER64494cDepartment of Energy (DOE) Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center 3aSugarcane mosaic virus 3aZea mays 3acorn 3agene expression 3agenome assembly 3agenome-wide association study 3agermplasm 3aresistance genes1 aVaillancourt, Brieanne1 aHamilton, John P.1 aManrique‐Carpintero, Norma C.1 aGustafson, Timothy J.1 aBarry, Kerrie1 aLipzen, Anna1 aTracy, William F.1 aMikel, Mark A.1 aKaeppler, Shawn M.1 aBuell, C.

These new neurons originate from neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG). Recent studies indicate that vascular reconstruction is closely connected with neurogenesis, but little is known about its mechanism. We have examined vascular reconstruction in the hippocampus of adult mouse brain after the administration of the antidepressant fluoxetine, a potent inducer of hippocampal neurogenesis. The immunohistochemistry of laminin and CD31 showed that filopodia of endothelial cells sprouted from existing thick microvessels and often formed a bridge between two thick microvessels. These filopodia were frequently seen at the molecular layer and dentate hilus of the DG, the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of the CA1, and the stratum oriens of the CA3. The filopodia were exclusively localized along cellular processes of astrocytes, but such intimate association was not seen with cell bodies and processes of NSPCs. The administration of fluoxetine significantly increased vascular density by enlarging the luminal size of microvessels and eliminating the filopodia of endothelial cells in the molecular layer and dentate hilus. Treatment with fluoxetine increased the number of proliferating NSPCs in the granule cell layer and dentate hilus, and that of endothelial cells in the granule cell layer. Thus, antidepressant-induced vascular dynamics in the DG are possibly attributable to the alteration of the luminal size of microvessels rather than to proliferation of endothelial cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aantidepressants 3aastrocytes 3aendothelial cells 3ahippocampus 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alaminin 3amemory 3amice 3aneurogenesis 3aneurons 3apseudopodia 3astem cells1 aSawa, Hayato1 aFurube, Eriko1 aFukushima, Shohei1 aNishikawa, Kazunori1 aNakashimna, Toshihiro1 aMiyata, Seiji0 tCell and tissue research.g2014 Oct., v. 358, no. 1 p.43-55dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-014-1933-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245009800168500002000266500001900286500000900305520172500314592002802039650002102067650002302088650001102111650001502122650002802137650001202165650001902177650003002196650002702226650001402253650002402267650001402291700001402305700001802319700002402337700001702361700001602378700001602394700001802410700001602428773014402444856008802588852000902676655001202685IND60669741520221120131334.0220517e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066974152DNAL7 a10.3835/plantgenome2016.01.00102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Dan10aQuantitative Trait Loci Mapping for Tillering‐Related Traits in Two Switchgrass Populations  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aPlant tillering and related traits are morphologically important components contributing to switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) biomass yield. The objectives of this study were to estimate broad‐sense heritabilities for tillering‐related traits, to analyze correlations between biomass yield and the traits, and to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for them. A first‐generation selfed population of NL94 plant and a hybrid population between NL94 and SL93 plants were field established in a randomized complete block design with three replications in Stillwater and Perkins, OK. Phenotypic data were collected in 2 yr and genotypic data were obtained by genotyping simple‐sequence repeat (SSR) markers in the two populations on the basis of two preexisting genetic maps. Plant base size (PBS), plant girth (PG), tillering ability (TA), tiller diameter (TD), and tiller dry weight (TDW) were positively correlated with biomass yield in both populations. Consistently, PBS had the largest correlation coefficients for biomass yield, suggesting its value as an indirect selection criterion for biomass yield. Twenty and 26 QTL for six tillering‐related traits were detected in the hybrid and selfed population, respectively. Among the QTL, one on linkage group (LG) 5a between sww‐2387/PVCAG‐2197/2198 and PVGA‐1649/1650 for PBS, PG, and TA and another on LG 2a between sww‐2640/sww‐2545 and PVCA‐765/766 for TD and TDW were stably detected in multiple environments in the two populations. The findings add to the knowledge base regarding the genetics of tillering‐related traits that could be used in accelerating the development of high‐yielding cultivars through marker‐assisted selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum virgatum 3abiomass production 3agenome 3agenotyping 3ahigh-yielding varieties 3ahybrids 3alinkage groups 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphenotype 3aquantitative traits 3atillering1 aWu, Yanqi1 aLiu, Linglong1 aLu‐Thames, Shuiyi1 aDong, Hongxu1 aGoad, Carla1 aBai, Shiqie1 aMakaju, Shiva1 aFang, Tilin0 tThe plant genome.g2016 July, v. 9, no. 2 p.eplantgenome2016.01.0010-dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4288766x1940-33727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3835/plantgenome2016.01.00103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010000163300001800263520151800281592002801799596005301827596007601880596005401956596007502010650001502085650001502100650001302115650002302128650001802151650001602169650001602185650000702201650001402208650003002222650001402252650001302266650002202279650000902301650001602310651001002326700001802336700001402354700001302368700005502381773011202436856008302548852000902631655001202640IND60712280520221121004922.0211209e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071228052DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-020-02210-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hao10aLuteimonas weifangensis sp. nov., Isolated from Bensulfuron-Methyl Contaminated Watermelon Soil  ap. 3787-3792.  aA Gram-stain-negative bacterium, designated WF-2ᵀ, was isolated from bensulfuron-methyl contaminated watermelon soil in Weifang, Shandong province, China. Cells of strain WF-2ᵀ were strictly aerobic, non-motile and rod-shaped. Strain WF-2ᵀ grew optimally at 30 °C, pH 7.0. Strain WF-2ᵀ possessed ubiquinone-8 (Q-8) as the predominant respiratory quinone. The major cellular fatty acids of the strain WF-2ᵀ (> 5.0%) were iso-C₁₅:₀, anteiso-C₁₅:₀, iso-C₁₆:₀, C₁₆:₀, iso-C₁₇:₀, and summed feature 9 (iso-C₁₇:₁ ω9c/C₁₆:₀ 10-methyl). The polar lipids consisted of two unidentified lipids, three unidentified phospholipids, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and diphosphatidyl glycolipid. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gᵀne sequences revealed that WF-2ᵀ was a member of the genus Luteimonas and showed the highest sequence similarity to Luteimonas lumbrici 1.1416ᵀ (98.6%) and Lysobacter pocheonensis Gsoil 193ᵀ (97.9%), lower sequence similarity (< 97.0%) to other known species. The genomic DNA G + C content of WF-2ᵀ was 69.2 mol%. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and the digital DNA-DNA hybridizations (DDH) between strains WF-2ᵀ and L. lumbrici 1.1416ᵀ were 81.9% and 24.7%, respectively. Based on the phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic data presented here, a new species with the name Luteimonas weifangensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is WF-2ᵀ (= KCTC 62441ᵀ = CGMCC 1.13633ᵀ).  aPublisher supplied data  a41671317cNational Natural Science Fund of China  aKYYJ202002cThe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  aNY201902cFengyang science and technology project  aCX(18)1005cJiangsu Agriculture Science and Technology Innovation Fund 3aLuteimonas 3aLysobacter 3abacteria 3abensulfuron-methyl 3achemotaxonomy 3aglycolipids 3anew species 3apH 3aphenotype 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphylogeny 3aquinones 3asequence homology 3asoil 3awatermelons 3aChina1 aZhao, Hua-Zhu1 aLiu, Juan1 aQin, Wei1 aHuang, Xing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8710-81820 tCurrent microbiology.g2020 Nov., v. 77, no. 11 p.3787-3792dSpringer USwJournal:jnl10978x0343-86517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-020-02210-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01559naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245008000189300001800269520022800287592002800515650001700543650004000560650002000600650003900620650002900659650002900688650006200717650003600779650001400815650005600829650002400885650002600909700001800935773009500953856008101048990002301129852000901152655001201161IND60093946020221119224321.0141104e20120911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009394602DNAL7 a229749982pmid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2012.07.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoodson, Jesse D.10aOrganelle Signaling: How Stressed Chloroplasts Communicate with the Nucleus  ap.

To implement GS, a training population (TP) with phenotypic and genotypic data is required to train a statistical model used to predict genotyped selection candidates (SCs). A key factor impacting prediction accuracy is the relationship between the TP and the SCs. This study used empirical data for quantitative adult plant resistance to stem rust of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to investigate the utility of a historical TP (TPH) compared with a population-specific TP (TPPS), the potential for TPH optimization, and the utility of TPH data when close relative data is available for training. We found that, depending on the population size, a TPPS was 1.5 to 4.4 times more accurate than a TPH, and TPH optimization based on the mean of the generalized coefficient of determination or prediction error variance enabled the selection of subsets that led to significantly higher accuracy than randomly selected subsets. Retaining historical data when data on close relatives were available lead to a 11.9% increase in accuracy, at best, and a 12% decrease in accuracy, at worst, depending on the heritability. We conclude that historical data could be used successfully to initiate a GS program, especially if the dataset is very large and of high heritability. Training population optimization would be useful for the identification of TPH subsets to phenotype additional traits. However, after model updating, discarding historical data may be warranted. More studies are needed to determine if these observations represent general trends.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3acase studies 3adata collection 3adisease resistance 3agenome 3agenotyping 3aheritability 3amarker-assisted selection 3amature plants 3aphenotype 3aplant breeding 3apopulation size 3aprediction 3areproductive performance 3astatistical models 3astem rust 3avariance 3awheat1 aSingh, R.

Repeated addition of a mixture of these monomers was exploited to generate tapered multiblock copolymer architectures of the (AB)ₙ type with up to 10 blocks (1 ≤ n ≤ 5), thereby subdividing the polymer chains in alternating flexible polyisoprene (PI) and rigid polystyrene (PS) segments. Three series of well-defined tapered multiblock copolymers with approximate molecular weights of 80, 240, and 400 kg/mol were prepared on the 100 g scale. Via this synthetic strategy polymer chains were divided in di-, tetra-, hexa-, octa-, and decablock tapered multiblock structures. Because of the living nature of the polymerization, low dispersities in the range 1.06–1.28 (decablock) were obtained. To ensure full monomer conversion prior to the addition of the isoprene/styrene mixture, kinetic Monte Carlo simulation was employed, permitting to simulate chain growth in silico by employing the known polymerization rates and rate constants kₚ. The synthesized tapered multiblock copolymers were characterized via SEC and selected samples via oxidative degradation of the polyisoprene block in solution, confirming the well-defined nature of the PS segments. Subsequently, the question was addressed, to which extent the tapered multiblock copolymers are capable of forming ordered nanosegregated morphologies. Detailed thermal, structural, and rheological investigations showed that the tapered multiblock copolymers with a molecular weight of 240 kg/mol formed ordered phases with the expected lamellar morphology. However, X-ray scattering data and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the octablock and decablock copolymers reflect weakly ordered structures at ambient temperature. The domain spacing, d, was found to scale as d ∼ N⁰.⁶², where N is the total degree of polymerization, suggesting stretching of chains and nonideal configurations. Following the structure factor, S(q), as a function of temperature revealed that the tapered multiblock copolymers undergo a fluctuation-induced first-order transition at the respective order-to-disorder transition temperature, TODT. The viscoelastic response of the tapered copolymers was controlled by the nanodomain structure, the degree of segregation, nanodomain-bridging configurations of blocks, and also the proximity to the glass temperature of the vitrified PS domains. Tapered hexablock copolymers were found to best combine structural integrity and mechanical toughness, while maintaining a large strain at break (>900%).  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aX-ray scattering 3aambient temperature 3acomposite polymers 3acopolymerization 3acyclohexanes 3aglass 3aisoprene 3amechanical properties 3amolecular weight 3apolystyrenes 3astyrene 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aviscoelasticity1 aJohann, Tobias1 aGalanos, Eftyxis1 aAppold, Michael1 aRüttiger, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0374-78901 aMezger, Markus1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9049-69831 aGallei, Markus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3740-51971 aMüller, Axel H.

To date, miRNAs have been implicated in a large number of biological and disease processes, which has signified the need for the reliable detection methods of miRNA transcripts. Here, we describe a detailed protocol for digoxigenin-labeled (DIG) Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA) probe-based miRNA detection, combined with protein immunostaining on mouse heart sections. First, we performed an in situ hybridization technique using the probe to identify miRNA-182 expression in heart sections from control and cardiac hypertrophy mice. Next, we performed immunostaining for cardiac Troponin T (cTnT) protein, on the same sections, to co-localize miRNA-182 with the cardiomyocyte cells. Using this protocol, we were able to detect miRNA-182 through an alkaline phosphatase based colorimetric assay, and cTnT through fluorescent staining. This protocol can be used to detect the expression of any miRNA of interest through DIG-labeled LNA probes, and relevant protein expression on mouse heart tissue sections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3acardiomyocytes 3acolorimetry 3ahypertrophy 3ain situ hybridization 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amicroRNA 3aprotein synthesis 3atranslation (genetics) 3atroponin T1 aTirziu, Daniela1 aPapangeli, Irinna0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Sept. 15, , no. 139 p.e57920-e57920dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/579203Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/57920/tissue-specific-mirna-expression-profiling-mouse-heart-sections-using  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle10448naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100002400140245010600164300001400270500000900284500001500293520898400308592002809292650001609320650001509336650001809351650002209369650002409391650001509415650002209430650002409452650001709476650002009493651001609513653002209529653001209551653002009563653002009583700002209603700002309625700002209648773019909670852000909869856007709878990002309955655001209978IND2052218320221118181533.0191122e199601  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205221832DNAL7 a10.2134/jpa1996.00612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeatherly, Larry G.10aYield and Net Returns from Monocrop Winter Wheat Systems and a Winter Wheat-Soybean Doublecrop System  ap. 61-65.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aEconomic evaluation of agronomic production practices is required to determine the feasibility of inputs used in cropping systems with two or more crops. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of preplant tillage and seedbed type on subsequent monocrop wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seed yield and net returns, and compare the results with those from a wheat-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] doublecrop system (TRT 6). Net returns were calculated using data from plantings made for 4 yr on a Tunica clay (clayey over loamy, montmorillonitic, nonacid, thermic Vertic Haplaquept) near Stoneville, MS. Within the monocropped wheat treatments, preplant management inputs were: TRT 1—wheat planted flat following summer fallow; TRT 2—wheat planted flat following a summer legume crop [Hemp sesbania, Sesbunia exultutu (Raf.) Rydb. ex A.W. Hill]; TRT 3—wheat planted flat following summer fallow and subsoiling; TRT 4—wheat planted on 80-in.-wide beds following summer fallow; TRT 5—wheat planted on 80-in.-wide beds following summer fallow and subsoiling; and TRT 6—wheatsoybean doublecrop, where soybean was planted no-till in burned wheat straw and wheat was planted in harrowed (disk and/or spring-tooth) soybean stubble. Wheat yields from TRT 3 were among the highest each year, but net returns resulting from this treatment were among the highest in only 2 of the 4 yr. Combined net returns from TRT 6 were among the highest in all years, but they were positive in only 2 of the 4 yr and soybean yields averaged only 14.8 to 25.2 bu/acre. Net returns (losses in all 4 yr) resulting from TRT 2 were among the lowest each year because of the expense associated with establishing and incorporating the legume residue. These results indicate that monocropping of wheat, regardless of preplant management, is not a feasible replacement for winter wheat-soybean doublecropping in a nonirrigated environ on clay soil, even though wheat yields were higher in the monocrop treatments in most years. Expenses associated with summer fallow maintenance for monocropped winter wheat were not offset by sufficiently higher yields. Research QuestionDoublecropping of winter wheat and nonirrigated soybean is a common and important practice in the southeastern USA. On the clay soils of the lower Mississippi River Valley, yield of soybean in this system is frequently low and results in little or no profit. Removing soybean from this system, or growing wheat as a monocrop, appears to be an alternative to wheat-soybean doublecropping in this region. This study was conducted to assess the economic feasibility of growing wheat in monoculture vs. growing continuous doublecropped wheat and nonirrigated soybean. Literature SummaryIn the winter wheat-soybean doublecrop system, soybean is planted no-till in standing wheat stubble, following burning of wheat stubble, or in a prepared seedbed. Wheat is usually planted in a prepared seedbed following soybean harvest, even if the soybean crop is planted no-till. Doublecropping wheat and soybean results in greater economic returns than those realized from a monocrop soybean system, especially when soybean is irrigated. No information is available on the effect of seedbed condition on yield and net returns from monocropped wheat, or on the economic feasibility of monocropping winter wheat. Study DescriptionA field study was conducted from June 1991 through June 1994 on Tunica clay near Stoneville, MS. The study included six treatments: TRT 1—monocrop winter wheat planted flat following summer fallow; TRT 2—monocrop wheat planted flat following a summer legume crop of hemp sesbania; TRT 3—monocrop wheat planted flat following summer fallow and fall subsoiling; TRT 4—monocrop wheat planted on 80-in.-wide beds following summer fallow; TRT 5—monocrop wheat planted on 80-in.-wide beds following summer fallow and fall subsoiling; and TRT 6—wheat-soybean doublecrop. Soybean (‘Pioneer 9592’) in TRT 6 was planted no-till in 20-in. rows, and all wheat (different cultivars in each year) was planted in 8-in. rows in a prepared seedbed. Wheat stubble was burned in all years. Tillage using a disk harrow and spring tooth harrow was used to control weeds during the summer fallow months in the monocrop wheat treatments. Crop enterprise budgets were developed annually for each treatment. Application rates for all variable inputs were those used in this experiment. Variable expenses were the actual prices paid by farmers each year, and crop prices were the seasonal average prices received for each respective year. Total expenses included both variable and fixed expenses. Net returns were calculated annually as the difference between gross income and total specified expenses. Charges for land, management, and overhead were not included. Applied QuestionsDoes yield of monocropped wheat exceed that of wheat grown in a doublecrop system with soybean and a summer legume cover crop? In 3 of the 4 yr of the study, yields from monocrop wheat treatments exceeded the yield of wheat grown in a doublecrop system with soybean (Table 1). Wheat grown following a summer crop of hemp sesbania produced a yield that was among the lowest each year, and this yield never exceeded that from the doublecropped wheat. Does soil tillage treatment preceding wheat planting have an effect on wheat yield? Yield from wheat planted in the subsoiled and bedded treatment (TRT 5) never significantly exceeded that from the subsoiled flat-planted treatment (TRT 3) or the bedded treatment (TRT 4) (Table 1). Yield of wheat planted after subsoiling alone (TRT 3) was always in the highest yielding group and yield of wheat planted after bedding alone (TRT 4) was in the highest yielding group in 3 of 4 yr. Apparently, either subsoiling or bedding, but not both, offers the greatest potential for highest wheat yield on this clay soil. The 4-yr mean yield from monocropped wheat planted flat with no subsoiling (TRT 1) was 7.5 bu/acre less than mean yield from monocropped wheat planted following subsoiling (TRT 3). Does monocropping of wheat result in increased net returns compared with wheat-soybean doublecropping? Net returns from TRT 6 were the highest or among the highest in all years. Net returns (negative or losses in all cycles) from TRT 2 (monocropped wheat following summer legume) were the lowest or among the lowest in all years (Table 1). Thus, the income from the soybean in TRT 6 was an important component of net returns from that treatment. Net returns from TRT 1 were among the highest in 3 yr, while net returns from TRT 3 and TRT 4 were among the highest in 2 yr. Net returns (losses in three of the four cycles) from TRT 5 were among the highest in only 1 yr. What is the overall assessment of a monocrop wheat vs. a doublecrop wheat-soybean system? Growing only monoculture winter wheat, or the absence of a soybean crop between harvest and planting of winter wheat, did not result in increased net returns vs. those obtained from a continuous winter wheat-soybean doublecrop system (Table 1). Yields of wheat from the monocrop systems were sometimes greater than those from the doublecrop treatment, but net returns were never significantly higher. The inclusion of a nonirrigated soybean crop during the summer (15 June–15 Oct.) resulted in a yield of soybean that somewhat offset the costs incurred for weed control during this period. These results confirm the importance of using net returns as the criteria for selecting feasible or optimum cropping systems, especially when using different crops in the same system.

High-throughput methods to study PPIs in yeast have opened a new perspective on the organization of the cell by allowing the study of whole protein interactomes. Recent investigations have moved from the description of this organization to the analysis of its dynamics by experimenting how protein interaction networks (PINs) are rewired in response to perturbations. Here we review studies that have used the budding yeast as an experimental system to explore these altered networks. Given the large space of possible PPIs and the diversity of potential genetic and environmental perturbations, high-throughput methods are an essential requirement to survey PIN perturbations on a large scale. Network perturbations are typically conceptualized as the removal of entire proteins (nodes), the modification of single PPIs (edges) or changes in growth conditions. These studies have revealed mechanisms of PPI regulation, PIN architectural organization, robustness and sensitivity to perturbations. Despite these major advances, there are still inherent limits to current technologies that lead to a trade-off between the number of perturbations and the number of PPIs that can be considered simultaneously. Nevertheless, as we exemplify here, targeted approaches combined with the existing resources remain extremely powerful to explore the inner organization of cells and their responses to perturbations.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenotype-phenotype correlation 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteins 3asurveys 3ayeasts 0ayeast 0aprotein–protein interaction 0aprotein interactome perturbation 0ahigh-throughput screening 0agenetic robustness 0aposttranslational modification1 aVignaud, Hélène1 aRochette, Samuel1 aDiss, Guillaume1 aChrétien, Andrée-Ève1 aBerger, Caroline M.1 aLandry, Christian R.0 tBriefings in functional genomics.g2016 Mar., v. 15, no. 2 p.130-137dOxford University PresswJournal:27071x2041-26577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bfgp/elv0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01378naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245006700183300001400250520043300264592002800697650001300725650001100738650001000749650001100759650001700770650001200787700001400799700001400813700002500827773009800852856008100950852000901031655001201040IND60082065020221119023859.0141016e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008206502DNAL7 a251301422pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-014-1980-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Ti-Fei10aEvidence of adult neurogenesis in non-human primates and human  ap. 17-23.  aAdult neurogenesis in rodents has been extensively studied.

JBW4 degraded 75.8 and 87.0 % of α-endosulfan and 58.5 and 69.5 % of β-endosulfan in sterilized and natural soils, respectively, after 77 days. Endosulfan ether and endosulfan lactone were the major metabolites that were detected by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. This result suggested that A. faecalis strain JBW4 degrades endosulfan using a non-oxidative pathway in soils. The ability of strain JBW4 to colonize endosulfan-contaminated soils was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. This result suggested that strain JBW4 competed with the original inhabitants in the soil to establish a balance and successfully colonize the soils. In addition, the detoxification of endosulfan by strain JBW4 was evaluated using single-cell gel electrophoresis and by determining the soil microbial biomass carbon and enzymatic activities. The results showed that the genotoxicity and ecotoxicity of endosulfan in soil were reduced after degradation. The natural degradation of endosulfan in soil is inadequate; therefore, JBW4 shows potential for the bioremediation of industrial soils that are contaminated with endosulfan residues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlcaligenes faecalis 3abacteria 3abioremediation 3acarbon 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aecotoxicology 3aendosulfan 3aenzyme activity 3agas chromatography 3agenotoxicity 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3amicrobial biomass 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asoil 2aAlcaligenes faecalisxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBiotransformation 2aDenaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis 2aEndosulfanxmetabolism 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aMetabolic Networks and Pathways 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSoil Pollutantsxmetabolism1 aZhu, Shaoyuan1 aZhu, Lusheng1 aXie, Hui1 aWei, Kai1 aYan, Tongxiang1 aWang, Jun1 aWang, Jinhua1 aWang, Fenghua1 aSun, Fengxia0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2014 Feb., v. 98, no. 3 p.1407-1416dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-013-5033-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012000162520129200282592002801574650001001602650001801612650002601630650002201656650001701678650001701695650001301712650002301725650001701748650001501765650001701780650001501797650001401812700002501826700002101851773012001872856007401992852000902066655001202075IND60702898020221123042838.0200719e20200220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070289802DNAL7 a10.3390/f110202342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHomolák, Marián 10aCan Soil Electrical Resistivity Measurements Aid the Identification of Forest Areas Prone to Windthrow Disturbance?  aThis study investigates how certain forest soil properties influence the propensity of beech forests to windthrow disturbances. The field measurements of soil electrical resistivity were carried out in an old-growth natural beech forest where the soil has developed from Cainozoic sedimentary rock with mudstone–claystone stratigraphy. In 2014, the forest was hit by a severe windstorm, and dispersed windthrow occurred at certain plots. Apparent electrical resistivity measurements were performed to investigate whether some soil properties could influence the forest trees’ predisposition to windthrow. The increases in the clay content and soil bulk density below 30 cm were associated with weathered claystone and mudstone, which created a physiological barrier for deeper root penetration. The result of the χ 2 test suggested that the windthrown spots were not distributed evenly over the entire study area. They were mainly concentrated over approximately 50% of the area, and their positions coincided with low resistivity values, indicating low soil skeleton content, high clay content and soil moisture. Therefore, electrical resistivity tomography could be considered a useful predictive tool for reducing the risk of natural disturbances by preventive forest management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aclay fraction 3aelectrical resistance 3aforest management 3aforest soils 3aforest trees 3amudstone 3aold-growth forests 3asoil density 3asoil water 3astratigraphy 3atomography 3awindthrow1 aGömöryová, Erika 1 aPichler, Viliam 0 tForests.g2020 Feb. 20, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f110202343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245011700171500002000288500001900308500000900327520164700336592002801983596010202011650002102113650000802134650001902142650002802161650001102189650001202200650002202212650004202234650001602276700002302292700001202315700002502327773012802352856008802480852000902568655001202577IND60669742120221120131434.0220518e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066974212DNAL7 a10.3835/plantgenome2018.05.00232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorani, Walid10aMachine Learning as an Effective Method for Identifying True Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Polyploid Plants  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have many advantages as molecular markers since they are ubiquitous and codominant. However, the discovery of true SNPs in polyploid species is difficult. Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an allopolyploid, which has a very low rate of true SNP calling. A large set of true and false SNPs identified from the Axiom_Arachis 58k array was leveraged to train machine‐learning models to enable identification of true SNPs directly from sequence data to reduce ascertainment bias. These models achieved accuracy rates above 80% using real peanut RNA sequencing (RNA‐seq) and whole‐genome shotgun (WGS) resequencing data, which is higher than previously reported for polyploids and at least a twofold improvement for peanut. A 48K SNP array, Axiom_Arachis2, was designed using this approach resulting in 75% accuracy of calling SNPs from different tetraploid peanut genotypes. Using the method to simulate SNP variation in several polyploids, models achieved >98% accuracy in selecting true SNPs. Additionally, models built with simulated genotypes were able to select true SNPs at >80% accuracy using real peanut data. This work accomplished the objective to create an effective approach for calling highly reliable SNPs from polyploids using machine learning. A novel tool was developed for predicting true SNPs from sequence data, designated as SNP machine learning (SNP‐ML), using the described models. The SNP‐ML additionally provides functionality to train new models not included in this study for customized use, designated SNP machine learner (SNP‐MLer). The SNP‐ML is publicly available.  aPublisher supplied data  a2012‐85117‐19435cPeanut Foundation, the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative competitive 3aArachis hypogaea 3aRNA 3aallopolyploidy 3aartificial intelligence 3agenome 3apeanuts 3asequence analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism arrays 3atetraploidy1 aClevenger, Josh P.1 aChu, Ye1 aOzias‐Akins, Peggy0 tThe plant genome.g2019 Mar., v. 12, no. 1 p.e180023-dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4288766x1940-33727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3835/plantgenome2018.05.00233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013400165300001400299520100100313592002801314650002201342650001201364650000901376650002301385650001101408650001201419650001801431650001601449650001101465650001101476650000901487650001201496650001901508650001401527650000901541650000901550650002801559650001601587651001001603653002801613653001901641653001801660653002301678653002301701653002301724700001801747700001801765700001901783700001901802700002101821700001801842773009901860856008201959852000902041655001202050IND60524610420221120120548.0190416e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052461042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gfs.2016.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeFries, Ruth10aSynergies and trade-offs for sustainable agriculture: Nutritional yields and climate-resilience for cereal crops in Central India  ap. 44-53.  aSustainable agriculture has multiple objectives, including efficient use of land to produce nutrients for human consumption, climate resilience, and income for farmers. We illustrate an approach to examine trade-offs and synergies among these objectives for monsoon cereal crops in central India. We estimate nutritional yields for protein, energy and iron and examine the sensitivity of yields to monsoon rainfall and temperature. Rice, the dominant crop in the region, is the least land efficient for providing iron and most sensitive to rainfall variability. Sorghum and maize provide high nutritional yields while small millet is most resilient to climate variability. Price incentives are strong for rice. No single crop is superior for all objectives in this region. Instead, understanding which crops, or combinations of crops, are most suitable requires identifying household-, community-, and region-specific priorities coupled with empirical analysis that considers multiple objectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum (Poaceae) 3aclimate 3acorn 3aempirical research 3aenergy 3afarmers 3afood security 3agrain crops 3ahumans 3aincome 3airon 3amillets 3amonsoon season 3anutrients 3arain 3arice 3asustainable agriculture 3atemperature 3aIndia 0aSustainable agriculture 0aCoarse cereals 0aCentral India 0aClimate resilience 0aNutritional yields 0aTrade off analysis1 aMondal, Pinki1 aSingh, Deepti1 aAgrawal, Ishan1 aFanzo, Jessica1 aRemans, Roseline1 aWood, Stephen0 tGlobal food security.g2016 Dec., v. 11 p.44-53dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21608x2211-91247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2016.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012000161520179600281592002802077650002002105650001902125650001502144650002002159650002602179650002202205650001102227650001302238650000702251650002302258650001702281650002402298650002102322650002102343651001002364700002002374700002002394700002002414700001602434700001802450773012002468856007402588852000902662655001202671IND60702898120221123043034.0200719e20200220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070289812DNAL7 a10.3390/f110202352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Shengsheng 10aEffects of One-Year Simulated Nitrogen and Acid Deposition on Soil Respiration in a Subtropical Plantation in China  aAtmospheric nitrogen (N) and acid deposition have become global environmental issues and are likely to alter soil respiration (Rₛ); the largest CO₂ source is from soil to the atmosphere. However, to date, much less attention has been focused on the interactive effects and underlying mechanisms of N and acid deposition on Rₛ, especially for ecosystems that are simultaneously subjected to elevated levels of deposition of both N and acid. Here, to examine the effects of N addition, acid addition, and their interactions with Rₛ, we conducted a two-way factorial N addition (control, CK; 60 kg N ha⁻¹ a⁻¹, LN; 120 kg N ha⁻¹ a⁻¹, HN) and acid addition (control, CK; pH 4.5, LA; pH 2.5, HA) field experiment in a subtropical plantation in China. Our results showed the following: (1) During the one-year observation period, the seasonal dynamics of Rₛ presented a single peak curve model, which was closely related to the surface soil temperature. (2) The simulated N deposition and acid deposition significantly decreased the Rₛ in the subtropical plantation. Compared to the CK plots, the LN and HN treatments reduced the annual mean values of Rₛ by 41% and 56%, and the annual mean values of Rₛ were inhibited by 26% and 31% in the LA and HA plots. The inhibition of N application on Rₛ was stronger than that of the simulated acid deposition. (3) Significant interactions between N addition and acid addition on Rₛ were detected, and Rₛ was significantly inhibited under four co-addition treatments. (4) The underlying mechanism and main reason for the responses of Rₛ to simulated N and acid deposition in this study might be the inhibition of soil microbial biomass and soil enzyme activity due to soil acidification under increased N and acid input.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid deposition 3acarbon dioxide 3aecosystems 3aenzyme activity 3afield experimentation 3amicrobial biomass 3amodels 3anitrogen 3apH 3asoil acidification 3asoil enzymes 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil respiration 3asoil temperature 3aChina1 aWang, G.

The acid–base blend membranes demonstrated high thermal and excellent chemical stabilities in terms of oxidative weight loss. Small changes in the molecular weight distribution after immersion in Fenton's solution were determined with gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showed the outstanding integrity of the acid–base blend membranes after a 24 hour-long Fenton's test. In contrast to pure polybenzimidazole (PBI) and AB-PBI membranes the new acid–base membranes exhibited long-term stability in phosphoric acid (PA) at 130 °C. Ionic cross-linking between acid and base blend polymers improved the stability and integrity of the membranes. The in situ conductivities of several acid–base blend membranes were higher than that of pure AB-PBI membranes with drastically reduced acid uptake. Membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) based on these blend membranes were prepared showing good fuel cell performance at practical relevant operation conditions. This study proves that acid–base blends are a suitable alternative to pure PBI and AB-PBI as membranes for HT-PEMFCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3afuel cells 3agel chromatography 3amolecular weight 3aphosphoric acid 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aweight loss1 aAniol, Karin1 aEllwein, Corina1 aKerres, Jochen1 aZeis, Roswitha0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 May 12, v. 3, no. 20 p.10864-10874dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta01337b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245016600163300001600329520095000345592002801295650002601323650001801349650001601367650001001383650001001393650001801403650002001421650001201441650002101453650001001474650001001484650001401494650004301508650000901551650002801560650001901588653002401607653001801631653001801649653002701667653003101694653003201725653003601757653004401793653003601837653003501873653003301908653003101941653004001972653003402012653003302046700001502079773011202094856008202206852000902288655001202297IND60527312920221122221334.0190415e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052731292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2016.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Mengmei10aAnti-diabetic effects of soluble and insoluble dietary fibre from deoiled cumin in low-dose streptozotocin and high glucose-fat diet-induced type 2 diabetic rats  ap. 186-196.  aThe effects of soluble dietary fibre (SDF) and insoluble dietary fibre (IDF) from deoiled cumin on low-dose streptozotocin and high glucose-fat-induced type 2 diabetes rats were examined.

R722-R732.  aAll multicellular organisms protect themselves against pathogens using sophisticated immune defenses. Functionally interconnected humoral and cellular facilities maintain immune homeostasis in the absence of overt infection and regulate the initiation and termination of immune responses directed against pathogens. Immune responses of invertebrates, such as flies, are innate and usually stereotyped; those of vertebrates, encompassing species as diverse as jawless fish and humans, are additionally adaptive, enabling more rapid and efficient immune reactivity upon repeated encounters with a pathogen. Many of the attributes historically defining innate and adaptive immunity are in fact common to both, blurring their functional distinction and emphasizing shared ancestry and co-evolution. These findings provide indications of the evolutionary forces underlying the origin of somatic diversification of antigen receptors and contribute to our understanding of the complex phenotypes of human immune disorders. Moreover, informed by phylogenetic considerations and inspired by improved knowledge of functional networks, new avenues emerge for innovative therapeutic strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiptera 3aadaptive immunity 3aancestry 3aantigens 3acoevolution 3afish 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3ainvertebrates 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3areceptors 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aHumans 2aImmune System Diseasesxepidemiology 2aImmune System Phenomena 2aModels, Immunological 2aVertebratesximmunology0 tCurrent biology.g2012 Sept. 11, v. 22, no. 17 p.R722-R732dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2012.07.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245009200188300001600280520170900296592002802005650002102033650002502054650001302079650002202092650001202114650002502126650001802151650001202169650001302181650001802194650001902212650001602231650002402247650004302271700002502314700002202339700002202361700002002383773010002403856008102503852000902584655001202593IND60082065420221119023457.0141016e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008206542DNAL7 a248592212pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-014-1913-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCunha, Juliana S.10aEffects of high glucose and high insulin concentrations on osteoblast function in vitro  ap. 249-256.  aBone disease as a consequence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is not fully understood. The effects of high glucose (30 mM), high insulin (50 nM), or mannitol (30 mM; osmotic control) were evaluated on MC3T3-E1 cells (osteoblasts) in vitro. The mRNA and protein levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor (PTH1R), collagen I, RANKL, osteoprotegerin (OPG), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and glucose transporter (GLUT1) were estimated by real-time polymerase chain reaction or Western blotting. The mineralization capacity was analyzed by von Kossa staining. High glucose induced overexpression of RANKL (2×) and OPG (30×), suggesting that RANKL-induced osteoclast activity might not be a dominant mechanism of bone disease in DM, since this increase was followed by increased OPG. Collagen I increased by 12×, indicating an excess of organic matrix production. The expression of ALP decreased by 50 %, indicating a deficit in mineralization capacity, confirmed by von Kossa staining. Mannitol induced similar effects as glucose suggesting that extracellular hyperosmolarity was able to stimulate organic matrix production. GLUT1 expression was not altered, and insulin did not reverse most of the effects of glucose, suggesting that glucose uptake by osteoblasts was not altered by high glucose. The data suggest that the bone fragility typical of DM is not a consequence of excessive bone reabsorption but is instead attributable to a defect in organic matrix mineralization. The heightened increase in OPG versus RANKL might cause a decrease in the bone-remodeling cycle. Osteoblasts appear to be more sensitive to extracellular hypertonicity than to the intracellular metabolic effects of hyperglycemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aalkaline phosphatase 3acollagen 3adiabetes mellitus 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3ahyperglycemia 3ainsulin 3amannitol 3amessenger RNA 3amineralization 3aosteoblasts 3aparathyroid hormone 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction1 aFerreira, Vanessa M.1 aMaquigussa, Edgar1 aNaves, Marcelo A.1 aBoim, Mirian A.0 tCell and tissue research.g2014 Oct., v. 358, no. 1 p.249-256dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-014-1913-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03588naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245016500165300001600330520183000346592002802176650003402204650003702238650001702275650001202292650001402304650002302318650001702341650001502358650001802373650002802391650000902419650002102428650001302449650001402462650002002476653002202496653002102518653001602539653002202555653003102577700001902608700001502627700001802642700001202660700005502672700001702727700001702744700001802761700001802779700001802797773010302815856008302918852000903001655001203010IND60697720820221121023645.0201023e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069772082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2020.05.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lingling10aOperando spectroscopic and isotopic-label-directed observation of LaN-promoted Ru/ZrH2 catalyst for ammonia synthesis via associative and chemical looping route  ap. 218-228.  aThe synthesis of ammonia via the Haber-Bosch process using Fe-derived catalysts requires harsh reaction conditions. It is hence meaningful to develop catalysts for low-temperature synthesis of ammonia for industrial application. Herein for the first time, we report that with the synergy between LaN and Ru/ZrH₂, NH₃ can be synthesized via a dual-path mechanism. The LaN-promoted Ru/ZrH₂ catalyst shows exceptionally high NH₃ synthesis rate (up to 305 mmolNH₃ gRᵤ⁻¹ h⁻¹) at 350 °C under 1 MPa and remarkable durability (tested for 200 h). The outcomes of isothermal surface reaction and a suite of ¹⁵N₂ and D₂ isotopic labeling experiments reveal that the N³⁻ of LaN reacts with H⁻ ions to produce NH₃, leaving behind N and H vacancies. The initial state of Ru/xLaN/ZrH₂ can be restored by having the N and H entities replenished under the atmosphere adopted for NH₃ synthesis. Moreover, based on the results of N₂ reaction order, nitrogen K-edge NEXAFS, in situ XPS as well as in situ DRIFTS analyses under a 25%N₂-75%D₂ atmosphere, it is reckoned that the direct dissociation of N₂ does not occur on the LaN-promoted Ru/ZrH₂ catalyst while N₂ hydrogenation takes place via an associative pathway under mild conditions. For the hydrogenation of N₂, an appropriate amount of LaN would induce a synergic effect on the Ru active sites, leading to facile activation and hydrogenation of N₂ to *N₂H₂. Nonetheless, an excess amount of LaN would result in blocking of Ru sites, consequently hindering the formation of *N₂H₂ and decreasing the catalytic activity. Following the associative and chemical looping pathways, the LaN-promoted Ru/ZrH₂ catalyst bypasses the bottleneck of N₂ direct dissociation, making the synthesis of NH₃ at mild conditions possible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aactive sites 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adissociation 3adurability 3ahydrogenation 3aindustrial applications 3aions 3aisotope labeling 3anitrogen 3aruthenium 3astable isotopes 0aAmmonia synthesis 0aChemical looping 0aAssociative 0aIsotopic labeling 0aReact intermediate species1 aZhang, Tianhua1 aCai, Jihui1 aCai, Hongfang1 aNi, Jun1 aLin, Bingyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6879-91951 aLin, Jianxin1 aWang, Xiuyun1 aZheng, Lirong1 aAu, Chak-Tong1 aJiang, Lilong0 tJournal of catalysis.g2020 Sept., v. 389 p.218-228dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2020.05.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009000164300001600254520107500270592002801345650001401373650002501387650001401412650001001426650001501436650002101451650002101472650001701493650001801510650001701528650001801545650003101563650001201594650001701606650002101623650001601644650002801660650001301688653002101701653002001722653002201742653002101764653001401785653001601799653000901815653000801824653001101832653000901843653000801852653000801860653000701868653000701875653000801882700002201890700002001912700001601932700002201948700001801970700002801988773011202016856008202128852000902210655001202219IND60527313020221122221351.0190415e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052731302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2016.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElmann, Anat10aPulicaria incisa infusion attenuates inflammatory responses of brain microglial cells  ap. 110-122.  aActivated microglial cells release various mediators, which cause neuronal cell death and have been implicated in different neurological disorders. The present study demonstrates that an infusion prepared from the plant Pulicaria incisa (Pi) inhibits microglial activation and down-regulates levels of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and of the toxic mediators nitric oxide and glutamate. The infusion was also shown to have antioxidant properties in cell-free assays (e.g., differential pulse voltammetry) and in a cellular assay, in which the infusion attenuated the induced accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). We found that Pi infusion is rich in polyphenols, especially chlorogenic acids and ferulic acids, which might be responsible for the observed activities. It is proposed that Pi infusion be further evaluated for use as a functional beverage for the prevention and/or treatment of chronic diseases, especially neurodegenerative disorders in which microglial activation and oxidative stress play important roles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPulicaria 3aantioxidant activity 3abeverages 3abrain 3acell death 3achlorogenic acid 3achronic diseases 3aferulic acid 3aglutamic acid 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurons 3anitric oxide 3aoxidative stress 3apolyphenols 3areactive oxygen species 3atoxicity 0aPulicaria incisa 0aHerbal infusion 0aNeuroinflammation 0aMicroglial cells 0aGlutamate 0aPolyphenols 0aABAP 0aDPV 0aIL-1β 0aIL-6 0aLDH 0aLPS 0aNO 0aPi 0aROS1 aBeit-Yannai, Elie1 aTelerman, Alona1 aOfir, Rivka1 aMordechay, Sharon1 aErlank, Hilla1 aBorochov-Neori, Hamutal0 tJournal of functional foods.g2016 Aug., v. 25 p.110-122dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2016.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003200139245016000171520194200331592002802273650002502301650001502326650002402341650002002365650001702385650001002402650002302412650001602435650001602451650001302467650001502480650001102495650001402506650001402520650001002534650000902544651001002553700003802563700002302601700002002624773012002644856007302764852000902837655001202846IND60702898920221123021706.0200719e20200222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070289892DNAL7 a10.3390/f110202422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChowdhury, Md.  Qumruzzaman10aGrowth-Ring Analysis of <i>Diploknema butyracea</i> Is a Potential Tool for Revealing Indigenous Land Use History in the Lower Himalayan Foothills of Nepal  aSlash-and-burn is a farming practice of the indigenous communities in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal. The traditional land-tenure system is based on a customary oral tradition. However, the government&rsquo;s persistent denial of land rights has fueled the indigenous conflicts in the last few decades. Deliverance of scientific evidence-based arguments may underpin the ongoing conflict-resolution dialogues between the authorities and the indigenous communities. Dating growth rings of trees in a slash-and-burn system might help the indigenous people to find evidence of their historic land uses in the mountainous landscape. In this pilot study, we examined the potential of <i>Diploknema butyracea</i> (Roxb.) H. J. Lam growth rings for documenting land use history of Nepalese indigenous farming practices, as this species is being preserved during the slash-and-burn practices. The species is an economically important and ecologically interesting (as it flushes leaves when everything is dry, and sheds leaves while everything is green) deciduous tree species belonging to <i>Sapotaceae</i> family and widely distributed in Sub-Himalayan tracts. Five stem discs were studied which were originated from the Kandrang valley of the Chitwan district, Nepal. For the first time, we revealed distinct growth rings in this species which are marked by fibers with thicker cell walls. Growth-ring anomalies, i.e., wedging and partially missing rings, were also found. Four out of five samples could be crossdated at a marginal level (<i>GLK</i> &ge; 60 and <i>t</i> &ge; 2.0) which is a confirmation of the annual nature of growth rings. One of the samples showed black spots of oxidized wood which are traces of fire, suggesting evidence of slash-and-burn practices in the study area since 1933. This study suggests a strong potential of <i>D. butyracea</i> for growth-ring analysis to reconstruct indigenous land use history in Nepal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiploknema butyracea 3acell walls 3aconflict management 3afarming systems 3agrowth rings 3ahills 3aindigenous peoples 3aland rights 3aland tenure 3aland use 3alandscapes 3aleaves 3amountains 3aoxidation 3atrees 3awood 3aNepal1 aBhattarai, Teeka R.q(Teeka Ram),1 aDe Ridder, Maaike 1 aBeeckman, Hans 0 tForests.g2020 Feb. 22, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f110202423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245007900174520150200253592002801755650000801783650001301791650001601804650002301820650001601843650001101859650001901870653000901889653002501898653002401923653001001947653001101957653001201968653001401980653001901994700002002013700002202033700002402055773011902079856008802198852000902286655001202295IND60756428420221116162314.0220222e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075642842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1515052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez, Andres10aIntracity occurrence and distribution of airborne PCB congeners in Chicago  aTo evaluate the magnitude and extent of airborne PCBs in an urban area, we measured and investigated the temporal and spatial behavior of atmospheric concentrations of individual polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners as well as the sum of all congeners (ΣPCB) in both gas and particle phases at 27 locations across the City of Chicago in a single year (2009). In total, 141 gas-phase air samples were collected, including 22 pairs (44 samples) deployed at the same time but at two different locations, and 46 particle-phase samples. ΣPCB in the gas-phase ranged from 80 to 3000 pg/m³, with a geometric mean (GM) of 530 pg/m³, whereas particle-phase ranged from 8 to 160 pg/m³, with a GM of 28 pg/m³. We found the temporal variability to be about three times larger than the variability over space for all gas-phase congeners and ΣPCB. Around 50% of the sample PCB profiles resembled a mixture of a 1:1 vapor Aroclor mixture of 1016 + 1254, with most of the rest (30%) showing enrichment of PCB 3 (>0.1), which did not match any Aroclor profiles. PCB 11 contributed to ~5% in all samples. The fractions of PCB congeners bound to particles ranged from 0.001 to 0.97. Our analysis shows that airborne PCBs are widely distributed across Chicago and confirms that most locations have a similar PCB distribution, but differ in the concentration levels.

The study is also aimed at describing structural activity relationship, type of α-glucosidase inhibition and in-vivo potential to regulate post prandial hyperglycemia in Wistar rats.Methanolic extract of whole plant was suspended in water, and sequentially fractionated with n-hexane and ethyl acetate. Further ethyl acetate fraction was subjected to medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) to isolate the active molecules under the following experimental conditions, pressure (up to 5kg/cm²) and flow rate (2in./min). The structural elucidation of isolated compounds was done on the basis of detailed spectral analysis. The α-glucosidase inhibitory potential of isolated compounds was evaluated and compared with standard drug acarbose. In addition, type of inhibition was dwelled by Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis. Further, sucrose tolerance test was performed in Wistar rats pre-treated with the isolated compounds and acarbose (0.015mM) followed by a sucrose load (2g/kg, p.o.) and blood glucose level was measured up to 120min by the glucose oxidase method.The ethyl acetate fraction afforded quercetrin (1), dimethoxy quercetrin (2), along with two new prenylated flavonosides designated as hirtacoumaroflavonoside (3) and hirtaflavonoside-B (4) characterized as 7-O-(p-coumaroyl)-5,7,4′-trihydroxy-6-(3,3-dimethyl allyl)-flavonol-3-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-(2″→1″′)-O-α-l-rhamnopyranoside and 5, 7, 3′, 4′-trihydroxy-6-(3, 3-dimethyl allyl)-8-(iso-butenyl)-flavonol-3-C-β-d-glucopyranoside, respectively. All the isolated compounds showed dose dependent inhibition of α-glucosidase which was found to be comparable to acarbose. Maximum α-glucosidase inhibition was achieved with compound 3 (IC50 0.022mM) followed by 4 (IC50 0.071mM) in comparison to acarbose (IC50 0.092mM). The results revealed that 5,7,4′- trihydroxyflavone structure is imperative for the inhibitory activity. The prenylation in the flavonoids increase the potency and p-coumaroyl substitution at C-7 further enriched the α-glucosidase inhibition. Compound 3 exhibited non-competitive inhibition while compounds 1, 2 and 4 showed mixed non-competitive inhibitory pattern. The results of sucrose tolerance test corresponded well with the in vitro studies.α-Glucosidase inhibitory activity and sucrose tolerance test demonstrated by the prenylated flavonoids present in E. hirta provide credence to the ethnomedicinal use of the plant in the management of diabetes in folk medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuphorbia hirta 3aacarbose 3aalpha-glucosidase 3ablood glucose 3adiabetes 3adose response 3adrugs 3aenzyme inhibition 3aethyl acetate 3aflavonoids 3aglucose oxidase 3ahexane 3ahyperglycemia 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aliquid chromatography 3arats 3aspectral analysis 3asucrose 3atraditional medicine 0aDMSO 0aESI 0aFAB 0aIAEC 0aMPLC 0aNMR 0aOECD 0aPNPG 0aPPHG 0aTLC 0aEuphorbia hirta 0aEuphorbiaceae 0aPrenylated flavonoids 0aα-Glucosidase 0aPost prandial hyperglycemia1 aRayhana, Begum1 aAli, Abuzer1 aPillai, Krishna Kollapa1 aAeri, Vidhu1 aSharma, Manju1 aMir, Showkat R.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2015 Dec. 24, v. 176 p.1-8dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2015.10.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245019100169500002200360520128500382592002801667650001501695650001501710650002001725650001101745650002601756650001401782650002501796650000701821650001701828650002001845650001301865650002901878653003401907653001201941653001101953653003301964653001401997653001702011700006402028773006802092856008102160852000902241655001202250IND60524610920221120100701.0160724s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052461092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2016.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Beqqali, Aziza10aMolecularly imprinted polymer-sol-gel tablet toward micro-solid phase extraction: I. Determination of methadone in human plasma utilizing liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry  aPre-press version  aIn the present work molecularly imprinted sol-gel tablet (MIP-Tablet) was prepared. The MIP-sol-gel was prepared as a thin layer on polyethylene material in a tablet form. Methadone-d9 was selected as the template and 3-(propylmethacrylate)-trimethoxysilane was used as precursor. MIP-Tablet was applied for micro-solid phase extraction (μ-SPE). The MIP-Tablet was used for the determination of methadone in human plasma samples utilizing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; and each tablet could be used twenty times. The extraction time was 10 min while desorption time was 6 min. Factors affecting the extraction efficiency such as desorption solvents, sample pH, salt addition, extraction time, desorption time and adsorption capacity were investigated. The calibration curves were obtained within the range of 5–5000 ng/mL using methadone in human plasma samples. The coefficients of determination (r2) values were ≥0.999 for all runs and the extraction recovery was >80%. The accuracy values for quality control samples varied from +3.6 to +9.7% and the inter-day precision (RSD %) values were ranged from 5.0 to 8.0%. The limit of detection was 1.0 ng/mL and the lower limit of quantification was 5 ng/mL utilizing methadone in human plasma samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3ahumans 3aliquid chromatography 3amethadone 3amolecular imprinting 3apH 3apolyethylene 3aquality control 3asolvents 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aMolecularly imprinted polymer 0aSol-gel 0aTablet 0aMicro-solid phase extraction 0aMethadone 0aHuman plasma1 aAbdel-Rehim, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3862-88780 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2016.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245012500169300001400294520188800308592002802196650001302224650001702237650001502254650001502269650001202284650001502296650001002311650001402321650001802335650001302353700002102366773009202387856005502479852000902534655001202543IND4487704720221121230307.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448770472DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1096-0031.2011.00364.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuil, Noemí12aA comprehensive molecular phylogeny of tardigrades—adding genes and taxa to a poorly resolved phylum‐level phylogeny  ap. 21-49.  aTardigrades constitute a phylum of miniaturized metazoans with ca. 1030 living species, a fossil record that probably dates back to the Cambrian, and physiological properties that allow them to live in almost any environment known to host life on Earth—they can also survive in space. Despite broad consensus regarding their membership of the superclade Ecdysozoa, the exact position of the phylum remains contested (some analyses suggest onychophorans and arthropods as their closest relatives, while others suggest a relationship to nematodes and nematomorphs) and the internal relationships of the phylum are still poorly understood. In the present study, we present a hypothesis of tardigrade relationships by examining more taxa and more markers than any previously published phylogeny of the group. We generated novel data for three markers (18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, COI) for 42 individuals of 16 carefully identified species, comprising 12 genera and five families from the classes Heterotardigrada and Eutardigrada, and analysed them in conjunction with nearly all data available from GenBank. Our results show certain disagreement with current taxonomy both at higher ranks (families, orders, classes) and at low (generic) taxonomic levels. When studying the sensitivity to outgroup choice, the class Eutardigrada was monophyletic under only one combination of outgroups; all other combinations placed the eutardigrade order Apochela as sister to the class Heterotardigrada. Phylogenetic relationships within the other eutardigrade order, Parachela, were stable to outgroup choice. Eutardigrade superfamilies recently proposed by Sands and collaborators in the order Parachela were tested with the introduction of new sequences from additional genera, and the possible morphological synapomorphies supporting those superfamilies are discussed. © The Will Henning Society 2011.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3aNematomorpha 3aTardigrada 3aarthropods 3afossils 3agene banks 3agenes 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3ataxonomy1 aGiribet, Gonzalo0 tCladistics.g2012 Feb., v. 28, no. 1 p.21-49dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0748-30077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1096-0031.2011.00364.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009800168500002200266520144000288592002801728650001101756650002601767650001301793650000901806650002101815650001301836650001701849650001101866650001201877650001001889650000901899650002501908650003701933650001401970650000901984650001801993650001102011650001402022650001802036650002502054651001402079653001702093653001402110653002002124653001402144700002302158700002302181700002102204700002502225700002602250700002102276773008402297856008402381852000902465655001202474IND60568011420221121120509.0170628s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056801142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.04.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYost, Lisa J.10aEvaluation of triclosan in Minnesota lakes and rivers: Part II - human health risk assessment  aPre-press version  aTriclosan, an antimicrobial compound found in consumer products, has been detected in low concentrations in Minnesota municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. This assessment evaluates potential health risks for exposure of adults and children to triclosan in Minnesota surface water, sediments, and fish. Potential exposures via fish consumption are considered for recreational or subsistence-level consumers. This assessment uses two chronic oral toxicity benchmarks, which bracket other available toxicity values. The first benchmark is a lower bound on a benchmark dose associated with a 10% risk (BMDL10) of 47mg per kilogram per day (mg/kg-day) for kidney effects in hamsters. This value was identified as the most sensitive endpoint and species in a review by Rodricks et al. (2010) and is used herein to derive an estimated reference dose (RfD(Rodricks)) of 0.47mg/kg-day. The second benchmark is a reference dose (RfD) of 0.047mg/kg-day derived from a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 10mg/kg-day for hepatic and hematopoietic effects in mice (Minnesota Department of Health [MDH] 2014). Based on conservative assumptions regarding human exposures to triclosan, calculated risk estimates are far below levels of concern. These estimates are likely to overestimate risks for potential receptors, particularly because sample locations were generally biased towards known discharges (i.e., WWTP effluent).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanti-infective agents 3achildren 3afish 3afish consumption 3ahamsters 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3akidneys 3alakes 3amice 3amunicipal wastewater 3ano observed adverse effect level 3areceptors 3arisk 3arisk estimate 3arivers 3asediments 3asurface water 3awastewater treatment 3aMinnesota 0aHuman health 0aTriclosan 0aRisk assessment 0aMinnesota1 aBarber, Timothy R.1 aGentry, P.

The present study used isolated, saline-perfused trout hearts to determine the maximum cardiac performance during hypoxic perfusion and during changes in pacing frequency similar to the range of heart rate observed in intact trout. The threshold oxygen tension of the perfusate was between 25 and 46 Torr (3.33–6.13 kPa) for maintaining resting and maximum cardiac ouput, but was between 46 and 67 Torr (6.13 – 8.93 kPa) for maintaining maximum power output. Increasing the pacing frequency from 30 to 58 beats/min did not produce a proportionate increase in the maximum cardiac output because maximum stroke volume was reduced significantly. It is suggested that the reduction in maximum stroke volume occurs because atrial filling time is compromised at higher pacing frequencies in the isolated perfused heart.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiac output 3aheart 3aheart rate 3ahypoxia 3aoxygen 3atrout1 aSmall, S.1 aGraham, M.

However, the biological stability of emerging biofuels and their potential impact on copper-nickel alloys commonly used in marine systems has not been well documented. Two potential naval biofuels (Camelina-JP5 and Fisher-Tropsch-F76) and their petroleum-derived counterparts (JP5 and F76) were critically assessed in seawater/sediment incubations containing a metal coupon (70/30 Cu-Ni alloy). Relative to a fuel-unamended control (1.2 ± 0.4 μM/d), Camelina-JP5 (86.4 ± 1.6 μM/d) and JP5 (77.6 ± 8.3 μM/d) stimulated much higher rates of sulfate reduction than either FT-F76 (11.4 ± 2.7 μM/d) or F76 (38.4 ± 3.7 μM/d). The general corrosion rate (r² = 0.91) and pitting corrosion (r² = 0.92) correlated with sulfate loss in these incubations. Despite differences in microbial community structure on the metal or in the aqueous or sediment phases, sulfate reducing bacteria affiliated with Desulfarculaceae and Desulfobacteraceae became predominant upon fuel amendment. The identification of alkylsuccinates and alkylbenzylsuccinates attested to anaerobic metabolism of fuel hydrocarbons. Sequences related to Desulfobulbaceae were highly enriched (34.2–64.8%) on the Cu-Ni metal surface, regardless of whether the incubation received a fuel amendment. These results demonstrate that the anaerobic metabolism of biofuel linked to sulfate reduction can exacerbate the corrosion of Cu-Ni alloys. Given the relative lability of Camelina-JP5, particular precaution should be taken when incorporating this hydroprocessed biofuel into marine environments serviced by a Cu-Ni metallic infrastructure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesulfarculaceae 3aDesulfobacteraceae 3aDesulfobulbaceae 3aalloys 3aanaerobiosis 3abiodegradation 3abiofuels 3acommunity structure 3acorrosion 3ahydrocarbons 3ainfrastructure 3amarine environment 3amicrobial communities 3aseawater 3asediments 3asulfate-reducing bacteria 3asulfates 0aBiofuels 0aCu-Ni alloy 0aBiodegradation 0aBiocorrosion 0aBiofilm 0aSulfate-reducing bacteria1 aAydin, Egemen1 aLe Borgne, Sylvie1 aSunner, Jan1 aDuncan, Kathleen E.1 aSuflita, Joseph M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1619-52470 tChemosphere.g2018 Mar., v. 195 p.427-436dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.12.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245016700174300001400341520131900355592002801674650002601702650001401728650001501742650001201757650001401769650002501783650001201808650002301820650001201843650001501855650001201870650001101882650002601893650002201919650001401941650001201955650001101967653001401978653001201992653001502004653001502019653001402034653002502048700002202073700002002095700001602115700002302131773010602154856008502260852000902345655001202354IND60564184220221120143235.0180830e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056418422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.03.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerardi, Alessandra10aImproving the enzymatic hydrolysis of Saccharum officinarum L. bagasse by optimizing mixing in a stirred tank reactor: Quantitative analysis of biomass conversion  ap. 15-22.  aThe enzymatic hydrolysis of sugarcane bagasse, an important source for the second generation bioethanol production, was optimized in a stirred tank reactor and the power of stirring was monitored. A synergistic effect of mixing and enzymatic hydrolysis occurs: the mixing increases the cellulose conversion rate, whilst the increased conversion eases the mixing. The objective was to evaluate the effect of an improved mixing on the efficiency of the enzymatic hydrolysis and the possibility to bypass the washing step carried out before hydrolysis reaction. This step removes the inhibitors of hydrolytic enzymes, but it represents an economical and an energetic cost for bioethanol process. In addition, other monomeric sugars contained in pretreated material as xylose, arabinose and mannose, are removed during the washing step. In this study, the yields of glucose, xylose, arabinose and mannose were evaluated after enzymatic hydrolysis performed under different stirring conditions: at 300rpm and at 100/150rpm. At the stirring rate of 300rpm, the yield increase was 9% for glucose and as high as 90% for the other monosaccharides. These results suggest that the key to optimize the enzymatic hydrolysis reaction is an adequate mixing, proposing a way for an economical optimization of bioethanol synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharum officinarum 3aarabinose 3abioethanol 3abiomass 3acellulose 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzymes 3aethanol production 3aglucose 3ahydrolysis 3amannose 3amixing 3aquantitative analysis 3asugarcane bagasse 3asynergism 3awashing 3axylose 0aSugarcane 0aBagasse 0aBioethanol 0aBioreactor 0aCellulase 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis1 aBlasi, Alessandro1 aMolino, Antonio1 aAlbo, Laura1 aCalabrò, Vincenza0 tFuel processing technology.g2016 Aug., v. 149 p.15-22dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.03.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03436naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245009300177300001600270520177100286592002802057650002302085650002002108650001002128650001502138650001302153650002602166650001802192650002202210650001102232650002502243650002802268650001102296650001502307650001402322650001102336650002402347650001302371650003702384653001902421653003202440653003002472653001602502653003602518700002602554700005702580700001702637700002002654700001802674773009102692856009002783852000902873655001202882IND60590722220221120084438.0181011e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059072222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.12.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKadoya, Warren M.10aEvidence of anaerobic coupling reactions between reduced intermediates of 4-nitroanisole  ap. 372-380.  aNitroaromatic compounds are widely used in agricultural pesticides, pharmaceuticals, military explosives, and other applications. They enter the environment via manufacturing and municipal wastewater discharges and releases from agricultural and military operations. Because of their ubiquity and toxicity, they are considered an important class of environmental contaminants. Nitroaromatics are known to undergo reductive transformation to aromatic amines, and under aerobic conditions they are susceptible to coupling reactions which may lead to their irreversible incorporation into soil organic matter. However, there is also evidence of coupling reactions in the absence of oxygen between reduced intermediates of the insensitive munitions compound 2,4-dinitroanisole, leading to the formation of azo dimers. The formation of such products is a concern since they may be more toxic than the original nitroaromatic compounds. The objective of this research is to provide evidence of the anaerobic formation of azo coupling products. 4-Nitroanisole was used as a model compound and was spiked into incubations containing anaerobic granular sludge with H2 as the electron donor. Using liquid chromatography, UV–Vis spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry, the formation of the azo dimer 4,4′-dimethoxyazobenzene was confirmed. However, due to the instability of the azo bond under the reducing conditions of our incubations, the azo dimer did not accumulate. Consequently, 4-aminoanisole was the major product formed in our experiment. Other minor suspected coupling products were also detected in our incubations. The results provide clear evidence for the temporal formation of at least one azo dimer in the anaerobic reduction of a model nitroaromatic compound.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerobic conditions 3aaromatic amines 3adrugs 3aexplosives 3ahydrogen 3aliquid chromatography 3amanufacturing 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitroaromatic compounds 3aoxygen 3apesticides 3apollution 3asludge 3asoil organic matter 3atoxicity 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aNitroaromatics 0aAnaerobic biotransformation 0a2,4-Dinitroanisole (DNAN) 0aAzobenzenes 0aInsensitive munitions compounds1 aSierra-Alvarez, Reyes1 aWong, Stanley1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2630-40241 aAbrell, Leif1 aMash, Eugene A.1 aField, Jim A.0 tChemosphere.g2018 Mar., v. 195 p.372-380dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.12.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002400189245012100213300001800334506007600352520161900428592002802047596006002075596007002135506003702205650002402242650001502266650001702281650002802298650001202326650001002338650002202348650001802370650002502388650001902413650001502432650001502447650001302462650002402475700002002499700002902519700006402548773010802612856008202720852000902802655001202811IND60675886820221207125511.0191110e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067588682DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-019-01346-22doi7 aPMC67687692pmcid7 a309290452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHogue, Stephanie R.12aA Customized At-Home Stool Collection Protocol for Use in Microbiome Studies Conducted in Cancer Patient Populations  ap. 1030-1034.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFecal specimen collection in the clinical setting is often unfeasible for large population studies, especially because cancer patients on immunotherapy often experience constipation. A method for constructing and using an at-home stool collection kit designed for epidemiological studies in cancer patients is presented. Participation and compliance rates of the collection kit among late-stage cancer patients from an ongoing, longitudinal study are also discussed. The kit includes three different media on which samples are introduced. Using one stool sample, patients collect specimens by smearing stool onto a fecal occult blood test (FOBT) card, containing three slides for collection. Additional specimens from the same stool sample are added to one tube containing 8 mL of RNAlater preservative and one tube containing 8 mL of 95% ethanol. Stool specimens are stored at room temperature and returned to researchers within 3 days of collection. The purpose of this kit is to yield stool specimens on a variety of media that can be preserved for extended periods of time at room temperature and are compatible with multi-omics approaches for specimen analysis. According to leading microbiome researchers and published literature, each collection method is considered optimal for use in large epidemiological studies. Moreover, the kit is comprised of various components that make stool collection easy, so as not to burden the patient and hence maximize overall compliance. Use of this kit in a study of late-stage lung cancer patients had a participation rate of 83% and baseline compliance rate of 58%.  aPublisher supplied data  a02-25999-18-46cFlorida Academic Cancer Center Alliance  aP30-CA076292cH.

The objective of this study was to characterize water movement through the shallow vadose zone following surface irrigation. Two infiltration plots were installed in each of three predominant local soil types. Plots were instrumented to measure soil water content and shallow groundwater level. Data were used to calculate water infiltration, velocity of propagation of the wetting front, water fluxes, and water level response following irrigation. Results showed a low to moderate infiltration rate (0.001–0.056 m h⁻¹), relatively low levels of propagation of the wetting front (0.13–0.79 m h⁻¹), water flux (0.001–0.13 m h⁻¹), and shallow groundwater response (0.01–0.1 m) in Fruitland sandy loam and Werlog clay loam soils. In the Abiquiu-Peralta soil, however, a higher infiltration rate (0.002–0.124 m h⁻¹), wetting front propagation (0.28–3.75 m h⁻¹), water flux (0.007–0.925 m h⁻¹), and water level response (0.01–0.14 m) were observed. Results from this study helped to improve our understanding of the surface water and shallow groundwater interactions in an irrigated valley in northern New Mexico. The field data set obtained in this study can benefit future model characterization and contribute to extrapolating local results to larger spatial areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3airrigation water 3ahigh water table 3asoil water content 3airrigation 3aclay loam soils 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3airrigated soils 3asandy loam soils 3awetting front 3avadose zone 3aNew Mexico 0asoil water movement 0awater table1 aFernald, Alexander G.1 aGuldan, Steven J.1 aShukla, Manoj K.0 tVadose zone journal.g2009 May, v. 8, no. 2 p.414-425dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2008.00593Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02686naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245010900208300001600317520122500333592002801558650002101586650000901607650003001616650001901646650002601665650002301691650002001714650001901734653004501753653001801798653001601816653002101832653001501853700002001868700001901888700006001907700001801967700002101985700001802006773012402024856008302148852000902231655001202240IND60684038820221122080539.0201202e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068403882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.02.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrégoire, Brian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0920-816910aOrientation measurements of clay minerals by polarized attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy  ap. 274-284.  aThe orientation and organization of molecular guests within the interlayer of clay minerals control the reactivity and performance of tailored organo-clay materials. Such a detailed investigation of hybrid structure on the molecular scale is usually provided by computational methods with limited experimental validation. In this study, polarized attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy was used to extract quantitative orientation measurements of montmorillonite particles. The validity of the evanescent electric field amplitude calculations necessary to derive the order parameter was critically evaluated to propose a methodology for determining the orientation of the normal to the clay layer relative to a reference axis, enabling comparison with the results obtained from X-ray scattering experiments and molecular dynamic simulations. Subsequently, the orientation of the interlayer water dipole and surface hydroxyls with respect to the normal of the clay layer was experimentally determined, showing good agreement with molecular simulations. This methodology may provide quantitative insights into the molecular-level description of interfacial processes between organic molecules and clay minerals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray scattering 3aclay 3acomputational methodology 3aelectric field 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amolecular dynamics 3amontmorillonite 3aorganic matter 0aAttenuated total reflection spectroscopy 0aClay minerals 0aOrientation 0aLinear dichroism 0aThin layer1 aDazas, Baptiste1 aHubert, Fabien1 aTertre, Emmanuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2144-719X1 aFerrage, Eric1 aGrasset, Laurent1 aPetit, Sabine0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 May 01, v. 567 p.274-284dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.02.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012700168300001600295520098800311592002801299650002201327650001401349650002001363650001801383650001401401650002301415650001401438650001301452650001701465650001301482650003301495650001601528650002401544650003701568653002401605653002401629653002001653653001401673700001601687700001801703700002001721773010801741856008501849852000901934655001201943IND60564184620221122133105.0180830e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056418462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.03.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Mingming10aBlocky shapes Ca-Mg mixed oxides as a water-resistant catalyst for effective synthesis of biodiesel by transesterification  ap. 163-168.  aThe Ca-Mg mixed oxides were synthetized from a new method using calcium oxalate and magnesium oxalate as the precursors for transesterification of soybean oil. To elucidate their composition, morphology and basic properties, the resulting materials were characterized using: XRD, SEM, TEM, CO2-TPD and Nitrogen adsorption-desorption. The results showed that the catalyst with neat blocky structure had better water-resistance compared to the pure calcium oxide. And the CaO-MgO exhibited higher amounts of basic site and provided higher catalytic activity in the methanolysis process. The highest biodiesel yield reached 98.4% over CaO-MgO with a Ca-to-Mg molar ratio of 1:3 under the optimal reaction conditions: 1.0wt% of catalyst adding, 12:1 of methanol/oil and reacting at 70°C for 2h. Hopefully, this kind of stable solid base catalyst could confirm the yield of FAME still above 90% after using 5 times which demonstrated the good reusability of mixed oxide CaO-MgO catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiodiesel 3acalcium oxalate 3acalcium oxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3amagnesium 3amethanol 3amethanolysis 3anitrogen 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asoybean oil 3atransesterification 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aMixed oxide CaO-MgO 0aTransesterification 0aWater-resistant 0aBiodiesel1 aLiu, Yanlei1 aZhang, Pingbo1 aJiang, Pingping0 tFuel processing technology.g2016 Aug., v. 149 p.163-168dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.03.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03748naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245016800158500002000326520227200346592002802618596007102646650002402717650001402741650001002755650002002765650002002785650002402805650002602829650001902855650001702874650002002891650001802911650001502929650001602944650002102960700006602981700001803047700002303065773014303088856007403231852000903305655001203314IND60655999720221123042650.0190808e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065599972DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.140172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhat, Suheela10aPeroxidase as indicator enzyme of blanching in bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria): Changes in enzyme activity, color, and morphological properties during blanching  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study investigated the effect of ohmic and conventional blanching on different characteristics of bottle gourd. The varying temperature–time combinations (60–90°C for 1–5 min) were used and optimum temperature–time of blanching was selected according to peroxidase activity and color retention. Residual peroxidase activity reached a level of no detection at 80°C for 4 min in ohmic blanching and 90°C for 5 min in conventional blanching. Ohmic blanching (80°C—4 min) was more effective than conventional blanching (90°C—5 min) at lesser temperature–time combinations. The temperature dependence of enzyme inactivation followed first‐order reaction with R² ranging from 0.955 to 0.997 in all temperature ranges. Increase in blanching temperature led to increase in rate constant, k from 0.26 to 2.6 at 60 to 90○C in conventional blanching and 0.30–1.6 at 60 to 80○C, respectively, in ohmic blanching. Color of blanched samples was well retained in both conventional and ohmic blanched samples as compared to control sample. Hue angle (h○) and (−a*) values of blanched samples increased with increasing temperature and time of blanching. Minimum browning index was observed in ohmically blanched (BO) samples. Microstructural and textural study of bottle gourd cubes blanched under optimized conditions (80°C—4 min; 90°C—5 min) were studied. Ohmic blanching was found more pronounced in faster degradation of residual enzyme activity and retention of color. Laser diffraction analysis of BO samples of bottle gourd showed highest decrease in particle size. Losses in functional properties were more pronounced in conventional blanched samples. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Consumer demand for bottle gourd juice (BGJ) owing to its high nutritional value and pharmacological benefits has led emphasis on improving its quality and market value. However, due to high enzymatic activity BGJ turn brown that appears to be unacceptable and leads to loss of market value. Peroxidases being high heat‐resistant enzymes can act as potential trace markers for complete enzyme inactivation. Moreover, retention of color without much degradation to nutritional quality need to be assessed for increasing benefits and maximum returns.  aPublisher supplied data  cSant Longowal Institute of Engineering & Technology, Punjab, India 3aLagenaria siceraria 3ablanching 3acolor 3aconsumer demand 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inactivation 3afunctional properties 3aheat tolerance 3amarket value 3anutritive value 3aparticle size 3aperoxidase 3atemperature 3avegetable juices1 aSaini, Charanjiv Singh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9246-17731 aManish Kumar,1 aSharma, Harish K.,0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2019 Aug., v. 43, no. 8 p.e14017-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.140173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01758naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245004500160300001600205520093700221592002801158653001801186653001501204653002301219653002001242773014701262856007401409852000901483655001201492IND60128381220221119052733.0151115e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012838122DNAL7 a10.1899/10-021.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeWalt, R.

The goals and methods of DNA barcoding and the criticisms leveled at the procedure by the taxonomic community are explained. The major goal of DNA-barcoding efforts is to aid identification of specimens by matching sequences to a sequence library. This goal is achievable, but barcoding efforts must be coupled with a much wider sampling regime and should be done with the full cooperation and collaboration of the taxonomic community. Through collaborative efforts, taxonomists and barcode advocates can build capacity for taxonomy and sequence the vast number of specimens needed to build a truly comprehensive barcode library for use by benthic scientists. Other barcoding goals, such as species diagnosis and biodiversity surveys, are more problematic, but solutions are possible.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDNA barcoding 0afreshwater 0amacroinvertebrates 0aaquatic insects0 tJournal of the North American Benthological Society.g2011 Mar., v. 30, no. 1 p.174-181dNorth American Benthological Societyx0887-35937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1899%2F10-021.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245011800163520162500281592002801906650001501934650001601949650001701965650001201982650001701994650001902011650001702030650001302047650001502060650001802075650001002093650001002103650000802113653001502121653002602136653002302162653002102185653003402206700001402240700001802254700001702272700001602289700001702305700001702322700001802339700001802357773011102375856008602486852000902572655001202581IND60761201820221118193847.0220222e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076120182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1109252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qin10aCharacterization of key aroma compounds and core functional microorganisms in different aroma types of Liupao tea  aLiupao tea is a representative Chinese dark tea. Stale-aroma type, betelnut-aroma type and fungal-aroma type were the main aroma types of Liupao tea. In this study, aroma profiles and fungal communities of the three aroma types of Liupao tea were examined by HS-SPME/GC–MS and Illumina MiSeq analysis. A total of 102 volatiles were identified and quantified in Liupao tea. Indicated by OPLS-DA analysis, six aroma compounds with stale, woody, roasted notes in stale-aroma type samples, five aroma compounds possessing smoky, minty, pungent notes in betelnut-aroma type samples, and nine aroma compounds owned minty, floral, fruity, woody, green notes in fungal-aroma type samples were responsible for the different aroma characteristics formation of Liupao tea. In addition, a total of 60 fungal genera were identified in Liupao tea. Aspergillus, Wallemia, Xeromyces were the predominant fungal genera in Liupao tea. Ten fungal genera, including Wallemia, Tritirachium, Debaryomyces, Trichomonascus, unclassified_o_Hypocreales in betelnut-aroma type, Rasamsonia, Candida, Blastobotrys, Acremonium in stale-aroma type, and Xeromyces in fungal-aroma type, were identified as the biomarkers in the three aroma types of Liupao tea. Furthermore, fungal genera including Aspergillus, Wallemia, Xeromyces, and Blastobotrys were identified as the core functional microorganisms contributing to the variation of volatile profiles based on O2PLS analysis. This study provided useful information on the key aroma compounds and core functional microorganisms that drive the different aroma characteristics formation of Liupao tea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcremonium 3aAspergillus 3aBlastobotrys 3aCandida 3aDebaryomyces 3aTrichomonascus 3aTritirachium 3aWallemia 3abiomarkers 3afood research 3afungi 3aodors 3atea 0aLiupao tea 0aAroma characteristics 0aKey aroma compound 0aFungal community 0aCore functional microorganism1 aHong, Xin1 aZheng, Xuexue1 aXu, Yongquan1 aLai, Xiumei1 aTeng, Cuiqin1 aWu, Wenliang1 aHuang, Jianan1 aLiu, Zhonghua0 tFood research international.g2022 Feb., v. 152 p.110925-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1109253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011800167300001600285520116900301592002801470650002201498650001101520650001401531650001101545650001801556650001501574650001401589650001101603650001701614653002701631653002801658653002601686653001101712700001601723700001401739700005301753700005601806773012401862856008301986852000902069655001202078IND60684039020221122174502.0201202e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068403902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.02.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Mengmeng10aBiomass-derived carbon from Ganoderma lucidum spore as a promising anode material for rapid potassium-ion storage  ap. 256-263.  aThe design and preparation of powerful anode materials are key to developing potassium-ion batteries. A biomass-based potassium anode material with a distinct hollow-cage structure was prepared by one-step carbonization. The target carbon exhibited a specific surface area of 104.4 m² g⁻¹ and mesopores/macropores distributed materials. When used as the negative electrode of a potassium-ion battery, the cage-like porous carbon (CPC) showed a reversible capacity of 407 mAh g⁻¹ after 50 cycles at 50 mA g⁻¹ current density. After 100 cycles, at a current density of 200 mA g⁻¹, the reversible capacity was 163.8 mAh g⁻¹. It still exhibits an extremely long cycle stability at high current densities (discharge capacity of 124.6 mAh g⁻¹ after 700 cycles at a current density of 1 A g⁻¹). The excellent performance is attributed to the stable cage-like carbon scaffold and uniform continuous distribution of mesopores/macropores to improve ion diffusion kinetics and electronic conductivity. These results indicate that a properly designed CPC can effectively increase the capacity and cycle stability of a potassium-ion battery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGanoderma lucidum 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3amacropores 3apotassium 3aspores 3asurface area 0aBiomass-derived carbon 0aGanoderma lucidum spore 0aPotassium ion battery 0aAnodes1 aDai, Jinyan1 aHe, Minyi1 aDuan, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0944-69951 aYao, Weitang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9558-01560 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 May 01, v. 567 p.256-263dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.02.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245011800173300001800291520110600309592002801415650001401443650001801457650001101475650001801486650001801504650001701522650001001539653002101549653001401570653001601584653003501600653001701635700002101652700002101673773010301694856009001797852000901887655001201896IND60599721920221119101818.0180702e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059972192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.05.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Kang-In10aFootprint- and xeno-free human iPSCs derived from urine cells using extracellular matrix-based culture conditions  ap. 8330-8338.  aThe efficient generation of integration- and xeno-free iPSCs is a prerequisite for their use in clinical applications. Furthermore, non-invasiveness of somatic cell acquisition for iPSC generation is another factor to consider. In this study, we established a practical, simple, and convenient method to generate integration- and xeno-free iPSCs from urine cells which can be obtained in a non-invasive manner. Our method was based on extracellular matrix-based xeno-free iPSC culture condition and episomal transfection, and worked efficiently with both urine cells and adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs). To obtain strictly xeno-free iPSCs, we also formulated a new xeno-free culture medium for primary urine cells. Intriguingly, urine cells displayed slower growth, and more dramatic increase in apoptosis at high passage numbers than ADSCs. However, urine cells at low passage (<P3) displayed modest apoptosis (∼7–8%) and relatively high (∼0.29%) efficiency of iPSC generation.This study reports the generation of integration- and xeno-free iPSCs from non-invasively obtained urine cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aculture media 3ahumans 3asomatic cells 3astromal cells 3atransfection 3aurine 0aIntegration-free 0aXeno-free 0aUrine cells 0aInduced pluripotent stem cells 0aCell therapy1 aKim, Hyeong-Taek1 aHwang, Dong-Youn0 tBiomaterials.g2014 Sept., v. 35, no. 29 p.8330-8338dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.05.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245011300161300001400274520183300288592002802121653002802149653002102177653002602198653002602224653001702250653002502267653002302292653001102315700002002326700002002346700002002366700002202386700002402408773014502432856007402577852000902651655001202660IND60128381420221119052832.0151115e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012838142DNAL7 a10.1899/10-040.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, Emily Y.10aTimber harvest intensifies spawning-salmon disturbance of macroinvertebrates in southeastern Alaskan streams  ap. 49-59.  aWe addressed how timber harvest can interact with salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) spawning activities to influence benthic macroinvertebrate communities in streams on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska. We predicted that spawning salmon would cause greater disturbance to macroinvertebrates in streams in watersheds with high than with low timber-harvest intensity because finer sediments that accumulate in streams after timber harvesting would be readily dislodged by spawning salmon and lower volumes of large wood in the streams would decrease availability of macroinvertebrate refugia from salmon activity. We used a modified Hess sampler to collect benthic macroinvertebrates from 6 riffles in each of 7 streams before and during the annual salmon run. Diptera biomass was lower and Plecoptera biomass was higher during the salmon run than before it. During the run, insect biomass, scraper biomass, and Ephemeroptera biomass were higher in streams with low than with high timber-harvest intensity, possibly because the finer sediments in the high timber-harvest intensity streams were more readily dislodged by salmon. Macroinvertebrate community structure (density and biomass) differed between before and during the run. Epeorus longimanus, Baetis, Seratella tibialis, Suwallia, Chironomidae, and Simuliidae were significant indicators of before-salmon benthic communities, whereas Sweltsa and Zapada cinctipes typified during-salmon communities. Some taxa probably are more tolerant of salmon disturbance than others, and their life histories might be adapted to the autumn salmon run. Overall, our results indicate that strong interactive effects can occur between anthropogenic activities and natural disturbance and that timber-harvest activity can intensify the effects of spawning-salmon disturbance on macroinvertebrates.  aPublisher supplied data 0ainteractive disturbance 0aOncorhynchus spp 0abenthic invertebrates 0aecosystem engineering 0abioturbation 0awatershed management 0acontext dependency 0aAlaska1 aBenbow, M.

O₃ treatment inhibited the decline in chlorophyll content and inhibited the activity of the chlorophyll‐degrading enzymes: chlorophyllase, chlorophyll‐degrading peroxidase, Mg‐dechelatase, and pheophytinase. Results also indicated that O₃ effectively inhibited the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and the generation of superoxide anion while increasing the enzyme activity of peroxidase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase, compared to untreated coriander. Thus, treatment of coriander with ozone may be a useful approach for maintaining the quality and extending the shelf life of coriander through its regulation of antioxidant and chlorophyll‐degrading enzyme activity. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Coriander is prone to postharvest yellowing or wilting of its leaves when stored at ambient temperature, and its quality deteriorates due to a rapid increase in senescence. Ozone treatments have been reported to induce disease resistance, stimulate the response to oxidative stress in plants, and effectively delay the decay of fruits and vegetables. Coriander treated with ozone may be a useful approach for maintaining postharvest quality through its regulation of antioxidant and chlorophyll‐degrading enzyme activity. The study demonstrated that ozone is a potential method for suppressing the postharvest quality deterioration in horticultural corps.  aPublisher supplied data  a31772022cChina Agriculture Research System Project (CARS‐23), National Natural Science Foundation of China  a20180404 and 20180705cBeijing Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences  a2016YFD0400901cNational Key R & D Program of China  a201709cYoung Investigator Fund of Beijing Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences  a6182016cNatural Science Foundation of Beijing 3aCoriandrum sativum 3aambient temperature 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3acatechol oxidase 3acell respiration 3achlorophyll 3achlorophyllase 3adisease resistance 3aenzyme activity 3afruits 3ahorticulture 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3aoxidative stress 3aozone 3aperoxidase 3apolyphenols 3apostharvest storage 3ashelf life 3astorage temperature 3asuperoxide anion 3avegetables 3awilting1 aShi, Meng1 aJia, Bin1 aYan, Zhicheng1 aGao, Lipu1 aGuan, Wenqiang1 aWang, Qing1 aZuo, Jinhua0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2019 Aug., v. 43, no. 8 p.e14020-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.140203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012500175300001400300520131900314592002801633650002301661650001401684650002401698650001101722650001601733653001601749653001101765653003301776653002401809653002701833653001601860653001001876700002301886773012801909856008602037852000902123655001202132IND60759182220221121052110.0211206e20211102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075918222DNAL7 a10.1080/09715010.2019.15703602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalamatian, S.

Empirical equations also assume steady-state condition which means the flood peak flows for a long time. In the present study, a methodology is presented for the reliability assessment of bridge piers against scouring considering the uncertainties involved in effective parameters and duration of the flood. Additional necessary experimental studies were also carried out to develop an equation for time development of scouring around a protected pier by a collar. Monte Carlo simulation technique was used for estimating the probability of bridge failure. In addition, Fault Tree analysis was employed for combining the interactions of various parameters and calculating the overall probability of failure. For unprotected piers, results showed that at lower flow intensities, flood time has a lower influence on probability of bridge failure. It was also concluded that the collar protection increases the reliability of bridge piers significantly, especially at lower flow intensities. Furthermore, the model was applied to find a relationship between the reliability index and safety factors under various flow conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aequations 3afault tree analysis 3amodels 3auncertainty 0aBridge pier 0acollar 0atime development of scouring 0afailure probability 0aMonte Carlo simulation 0areliability 0ascour1 aZarrati, Amir Reza0 tISH journal of hydraulic engineering.g2021 Nov. 02, v. 27, no.

This is achieved by maintaining the part of the coast that support these functions; the coastal foundation. The coastal foundation is maintained by means of sand nourishments. Up to now, it has been assumed that net transports across the coastal foundation’s offshore boundary at the 20 m depth contour are negligibly small. In the framework of the Coastal Genesis 2.0 program we investigated sand transports across this boundary and across other depth contours at the lower shoreface. This paper presents a computationally efficient approach to compute the annual sand transport rates at the Dutch lower shoreface. It is based on the 3D Dutch Continental Shelf Model with Flexible Mesh (3D DCSM-FM), a wave transformation tool and a 1DV sand transport module. We validate the hydrodynamic input against field measurements and present flow, wave and sand transport computations for the years 2013–2017. Our computations show that the net annual sand transport rates along the Dutch coast are determined by peak tidal velocities (and asymmetry thereof), density driven residual flows, wind driven residual flows and waves. The annual mean alongshore transports vary along the continuous 20 m depth contour. The computed total cross-shore transports are onshore directed over the continuous 20 m, 18 m and 16 m depth contours and increase with decreasing water depth. The effect of density difference and wind on the 3D structure of the flow and on the sand transports cannot be neglected along the Dutch lower shoreface. Our computations show that excluding the effect of density results in a significant decrease of the onshore directed transports. Also switching off wind largely counteracts this effect. The net cross-shore transport is determined by a delicate balance between gross onshore and offshore transports, where wave conditions are important. We show an example for Scheveningen where the net cross-shore transport is onshore directed when including all wave conditions but would be offshore directed when excluding waves higher than 3.5 m. In contrast, at Callantsoog the highest waves contribute more to the offshore directed transports. These results suggest that storm conditions play an important role in the magnitude and direction of the net annual transport rates at the lower shoreface.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aasymmetry 3acoastal zone management 3acoasts 3acontinental shelf 3ahydrodynamics 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3asand 3astorms 3awind 0aCoastal Genesis 2.0 0aDutch lower shoreface 0aSand transport 0aModelling1 aHuisman, Bas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0052-72001 aLuijendijk, Arjen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0292-23511 aSchrijvershof, Reinier1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4178-44061 avan der Werf, Jebbe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4860-27241 aZijl, Firmijn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0122-85631 ade Looff, Harry1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6609-76211 ade Vries, Wout0 tOcean & coastal management.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 217 p.105984-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1059843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006400149245010000213300001400313520130000327592002801627650002901655650001801684650002601702650001601728650001701744650001501761650001001776650001601786650003001802650002001832650001901852650002401871653002601895653002901921653001301950653001501963653001501978653001401993700001802007700002102025700002702046700002002073700002302093700002402116700002402140700002102164700002102185773011302206856008302319852000902402655001202411IND60603517320221117230250.0180716e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060351732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2014.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrigtsen, Anne Karin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0904-042610aComparison of PCR and serotyping of Group B Streptococcus in pregnant women: The Oslo GBS-study  ap. 31-35.  aStreptococcus agalactiae (GBS) is a leading cause of invasive neonatal infection. Serotyping of GBS is important in following epidemiological trends and vaccine development. Capsular serotyping of GBS by latex agglutination has been the predominant typing method, but more recently capsular genotyping has been introduced as an alternative method. The purpose of this study was to compare the relative performance of these methods in a contemporary population of pregnant women. We typed isolates from an unselected population of 426 colonized women at delivery using latex agglutination and a combination of four PCR methods. Antibiotic resistance was tested in 449 isolates. Capsular genotyping gave a result in all except three of 426 isolates. Fifty-nine of 426 isolates could not be typed by latex agglutination. Agreement between serotyping and genotyping was shown in 303 (71.1%) of the isolates. 10.2% of the isolates were resistant to erythromycin, 9.6% to clindamycin, 76.6% to tetracycline and none to penicillin. In conclusion, a substantial proportion of the colonizing strains were non-typeable by serotyping, but typeable by genotyping. This suggests that a diagnostic genotyping strategy is preferable to serotyping of the GBS polysaccharide capsule in colonized, pregnant women.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3aagglutination 3aantibiotic resistance 3aclindamycin 3aerythromycin 3agenotyping 3alatex 3apenicillins 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apolysaccharides 3apregnant women 3avaccine development 0aGroup B Streptococcus 0aStreptococcus agalactiae 0aSerotype 0aSerotyping 0aGenotyping 0aPregnancy1 aDedi, Lumnije1 aMelby, Kjetil K.1 aHolberg-Petersen, Mona1 aRadtke, Andreas1 aLyng, Randi Valsø1 aAndresen, Lise Lima1 aJacobsen, Anne Flem1 aFugelseth, Drude1 aWhitelaw, Andrew0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2015 Jan., v. 108 p.31-35dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2014.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03757naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245014500177300001800322520247200340592002802812650002102840650001202861650002002873650001302893650002302906650002102929650001502950650002402965650002002989650000903009650001703018650002103035650001103056650002203067650001103089650001103100650001603111700002703127773010503154856005503259852000903314655001203323IND4467400720221119130311.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446740072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02691.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMATTHEWS, WILLIAM J.13aAn invasive fish species within its native range: community effects and population dynamics of Gambusia affinis in the central United States  ap. 2609-2619.  a1. Management of invasive species benefits from detailed information on the biology of the invaders, both from where they have already invaded, and from within their areas of origin. Western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, is a widely invasive and destructive freshwater fish. However, within its native range, G. affinis co‐exists with many other fish species in a wide variety of habitats without obvious harm. 2. In this study, we used data on fish communities within the native range of G. affinis at 154 sites across a broad spatial scale to examine the effects of G. affinis on species richness and diversity of residual (species other than G. affinis) fish assemblages. We further used data based on annual samples at eight fixed river sites over 18 summers to examine temporal population dynamics of G. affinis and to test factors associated with population fluctuations. 3. Higher residual species richness occurred in the presence of G. affinis, but residual diversity did not differ. We found an inverse relationship between relative abundance of G. affinis and residual species richness (although effect size was extremely small), but no effect on residual diversity. 4. Gambusia affinis populations fluctuated markedly across summers at all eight fixed sites, but population sizes at a site over time were not autocorrelated. However, population fluctuations were highly correlated among sites across all years, suggesting that regional factors influenced population size. Regional abundance of G. affinis did not correlate with drought, rainfall or winter temperature, but varied with spring temperature. We suggest earlier onset of reproduction in warmer springs resulted in larger summer populations. 5. Overall, within its native range, G. affinis does not appear to impact negatively on the assemblages in which it occurs, possibly due to fluctuations in its density. These findings suggest that introduced Gambusia populations, and those of other invasive species, warrant careful monitoring over long periods of time where they have invaded. Long‐term monitoring of new populations can establish if they are prone to ‘boom and bust’ dynamics, in which case the invader may be less a threat than sometimes assumed. Population information from long‐term studies, either in their native ranges or at invaded sites, can thus help to form the basis of prudent, cost‐effective management strategies for invasive organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGambusia affinis 3adrought 3afreshwater fish 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3amonitoring 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation size 3arain 3areproduction 3aresidual effects 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature1 aMARSH‐MATTHEWS, EDIE0 tFreshwater biology.g2011 Dec., v. 56, no. 12 p.2609-2619dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02691.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245015100175300001600326520173000342592002802072650002702100650001502127650001302142650001402155650001302169650002402182650001902206650002102225650002002246651001302266653003402279653001002313653001602323653001302339653001302352700006002365773009502425856008902520852000902609655001202618IND60625156120221118031827.0190502e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062515612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.10.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, Carla14aThe integration of land use in public water reservoirs plans – A critical analysis of the regulatory approaches used for the protection of banks  ap. 762-775.  aThe water reservoirs created by dams and used for public water supply, irrigation or electricity production, have several environmental, economic and social values, and constitute strategic reserves in periods of water scarcity. Reservoirs are vulnerable to the impacts of land uses on their banks and so require careful planning and development control. Systematic studies on how water reservoirs plans formulate land use rules are, however, scarce. In Portugal, reservoirs for public water uses have been subject to protection plans but those have not raised much attention. This paper analyses the rules established by reservoir protection plans adopted in Portugal and assesses if the legal regime revised after the Water Framework Directive (WFD) entry into force has altered their regulatory approaches. The analysis uses a methodology based on a set of analytical factors proven valuable for comparative studies on regulatory approaches. The findings revealed that the Reservoir Legal Regime (RLR), as reviewed to adapt to the new regulatory framework that followed the WFD approval, did not bring robust changes to the earlier regulatory praxis. Although the relative importance of rules for reservoir banks is slightly reinforced, they are maintained as predominantly prohibitive and still poorer than before concerning targets definition. The increase of conditioned rules is not followed by a corresponding increase in mentioning indicators or nutrients. As rules on the reservoir banks are to be assimilated by different users and agencies, the paper stresses how they could foster more substantiated, referenced and balanced deterrence-compliance formulations in order to incentivize innovative land use options.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity generation 3airrigation 3aland use 3anutrients 3aplanning 3apublic water supply 3asocial benefit 3awater reservoirs 3awater shortages 3aPortugal 0aPublic water reservoirs plans 0aRules 0aLegislation 0aLand use 0aPortugal1 aFidélis, Teresa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6594-25710 tLand use policy.g2019 Feb., v. 81 p.762-775dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.10.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02272naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245010800176300001400284520106800298592002801366650001401394650002501408650002001433650001401453650002501467650002101492650002501513651001101538653001101549653002801560653002201588653002301610653001501633653001501648700002301663773009401686856008501780852000901865655001201874IND60485928520221119111906.0160218e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048592852DNAL7 a10.1080/08920753.2016.11166712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHimes-Cornell, Amber10aUsing Socioeconomic and Fisheries Involvement Indices to Understand Alaska Fishing Community Well-Being  ap. 36-70.  aOver recent years, fisheries managers have been going through a paradigm shift to prioritize ecosystem-based management. With this comes an increasing need to better understand the impacts of fisheries management decisions on the social well-being and sustainability of fishing communities. This article summarizes research aimed at using secondary data to develop socioeconomic and fisheries involvement indices to measure objective fishing community well-being in Alaska. Data from more than 300 communities in Alaska were used to create a database of socioeconomic and fisheries involvement indices of objective well-being and adaptability for Alaska communities dependent on marine resources. Each index was developed using a principal components factor analysis to assess the relative position of each community compared to all other communities in Alaska. We find that creating performance measures, such as the indices presented here, provides a useful way to track the status of socioeconomic conditions and fisheries involvement by communities over time.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3aecosystem management 3afactor analysis 3afisheries 3afisheries management 3amarine resources 3asocioeconomic status 3aAlaska 0aAlaska 0acommunity vulnerability 0afishing community 0afishing dependence 0aresilience 0awell-being1 aKasperski, Stephen0 tCoastal Management.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 44, no. 1 p.36-70dTaylor & Francisx1521-04217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08920753.2016.11166713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02211naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245006600173506011700239506007600356520080000432592002801232506003701260650000901297650001201306650001101318650002801329650002701357650001101384650001101395650001301406653002101419653002501440653001701465653002601482653002801508700005801536773011001594856008801704852000901792655001201801IND60761202220221207143356.0220614e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076120222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1060192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCabioch, Brieuc10aIntegrated beach management in large coastal cities.

Some of these beaches are located in large coastal cities with which they interact on a physical and social level. Facing this particularity, we propose a state of knowledge dedicated to the management of beaches in large coastal cities, here defined as cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants. Using the WoS and an analysis grid, 53 articles were identified and studied. This analysis shows that these beaches at the interface of a large coastal city are mainly the subject of sectorial studies and that the interactions between the city and the beach are relatively little studied. In this context, this article aims to highlight the need to develop integrated management model specific to beaches located in large cities.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarea 3abeaches 3acities 3acoastal zone management 3ainformation management 3amodels 3aoceans 3apressure 0aBeach management 0aLarge coastal cities 0aBeach system 0aIntegrated management 0aCity-beach interactions1 aRobert, Samuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3595-57930 tOcean & coastal management.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 217 p.106019-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1060193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02087naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002400137245011200161300001600273520115100289592002801440650002201468650001301490650001001503650001201513650001001525650001001535650001301545650001201558773012301570856007101693852000901764655001201773IND60517319020221121221516.0160329e19890201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051731902DNAL7 a10.1139/z89-0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSvendsen, Gerald E.10aPair formation, duration of pair-bonds, and mate replacement in a population of beavers (Castor canadensis)  ap. 336-340.  aCharacteristics of the breeding units in a population of North American beavers (Castor canadensis) are presented. All breeding units were monogamous. The hypothesis that a successful pair-bond usually occurs between an older and larger female and a younger and smaller male was rejected. Fifty-six percent of all pairs were formed in the months of September, October, and November. Newly formed pairs occurred predominantly between a resident beaver that had not yet acquired a mate, or had lost a previous mate, and an immigrant. A 2-year-old size beaver was one of the pair mates in 90% of newly formed pairs. The average pair-bond lasted 2.5 years. The length of a pair-bond was associated with conditions at the site of residency; beavers living in the more stable conditions (lake sites) remained together longer than did beavers living in comparatively unstable conditions (stream sites). Loss of the male was the cause of 39% of the breakups of pairs, loss of the female, 61%. Desertion was documented in 4%. Because of the age discrepancy at the time of pairing, death of one of the mates was presumably the major cause of mate turnover.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastor canadensis 3abreeding 3adeath 3afemales 3alakes 3amales 3amonogamy 3astreams0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g1989 Feb. 01, v. 67, no. 2 p.336-340dNRC Research PresswJournal:19146x0008-43017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z89-0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014200169300001600311520106200327592002801389650002901417650002501446650001901471650001501490650001501505650002601520650001601546650001401562650001501576653001801591653001501609653003501624653001901659700001701678700001801695773011301713856008601826852000901912655001201921IND60555389220221122182016.0180831e20161120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055538922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.07.0972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWikström, F.14aThe influence of packaging attributes on recycling and food waste behaviour – An environmental comparison of two packaging alternatives  ap. 895-902.  aThis paper analyses how user behaviour influences the environmental comparison of two different packages for minced meat - a lightweight tube and a tray. The direct and indirect environmental effects are evaluated using simplified LCA. A number of packaging attributes with regard to food waste and recycling behaviour are analysed for the packages, and then used for the scenario calculations. The results show that the tube is the superior environmental alternative when only the direct effects are considered. When indirect effects and user behaviour are included in the comparison, the tray is the better alternative due to higher recycling rates and, most importantly, less food waste during the process of emptying. However, the environmental impacts due to the food waste in the tube may be compensated for, if the longer shelf-life of the tube results in lower wastage in the households. It is concluded that indirect environmental effects and user behaviour should be included in environmental assessments of packaging to obtain meaningful results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3afood packaging 3afood waste 3ahouseholds 3alife cycle assessment 3aminced meat 3arecycling 3ashelf life 0aPackaging LCA 0aFood waste 0aIndirect environmental effects 0aUser behaviour1 aWilliams, H.1 aVenkatesh, G.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Nov. 20, v. 137 p.895-902dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.07.0973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013100169300001800300520139600318592002801714650002101742650002401763650002301787650001901810650001701829650001901846650001601865650001701881650001901898650001901917650001901936650001801955650001601973650001601989700001902005700002102024700001702045700001702062700001902079700002102098773009902119856008602218852000902304655001202313IND60577689220221119161717.0170810e20170808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057768922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b005572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandani, Sonam10aCarbon Dots as Nanodispersants for Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes: Reduced Cytotoxicity and Metal Nanoparticle Functionalization  ap. 7622-7632.  aThe colloidal stabilization of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in an aqueous medium through noncovalent interactions has potential benefits toward the practical use of this one-dimensional carbonaceous material for biomedical applications. Here, we report that fluorescent carbon nanodots can efficiently function as dispersing agents in the preparation of stable aqueous suspensions of CNTs at significant concentrations (0.5 mg/mL). The amphiphilic nature of carbon dots with a hydrophobic graphitic core could effectively interact with the CNT surface, whereas hydrophilic oxygenated functionalization on the C-dot surface provided excellent water dispersibility. The resultant CNT-C-dot composite showed significantly reduced cytotoxicity compared to that of unmodified or protein-coated CNTs, as demonstrated by cell viability and proliferation assays. Furthermore, the reducing capability of C-dots could be envisaged toward the formation of a catalytically active metal nanoparticle-CNT-C-dot composite without the addition of any external reducing or stabilizing agents that showed excellent catalytic activity toward the reduction of p-nitrophenol in the presence of NaBH₄. Overall, the present work establishes C-dots as an efficient stabilizer for aqueous dispersions of CNTs, leading to an all-carbon nanocomposite that can be useful for different practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3acarbon quantum dots 3acatalytic activity 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3adispersibility 3adispersions 3afluorescence 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3ananocomposites 3ap-nitrophenol 3astabilizers 3asurfactants1 aMajee, Prativa1 aSharma, Bhagwati1 aSarma, Daisy1 aThakur, Neha1 aNayak, Debasis1 aSarma, Tridib K.0 tLangmuir.g2017 Aug. 08, v. 33, no. 31 p.7622-7632dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.7b005573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03587naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245014400176300001800320520184000338592002802178650002302206650002502229650001302254650001402267650001202281650002002293650001302313650001302326650001902339650001902358650001802377650001402395650003702409650000902446650001402455650001402469650000702483650002502490650001302515650001102528650002702539653002602566653001902592653002502611653001302636653001902649653002202668700001502690700002102705700002102726700002002747700001602767773010302783856009002886852000902976655001202985IND60599722320221119101553.0180702e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059972232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.05.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshizaki, Yuta10aPotentiation of pH-sensitive polymer-modified liposomes with cationic lipid inclusion as antigen delivery carriers for cancer immunotherapy  ap. 8186-8196.  aCationic lipid-incorporated liposomes modified with pH-sensitive polymers were prepared by introducing 3, 5-didodecyloxybenzamidine as a cationic lipid to egg yolk phosphatidylcholine liposomes modified with 3-methylglutarylated hyperbranched poly(glycidol) (MGlu-HPG) as a pH-sensitive polymer. These liposomes were stable at neutral pH, but were destabilized below pH 6.0 because MGlu-HPG changed its characteristics from hydrophilic to hydrophobic in response to the pH decrease. Cationic lipid inclusion improved their pH sensitivity at weakly acidic pH and association of liposomes with murine dendritic cell (DC) lines. Cationic lipid-incorporated liposomes delivered entrapped ovalbumin (OVA) molecules not only to cytosol but also to endosome/lysosome. Treatment with cationic lipid-incorporated liposomes induced up-regulation of antigen presentation-involved molecules on DCs, the promotion of cytokine production, and antigen presentation via both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules. Especially, antigen presentation via MHC class II was promoted by cationic lipid inclusion, which might correspond to efficient endosome/lysosome delivery of OVA. Subcutaneous administration of OVA-loaded cationic lipid-incorporated liposomes induced antigen-specific antibody production in serum and Th1-dominant immune responses in the spleen. Furthermore, administration of the cationic lipid-incorporated liposomes to mice bearing E.G7-OVA tumor more significantly reduced the tumor volume than liposomes without cationic lipids. Therefore, cationic lipid inclusion into pH-sensitive polymer-modified liposomes, which can achieve both efficient antigen intracellular delivery and activation of antigen presenting cell, is an effective approach to develop antigen carriers for efficient cancer immunotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibody formation 3aantigen presentation 3aantigens 3acytokines 3acytosol 3adendritic cells 3aegg yolk 3aglycidol 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aimmunotherapy 3alysosomes 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amice 3aneoplasms 3aovalbumin 3apH 3aphosphatidylcholines 3apolymers 3aspleen 3asubcutaneous injection 0apH-sensitive liposome 0aCationic lipid 0aCancer immunotherapy 0aAdjuvant 0aDendritic cell 0aCellular immunity1 aYuba, Eiji1 aSakaguchi, Naoki1 aKoiwai, Kazunori1 aHarada, Atsushi1 aKono, Kenji0 tBiomaterials.g2014 Sept., v. 35, no. 28 p.8186-8196dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.05.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03591naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005500140245016900195500002000364520201600384592002802400596009002428596005702518596004002575650002502615650001702640650000902657650001502666650001002681650001602691650001302707650001102720650001202731650001802743650001002761700001302771700001302784700002002797700001702817700005602834700001702890773014302907856007403050852000903124655001203133IND60656000520221123012738.0190808e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065600052DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.140412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shuxun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6296-753810aAnthocyanin copigmentation and color attributes of bog bilberry syrup wine during bottle aging: Effect of tannic acid and gallic acid extracted from Chinese gallnut  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTannic and gallic acids, extracted from Chinese gallnut, were applied as copigments to bog bilberry syrup wine with two different mass ratios of 1:2.5 and 1:6 of anthocyanin to copigment. The effect of copigmentation on anthocyanins and the changes in non‐anthocyanin compounds and color characters during 6 months of aging were studied. Addition of copigment significantly helped to retain redness while reduced increase in the yellow shade and lightness. After 6 months of aging, the syrup wines with added copigments had 1.4–1.8 times higher total anthocyanin content compared to the control. The percentage of polymeric anthocyanins in copigment treated wines was lower than in control wine. Oppositely, the copigment treated wines possessed a higher percentage of copigmented anthocyanins than the control. The highest value of redness, the lowest percentage of polymeric anthocyanins and the highest percent of copigmented anthocyanins were presented in the wines treated with a high dosage of gallic acid. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Bottle aging shows a negative effect on the appearance of bog bilberry syrup wine. Copigmentation between anthocyanins and copigments is an alternative approach to prevent the loss of color during aging. However, the high expense of pure copigments limits the application of this protocol in wine industry. The cheaper copigments of tannic acid and gallic acid, extracted from Chinese gallnut, were used in the present study and presented positive effects on remaining red hub of bog bilberry fermented products through the enhancement of anthocyanin copigmentation. The current study provides new insights on exploiting somewhat poorly utilized bog bilberry byproduct in wine industry. The findings also verify the practicable of the economical copigments of Chinese gallnut extracted tannic and gallic acids in bog bilberry fermented products. On the other hand, observations made with bog bilberry in this study may be exploited with other berry materials, as well.  aPublisher supplied data  aKLVE201701cKey Laboratory of Viticulture and Enology, Ministry of Agriculture, China  a2015-4-49cChina Forestry Administration 948 Project  aKLVE201701cMinistry of Agriculture 3aVaccinium uliginosum 3aanthocyanins 3abogs 3abyproducts 3acolor 3agallic acid 3apolymers 3asyrups 3atannins 3awine industry 3awines1 aLi, Siyu1 aLin, Guo1 aMarkkinen, Niko1 aYang, Hangyu1 aZhu, Baoqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9767-68881 aZhang, Bolin0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2019 Aug., v. 43, no. 8 p.e14041-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.140413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245012000169300001800289500002000307500000900327520151500336592002801851596006601879596006601945596002402011650002302035650002102058650001202079650001102091650001402102650001802116650002302134650001402157650001402171650001402185700001402199700001402213700001602227700001702243773013302260856008402393961001302477852000902490655001202499IND60665574220221122055316.0220513e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066557422DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2018.08.05172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, B.

Primarily due to their photoperiodic nature, efforts to utilize these resources have been slow. To complement efforts to develop day‐neutral converted germplasm lines, we identified a number of naturally occurring day neutral landrace genotypes and evaluated their breeding potential when crossed to elite upland germplasm lines and cultivars. The mean performance of parental lines and F₂ hybrids along with genetic effect estimates indicate that naturally occurring day‐neutral landrace genotypes provided average agronomic performance while increasing fiber quality performance. Results suggest that crosses derived from naturally occurring day‐neutral genotypes and elite upland lines result in new allelic combinations that interact in both an additive and nonadditive way. However, it appears that several naturally occurring day‐neutral genotypes transmit negatively correlated alleles for agronomic performance and fiber quality that often display opposite additive and nonadditive effects. These negatively correlated allele combinations present a major challenge for cotton breeding programs. Future efforts that determine the percentage of “new” alleles present in the landrace germplasm, along with innovative breeding methods focused on efficiently capturing beneficial alleles, are needed to expand the cotton genetic base.  aPublisher supplied data  a6082‐21000‐008‐00DcCurrent Research Information System  a3091‐21000‐041‐00DcCurrent Research Information System  cCotton Incorporated 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aagronomic traits 3aalleles 3acotton 3acultivars 3afiber quality 3agenetic background 3agermplasm 3ahighlands 3alandraces1 aHugie, K.1 aHinze, L.1 aWu-O, Jess,1 aJones, D.

Mercury adsorption was well described by pseudo-second order and Langmuir isotherm models with maximum adsorption capacity of 39.8 mg g⁻¹. Additional fitting of intraparticle model showed that mercury in the MRDP freshwater marsh soil was controlled by both external surface adsorption and intraparticle diffusion. The partition of adsorbed mercury (mg g⁻¹) revealed that mercury was primarily adsorbed into organic-bond fraction (12.09) and soluble/exchangeable fraction (10.85), which accounted for 63.5% of the total adsorption, followed by manganese oxide-bound (7.50), easily mobilizable carbonate-bound (4.53), amorphous iron oxide-bound (0.55), crystalline Fe oxide-bound (0.41), and residual fraction (0.16). Mercury adsorption capacity was generally elevated along with increasing solution pH even though dominant species of mercury were non-ionic HgCl2, HgClOH and Hg(OH)2 at between pH 3 and 9. In addition, increasing background NaCl concentration and the presence of humic acid decreased mercury adsorption, whereas the presence of phosphate, sulfate and nitrate enhanced mercury adsorption. Mercury adsorption in the MRDP freshwater marsh soil was reduced by the presence of Pb, Cu, Cd and Zn with Pb showing the greatest competitive adsorption. Overall the adsorption capacity of mercury in the MRDP freshwater marsh soil was found to be significantly influenced by potential environmental changes, and such factors should be considered in order to manage the risks associated with mercury in this MRDP wetland for responding to future climate change scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acadmium 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3acopper 3afreshwater 3ahumic acids 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amarshes 3amercuric chloride 3amercury 3amodels 3anitrates 3apH 3aphosphates 3arisk 3asodium chloride 3asoil 3asorption isotherms 3asulfates 3azinc 3aLouisiana 3aMississippi River 0aMercury adsorption 0aMetal fractionation 0aClimate change 0aCoastal wetland 0aFreshwater marsh1 aWang, Jim J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5082-82341 aXiao, Ran1 aPensky, Scott M.1 aKongchum, Manoch1 aDeLaune, R.

This paper offers a quantitative study of Lean/Green integration focused on waste reduction techniques in manufacturing processes. The literature confirms the convergence of the concepts of Lean Manufacturing and Green Management. Specifically, Waste Reduction Techniques are considered one of the main areas of the overlap between the Lean and Green paradigms. This offers interesting possibilities for future research on the development of quantitative studies on Waste Reduction Techniques, especially for a solid waste minimization program in manufacturing. Using the Design of Experiments tool, the present study measures the influence of different methods, derived from both the Lean and Green approaches, on solid waste management performance. Based on these results, a hierarchy of progress factors for a waste minimization program in manufacturing is outlined: the 3R Hierarchy must be preferred to a deadly waste (muda) analysis and combining the 3R Hierarchy and the deadly wastes of Lean Management improves the performance of a waste minimization program in manufacturing. In addition, the use of a Lean/Green matrix —a check-list that integrates Lean and Green best practices— was shown to consistently increase the performance of a waste minimization plan and as a result, the impact on the waste reduction can be doubled. This work is of interest to practitioners because they can build upon this experience to implement a waste reduction program using a set of tools to monitor and measure the program's achievements, which can ultimately lead to balanced performance improvement in terms of environmental, social and economic dimensions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aexperimental design 3amanufacturing 3aresearch and development 3asolid wastes 3asustainable manufacturing 3awaste reduction 0aGreen supply chain management 0aLean manufacturing 0aWaste management 0aWaste reduction techniques1 aLamouri, Samir1 aCarbone, Valentina0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Nov. 20, v. 137 p.567-578dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.07.1073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245008100166300001600247500000900263520154200272592002801814650002601842650002501868650002201893650002601915650001201941650001001953650001301963650000901976650001601985650002702001650001102028650001302039650002002052650002102072650002402093650001002117700001902127700001502146700001802161773012002179856008402299852000902383655001202392IND60665574320221122055320.0191228e200005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066557432DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2000.403611x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEhlers, J.D.10aInheritance of a Broad-Based Form of Root-Knot Nematode Resistance in Cowpea  ap. 611-618.  aepub  aRoot-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are serious pests of cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] and many other crops worldwide. Host plant resistance is the primary means for managing root-knot nematodes in cowpea, yet few resistance genes have been identified and their effectiveness can vary depending on the specific nematode isolate. Therefore, there is a need to describe new genes that confer a high level of resistance to a broad spectrum of these pests. This study was conducted to determine the inheritance of resistance to M. incognita (Kofoid and White) Chitwood and M. javanica (Treub) Chitwood in a blackeye-type cowpea line H8-8R that is expressed at a higher level than the resistance conferred by gene Rk in current cultivars CB46 and CB88. F₁, F₂, and F₂-derived F₃ families from crosses between H8-8R and CB88 or CB46 were screened for reaction to Rk-avirulent and Rk-virulent M. incognita and Rk-aggressive M. javanica isolates in growth-pouch and pot tests. Nematode egg numbers and egg-mass production on roots gave segregation patterns in all tests that were consistent with the model that the additional resistance in H8-8R is conferred by a single recessive gene. The data indicated this recessive gene is independent of gene Rk, confers partial resistance when expressed alone, and has an additive effect of increasing resistance in the presence of gene Rk Line TVu4552 in the pedigree of H8-8R was identified as the probable donor parent of the recessive gene, for which we propose the gene symbol rk3  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aMeloidogyne javanica 3aVigna unguiculata 3aadditive gene effects 3acowpeas 3acrops 3acrossing 3aeggs 3ahost plants 3ainheritance (genetics) 3amodels 3apedigree 3arecessive genes 3aresistance genes 3aroot-knot nematodes 3aroots1 aMatthews, W.C.1 aHall, A.E.1 aRoberts, P.A.0 tCrop science.g2000 May, v. 40, no. 3 p.611-618dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2000.403611x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245017000167300001800337520152400355592002801879596005901907596005901966596005002025596006702075650001102142650001302153650001702166650001602183650001602199650002502215650002402240650001002264651001002274700002002284700002002304700001902324700001602343700001302359700001602372700001502388700005702403773013702460856008202597852000902679655001202688IND60675888120221117164516.0210731e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067588812DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-018-1866-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Fang-fang10aAssociation between erythrocyte fatty acids in de novo lipogenesis pathway and DXA-derived body fat and trunk fat distribution in Chinese adults: a prospective study  ap. 3229-3239.  aPURPOSE: Higher levels of fatty acids (FAs) in the de novo lipogenesis (DNL) pathway might be associated with higher levels of fat mass (FM), while limited evidence is available from the general population. We aimed to examine the associations between DNL-FAs and body fat and fat distribution in a general population of Chinese adults. METHODS: This community-based prospective cohort study included 3,075 participants (68% women) aged 40–75 years in urban Guangzhou, China. We measured erythrocyte DNL-FAs composition (including C16:0, C16:1n-7, C18:0, and C18:1n-9) at baseline and %FM over the total body (TB), trunk, limbs, android (A) and gynoid (G) regions after 3.2 years and 6.3 years of follow-up, respectively. RESULTS: Generally, higher proportions of individual erythrocyte DNL-FAs and their combined index were positively associated with adipose indices in the multivariable cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. The cross-sectional percentage mean differences in quartile 4 (vs. 1) of the DNL index were 3.43% (TB), 4.56% (trunk), and 2.67% (A/G ratio) (all P trends < 0.01). The corresponding values in longitudinal changes of adipose indices were 1.40% (TB), 1.78% (trunk), and 1.32% (A) (all P trends < 0.05). The above associations tended to be more pronounced in the trunk and android area than the limbs and gynoid area. CONCLUSIONS: Erythrocyte DNL-FAs may contribute to an increase in total body fat in Chinese adults, particularly FM distributed in trunk and abdominal regions.  aPublisher supplied data  a81472965cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81602853cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2007032c5010 Program for Clinical Researches  a17ykpy12cSun Yat-sen University Foundation for Youth Teachers 3aadults 3abody fat 3aerythrocytes 3afatty acids 3alipogenesis 3alongitudinal studies 3aprospective studies 3awomen 3aChina1 aChen, Zhan-yong1 aZheng, Ju-Sheng1 aLin, Jie-sheng1 aLi, Yi-hong1 aQiu, Rui1 aWang, Cheng1 aSun, Li-li1 aChen, Yu-ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1658-55280 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2019 Dec., v. 58, no. 8 p.3229-3239dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949855x1436-62077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-018-1866-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245005100177300001800228520125400246592002801500650001301528650002901541650001201570650000901582650001601591650001401607650002501621650000901646650003001655650001201685650001501697650002601712650000901738650002301747650001201770650001301782650001001795651002301805651001801828653001201846653002001858653002301878700002401901700002001925773011701945856008402062852000902146655001202155IND60121963520221120152330.0150324e20140903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012196352DNAL7 a10.1080/10807039.2013.8585262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuraga, Rama Mohana R.10aPerceptions of Mercury Risk and Its Management  ap. 1385-1405.  aAnthropogenic activities, such as coal burning for electricity generation, release mercury (Hg), a toxic, bioaccumulative pollutant with potential health impacts primarily borne by specific population groups such as women of child-bearing age and subsistence fishers. Current Hg risk communication efforts and much of the extant research on Hg risk perceptions focus on these groups most at-risk. Little is known about the perceptions of Hg risk among the general public, although their support is required for implementing Hg emissions mitigation policies. We report results from two surveys—one a U.S. nationally representative Internet survey and the other a mail survey of New England residents—on a range of perceptions of the general population regarding Hg risk and its management. Our analysis of quantitative and qualitative data from the surveys point toward some gaps in public understanding of Hg risk, on aspects such as sources of mercury release, agencies responsible for mercury information, and products that contain mercury. Our results suggest that agencies responsible for providing Hg information should go beyond fish advisories and enhance their efforts at wider dissemination of information on Hg risk and its management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aanthropogenic activities 3aburning 3acoal 3aelectricity 3aemissions 3aenvironmental policy 3afish 3ainformation dissemination 3amercury 3apollutants 3aquantitative analysis 3arisk 3arisk communication 3asurveys 3atoxicity 3awomen 3aNew England region 3aUnited States 0amercury 0arisk perception 0arisk communication1 aHowarth, Richard B.1 aBorsuk, Mark E.0 tHuman and ecological risk assessment.g2014 Sept. 3, v. 20, no. 5 p.1385-1405dTaylor & Francisx1549-78607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2013.8585263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245014000164300001600304500002000320500000900340520133800349592002801687650002001715650001401735650001501749650002501764650001101789650001301800650001601813650001401829650002301843650001101866650002001877650002601897650001701923650001501940650002001955650002101975650002001996650001402016700001802030700001802048773013102066856008402197852000902281655001202290IND60665574420221122055228.0220513e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066557442DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2017.08.04912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Feng10aEnhancement of Germination, Seedling Growth, and Oxidative Metabolism of Barley under Simulated Acid Rain Stress by Exogenous Trehalose  ap. 783-791.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aThis study investigated the effects of simulated acid rain on germination, seedling growth, and oxidative metabolism in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Barley seeds were separately soaked in trehalose solutions of 5, 10, and 15 mM concentration or distilled water (the control). Results showed inhibited seed germination, increased foliar damage, decreased chlorophyll content, damaged roots, and delayed seedlings growth in barley when exposed to acid rain at pH 3.0. Although the treatment with acid rain increased the activities of peroxidase, catalase, and plasma membrane H⁺‐ATPase, membrane permeability and malondialdehyde content still increased significantly. However, the addition of exogenous trehalose significantly alleviated the negative effect of acid rain on growth inhibition of barley and increased total leaf chlorophyll due to an increase of chlorophyll a content. Trehalose also increased catalase and peroxidase activity, which led to an increase in the antioxidant capacity and a balance in production and scavenging of free radicals. Plasma membrane H⁺‐ATPase activities of roots and leaves also increased with trehalose and maintained stable pH of the cytoplasm of roots and leaf cells under low pH. The 10 mM trehalose pretreatment was enough to alleviative the negative effects of acid rain in barley.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aacid rain 3aaerobiosis 3aantioxidant activity 3abarley 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acytoplasm 3agrowth retardation 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3amembrane permeability 3apH stability 3aperoxidase 3aplasma membrane 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3atrehalose1 aWang, Ruiming1 aWang, Tengfei0 tCrop science.g2018 Mar., v. 58, no. 2 p.783-791dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2017.08.04913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245014200161300001600303520139000319592002801709650002201737650001701759650001501776650001101791650001101802650001301813650003001826650002101856650001701877650001901894650001301913650002401926650001501950650001801965650001101983650001301994650002202007650001502029650001502044650001602059653002202075653002802097653003202125653002702157653002002184700002002204700001602224700005602240700001302296700001902309700002002328700005702348773012402405856008302529852000902612655001202621IND60684039920221122174605.0201202e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068403992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.02.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Biao10aDecorated nickel phosphide nanoparticles with nitrogen and phosphorus co-doped porous carbon for enhanced electrochemical water splitting  ap. 393-401.  aA novel free-standing electrode consisting of nickel phosphide (Ni₂P) nanoparticles on nitrogen and phosphorus co-doped porous carbon (NPC) are synthesized on carbon cloth (CC). Polyaniline (PANI) and nickel (Ni) are sequentially electro-deposited on the surface of CC, which are then transformed into NPC and Ni₂P by an in-situ carbonization-phosphorization combined process. The electrode surface is distributed with large amounts of uniform macropores, which could expose more active sites and enhance the interfacial exchange with the electrolyte. The Ni₂P@NPC@CC electrode delivers early overpotentials of 92 and 280 mV vs. Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE) at 10 mA cm⁻² for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline condition, respectively. The electrolytic cell with Ni₂P@NPC@CC electrode both as anode and cathode can achieve 10 mA cm⁻² at a small bias of 1.54 V for the overall water splitting. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicates that combination with Ni₂P and NPC can decrease Gibbs free energy for H* adsorption (ΔGH*) and increase charge density on the interface, thus could lead to the enhanced activity for water splitting. The free-standing and noble-metal free Ni₂P@NPC@CC electrode is stable, highly active and cost effective, thus have great potential for the hydrogen production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3aanodes 3acarbon 3acathodes 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aelectroplating 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amacropores 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3anitrogen 3aoxygen production 3aphosphides 3aphosphorus 3apolyaniline 0aElectrodeposition 0aIn situ phosphorization 0aN, P co-doped porous carbon 0aBifunctional electrode 0aDFT calculation1 aDuan, Xiaoguang1 aHan, Weiwei1 aFan, Xiaobin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9615-38661 aLi, Yang1 aZhang, Fengbao1 aZhang, Guoliang1 aPeng, Wenchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1515-82870 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 May 01, v. 567 p.393-401dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.02.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001300191245007500204300001800279506007600297520138800373592002801761506003701789650002101826650001301847650002601860650001501886650001701901650001501918650001401933650002101947650002401968650002301992650001902015700001702034700002102051700002102072700002402093700002202117700002402139773009902163856008602262852000902348655001202357IND60577689620221207081214.0170810e20170808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057768962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b007492doi7 aPMC57404802pmcid7 a284868052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ping10aIsolated Reporter Bacteria in Supramolecular Hydrogel Microwell Arrays  ap. 7799-7809.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe combination of supramolecular hydrogels formed by low molecular weight gelator self-assembly via noncovalent interactions within a scaffold derived from polyethylene glycol (PEG) affords an interesting approach to immobilize fully functional, isolated reporter bacteria in novel microwell arrays. The PEG-based scaffold serves as a stabilizing element and provides physical support for the self-assembly of the C₂-phenyl-derived gelator on the micrometer scale. Supramolecular hydrogel microwell arrays with various shapes and sizes were used to isolate single or small numbers of Escherichia coli TOP10 pTetR-LasR-pLuxR-GFP. In the presence of the autoinducer N-(3-oxododecanoyl) homoserine lactone, the entrapped E. coli in the hydrogel microwell arrays showed an increased GFP expression. The shape and size of microwell arrays did not influence the fluorescence intensity and the projected size of the bacteria markedly, while the population density of seeded bacteria affected the number of bacteria expressing GFP per well. The hydrogel microwell arrays can be further used to investigate quorum sensing, reflecting communication in inter- and intraspecies bacterial communities for biology applications in the field of biosensors. In the future, these self-assembled hydrogel microwell arrays can also be used as a substrate to detect bacteria via secreted autoinducers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiosensors 3afluorescence 3ahomoserine 3ahydrogels 3amolecular weight 3apolyethylene glycol 3apopulation density 3aquorum sensing1 aDou, Xiaoqiu1 aFeng, Chuanliang1 aMüller, Mareike1 aChang, Matthew Wook1 aFrettlöh, Martin1 aSchönherr, Holger,0 tLangmuir.g2017 Aug. 08, v. 33, no. 31 p.7799-7809dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.7b007493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01268naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245005100168300001600219520037000235592002800605653000900633653000900642653002200651653002100673653002100694653002100715700002200736773011600758856008300874852000900957655001200966IND60761202920221118193331.0220509e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076120292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibs.2021.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeifert, Roland10acCMP and cUMP come into the spotlight, finally  ap. 461-463.  acCMP and cUMP have been identified in numerous biological systems and proposed to serve as second messengers.

Insoluble particles and surface deposits can impair engine performance. Jet fuel thermal oxidation test (JFTOT) defines the standard test method for evaluation of the deposit formed through heating fuels in tubes caused by thermal oxidation (<400°C). At a higher temperature, fuel in the heating process decomposes leading to surface deposits by coking. In this work, we propose a method to evaluate the security of fuel flowing in the tube at high temperatures (>500°C). The heat transfer and cracking performances of two hydrocarbon fuels which are laboratory modified aviation kerosene (Fuel 1 (ρ=0.85g/cm³) and Fuel 2 (ρ=0.78g/cm³)) have been investigated in a heat-exchanger under supercritical conditions (T=700–770°C, p=2.5–5.5MPa, m=0.4–1.0g/s). The temperature and flow rate in this work are much higher than those in JFTOT. The safe run time (SRT) is used to evaluate the heat transfer security of each fuel. As the temperature increases or the flow rate decreases or the pressure increases, the SRTs of Fuel 1 and Fuel 2 decrease clearly. In general, the heat transfer security of Fuel 1 is better than that of Fuel 2. Moreover, the volumetric heat sink of Fuel 1 is larger than that of Fuel 2. So, the overall performance of Fuel 1 is more excellent when it is used as propellant and coolant for hypersonic aircraft. In consideration of the heat transfer security, heat sink and the required driving force for aircraft, the temperature of fuel at the exit of heat transfer passage should be set as 740°C, the flow rate of fuel should be 0.6–1.0g/s, the pressure of heat transfer passage should be 3.5MPa. Based on these results, we find that the modification of a high density fuel is an effective way to prepare an advanced hydrocarbon fuel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaircraft 3aaviation 3acracking 3aendothermy 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer 3akerosene 3aoxidation 3atemperature 0aHeat transfer 0aCracking 0aHydrocarbon fuel 0aHeat sink 0aSafe run time (SRT)1 aWu, Jianzhou1 aGong, Yu1 aHou, Jingwei1 aXiong, Liangping1 aXiao, Chengjian1 aFang, Wenjun0 tFuel processing technology.g2016 Aug., v. 149 p.112-120dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04151naa a2201057 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245006100169300001600230520175200246592002801998650000802026650001302034650001502047650001002062650001602072650001002088650002402098650001902122650002002141650001802161650002102179650001802200650001202218650002302230650001902253650001402272650001302286650001402299653000802313653000902321653001002330653001002340653000902350653001002359653001002369653000802379653000802387653000702395653001002402653001102412653001002423653001002433653000902443653000702452653000802459653000802467653000902475653000802484653000802492653000802500653000802508653001102516653000902527653001102536653000902547653001002556653000802566653000802574653000802582653000802590653000702598653000902605653000902614653000802623653000802631653000802639653000902647653001202656653000802668653000902676653001002685653001002695653000902705653001302714653001602727653001802743653003102761653002402792653003702816653003502853700001502888773008502903856008402988852000903072655001203081IND60568012920221121064817.0170628e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056801292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2017.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunn, Jennifer10aEpigenetics and immunotherapy: The current state of play  ap. 227-239.  aCancer cells employ a number of mechanisms to escape immunosurveillance and facilitate tumour progression. The recent explosion of interest in immunotherapy, especially immune checkpoint blockade, is a result of discoveries about the fundamental ligand-receptor interactions that occur between immune and cancer cells within the tumour microenvironment. Distinct ligands expressed by cancer cells engage with cell surface receptors on immune cells, triggering inhibitory pathways (such as PD-1/PD-L1) that render immune cells immunologically tolerant. Importantly, recent studies on the role of epigenetics in immune evasion have exposed a key role for epigenetic modulators in augmenting the tumour microenvironment and restoring immune recognition and immunogenicity. Epigenetic drugs such as DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors can reverse immune suppression via several mechanisms such as enhancing expression of tumour-associated antigens, components of the antigen processing and presenting machinery pathways, immune checkpoint inhibitors, chemokines, and other immune-related genes. These discoveries have established a highly promising basis for studies using combined epigenetic and immunotherapeutic agents as anti-cancer therapies. In this review, we discuss the exciting role of epigenetic immunomodulation in tumour immune escape, emphasising its significance in priming and sensitising the host immune system to immunotherapies through mechanisms such as the activation of the viral defence pathway. With this background in mind, we highlight the promise of combined epigenetic therapy and immunotherapy, focusing on immune checkpoint blockade, to improve outcomes for patients with many different cancer types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aantigens 3achemokines 3adrugs 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3ahistone deacetylase 3aimmune evasion 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3aimmunomodulation 3aimmunotherapy 3aligands 3amethyltransferases 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3areceptors 0aTME 0aPD-1 0aPD-L1 0aPD-L2 0aPTMs 0aDNMTi 0aHDACi 0aTAA 0aAPM 0aNK 0aNKG2D 0aMICA/B 0aULBPs 0aTRAIL 0aFASL 0aDC 0aAPC 0aTFH 0aTreg 0aCTL 0aTCR 0aHLA 0aTAP 0aICAM-1 0aTILs 0aCTLA-4 0aTNBC 0aNSCLC 0aAML 0aCCL 0amAb 0aFDA 0aIg 0aPI3K 0aMDSC 0aCAF 0aCSC 0aHGF 0aCTAs 0aHMW-MAA 0aTh1 0aEZH2 0aH3K27 0aDNMT1 0aERVs 0a5-AZA-dC 0aEpigenetics 0aImmunotherapy 0aImmune checkpoint blockade 0aCombination therapy 0aDNA methyltransferase inhibitors 0aHistone deacetylase inhibitors1 aRao, Sudha0 tMolecular Immunology.g2017 July, v. 87 p.227-239dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2017.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245012800153300001600281520160100297592002801898650002001926650001101946650002001957650001701977650001201994650001002006650001202016650002202028650001902050651001002069651002502079700001702104700001902121700001402140700001702154773011602171856007402287852000902361655001202370IND50073874920221119043504.0150206e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007387492DNAL7 a10.1111/ejss.121122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapa, S.10aMicrobial enzyme activities, fungal biomass and quality of the litter and upper soil layer in a beech forest of south Italy  ap. 274-285.  aForest soils contain a large amount of organic matter (OM) and therefore represent a considerable carbon reserve. The amount of OM sequestered in the soil is dependent on annual input of litter and its quality. The aim of this study was to investigate the quantity and quality of OM, the microbial capacity to degrade it and its recalcitrance to further degradation, by considering some extracellular enzyme activities in a beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest in south Italy (Mediterranean area). Our attention was focused on the decomposition continuum of the litter horizon and upper soil layer. Because fungi are the major decomposers of plant material, fungal biomass was also measured and its relationship with enzyme activities was tested. The results showed that: (i) the litter horizon and the upper soil layer differed in chemical characteristics and biological activities; (ii) within the litter horizon, the three layers detected for their different degree of degradation (L, recently fallen, not decomposed and not compressed material; F, partially decomposed and fragmented but macroscopically recognizable material; H, compressed and strongly fragmented) differed more in chemical characteristics than in biological activities; (iii) the enzyme activities and fungal biomass changed during the study period but a clear relationship with succession of seasons was evident only for cellulase, laccase, peroxidase and fungal biomass; and (iv) the upper soil layer included 42% OM and less than 50% of that was susceptible to further decomposition. This percentage was 30% in the OM of L.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica 3acarbon 3aenzyme activity 3aforest soils 3aforests 3afungi 3alaccase 3amicrobial biomass 3aorganic matter 3aItaly 3aMediterranean region1 aCembrola, E.1 aPellegrino, A.1 aFuggi, A.1 aFioretto, A.0 tEuropean journal of soil science.g2014 Mar., v. 65, no. 2 p.274-285dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1351-07547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ejss.121123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009100175300001600266520112300282592002801405650001201433650001501445650001501460650001501475650001101490650001301501650001901514650001201533651001301545653001701558653002601575653001301601653001601614653001801630653002201648653001701670700001701687773009801704856008501802852000901887655001201896IND60485929320221119111938.0160218e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048592932DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2015.10896122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWayessa, Gutu Olana10aWhose Decisions, Whose Livelihoods? Resettlement and Environmental Justice in Ethiopia  ap. 387-402.  aThis article analyzes recent state-implemented resettlement schemes in Oromia, Ethiopia, by examining the experiences and outcomes of resettlement from the perspective of both the resettlers and hosts. Besides involving transformations in people’s access to resources and the ability to earn their livelihoods, resettlement invites deep-seated questions of governance and justice. Drawing on theoretical approaches of political ecology and environmental justice, we analyze the processes and outcomes of resettlement in terms of four interlinked dimensions, including resource (re)distribution, cultural recognition, political representation, and social recovery. Special attention is paid to the questions of who decides for whom, and who lives the consequences. The analysis is based on a mixed-methods approach, involving a combination of qualitative interviews and a quantitative survey. We conclude that both the resettlers and the hosts experienced uneven redistribution of resources and unfair forms of recognition and political representation, which in tandem limited their possibilities for social recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecology 3agovernance 3ainterviews 3alivelihood 3apeople 3apolitics 3asocial justice 3asurveys 3aEthiopia 0aDisplacement 0aenvironmental justice 0aEthiopia 0alivelihoods 0amixed methods 0apolitical ecology 0aresettlement1 aNygren, Anja0 tSociety & natural resources.g2016 Apr. 2, v. 29, no. 4 p.387-402dRoutledgex1521-07237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2015.10896123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005600140245011600196300001800312500002000330520104500350592002801395596006601423650003501489650001501524650001601539650000901555650000901564650001801573650002301591650001401614650002501628650001601653650002301669650002701692650002101719650001701740650002201757700005901779700001901838700005701857773015301914856007402067852000902141655001202150IND60656000920221120170940.0190808e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065600092DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.141922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJribi, Sarra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9102-478210aEvolution of functional, thermal and pasting properties of sprouted whole durum wheat flour with sprouting time  ap. 2718-2724.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis research investigated the evolution of functional, pasting and thermal properties of durum wheat (Triticum durum) with sprouting time. Particle size, flour and flour gel hydration properties (Water Holding Capacity (WHC), Swelling Volume (SV), Water Absorption Index (WAI), Water Solubility Index (WSI), Swelling Power (SP)), Oil Absorption Capacity (OAC), Pasting and thermal properties were evaluated on different sprouting time: 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 h. Results showed that more than 12 h decreased significantly particle size, WHC(−14.8%), SV (−19%), SP (−14%) and WAI (−36.5%) while WSI (+383%) and OAC (+7.3%) increased. Pasting properties drastically decreased with sprouting time. DSC results showed a significant increase in onset temperature (T₀) (from 55.2 to 58.2 °C), peak temperature (Tₚ) (from 62.4 to 63.8 °C) while conclusion temperature Tc decreased (from 76 to 72.6 °C). Despite these changes, sprouted whole wheat flour could be suggested as an improver of some cereal products’ functionality.  aPublisher supplied data  cTunisian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3aabsorption 3adurum wheat 3agels 3aoils 3aparticle size 3apasting properties 3asprouting 3aswelling (materials) 3atemperature 3athermal properties 3awater holding capacity 3awater solubility 3awater uptake 3awhole wheat flour1 aSahagùn, Marta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7659-03051 aDebbabi, Hajer1 aGomez, Manuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2650-40820 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2019 Sept., v. 54, no. 9 p.2718-2724dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.141923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001800169245014100187300001800328520128900346592002801635650002901663650003001692650001601722650002501738650002601763650001001789650002401799650001301823650002701836650004201863650002901905650002301934650002001957650004201977650003302019650002502052650004102077700001302118700001502131700001702146773009702163856008602260852000902346655001202355IND4447399120221119064742.0141110e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444739912DNAL7 a210360352pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2010.09.1232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Shuangxiu10aImproved biohydrogen production with an expression of codon-optimized hemH and lba genes in the chloroplast of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  ap. 2610-2616.  aAccording to the codon bias in the chloroplast genome of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the codon-optimized coding regions of both the ferrochelatase gene, hemH, from Bradyrhizobium japonicum and the leghemoglobin gene, lba, from Glycine max were synthesized de novo and transferred into the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii. The expression level of hemH-lba protein was improved by 6.8 folds in the codon-optimized transgenic alga compared with the non-optimized one under both normal and anaerobic conditions. H₂ yield was 22% and the respiration rate was 44% higher in the codon-optimized transgenic algal cultures than those of the non-optimized ones, and was 450% and 134% higher than those of the control cultures, respectively. The transcript levels of hydA1 and hydA2 in the hemH-lba transgenic alga were also more stable and higher than those of the control alga. These results demonstrate that codon optimization increased the expression level of hemH-lba protein in the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii and improved algal H₂ yield by enhancing the respiration rate resulting in low O₂ content in the medium and up regulation of the expression of hydA1 and hydA2 in cells, thereby confirming the potential of the utilization of leghemoglobins for H₂ production in green algae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aGlycine max 3aanaerobic conditions 3aaquatic plant culture 3agenes 3ahydrogen production 3aproteins 2aBiofuelsxmicrobiology 2aChlamydomonas reinhardtiixphysiology 2aChloroplastsxphysiology 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCodonxgenetics 2aFerrochelatasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGenetic Enhancementxmethods 2aHydrogenxmetabolism 2aLeghemoglobinxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aXu, Lili1 aHuang, Rui1 aWang, Quanxi0 tBioresource technology.g2011 Feb., v. 102, no. 3 p.2610-2616dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2010.09.1233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245008000177300001800257500002000275500000900295520137500304592002801679650002301707650001001730650002401740650001301764650001601777650002301793651001101816700003801827700002701865700002501892773013201917856008402049852000902133655001202142IND60665574620221122055340.0220805e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066557462DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2016.05.03952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCláudio de Faria, Luis10aGenetic Gain in Common Bean with Black Grain by Indirect Estimation Methods  ap. 1308-1314.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aThe objective of this study was to estimate the genetic gain for yield of black‐grained common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) developed by the Embrapa breeding program of Brazil. Genetic gain estimates were generated from 403 field tests conducted in all regions of Brazil in three growing seasons over 16 yr, from 1993 to 2008. Genetic gains were estimated by two indirect methods and were compared with those found through a direct estimation method. The first methodology used the mixed model approach to calculate the best unbiased linear estimate of cycle means, as fixed effects, and the best unbiased predictor of the genotype effect within cycles, as random effects. The second methodology of generalized least squares considered a model of fixed effects, except for the error. For the direct method, 24 lines consisting of the three highest yielding of each of the eight breeding cycles were evaluated in 21 environments. The estimated percentage of annual genetic gain in grain yield by the direct method over the 16‐yr period (1.23%, P < 0.01) was significant and close to the result of the fixed model analysis (1.20%, P < 0.05) and by the mixed model (1.02%, P = 0.068). These results show that the indirect methods using a fixed model and the mixed model were consistent in determining genetic gain and can be used as an alternative to the direct method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3abeans 3agenetic improvement 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3astatistical models 3aBrazil1 aSantos Melo, Patrícia Guimarães1 aPereira, Helton Santos1 aMelo, Leonardo Cunha0 tCrop science.g2017 May, v. 57, no. 3 p.1308-1314dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2016.05.03953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04423naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245008800173300001600261520237600277592002802653650003402681650002302715650002102738650002102759650002502780650001802805650001302823650001702836650003802853650001602891650002802907650001402935650004302949650001802992650001603010650001803026650001003044650000903054650001803063650001803081650002403099650002503123650003203148650002603180651002003206653003803226653002303264653003403287653003903321653003003360653003203390700001903422700002203441700002403463700002003487700002203507700001903529773012303548856008103671852000903752655001203761IND60604637820221122061302.0180717e20151204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060463782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2015.09.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiraravesit, Narisara10aArtocarpus altilis heartwood extract protects skin against UVB in vitro and in vivo  ap. 153-162.  aArtocarpus altilis (Moreceae) has been widely used as a traditional folk medicine in Southeast Asia for the treatment of many diseases, including skin disorders, such as ulcers and dermatitis.The present study aimed to investigate the ability of an artocarpin-enriched extract to prevent ultraviolet radiation B-induced photodamage.The content of artocarpin in the extract was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A DPPH assay was used to evaluate the free radical scavenging activity of the extract, which was compared with those of l-ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol. Cytotoxicity and proliferation of cells treated with the extract were determined using XTT and BrdU assays, respectively. Human skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes were pretreated with the extract for 24h and later irradiated with ultraviolet radiation B at 128J/cm². The levels of TNF-α and IL-6 released from ultraviolet radiation B-irradiated keratinocytes and, MMP-1 and type-I procollagen produced by ultraviolet radiation B-irradiated fibroblasts were measured by ELISA and/or western blotting. The hairless skin of male mice (outbred ICR) was treated with the extract or l-ascorbic acid solution prior to exposure to ultraviolet radiation B irradiation. The dose of ultraviolet B irradiation was consecutively increased to 18, 36, 54, and 72J/cm² at weeks 1–4, 4–7, 7–10, and 10–12, respectively. The epidermal thickness and collagen content in the skin of ultraviolet radiation B-irradiated mice were evaluated.The extract concentration of 50µg/mL was not toxic and did not inhibit the proliferation of fibroblasts. The pretreatment of fibroblasts with 50µg/mL extract prior to ultraviolet radiation B irradiation attenuated MMP-1 production but did not affect type-I procollagen production. The extract also decreased the ultraviolet radiation B-induced production of TNF-α and IL-6 in keratinocytes. Moreover, the topical administration of the extract suppressed epidermal thickening and collagen loss in chronically ultraviolet radiation B-exposed skin in mice.The experimental study revealed that A. altilis extract suppresses structural alterations in skin damaged by ultraviolet radiation B irradiation. This suppression was, at least partially, mediated by decrease in MMP-1 production in fibroblasts and TNF-α and IL-6 productions in keratinocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aArtocarpus altilis 3aWestern blotting 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3acollagen 3acytotoxicity 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afibroblasts 3afree radical scavengers 3aheartwood 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainterleukin-6 3airradiation 3akeratinocytes 3amales 3amice 3askin (animal) 3askin diseases 3atopical application 3atraditional medicine 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aultraviolet radiation 3aSouth East Asia 0aArtocarpin (PubChem CID: 5458461) 0aArtocarpus altilis 0aUltraviolet radiation B (UVB) 0aMatrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) 0aPro-inflammatory cytokine 0aArtocarpin-enriched extract1 aYakaew, Swanya1 aRukchay, Racharat1 aLuangbudnark, Witoo1 aViennet, Celine1 aHumbert, Philippe1 aViyoch, Jarupa0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2015 Dec. 04, v. 175 p.153-162dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2015.09.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle08733naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100002300140245007600163300001600239500000900255500001500264520728200279592002807561650001307589650002407602650001607626650001807642650002007660650002007680650002307700650002107723650001907744650001707763650001107780650001807791650001807809651001307827653002207840653002107862700002107883700002007904700001707924773020107941852000908142856007708151990002308228655001208251IND2049190520221118181641.0191122e199504  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204919052DNAL7 a10.2134/jpa1995.02762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristenson, D. R.10aNet Returns from 12 Cropping Systems Containing Sugarbeet and Navy Bean  ap. 276-281.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aConsiderable research has been conducted evaluating yield relationships among crops in various rotations and cropping systems. To compare cropping systems of different lengths of rotation and with different crops, however, a common measurement is needed. This paper evaluates annual net return to land and unallocated resources (ANR) from various cropping systems containing sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.), navy bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), corn (Zea mays L.), oat (Avena sativa L.), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Gross returns using representative crop prices are calculated for each cropping system for yield data from a 15-yr cropping systems study conducted on a Misteguay silty clay soil in the Saginaw Valley of Michigan. Costs in 1991 dollars of agricultural inputs, machinery ownership, repairs, maintenance, fuel, and wages are used to calculate expenses. ANR is calculated by subtracting pre- and postharvest operating costs plus machinery ownership costs from gross income for two farm sizes and two sugarbeet prices. With sugarbeet priced at $36/ton, systems with the greatest proportion of sugarbeet and also including navy bean have the highest ANR. The relative ranking of a cropping system's ANR did not change appreciably when farm size increased from 600 to 1000 acres. A sensitivity analysis shows that sugarbeet priced at or below $18/ton caused the relative ranking of the systems to shift and navy bean to become a more dominant factor in the ANR of these systems. While short rotations for sugarbeet and navy bean production may result in lower crop yields, the high economic return of these crops is probably the major reason growers do not employ longer rotations. Research QuestionTo compare several cropping systems containing different crops grown in rotations of different lengths requires development of a common measurement for all systems. In this study a common measurement “annual net return to land and unallocated resources” (ANR) is developed by subtracting costs for preharvest inputs, machinery ownership, labor and postharvest inputs from gross income. ANR is then used to compare cropping systems using yield data from a long-term experiment. Literature SummaryCropping systems play an important role in maintaining yield, biological and economic stability of agricultural production due in part to the interruption of the life cycles of disease and other pests. In addition, diverse rotations distribute machinery and labor requirements over a greater portion of the season as well as lessening risks associated with fluctuations of yields and prices. Long-term studies evaluating rotations or cropping systems are necessary to study the effects of crop yields. Integration of economic parameters makes it possible to compare the economic value of dissimilar cropping systems. Study DescriptionThis 15-yr study was conducted in the Saginaw Valley of Michigan on a lake bed soil. Each crop was grown each year. General recommendations for fertilizers and pesticides were followed. A machinery selection model was used to select machinery complements to accomplish field operations common to the cropping methods used in the Saginaw Valley. This includes fall moldboard plowing, spring secondary tillage, growing crops in 30-in. rows and two cultivations. Annual costs were then calculated for machinery ownership. Yield data from the 15-yr study were used in this analysis. The 12 cropping systems are listed below: 2-yr3-yr4-yrCorn-beetCorn-corn-beetCorn-corn-corn-beetCorn-beanCorn-bean-beetCorn-corn-bean-beetBean-beetBean-bean-beetCorn-bean-bean-beetOat-beanOat-bean-beetOat-alfalfa-bean-beetwhere: beet = sugarbeet and bean = navy bean. Applied QuestionWhat is the effect of cropping system on yield? Yield of navy bean is generally better in 4-yr rotations than in shorter rotations (Table 1). Sugarbeet yielded more following navy bean than following corn. When corn follows corn in a rotation, yield is reduced by 11.9% compared with following navy bean or sugarbeet. What is the effect of cropping systems on net return to land and unallocated resources? For a 600-acre farm and a sugarbeet price of $36/ton, ANR ranges from $392/acre for navy bean-sugarbeet to $127/acre for oat-navy bean (Table 2). Systems containing sugarbeet had higher ANR than those that did not. The average ANR for 2-yr systems containing sugarbeet is $355; for 3-yr systems, $278; and- for 4-yr systems, $173/acre. What happens to relative ranking of ANR for the systems when farm size is increased from 600 to 1000 acres? When farm size is increased for 600 to 1000 acres, the relative ranking of the cropping systems does not change appreciably. ANR increases an average of $16/acre for all systems. ANR for corn-sugarbeet systems increased the least ($5/acre) due to greater machinery costs. The oat-navy bean-sugarbeet system increased the most ($32/acre), since machinery costs did not increase as much as for corn intensive systems. What happens to the relative ranking of cropping systems if sugarbeet prices decline? Since the gross return for sugarbeet is greater than for the other crops, we conducted an analysis to measure the effect of lower sugar prices on the ranking of these systems. There is no change in the ranking of the cropping systems until the sugarbeet price falls to $18/acre. Below this price, navy bean becomes a more dominant factor in the economic return from these systems. Table 1Average yield of crops grown in the Saginaw Valley cropping systems study.

Overall, 1,440 male broiler chickens (1-d-old), Ross 308, were randomly distributed into 6 treatment groups: T1 (1–42 d SS); T2 (1–42 d SY); T3 (1–14 d SS/15–42 d SY); T4 (1–21 d SS/22–42 d SY); T5 (1–28 d SS/29–42 d SY); and T6 (1–35 d SS/36–42 d SY) with 8 replicates each. The performance was evaluated at 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 d. At 42 d, 2 animals per replicate were slaughtered to remove the breast meat and livers. The Se deposition in tissues and the physicochemical characteristics of the broiler meat were measured. The results were analyzed with ANOVA, and an SNK test was applied, when necessary. There were no significant differences in the performance, liver Se deposition, drip loss, pH, shear force, and objective color. Broilers that received SY in the last week before slaughter had meat with lower levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and the cooking loss was similar to that of broilers fed SY for 42 d. The higher Se deposition in broiler breast was observed for SY throughout 1–42 d, followed by 29–42 and 36–42 d. The treatments using SY for any ages provided higher Se deposition compared to SS throughout 1–42 d. These results showed that is not necessary to supplement SY in broiler chickens for 42 d.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3abreast meat 3abroiler chickens 3achicken meat 3acolor 3acooking quality 3adrip loss 3agrowth performance 3aliver 3amales 3apH 3aselenium 3aslaughter 3asodium selenite 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3atissues 3ayeasts 0ameat quality 0apoultry 0aorganic mineral1 aBertechini, Antônio G.1 aNogueira, Bernardo R.F.1 aRibeiro, Heloísa V.1 aMencalha, Raquel1 aRamos, Eduardo M.0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2019 Dec., v. 28, no. 4 p.1021-1027dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/japr/pfz0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01591naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245012700170300001800297520046400315592002800779650001300807650002400820650000900844650001000853650001700863650001900880650001900899650001700918650001700935700001600952700001900968700001800987773014101005856007401146852000901220655001201229IND60671083320221118190922.0191002e20150407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067108332DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta01240f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJagadeeswararao, Metikoti10aVisible light-induced hydrogen generation using colloidal (ZnS)₀.₄(AgInS₂)₀.₆ nanocrystals capped by S²⁻ ions  ap. 8276-8279.  a(ZnS)₀.₄(AgInS₂)₀.₆ nanocrystals (NCs) capped by S²⁻ ions exhibit interesting electronic properties, absorbing visible light along with a suitable band alignment as well as properties such as high surface area providing active reaction sites for photocatalytic H₂ evolution.

However, how global changes in NB-LRR transcript levels coordinate with changes in miRNA and phasiRNA levels in defense responses remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated changes in the relative abundance of small RNAs (sRNAs), with a focus on miRNAs and phasiRNAs and their potential targets in response to the pathogen Phytophthora sojae in the susceptible soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] ‘Williams’ and nine resistant near-isogenic lines (NILs), each carrying a unique resistance to P. sojae (Rps) gene. In total, 369 distinct miRNAs, including 78 new ones, were identified in the 10 soybean lines. The majority of miRNAs were downregulated by the pathogen. Of the 525 NB-LRR genes found in the soybean reference genome, 257 were predicted to be the targets of eight abundant miRNA families and 126 (dubbed phasi-NB-LRRs or pNLs) were predicted to have produced phasiRNAs. Upregulation of 15 phasi-NB-LRRs was associated with downregulation of their corresponding phasiRNAs in the NILs; these phasiRNAs were predicted to regulate 75 additional NB-LRRs in trans. In addition, we identified putative 24-nucleotide (nt) phasiRNAs from transposons, possibly representing a novel general epigenetic mechanism for regulation of transposon activity under biotic stresses. Together, these observations suggest that miRNAs and phasiRNAs play an important role in response to plant pathogens through complex, multiple layers of post-transcriptional regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aPhytophthora sojae 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3amicroRNA 3aplant pathogens 3asoybeans 3atransposons1 aCai, Chunmei1 aZhai, Jixian1 aLin, Feng1 aLi, Linghong1 aShreve, Jacob1 aThimmapuram, Jyothi1 aHughes, Teresa J.1 aMeyers, Blake C.1 aMa, Jianxin0 tThe plant genome.g2015 Mar., v. 8, no. 1dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4288766x1940-33727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3835/plantgenome2014.09.00443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01192naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011700171300001400288520016900302592002800471650001000499650001400509650001600523653001000539653001700549653003400566653001600600653001100616700001600627773013000643856008400773852000900857655001200866IND60122539420221119163956.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012253942DNAL7 a10.1080/01647954.2013.8702262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUluçay, İsmail12aA new species of Neophyllobius and description of male of Neophyllobius yunusi (Acari: Camerobiidae) from Turkey  ap. 15-22.  aIn this study a new species of Neophyllobius quercus sp. nov. , and the male of Neophyllobius yunusi Akyol and Koç, 2006 from Turkey are described and illustrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcari 3aacarology 3anew species 0aAcari 0aCamerobiidae 0aNeophyllobius quercussp. nov. 0anew species 0aTurkey1 aKoç, Kamil0 tInternational journal of acarology.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 40, no. 1 p.15-22dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000089x1945-38927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01647954.2013.8702263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03639naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245010000175506011700275506007600392520188800468592002802356506003702384650001402421650001102435650001602446650001502462650001502477650003402492650000902526650001102535650001302546651002102559653001302580653003002593653001002623653001802633653004402651653003602695700001502731700001602746700002302762700002102785700002202806700002202828700002102850700002202871773011902893856008803012852000903100655001203109IND60756425520221207084404.0220714e20220301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075642552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1512192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpadaro, David A.10aProbabilistic risk assessment of mine-derived copper in the Ok Tedi/Fly River, Papua New Guinea  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Ok Tedi mine discharges waste rock and tailings into the Ok Tedi River in Papua New Guinea. This has resulted in elevated copper concentrations throughout the Ok Tedi/Fly River system, which can potentially impact aquatic biota. Ten years of measured copper and toxicity monitoring data were used to assess the risk of chronic effects from the mine-derived copper. Cumulative probability plots of dissolved and labile copper were compared to a species sensitivity distribution (SSD) of published copper toxicity data for four regions of the river. The Cu-SSD was used to estimate the risk of chronic effects to aquatic organisms in the Ok Tedi/Fly River at a range of potential copper exposure scenarios. The risk to species at the median labile copper concentration for each region showed a gradient effect with distance downstream from the mine and only the most sensitive (0.2–11%) species were at risk. There were copper exceedances of the region-specific guideline values (GV) and default guideline value (DGV) 88% and 74% of the time, respectively, in the Ok Tedi region (closest to the mine) and this is considered a high risk of chronic effects. Measured copper concentrations in the middle Fly River, lower Fly River (farthest downstream of the mine) and the river at Kiunga (reference site) exceeded the region-specific GVs and DGVs less frequently to rarely and present a lower risk of chronic effects from copper. The risk was supported using toxicity tests with the local microalgal species Chlorella sp. Comparison of recent (2010−2020) and historical (1996–2004) copper monitoring data from the Ok Tedi/Fly River indicates a decrease in the labile copper concentrations (30–76%) at key sites from impacted regions and a subsequent decrease in risk. This coincides with improved mining practices aimed at reducing the copper load into the Ok Tedi/Fly River.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChlorella 3acopper 3aenvironment 3aguidelines 3amicroalgae 3aprobabilistic risk assessment 3arisk 3arivers 3atoxicity 3aPapua New Guinea 0aToxicity 0aLabile/bioavailable metal 0aAlgae 0aWater quality 0aCopper species sensitivity distribution 0aRegion-specific guideline value1 aKing, Josh1 aAngel, Brad1 aMcKnight, Kitty S.1 aAdams, Merrin S.1 aBinet, Monique T.1 aGadd, Jennifer B.1 aHickey, Chris W.1 aStauber, Jenny L.0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 810 p.151219-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1512193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012700157300002000284520159100304592002801895650001201923650001101935650002801946650002101974650001301995650000902008650002202017650001202039650002102051650001302072650001202085650001202097650001402109700002002123700001802143700001602161700001802177700001602195700002002211700001802231773014302249856007402392852000902466655001202475IND60671083520221118190902.0191002e20150512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067108352DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta01251a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Mingxia12aA hybrid Si@FeSiy/SiOₓ anode structure for high performance lithium-ion batteries via ammonia-assisted one-pot synthesis  ap. 10767-10776.  aSynthesised via planetary ball-milling of Si and Fe powders in an ammonia (NH₃) environment, a hybrid Si@FeSiy/SiOₓ structure shows exceptional electrochemical properties for lithium-ion battery anodes, exhibiting a high initial capacity of 1150 mA h g⁻¹ and a retention capacity of 880 mA h g⁻¹ after 150 cycles at 100 mA g⁻¹; and a capacity of 560 mA h g⁻¹ at 4000 mA g⁻¹. These are considerably high for carbon-free micro-/submicro-Si-based anodes. NH₃ gradually turns into N₂ and H₂ during the synthesis, which facilitates the formation of highly conductive FeSiy (y = 1, 2) phases, whereas such phases were not formed in an Ar atmosphere. Milling for 20–40 h leads to partial decomposition of NH₃ in the atmosphere, and a hybrid structure of a Si core of mixed nanocrystalline and amorphous Si domains, shelled by a relatively thick SiOₓ layer with embedded FeSi nanocrystallites. Milling for 60–100 h results in full decomposition of NH₃ and a hybrid structure of a much-refined Si-rich core surrounded by a mantle of a relatively low level of SiOₓ and a higher level of FeSi₂. The formation mechanisms of the SiOₓ and FeSiy phases are explored. The latter structure offers an optimum combination of the high capacity of a nanostructural Si core, relatively high electric conductivity of the FeSiy phase and high structural stability of a SiOₓ shell accommodating the volume change for high performance electrodes. The synthesis method is new and indispensable for the large-scale production of high-performance Si-based anode materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aanodes 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrogen 3airon 3alithium batteries 3amilling 3ananocrystallites 3anitrogen 3apowders 3asilicon 3asynthesis1 aWang, Dingsheng1 aZhang, Xuqing1 aPan, Hongge1 aLiu, Yongfeng1 aLiang, Zhu,1 aShang, Congxiao1 aGuo, Z.

B73 and Mo17 typically make 20 and 17 leaves, 14 and 11 of which are below the ear. Total number of leaves and the number of leaves below the uppermost ear are ∼80% heritable in the IBMRILs, which show strongly transgressive phenotypic ranges of 15 to 24 and 10 to 18 leaves for these traits. B73 alleles at loci in chromosome bins 1.06, 3.06, 4.08, 8.04, 8.05, 9.07, and 10.04 increase leaf numbers, with all but the 3.06 QTL affecting both of these highly correlated traits (r = 0.86, p < 0.0001). Conservative QTL confidence intervals were computed and projected onto the draft maize genome sequence, revealing very narrow localizations (∼1 Mb) for four of the seven loci. More than 40% of the heritable variation for both traits is explained by an additive model, squarely accounting for the dramatic parental differences, but leaving the basis of the strong transgression unexplained. In addition, error rate control and confidence interval methods tailored for composite interval mapping are introduced, and their potential for improving QTL reporting is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aalleles 3achromosome mapping 3aconfidence interval 3acorn 3aflowering 3agenomics 3ainbred lines 3aleaves 3aloci 3amodels 3anucleotide sequences 3aphenotype 3aquantitative trait loci1 aMoscou, Matthew J.1 aHabiger, Josh1 aMoose, Stephen P.0 tThe plant genome.g2008 Nov., v. 1, no. 2 p.99-110dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4288766x1940-33727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3835/plantgenome2008.06.03853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011200169300001400281500001500295520147700310592002801787650001201815650001301827650001901840650001101859650001401870650000901884650001501893650001101908650001401919653002401933653002301957653002001980653001902000653001402019653001702033653002202050700002502072700002302097773011002120856008402230852000902314655001202323IND60122539520221119163948.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012253952DNAL7 a10.1080/01647954.2013.8721852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeniczak, Anna10aExternal morphology of Oppiidae (Acari: Oribatida) in the light of the ontogeny of three species and genera  ap. 52-80.  a2019-12-04  aExternal morphology of juveniles and ontogeny of Oppia denticulata (R. & G. Canestrini, 1882), Multioppia laniseta Moritz, 1966 and Oppiella uliginosa (Willmann, 1919) are described and illustrated for the first time. The juveniles of these species are unpigmented and have a soft body, with smooth integument that is covered with microtuberculate cerotegument; they also have a similar number of setae on the prodorsum, gastronotum and in the anal, anogenital and epimeral regions. They differ mainly by the length of seta c ₂ in all juveniles, length of setae in and ex in the larva and seta le in the nymphs, and leg setation. The juveniles of Op . uliginosa have coupled seta d at some leg solenidia (σ on leg I, σ and φ on legs II and III, and φ on leg IV), whereas those of other species and the adults of all species lack this seta. The juveniles of O . denticulata and M . laniseta have sunken famulus ε on tarsus I, whereas those of Op . uliginosa and the adults of all species have it emergent. All instars of these species have setal pair p on tarsus I, and lack this pair of setae on leg tarsi II–IV. The adult Op . uliginosa has seta c ₂ on the notogaster, whereas other species lack it, but O . denticulata has an alveolus of this seta. The adult of M . laniseta has all setae of d -series, whereas those of other species lack them. Morphological characters of Oppia C.L.

For the macroscopic survey, muscular samples (diaphragm, abdominal and intercostals muscles, cutaneous muscles and muscles of the thigh) from 769 slaughtered Sarda sheep, oesophagus (n=365) and laryngeal and pterygoid muscles (n=521) were macroscopically investigated and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) on selected macroscopic cysts was performed for a molecular identification of macroscopic Sarcocystis species. For the microscopic investigation 112 heart samples from slaughtered Sarda sheep were collected and investigated with two different protocols: unstained (compression) examination and a molecular technique. The overall prevalence of infection for macroscopic forms of sarcocysts was of 23.3% (179/769) with prevalences higher in the oesophagus (31.6%; 125/395) compared with the other investigated tissue type; two different morphotypes, classified as large oval (LO) macroscopic cysts, identified as Sarcocystis gigantea, and slender fusiform (SF) sarcocysts, were identified. The examination of heart samples revealed an overall prevalence of 77.7% (87/112) for Sarcocystis spp.; the nested-PCR analysis of heart samples allowed to identify the microscopic species, Sarcocystis tenella and Sarcocystis arieticanis, with prevalences of 95.5% (107/112) and 17.8% (5/112) respectively. Reported results highlight the high prevalence of Sarcocystis infection in the island and suggests the need of an improvement of control and prevention strategies for this parasitosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSarcocystis tenella 3aSardinian (sheep breed) 3adiaphragm 3aepidemiological studies 3aesophagus 3aheart 3alarynx 3amorphs 3aparasitoses 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprotocols 3asarcocysts 3asheep 3aslaughterhouses 3aItaly 3aSardinia 0aSarcocystis gigantea 0aSarcocystis tenella 0aSarcocystis arieticanis 0aSarcocystis medusiformis 0aPCR 0aSardinia1 aVarcasia, Antonio1 aZidda, Antonella1 aDessì, Giorgia1 aPanzalis, Romina1 aTamponi, Claudia1 aMarrosu, Raffaele1 aTosciri, Gabriele1 aSanna, Giuliana1 aDore, Francesco1 aChiesa, Francesco1 aScala, Antonio0 tVeterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports.g2016 June, v. 3-4 p.13-17dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23280x2405-93907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2016.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02137naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245019300158300001600351520088100367520020301248592002801451653001201479653002101491653002201512653002401534700001801558700002101576773015201597856007701749852000901826655001201835IND60563075220221120225727.0170211e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056307522DNAL7 a10.5560/znb.2013-30572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Yun10aCoordination of N-Heterocyclic Carbene to H2SiX2 (X = Cl, OTf) and H3SiOTf (OTf = OSO2CF3): Synthesis of Donor-stabilized Parent Silylium Salts with Four- and Five-coordinate Silicon Atoms  ap. 445-452.  aThe reactivity of the N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2- ylidene towards dichlorosilane H₂SiCl₂, bis(trifluoromethanesulfonato)silane H₂Si(OTf)₂ (OTf = OSO₂CF₃), and silyl trifluoromethanesulfonate H₃SiOTf has been investigated.

It was divided into two experiments. In Experiment I Artemia and Atlantic ditch shrimp (Palaemonetes varians) larvae were used as live diets, whilst in Experiment II frozen mysids Mesopodopsis slabberi and frozen P. varians were used. At the end of the first experiment juvenile pipefish grew significantly more when fed P. varians (P < 0.05) with an overall Weight Gain (WG) of 914.8 ± 79.3% bw day⁻¹, compared to Artemia fed fish (WG = 683.2 ± 14.7%). Both mean Specific Growth Rate (SGR) and survival were similar between dietary treatments and did not vary significantly (P > 0.05). In Experiment II juveniles were weaned with frozen diets but no significant differences were found between the two tested diets in all parameters tested. Final WG was 516.5 ± 63.3% and 566 ± 17.6%, and Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) was 30 ± 1.5% and 28.2 ± 1.2% for animals fed P. varians and M. slabberi respectively. Results indicate that P. varians is an adequate diet to use during initial stages of the S. typhle life cycle and should be considered as a frozen diet for subsequent life stages of this species as an alternative to currently known natural diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemia 3aPalaemonetes 3aSyngnathus typhle 3adiet 3afeed conversion 3afish 3agrowth performance 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3ashrimp 3aspecific growth rate 3aweight gain1 aPalma, Jorge1 aAndrade, José Pedro0 tAquaculture research.g2016 May, v. 47, no. 5 p.1652-1660dBlackwell Sciencex1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.126353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245016300159300001800322520166000340592002802000650002702028650002602055650001602081650002302097650002002120650002402140650002402164650001102188650001902199650000902218650003002227650002502257650002802282650003502310650002802345700001602373700001802389700001402407700001202421700002202433700001402455773012002469856008102589852000902670655001202679IND60520746620221119070406.0160522e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052074662DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-016-1192-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Xia10aHigh-resolution genetic linkage mapping, high-temperature tolerance and growth-related quantitative trait locus (QTL) identification in Marsupenaeus japonicus  ap. 1391-1405.  aThe Kuruma prawn, Marsupenaeus japonicus, is one of the most promising marine invertebrates in the industry in Asia, Europe and Australia. However, the increasing global temperatures result in considerable economic losses in M. japonicus farming. In the present study, to select genetically improved animals for the sustainable development of the Kuruma prawn industry, a high-resolution genetic linkage map and quantitative trait locus (QTL) identification were performed using the RAD technology. The maternal map contained 5849 SNP markers and spanned 3127.23 cM, with an average marker interval of 0.535 cM. Instead, the paternal map contained 3927 SNP markers and spanned 3326.19 cM, with an average marker interval of 0.847 cM. The consensus map contained 9289 SNP markers and spanned 3610.90 cM, with an average marker interval of 0.388 cM and coverage of 99.06 % of the genome. The markers were grouped into 41 linkage groups in the maps. Significantly, negative correlation was detected between high-temperature tolerance (UTT) and body weight (BW). The QTL mapping revealed 129 significant QTL loci for UTT and four significant QTL loci for BW at the genome-wide significance threshold. Among these QTLs, 129 overlapped with linked SNPs, and the remaining four were located in regions between contiguous SNPs. They explained the total phenotypic variance ranging from 8.9 to 12.4 %. Because of a significantly negative correlation between growth and high-temperature tolerance, we demonstrate that this high-resolution linkage map and QTLs would be useful for further marker-assisted selection in the genetic improvement of M. japonicus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarsupenaeus japonicus 3aaquatic invertebrates 3abody weight 3achromosome mapping 3afarming systems 3afinancial economics 3agenetic improvement 3agenome 3alinkage groups 3aloci 3amarker-assisted selection 3aphenotypic variation 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asustainable development1 aLuan, Sheng1 aHu, Long Yang1 aMao, Yong1 aTao, Ye1 aZhong, Sheng Ping1 aKong, Jie0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2016 June, v. 291, no. 3 p.1391-1405dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-016-1192-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02036naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010200165300002000267520070800287536010900995592002801104596007601132650001001208650001401218650002401232650001401256653001701270653003701287653002301324653002301347700001801370700001501388700002101403773014401424856008501568852000901653655001201662IND60595382220221116231712.0180602e20171231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059538222DNAL7 a10.1080/10942912.2017.13818482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Si-Yu10aExtensive and objective wine color classification with chromatic database and mathematical models  ap.

Similar mathematical models were also built for 79 Chinese Cabernet Sauvignon dry red wines from different regions and vintages, which could be set as chromatic reference for other Chinese Cabernet Sauvignon dry red wines. The reliability of these models and relationships between different chromatic parameters were further validated by statistical tools.

The highest generic diversity occurs in the Neotropics, with a correspondingly high species diversity, while the Palaearctic has the lowest generic diversity, but a high species diversity. Such distribution patterns may relate to how long evolutionary processes have been carrying on in isolation in a bioregion. Over an extended period, there may be extinction of species, but evolution of more genera. Dramatic extinction events such as the K-T mass extinction have affected current mayfly diversity and distribution. Climatic history plays an important role in the rate of speciation in an area, with regions which have been climatically stable over long periods having fewer species per genus, when compared to regions subjected to climatic stresses, such as glaciation. A total of 13 families are endemic to specific bioregions, with eight among them being monospecific. Most of these have restricted distributions which may be the result of them being the relict of a previously more diverse, but presently almost completely extinct family, or may be the consequence of vicariance events, resulting from evolution due to long-term isolation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEphemeroptera 3aextinction 3afauna 3afreshwater 3aglaciation 3aspecies diversity 3atropics1 aGattolliat, Jean-Luc1 aSartori, Michel1 aHubbard, Michael D.0 tHydrobiologia.g2008 Jan., v. 595, no. 1 p.339-350dSpringer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9028-y3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02016naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010200166300001800268520103500286592002801321650002001349650001001369650002101379650001901400650001201419650001101431650001601442650001401458700002301472773010501495856008101600852000901681655001201690IND60119713920221119015618.0150412e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011971392DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-014-8710-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThieme, Katrin10aNucleation and growth kinetics and phase analysis in zirconia-containing lithium disilicate glass  ap. 1488-1499.  aStoichiometric lithium disilicate glass was doped with up to 5 mol% ZrO₂. The zirconia addition leads to higher viscosities and additionally to a change in the crystallization behavior. The glass transition temperatures and the onset of crystallization are shifted to higher temperatures. While in the undoped sample and the glass containing 1 mol% ZrO₂, lithium disilicate is the sole crystal phase, in the glasses with higher zirconia concentrations, lithium metasilicate, quartz, and ZrO₂precipitate. Furthermore, with increasing zirconia concentration, the volume nucleation rates are remarkably decreased and the induction times of nucleation are increased. For zirconia concentrations >2 mol%, volume nucleation was not observed even after long heat treatment times; instead, surface crystallization solely occurred. This cannot be explained only by the higher viscosities of the ZrO₂-containing glass. Hence, zirconia acts as nucleation inhibitor for volume nucleation in stoichiometric lithium disilicate glass.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3aglass 3aglass transition 3aheat treatment 3alithium 3aquartz 3atemperature 3aviscosity1 aRüssel, Christian0 tJournal of materials science.g2015 Feb., v. 50, no. 3 p.1488-1499dSpringer-Verlagx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-014-8710-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009700168300001800265520133900283592002801622650001301650650002501663650001101688650002701699650001301726650001401739650002101753650001601774700001901790700002301809700002001832773012001852856008101972852000902053655001202062IND60520746820221119070259.0160522e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052074682DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-016-1194-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuchetti, Andrea10aRUDI, a short interspersed element of the V-SINE superfamily widespread in molluscan genomes  ap. 1419-1429.  aShort interspersed elements (SINEs) are non-autonomous retrotransposons that are widespread in eukaryotic genomes. They exhibit a chimeric sequence structure consisting of a small RNA-related head, an anonymous body and an AT-rich tail. Although their turnover and de novo emergence is rapid, some SINE elements found in distantly related species retain similarity in certain core segments (or highly conserved domains, HCD). We have characterized a new SINE element named RUDI in the bivalve molluscs Ruditapes decussatus and R. philippinarum and found this element to be widely distributed in the genomes of a number of mollusc species. An unexpected structural feature of RUDI is the HCD domain type V, which was first found in non-amniote vertebrate SINEs and in the SINE from one cnidarian species. In addition to the V domain, the overall sequence conservation pattern of RUDI elements resembles that found in ancient AmnSINE (~310 Myr old) and Au SINE (~320 Myr old) families, suggesting that RUDI might be among the most ancient SINE families. Sequence conservation suggests a monophyletic origin of RUDI. Nucleotide variability and phylogenetic analyses suggest long-term vertical inheritance combined with at least one horizontal transfer event as the most parsimonious explanation for the observed taxonomic distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCnidaria 3aRuditapes decussatus 3agenome 3agermplasm conservation 3amolluscs 3amonophyly 3aretrotransposons 3avertebrates1 aŠatović, Eva1 aMantovani, Barbara1 aPlohl, Miroslav0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2016 June, v. 291, no. 3 p.1419-1429dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-016-1194-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02094naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245014300168300001800311520083900329592002801168650002701196650002601223650002901249650001601278650001901294650001401313650001701327650001101344650002901355700001901384700002001403700001201423700001401435700001601449773011701465856008201582990002301664852000901687655001201696IND60091122720221122052656.0141103e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009112272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.09.1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Chang-Ji10aSynthesis and biological evaluation of 5-aryloxypyrazole derivatives bearing a rhodanine-3-aromatic acid as potential antimicrobial agents  ap. 7024-7028.  aThree novel series of 5-aryloxypyrazole derivatives have been synthesized and tested for their antibacterial activity. The majority of the synthesized compounds showed potent inhibitory activity against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus 4220, especially against the strains of multidrug-resistant clinical isolates (MRSA3167/3506 and QRSA3505/3519). Among which compounds IIIb, IIIg and IIIm showed the most potent levels of activity (MIC=1μg/mL) against the multidrug-resistant strains. And cytotoxic activity assay showed that the compounds tested did not affect cell viability on the Human cervical (HeLa) cells at their MICs. The current study therefore suggests that 5-aryloxypyrazoles bearing a rhodanine-3-aromatic acid moiety are promising scaffolds for the development of novel Gram-positive antibacterial agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3acell viability 3achemistry 3acytotoxicity 3ahumans 3amultiple drug resistance1 aSong, Ming-Xia1 aSun, Liang-Peng1 aWu, Yan1 aHong, Lan1 aPiao, Hu-Ri0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 22, no. 23 p.7024-7028dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.09.1073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01335naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245006000170300001400230500001500244520038700259592002800646650001500674650001000689650002200699650001000721650001300731650001700744651001500761653002300776700001600799773009200815852000900907856008100916655001200997IND4399869320221119063103.0160903e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439986932DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-007-9004-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSundberg, P.q(Per),10aGlobal diversity of nemerteans (Nemertea) in freshwater  ap. 61-66.  a2019-12-05  aMost ribborn worms (phylum Nemertea) are marine and only 22 of the currently named around 1,200 species are known from freshwater habitats (mainly lakes/ponds).

Our study focuses on the cardioprotection of SMY against doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiac toxicity in vivo. METHODS: Rats were injected with DOX (2.5 mg/kg) in six injections over a 2-week period. SMY was administrated intragastrically at the dose of 8.35, 16.7 and 33.4 g/kg, or 16.7 g/kg only twice a day concurrently with DOX for the 2-weeks. A series of assays were performed to detect the effects of SMY on: (i) heart weight index (HWI) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI); (ii) cardiac function; (iii) heart tissue morphology; (iv) the contents of carboxy terminal propeptide of procollagen typeI (PICP), amino terminal propeptide of procollagen type III (PШNP), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interferon gamma (INF-γ) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) by ELISA; (v) the mRNA levels of TGF-β1 and toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2); and (vi) protein level of TGF-β1. RESULTS: Rats treated with SMY displayed the reductions of BNP and CK-MB increased by DOX in a dose-dependent manner. Moderate dose of SMY exhibited the correction for the increased HWI, LVMI, and the injured cardiac function, as well as the collagen accumulation. In addition, cardioprotection of SMY against DOX-induced cardiac toxicity was demonstrated by the reduction of myocardial fibrosis, characterized by the suppression of PICP, PШNP and TGF-β1, as well as the anti-inflammation and the regulation for cardiac immune microenvironment, characterized by the inhibition of TLR2, MCP-1, INF-γ and IL-6. CONCLUSIONS: SMY may protect heart function through the restriction of myocardial fibrosis induced by DOX, which suggests the potentially therapeutic effect of SMY on DOX-induced cardiomyopathy.  aPublisher supplied data  a81273937cChinese Natural Science Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aToll-like receptor 2 3aalternative medicine 3acardiac output 3acardiomyopathy 3acardioprotective effect 3achemokine CCL2 3acollagen 3adose response 3adoxorubicin 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afibrosis 3aheart 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-6 3amessenger RNA 3anatriuretic peptides 3arats 3atoxicity 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 3aEast Asia1 aLi, Xiaojiang1 aDong, Liang1 aZhu, Jinli1 aZhang, He1 aJia, Yingjie0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2016 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.61-61dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-016-1037-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02058naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245006900168300001600237500001500253520095100268592002801219650001301247650001501260650001401275650001601289650001101305650002201316650001201338650001701350650002201367650001001389651001501399651001801414653002301432700002101455773009401476852000901570856008101579655001201660IND4399864920221119063113.0160903e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439986492DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-007-9014-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoxshall, Geoff A.10aGlobal diversity of copepods (Crustacea: Copepoda) in freshwater  ap. 195-207.  a2019-12-05  aThe zoogeographic distributions of the 2,814 species of copepods reported from freshwater are analysed. Faunal diversity is compared between zoogeographic regions: the Palaearctic region has more than double the species richness of the next most diverse region, the Neotropical. Historical factors affecting levels of diversity are identified. More than 90% of all freshwater copepods are endemic to a single-zoogeographic region and endemic genera occur in all regions except Antarctica. Species that are not endemic to a single region include the highly vagile and cosmopolitan species occurring in four or more regions. The greatest faunal connectivity, as identified by Sørensen’s Index, is between Palaearctic and Nearctic regions, and identifies the Holarctic taxa. Key human-related issues, such as the role of copepods as vectors for human parasites and the losses caused by parasitic copepods in commercial aquaculture, are mentioned.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopepoda 3afreshwater 3aparasites 3aaquaculture 3ahumans 3aPalearctic region 3atropics 3azoogeography 3aspecies diversity 3afauna 3aAntarctica 3aArctic region 0aPalaearctic region1 aDefaye, Danielle0 tHydrobiologia.g2008 Jan., v. 595, no. 1 p.195-207dSpringer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9014-43Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02666naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245005300161300001800214520138600232592002801618650002501646650002401671650001001695650001401705650001101719650002401730650002301754650004301777650005201820650002601872650001001898700001801908700001601926700001801942700001601960700001601976700001201992700001802004773012002022856008102142852000902223655001202232IND60520746920221119070107.0160522e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052074692DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-016-1189-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Li-zu10aMolecular characterization of Sp110 gene in pigs  ap. 1431-1442.  aSpeckled 110 kDa (Sp110) plays an important role in infectious diseases, as revealed by studies in humans. However, little is known regarding porcine Sp110. To elucidate its potential role in porcine resistance to viral diseases, here, the complete coding sequence of porcine Sp110 gene and its 26 alternatively spliced isoforms were isolated using reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and another seven splicing patterns were obtained using a minigene construct. Subcellular distribution of 11 representative isoforms was characterized in PK-15 cells transiently transfected with their respective GFP fusion constructs, and only isoforms (R and V) bearing all functional domains were localized in nucleus, indicating all the other isoforms lose normal functions of Sp110 owing to alternative splicing. Real-time quantitative PCR and competitive RT-PCR showed that both isoforms R and V had similar tissue expression profile, half-life and response to poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of viral double-stranded RNA, while the longer one (isoform R) was transcribed at a higher level. The results indicated that porcine Sp110 has a role in viral infection and that isoform R is the dominant active form. Overall the data provide potential resource for molecular breeding of pig resistant to diseases and contributes to breeding pigs resistant to viral infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative splicing 3adouble-stranded RNA 3agenes 3ahalf life 3ahumans 3ainfectious diseases 3alivestock breeding 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcription 3aswine1 aWang, Qiu-shi1 aHan, Li-xin1 aWang, Jin-kui1 aShao, Si-yu1 aWang, Liang1 aLiu, Di1 aYang, Xiu-qin0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2016 June, v. 291, no. 3 p.1431-1442dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-016-1189-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01577naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245008900165300001600254520049500270520008900765592002800854653003500882653001800917653001600935653001400951653002300965700001800988700001901006773015201025856007701177852000901254655001201263IND60563075620221121021924.0170211e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056307562DNAL7 a10.5560/znb.2013-30672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmid, Alexander10aSynthesis of a 30-Membered Macrocycle Incorporating Two Ruthenium Sandwich Complexes  ap. 707-713.  aThe first macrocycle incorporating two ruthenium sandwich complexes has been synthesised.

This is particularly important in areas that have suffered from a significant impact of human pressure on the ecological status of water. Field studies were conducted in the Ruda River in an area that had undergone anthropogenic disturbances. The objectives of our survey were to test the biological metrics based on benthic macroinvertebrates at four study sites. Spring and autumn surveys of benthic invertebrates indicated that based on the BMWP and BMWP(PL) indices, water quality was higher in comparison with the value of Multimetric index at all of the sites that were studied. Our results revealed that the water quality was higher at the study sites that are located above the dam reservoir based on both the chemical and biological parameters. This study also indicated that both spring and autumn constitute appropriate periods for carrying out monitoring studies. The values of multimeric index indicated the same water quality (except for site 1) in both sampling periods. Anthropogenic transformations of a riverbed influence the flora and fauna and affect the ecological status of rivers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aautumn 3achemistry 3aecosystem engineering 3afauna 3aflora 3amacroinvertebrates 3amonitoring 3arivers 3aspring 3astream channels 3asurveys 3awater quality 3aPoland 0amacroinvertebrates 0aMMI 0aBMWP 0aecological status of river 0aanthropopressure1 aKubicka, Justyna1 aStrzelec, Małgorzata0 tEcological Chemistry and Engineering.g2017 June 27, v. 24, no. 2 p.285-298dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23149x2084-45497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/eces-2017-00203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01936naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008500170300001800255520071100273592002800984650001701012650001401029650001301043650001001056650001701066650001001083650001801093650001601111650002101127700002301148700001901171700001601190700002001206700002101226700001901247700001701266773011701283856008201400990002301482852000901505655001201514IND60091123020221122091425.0141103e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009112302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.09.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamura, Yasutsugu10aDetection of pre-mRNA splicing in vitro by an RNA-templated fluorogenic reaction  ap. 7248-7251.  aRNA splicing is an important target for basic research of disease mechanisms and for drug discovery.

T. gondii is a zoonotic pathogen which may cause serious disease in man and warm-blooded animals, including wild species. B. besnoiti causes bovine besnoitiosis, an emergent disease in Europe, which is linked to important production losses. Unlike T. gondii, the life cycle of B. besnoiti remains a mystery, since the definitive host has not yet been identified. The aim of this work was to determine the seroprevalence of T. gondii in wildlife and feral cats from a hitherto unsampled area in southern Portugal and to identify likely candidates for definitive and/or other intermediate hosts of B. besnoiti. A total of 260 animals were screened for T. gondii and B. besnoiti by the modified agglutination tests, using the cut-off value of 1:20 and 1:80, respectively. The prevalence of T. gondii was 85.3% in Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon; n=34), 83.3% in wildcats (Felis silvestris; n=6), 66.7% in stone martens (Martes foina; n=6), 47.1% in genets (Genetta genetta; n=17), 40% in foxes (Vulpes vulpes; n=25), 39.2% in cats (Felis catus; n=79), 33.3% in European polecats (Mustela putorius; n=3), 21.4% in red deer (Cervus elaphus; n=14), 7.7% in wild boars (Sus scrofa; n=26), 2.8% in rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus; n=36) and 0% in European otters (Lutra lutra; n=2), European badgers (Meles meles; n=6) and rodents (n=5). None of the species tested was positive for B. besnoiti. Based on the present results, the monitoring of T. gondii in native animal populations may be of major importance for wildlife conservation strategies and human health protection, while the search for other hosts of B. besnoiti requires further investigations in wild and domestic species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBesnoitia besnoiti 3aCervus elaphus 3aFelis silvestris 3aGenetta genetta 3aHerpestes 3aLutra lutra 3aMartes foina 3aMeles meles 3aMustela putorius 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3aProtozoa 3aSus scrofa 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aVulpes vulpes 3aagglutination tests 3abadgers 3acats 3acattle 3adefinitive hosts 3aemerging diseases 3aferal animals 3afoxes 3ahealth promotion 3ahuman health 3aintermediate hosts 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3arabbits 3arodents 3aserological surveys 3aseroprevalence 3awild boars 3awildlife 3awildlife management 3aPortugal 0aToxoplasma gondii 0aBesnoitia besnoiti 0aWildlife 0aSeroprevalence1 aNunes, Telmo1 aVaz, Yolanda1 aLeitão, Alexandre0 tVeterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports.g2016 June, v. 3-4 p.7-12dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23280x2405-93907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2016.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100002800168245009400196300001600290500001900306500000900325520164100334592002801975650001302003650000902016650001602025650001502041650001802056650001702074650001002091650001202101650001102113650001102124700002302135700001802158700002402176773012002200852000902320856009802329655001202427991565888230742620221119185957.0191122e197605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7690667822DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1976.0011183X001600030017x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Tekriti, Ramadhan A.10aStructural Composition and in vitro Dry Matter Disappearance of Brown Midrib Corn Residue  ap. 387-389.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aThe purpose of this research was to determine the effect of the brown midrib-3 (bm3) gone on lignin percentage and in vitro dry matter disappearance of corn (Zea mays L.) stems and leaves sampled after grain harvest. Brown midrib-3 and nearly isogenic normal corn hybrids were grown under field conditions at two locations and sampled at approximately 3, 6, and 9 weeks after grain harvest. An additional normal source represented by a commercial hybrid was also grown at one location. The stover portion of the plants was separated into leaves and stems. Samples were analyzed for structural composition and in vitro dry matter disappearance (IVDMD) using detergent solution and rumen fermentation techniques. The lignin percentage in leaves averaged 5.8 and 7.1% for bm3 and normal plants at the first location. IVDMD of the leaves at this location averaged 57.1 and 49.8%. Lignin percentage in stems averaged 5.4 and 11.6% for bm3 and normal plants. IVDMD of stems averaged 59.2 and 43.0%. The composition of commercial hybrid plants was similar to that of normal plants. At the second location, leaf lignin averaged 6.6 and 8.1% and IVDMD was 56.0 and 50.2% for bm3 and normal genotypes. Lignin averaged 7.0 and 12.4% and IVDMD averaged 50.1 and 39.0% for bm3 and normal stems. Lignin percentage increased and IVDMD decreased after grain harvest. However, differences between bm3 and normal genotypes were nearly as great at the last sampling as at the first, indicating that the differences in composition and digestibility of corn stover caused by the bm3 gene persist in the plant residue long after the grain has been harvested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acorn stover 3adetergents 3adigestibility 3afermentation 3agenes 3ahybrids 3aleaves 3alignin1 aLechtenberg, V.

Drauch10aPatterns of Population Structure Vary Across the Range of the White Sturgeon  ap. 1273-1286.  aCritical unknowns surrounding the basic biology of White Sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus have hindered management and conservation efforts. Population genetic data may be used to address some of these uncertainties, but previous examinations of population structure in White Sturgeon have been limited by the highly duplicated nature of the species’ genome. We report results from an analysis of White Sturgeon population structure within and among drainages using 13 polysomic microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity levels varied widely among regions, and the lowest levels were observed in the endangered Kootenai River Distinct Population Segment and the highest levels were detected in regions with access to estuarine and marine habitat. Patterns of within-drainage population structure varied, and no structure was detected in the Sacramento–San Joaquin drainage and a complex pattern of isolation by distance was revealed in the Columbia–Snake River drainage. These results contrast a previously published evaluation of a White Sturgeon population structure in the Fraser River, which revealed several genetically distinct populations within a single drainage. Examination of population structure among drainages, including from samples collected across the species range, revealed six populations. Populations in the Sacramento–San Joaquin, Kootenai, lower Fraser, and upper Fraser River drainages were distinct. The complex isolation-by-distance pattern discovered in the within-drainage analysis of the Columbia–Snake River drainage was supported by the among-drainage population structure analysis. Our results provide little support for the practice of managing each impounded reach of the Columbia–Snake River system as a genetically distinct population as adjacent reaches show little to no genetic divergence in these analyses. Variation in patterns of population structure across the species range indicates that the scale of spawning site fidelity for White Sturgeon varies regionally, which has implications for recruitment failure mitigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser transmontanus 3adrainage 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3ahabitats 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphilopatry 3apopulation structure 3arivers 3aspawning 3auncertainty1 aMahardja, B.1 aMay, B.0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2013 Sept. 1, v. 142, no. 5 p.1273-1286dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:19703x1548-86597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2013.7885543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03597naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100001800188245011400206300001200320506007600332520161900408592002802027596006702055596005402122506003702176650002302213650002502236650001602261650001602277650002402293650002002317650001002337650002002347650001202367650001302379650003102392650003002423650001302453650002102466650001102487650001602498650001002514650001802524650002302542650001302565650000902578650002402587650001202611650002302623700001802646700001702664700002102681700001802702700001702720773013102737856008202868852000902950655001202959IND60548511320221207111301.0220927e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054851132DNAL7 aPMC48693422pmcid7 a271846702pmid7 a10.1186/s12906-016-1108-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Kuen-Tze10aRhodiola crenulata extract regulates hepatic glycogen and lipid metabolism via activation of the AMPK pathway  ap. 127.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome may lead to many complications, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A natural and effective therapeutic agent for patients with NAFLD is urgently needed. In a previous study, we showed that Rhodiola crenulata root extract (RCE) regulated hepatic gluconeogenesis through activation of AMPK signaling. However, the manner in which RCE regulates hepatic lipid and glycogen metabolism remains unclear. The current study was conducted to investigate the effects of RCE on hepatic glycogen and lipid metabolism, as well as the mechanisms underlying such effects. METHODS: Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were treated with RCE for 6 h under high glucose conditions, after which glycogen synthesis, lipogenesis, and relative gene expression were examined. In addition, lipogenesis-related genes were investigated in vivo. RESULTS: RCE significantly increased glycogen synthesis and inhibited lipogenesis, while regulating genes related to these processes, including glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), glycogen synthase (GS), fatty acid synthase (FAS), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c). However, the effects caused by RCE were neutralized by compound C, an AMPK antagonist. Further studies showed that expression levels of lipogenic genes decreased at the protein and mRNA levels in the rat liver. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that RCE regulates hepatic glycogen and lipid metabolism through the AMPK signaling pathway. These results suggest that RCE is a potential intervention for patients with NAFLD.  aPublisher supplied data  a104-2320-B-016-003cMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan  aMAB-104-017cMinistry of National Defense, TAIWAN0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRhodiola crenulata 3aalternative medicine 3aantagonists 3afatty liver 3afatty-acid synthase 3agene expression 3agenes 3agluconeogenesis 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3aglycogen (starch) synthase 3aglycogen synthase kinases 3ahepatoma 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3alipogenesis 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolic syndrome 3apatients 3arats 3asignal transduction 3asterols 3atau-protein kinase1 aHsu, Shih-Wei1 aLai, Feng-Yi1 aChang, Tsu-Chung1 aShi, Li-Shian1 aLee, Shih-Yu0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2016 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.127-127dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-016-1108-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245011500204300001800319520152800337592002801865596003501893596009401928650002102022650001502043650001802058650001902076650001202095650001302107650001502120650001802135650000902153700002002162700002502182700001602207700002002223773013402243856008202377852000902459655001202468IND60748804220221117110320.0210827e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074880422DNAL7 a10.1007/s00226-021-01307-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKyyrö, Suvi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4204-545610aEffect of drying on the hydroxyl accessibility and sorption properties of pressurized hot water extracted wood  ap. 1203-1220.  aHot water extraction (HWE) treatment changes the physicochemical properties of the wood, including hygroscopic properties. HWE treatment decreases the hydroxyl accessibility of the wood, but the relevance of other mechanisms that change hygroscopic properties are not fully understood. This study investigates the effect of drying on the hydroxyl accessibility and sorption properties of wood. Pressurized hot water extraction (HWE) treatment was applied at 140 °C for 1–5 h to Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sapwood samples in order to remove increasingly more hemicellulose from the cell wall matrix. Following HWE treatment, half of the wood samples were oven-dried and then re-soaked, while the other half was kept in a fully saturated state. The samples were investigated by applying a new approach that was based on the deuteration of accessible hydroxyl groups, which was followed by the measurement of mass loss due to re-protonation. Sorption properties of the wood samples were studied by measuring moisture content, sorption isotherms and dimensional changes. The present results showed that accessible hydroxyl group content decreased only due to hemicellulose removal during the HWE treatment and was unaffected by oven-drying. However, oven-drying enhanced the effect of HWE treatments in reducing the water-saturated dimensions and the moisture content of wood. Therefore, the additional reductions in hygroscopicity and water-saturated dimensions were not related to changes in sorption site density.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 309881cAcademy of Finland  aproject code A7389cSouth Savo Regional Council of the European Regional Development Fund 3aPinus sylvestris 3acell walls 3ahemicellulose 3ahygroscopicity 3asapwood 3asorption 3atechnology 3awater content 3awood1 aAltgen, Michael1 aSeppäläinen, Hanna1 aBelt, Tiina1 aRautkari, Lauri0 tWood science and technology.g2021 Sept., v. 55, no. 5 p.1203-1220dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl45947x0043-77197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-021-01307-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010100166520144900267592002801716650002301744650001301767650001601780650001601796650002001812650002001832650001801852650003001870650001201900650002801912650001501940650002001955650002101975650001801996650001002014653001202024653003102036653001502067700006702082700001602149700001702165700001602182700001702198700001602215773010702231856008502338852000902423655001202432IND60766057420221120155406.0220307e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076605742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2022.1093572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Chunru10aEffect of Bacillus coagulans on maintaining the integrity intestinal mucosal barrier in broilers  aBacillus coagulans (B. coagulans), a spore-forming bacteria, has been further studied for its high tolerance to extreme environmental stressors and probiotic characteristics. But the modulatory effect of B. coagulans on the intestinal mucosal barrier remains unclear. To investigate the effects of B. coagulans on intestinal mucosal barrier, 1-day-old broiler chickens were orally administrated with 10⁸ CFU/mL B. coagulans for consecutive 42 days. In this study, the body weight, jejunum villus height and crypt depth of broiler chickens were significantly increased after B. coagulans treatment. B. coagulans also increased the contents of total protein (TP) and albumin (ALB) in serum, and reduced the contents of low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and triglyceride (TG). In addition, B. coagulans improved the intestinal flora, significantly increasing the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria in the intestine. The ability of B. coagulans to enhance innate immunity is observed by the increased number of goblet cells and the decreased mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and sIgA content. Moreover, B. coagulans promoted intestinal epithelial proliferation through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This study demonstrated that B. coagulans could maintain the intestinal mucosal barrier by improving the intestinal flora, enhancing innate immunity and promoting intestinal epithelial proliferation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus coagulans 3aalbumins 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3agene expression 3ainnate immunity 3ainterleukin-6 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ajejunum 3alow density lipoprotein 3aprobiotics 3aprotein content 3atriacylglycerols 3aurea nitrogen 3avilli 0aBroiler 0aIntestinal mucosal barrier 0aMicrobiota1 aRadebe, Stoffel Matjeke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5709-07351 aZhang, Hang1 aJia, Junpeng1 aXie, Shuang1 aShi, Miaolei1 aYu, Qinghua0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2022 Mar., v. 266 p.109357-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2022.1093573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02191naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100001500168245009600183300001600279500001900295500000900314520108300323592002801406650002301434650002501457650002201482650001101504650001401515650001801529650001001547650001501557651001101572700001901583773012001602852000901722856009801731655001201829991565887940742620221119190149.0191122e197605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7690667842DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1976.0011183X001600030019x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarani, A.10aEvaluation of Verticillium Wilt Tolerance in Upland Cotton Relative to Lint Yield Reduction  ap. 392-395.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aField experiments were conducted to compare methods of evaluating the tolerance of upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) to Verticillium dahliae Kleb. by visual symptoms. Good differentiation between susceptible and tolerant cultivars was obtained by observing foliar symptoms after the middle of the flowering period. Correlation studies indicated that foliar symptoms explained 31 to 45% of the variation in lint yield among cotton breeding lines and cultivars in a wilt-infested field, vascular discoloration at the base of the stem explained 25 to 29%, and vascular discoloration at a height of 40 cm explained 6% or less of that variation. Similar results were obtained when the dependent variable was the difference between lint yield in the infested field and mean lint yield of the same lines grown in two wilt-free locations. Effective screening for wilt tolerance in Israel appears possible by observing foliar symptoms during the second half of the flowering period, provided the field is relatively uniformly infested by the fungus and suitable temperatures prevail.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aVerticillium dahliae 3aVerticillium wilt 3acotton 3acultivars 3adiscoloration 3afungi 3alint yield 3aIsrael1 aYaacobi, Y.

We investigated a non-pathological ATX3 form (ATX3Q24), a pathological expanded form (ATX3Q55), and an ATX3 variant truncated at residue 291 lacking the polyQ expansion (ATX3/291Δ). Solubility, morphology and hydrophobic exposure of oligomeric aggregates were characterized. Then we monitored the changes in the intracellular Ca²⁺ levels and the abnormal Ca²⁺ signaling resulting from aggregate interaction with cultured rat cerebellar granule cells. ATX3Q55, ATX3/291Δ and, to a lesser extent, ATX3Q24 oligomers displayed similar morphological and physicochemical features and induced qualitatively comparable time-dependent intracellular Ca²⁺ responses. However, only the pre-fibrillar aggregates of expanded ATX3 (the only variant which forms bundles of mature fibrils) triggered a characteristic Ca²⁺ response at a later stage that correlated with a larger hydrophobic exposure relative to the two other variants. Cell interaction with early oligomers involved glutamatergic receptors, voltage-gated channels and monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1)-rich membrane domains, whereas cell interaction with more aged ATX3Q55 pre-fibrillar aggregates resulted in membrane disassembly by a mechanism involving only GM1-rich areas. Exposure to ATX3Q55 and ATX3/291Δ aggregates resulted in cell apoptosis, while ATX3Q24 was substantially innocuous. Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms of ATX3 aggregation, aggregate cytotoxicity and calcium level modifications in exposed cerebellar cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyloid 3aapoptosis 3acalcium 3acalcium signaling 3acytotoxicity 3ahydrophobicity 3arats 3areceptors 3asolubility1 aBucciantini, Monica1 aInvernizzi, Gaetano1 aGatta, Elena1 aPenco, Amanda1 aFrana, Anna Maria1 aNosi, Daniele1 aRelini, Annalisa1 aRegonesi, Maria Elena1 aGliozzi, Alessandra1 aTortora, Paolo1 aRobello, Mauro1 aStefani, Massimo0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.

Moreover, people are spending more and more time indoors due to building densification and urban lifestyle. Therefore, indoor environments that can promote positive psychological perception will become more important. Use of wood in indoor settings and its health benefits are currently receiving increased attention from design and research communities. In this work, a comparative study was conducted on the different degrees of wood use in indoor spaces. The results show that the effect of the physical attributes of degree of wood use, wood coverage and change of wood surface (different type and application position of wood) on the visual psychological responses (visual attention and psychological impression) of wooden indoor spaces were significant. The wooden indoor spaces with medium degree of wood use were easier to get more visual attention and were more helpful to give people the psychological impression of naturalness, warmth, relaxation, and desire to use. In addition, the results also show that when considering the influence of change of wood surface, people tended to pay more attention to indoor spaces with relatively high wood coverage and preferred the experiences in such spaces. The change of wood surface was an all-important aspect that needs to be considered on top of wood coverage. These results provided guidance for the design of healthy indoor environments.  aPublisher supplied data  a201906120534cChina Scholarship Council 3acognition 3acomparative study 3alifestyle 3apeople 3atechnology 3aurban society 3awood1 aWu, Jianmei1 aLam, Frank1 aZhang, Chao1 aKang, Jian1 aXu, Hongpeng0 tWood science and technology.g2021 Sept., v. 55, no. 5 p.1485-1508dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl45947x0043-77197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-021-01320-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002500188245007800213300001600291506007600307520183100383592002802214506003702242650002302279650001802302650002202320650001002342650001202352650002002364650003502384650000902419650001202428650001702440650001902457650001902476650001802495650002502513650001602538700002702554773009402581856008102675852000902756655001202765IND60119714820221207050601.0141226e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011971482DNAL7 a251202202pmid7 aPMC42743752pmcid7 a10.1007/s11248-014-9825-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnutson, Danielle C.12aA complex RARE is required for the majority of Nedd9 embryonic expression  ap. 123-134.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNeural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 9 (Nedd9, Casl, Hef1, p105cas, Ef1) is a scaffolding protein that assembles complexes involved in regulating cell adhesion, migration, division, and survival. Nedd9 is found very early in the developing embryonic nervous system. A highly conserved complex retinoic acid response element (RARE) is located 485 base pairs (bp) upstream of exon 2B in the promoter of the Nedd9 gene. Mice transgenic for a 5.2 kilobase (kb) region of the 2B Nedd9 promoter containing the RARE upstream of a lacZ reporter gene [Nedd9(RARE)-lacZ] show a large subset of the normal endogenous Nedd9 expression including that in the caudal hindbrain neuroepithelium, spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia (drg) and migrating neural crest (ncc). However, the transgenic mice do not recapitulate the native Nedd9 expression pattern in presumptive rhombomeres (pr) 3 and 5 of the early hindbrain, the base of the neuroepithelium in the midbrain, nor the forebrain telencephalon. Thus, the 5.2 kb region containing the intact RARE drives a large subset of Nedd9 expression, with additional sequences outside of this region needed to define the full complement of expression. When the 5.2 kb construct is modified (eight point mutations) to eliminate responsiveness of the RARE to all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) [Nedd9(mutRARE)-lacZ], virtually all β-galactosidase (β-gal, lacZ) expression is lost. Exposure of Nedd9(RARE)-lacZ transgenic embryos to excess atRA at embryonic day 8.0 (E8.0) leads to rostral ectopic transgene expression within 6 h whereas the Nedd9(mutRARE)-lacZ mutant does not show this effect. Thus the RARE upstream of the Nedd9 2B promoter is necessary for much of the endogenous gene expression during early development as well as ectopic expression in response to atRA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abeta-galactosidase 3acell adhesion 3aearly development 3aexons 3aganglia 3agene expression 3agenetically modified organisms 3amice 3amutants 3aneural crest 3apoint mutation 3areporter genes 3aretinoic acid 3ascaffolding proteins 3aspinal cord1 aClagett-Dame, Margaret0 tTransgenic research.g2015 Feb., v. 24, no. 1 p.123-134dSpringer-Verlagx0962-88197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11248-014-9825-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01563naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245010500162300001600267520045500283520012100738592002800859653001100887653001500898653002200913653002200935653002000957700001900977700001500996773015201011856007701163852000901240655001201249IND60563076220221120235544.0170211e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056307622DNAL7 a10.5560/znb.2013-30782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanger, Robert10a[Cu40Se16(S-C6H4-CN)8(dppm)8]: A Disc-like Copper Cluster with a Nitrile-functionalized Ligand Shell  ap. 575-580.  aThe new copper chalcogenide cluster [Cu₄₀Se₁₆(S-C₆H₄-CN)₈(dppm)8] (1) with nitrile groups in the organic ligand shell has been synthesized and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and IR spectroscopy.

We examined what molecular mechanism is involved in the regulation of claudin-4 expression. In Madin–Darby canine kidney cells, hyperosmolarity increased the expression level of claudin-4 and the production of reactive oxygen species, which were inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, and manganese (III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid)porphyrin (MnTBAP), a scavenger of H₂O₂. Both hyperosmolarity and H₂O₂ increased p-ERK1/2 and p-JNK, which were inhibited by U0126, a MEK inhibitor, and SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, respectively. Immunoprecipitation assay showed that hyperosmolarity increased the association of nuclear Sp1 with c-Jun, which was inhibited by U0126 and SP600125. In mouse inner medullary collecting duct cells and rat kidney slices, hyperosmolarity increased the expression level of claudin-4, which was inhibited by DPI, MnTBAP, U0126, and SP600125. Hyperosmolarity increased luciferase reporter activity of claudin-4, which was inhibited by U0126, SP600125, Sp1 siRNA, and c-Jun siRNA. The activity was inhibited by the mutation in the Sp1 binding site. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and avidin–biotin conjugated DNA assay showed that Sp1 and c-Jun are associated with the Sp1 binding site. These results suggest that hyperosmolarity increases nuclear Sp1/c-Jun complex and the association of the complex with the Sp1 binding site, resulting in the segment-specific expression of claudin-4 in the kidney.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3abinding sites 3achromatin 3adogs 3ahydrogen peroxide 3akidney cells 3akidneys 3aluciferase 3amanganese 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amutation 3aporphyrins 3aprecipitin tests 3arats 3asmall interfering RNA1 aAtomi, Kosuke1 aYamazaki, Yasuhiro1 aSakai, Hideki1 aHayashi, Hisayoshi1 aYamaguchi, Masahiko1 aSugatani, Junko0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.

In general, virus detection by culture methods is time consuming. In contrast, detection by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is more rapid and therefore, more suitable for monitoring. At present, qPCR lacks the essential ability for discriminating between infectious and non-infectious viruses, thus limiting its applicability for monitoring disinfection processes. In this study, a method was developed to quantify UV inactivation by long amplicon (LA)-qPCR. Bacteriophage phiX174 was used as a surrogate for human pathogenic viruses. A qPCR protocol was developed with new sets of primers, resulting in amplicon lengths of 108, 250, 456, 568, 955, 1063, 1544, and 1764 nucleotides. The log reduction of gene copies increased with increasing amplicon length. Additional treatment with the intercalating dye, PMA, had no effect, indicating that the bacteriophage capsids were not damaged by low pressure UV irradiation. A qPCR of nearly the complete genome (approx. 5000 nucleotides) showed similar results to the plaque assay. The log reduction in qPCR correlates with [specific amplicon length x UV dose]. The normalized DNA effect constant can be applied to calculate phiX174 inactivation based on qPCR detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abacteriophages 3acapsid 3adisinfection 3agenes 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3anucleotides 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arisk assessment 3aultraviolet radiation 0aAmplicon size 0aPlaque assay 0aLow pressure UV 0aPropidium monoazide (PMA) 0aPCR primers 0aLA-qPCR1 aSeidel, Michael1 aNiessner, Reinhard1 aEggers, Jutta1 aTiehm, Andreas0 tWater research.g2016, dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2016.07.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011000166300001600276520175400292592002802046650000902074650001502083650002402098650001102122650000902133650000902142650002002151650002402171650002802195650002502223653001702248653001102265653001702276653001702293653002302310700001902333700003202352700003002384773014802414856008202562852000902644655001202653IND60773252320221119070833.0220606e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077325232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.esd.2022.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerhanu, Hiwot10aPerformance improvement of an electric injera baking pan (Mitad) using copper powder as additive material  ap. 242-257.  aIn this paper, the performance improvement of an electric injera baking stove is studied experimentally using copper powder as additive material for baking plate preparation. The performance of conventional electric injera baking stove is low because of the poor thermal conductivity of the backing plate material. This leads to a high energy consumption ranging from 1.23 to 1.41 kWh for initial heating and observed uneven temperature distribution on the baking surface. Therefore, this study focuses on reducing the time required for initial heating so that the energy consumption will be reduced which will result in overall thermal efficiency improvement. The composite material is developed in four different samples with mixture of different ratios of clay soil and copper powder. Then the performance is studied experimentally. The experiments are conducted for analyzing the initial heating time, plate surface temperature distribution and energy consumption. The results show that the composite material thermal conductivity property has been improved due to addition of copper powder. The sample with 20% copper powder and 80% clay soil ratio mixture has given a better overall performance than other composition (i.e. less initial heating time, better uniform baking surface temperature and less energy consumption/kg of injera). The thermal efficiency of the improved baking stove is 88.55% which is of Grade 1 as per the Ethiopian Standard ‘ES 04090 sub article 4.2 while that of the conventional electric baking stove is 53.36%. Hence, the addition of copper powder to clay has resulted in an overall improvement in thermal efficiency. The quality of injera baked is also very nice with bubbly eye in the front and smooth back side.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3aclay soils 3acomposite materials 3aenergy 3aeyes 3aheat 3aheating systems 3asurface temperature 3asustainable development 3athermal conductivity 0aBaking stove 0aInjera 0aHeating time 0aUniform heat 0aThermal efficiency1 aBekele, Addisu1 aVenkatachalam, Chandraprabu1 aSivalingam, Suyambazhahan0 tEnergy for sustainable development.g2022 June, v. 68 p.242-257dElsevier Inc.aInternational Energy InitiativewJournal:12424x0973-08267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2022.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01657naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012900164300001800293520047100311592002800782650001800810650001400828650002800842650002800870650002400898700001900922700002000941700001800961700001800979700001700997700002001014700001801034773011701052856008201169990002301251852000901274655001201283IND60091123720221122224942.0141103e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009112372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.09.0992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNitta, Aiko10aNovel series of 3-amino-N-(4-aryl-1,1-dioxothian-4-yl)butanamides as potent and selective dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors  ap. 7036-7040.  aA series of novel 3-amino-N-(4-aryl-1,1-dioxothian-4-yl)butanamides were investigated as dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitors.

We estimated there were 3,905 adfluvial individuals in Mann Creek Reservoir in October 2008 based on a mark–recapture population estimate. The adfluvial population sex ratio of 2.78 females per male captured at a weir, peak spawn timing near the peak of the hydrograph (late April), age at spawning (4–6 years), and growth patterns (slow growth in the stream followed by rapid growth in the reservoir) were all characteristic of an anadromous population. Resident fish abundance was not estimated, but the fish were characterized by relatively slow growth, earlier sexual maturity, and a reverse sex ratio (0.23 females per male) compared with the adfluvial fish. The two life histories (resident and adfluvial) and their differential use by the sexes are consistent with life history theory, which suggests female salmonids maximize fitness by increasing body size and fecundity while males attempt to maximize survival at the expense of growth. The migratory fish in this drainage that could have historically exercised an anadromous life history appear to be exercising the next-best option, an adfluvial life history, which has relatively similar costs and benefits to the anadromous form as distinct from the stream-resident form. Future studies should evaluate other similar native populations isolated in reservoir systems because these populations could play a role in recovery of endangered steelhead (anadromous Rainbow Trout) populations in the western USA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aage structure 3abody size 3ademographic statistics 3adrainage 3afecundity 3afemales 3afish 3ahydrograph 3alife history 3amales 3amigratory behavior 3asex ratio 3asexual maturity 3aspawning 3astreams 3aColumbia River 3aIdaho1 aScarnecchia, Dennis L.0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2013 Sept. 1, v. 142, no. 5 p.1157-1166dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:19703x1548-86597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2013.7995203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01667naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011200169300001800281520059200299592002800891650000800919650002300927650002000950650001800970650001900988650001901007650003001026700001801056700002401074773011701098856008201215990002301297852000901320655001201329IND60091123920221122191605.0141103e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009112392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.09.0902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanabe, Kazuhito10aAggregate formation and radiolytic degradation of amphiphilic DNA block copolymer possessing disulfide bond  ap. 7045-7047.  aWe have designed a novel aggregate of DNA block copolymer (DBC) that is sensitive to hypoxic X-irradiation.

We herein investigated the participation of p53 and metallothionein (MT) in the apoptotic process in response to hypoxia in shrimp hemocytes. The Lvp53 or LvMT genes were efficiently silenced by injection of double stranded RNA for p53 or MT. The effects of silencing on apoptosis were measured as caspase-3 activity and flow cytometry in hemocytes after 24 and 48 h of hypoxia (1.5 mg DO L−1). Hemocytes from unsilenced animals had significantly higher apoptosis levels upon both times of hypoxia. The apoptotic levels were diminished but not suppressed in dsp53-silenced but not dsMT-silenced hemocytes after 24 h of hypoxia, indicating a contribution of Lvp53 to apoptosis. Apoptosis in normoxia was significantly higher in dsp53-and dsMT-silenced animals compared to the unsilenced controls, pointing to a possible cytoprotective role of LvMT and Lvp53 during the basal apoptotic program in normoxia. Overall, these results indicate that hypoxia augments apoptosis in shrimp hemocytes and high mRNA levels of Lvp53 and LvMT are not necessary for this response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3aflow cytometry 3agenes 3ahemocytes 3ahypoxia 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3ametallothionein 3anormoxia 3ashrimp 0aHypoxia 0aApoptosis 0aCaspases 0adsRNA silencing 0ap53 0aLitopenaeus vannamei1 aMartínez-Quintana, José A.1 aArenas-Padilla, Marina1 aMata-Haro, Verónica1 aGómez-Jiménez, Silvia1 aYepiz-Plascencia, Gloria1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5730-40110 tChemosphere.g2016, dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.07.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01924naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245008400165300001600249520073700265592002801002650002501030650002001055650001701075650002801092650000901120650000701129650002301136650001301159650001201172650001401184650001501198700001901213700002901232700002001261700003001281773012701311856007901438852000901517655001201526IND60517868720221120064925.0160405e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051786872DNAL7 a10.1111/1471-0307.122412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeleet, Faten L10aDevelopment of a novel milk‐based fermented product fortified with wheat germ  ap. 217-224.  aWheat germ (WG) was mixed with water (1:5), heated (85 °C/15 min), cooled and used to replace 0, 20, 30 and 40% (w/w) of standardised cow's milk (3% fat), supplemented with 2%(w/w) skim milk powder.

Nutritious milk‐based fermented products of acceptable composition and quality could be prepared from formulations containing 20% (w/w) WG slurry.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3adried skim milk 3afermentation 3amicrobiological quality 3amilk 3apH 3asensory properties 3aslurries 3atexture 3aviscosity 3awheat germ1 aAssem, Fayza M1 aAbd El‐Gawad, Mona A M1 aDabiza, Nadia M1 aAbd El‐Salam, Mohamed H0 tInternational journal of dairy technology.g2016 May, v. 69, no. 2 p.217-224dSociety of Dairy Technologyx1364-727X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1471-0307.122413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245016100165300001600326520165100342592002801993650001602021650001802037650001302055650001002068650002602078650002602104650001002130650001202140650001302152650001102165650000902176650002102185650001002206651001102216653001502227653001302242653001402255653003102269773010002300856007702400852000902477655001202486IND60573136520170822000000.0170721e20170623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057313652DNAL7 a10.1515/eko-2017-00162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠikanja, Severin10aInfluence of ecological and botanical factors on the culture of black pine (Pinus nigra) and proposed future management in Šumadija region (Central Serbia)  ap. 184-196.  aAll ecological aspects have been analysed and studied: botanical factors at black pine cultures in the area of Šumadija. Cultures of black pine of age 33 and 55−60 years within five experimental fields can be found in (1) good habitats, (2) medium habitats and (3) bad habitats were analysed in order to see how the same aged cultures act in different habitats. We analysed all the plants that appear as terrestrial flora, all the plants that occur as a shrub vegetation and, finally, floor trees. We analysed all the biotic and abiotic factors. The measures for most appropriate care for the cultures of black pine. Black pine in Serbia reaches its highest elevation amplitude in Europe and covers most diverse habitats and soil, mainly because of its visibly pronounced ecological modesty. For this reason, the black pine is one of the most usable kinds of artificial afforestation in the Republic of Serbia at all devastated, treeless terrain in the oak belt, where there is a danger that through the action of erosion, soil degradation occurs. That in the management unit, Gružansko Lepeničke, Jaseničke forests, to answer all the questions, the pine, when it comes to artificially established black lines on the same or on different sites and the same and the various soils, as when it comes to tending these crops. It should be noted that of the 125,000 ha conifer cultures in the Republic of Serbia, 86 000 ha of trees were all pines, roughly 70% of all conifer cultures. Of the 86 000 ha pine, 65,200 ha was occupied by black pine, which is about 70%. In the above,Management Unit separate the five sample plots of 25 acres in size.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus nigra 3aafforestation 3aconifers 3acrops 3aenvironmental factors 3afield experimentation 3aflora 3aforests 3ahabitats 3ashrubs 3asoil 3asoil degradation 3atrees 3aSerbia 0ablack pine 0acultures 0aŠumadija 0aecological characteristics0 tEkológia (Bratislava).g2017 June 23, v. 36, no. 2 p.184-196dDe Gruyter Openx1337-947X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/eko-2017-00163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04012naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245016200168520224100330592002802571650002202599650001402621650002302635650001902658650002602677650001402703650001602717650002102733650001302754650002802767650002302795650001902818650002902837650001702866651001002883653001202893653000702905653000802912653000802920653000802928653000902936653000902945653000702954653000702961653000702968653000702975653000702982653002602989653002403015653002903039653001503068653001703083700001503100700001703115700001803132700001503150773011603165856008403281852000903365655001203374IND60766058120221120155354.0220314e20220430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076605812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2022.1075052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shuaikang10aSupplemental irrigation increases grain yield, water productivity, and nitrogen utilization efficiency by improving nitrogen nutrition status in winter wheat  aSupplemental irrigation (SI) is considered as one of the effective water management practices for improving grain yield and nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUₜE) in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). However, whether SI increases grain yield and NUₜE by improving the N status in winter wheat is unclear. Based on a two-year field experiment (2017–2018, 2018–2019), we studied the effects of different levels of SI (i.e., no SI (J0), volumetric soil water content at100% field capacity at 20 cm (J20), and volumetric soil water content at 100% field capacity at 40 cm (J40)) and winter wheat cultivars (i.e., large spike-type Shannong23 (SN23) and multi spike-type Shannong29 (SN29)) on grain yield, NUₜE and N status in winter wheat of the North China Plain. Our results indicated that, grain yield had a significant positive correlation with the amount of photosynthetic N (PN) at anthesis. With an increase in the N accumulation in shoots at anthesis (NAA), the amount of PN increased first and then remained stable, whereas the amount of reserve N (RN) increased continuously. Compared with SN29, SN23 allocated more N to PN and storage RN and less to structural N (SN) and accumulation RN at anthesis and had higher NUₜE. Supplemental irrigation at jointing stage significantly increased the amount of NAA and pre-anthesis N redistributed to grains, and its contribution to grains, while the highest grain yield, NUₜE, and water productivity (WP) were reached in J20 and not J40. WP was positively related to the amount of NAA and was also affected by the N nutrition index (NNI) at anthesis. The NNI of winter wheat under J20 treatment is optimal (approximated 1). In J40, with the higher irrigation amount, actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc ₐcₜ), the amounts of NAA and RN, and the NNI at anthesis increased further, but the amounts of PN and grain yield were not affected, which explained the reductions in NUₜE and WP. Overall, moderate SI increased winter wheat grain yield and NUₜE by improving N nutrition status as indicated by the NNI. And the NNI at anthesis is an important indicator to help manage irrigation and improve grain yield, NUₜE, and WP in winter wheat on the North China Plain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3acultivars 3aevapotranspiration 3afield capacity 3afield experimentation 3aflowering 3agrain yield 3airrigation rates 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3anutritional status 3aphotosynthesis 3avolumetric water content 3awinter wheat 3aChina 0aETc act 0aFN 0aNAA 0aNAM 0aNNI 0aNUpE 0aNUtE 0aPN 0aRN 0aSI 0aSN 0aWP 0aNitrogen accumulation 0aNitrogen allocation 0aNitrogen nutrition index 0aIrrigation 0aWinter wheat1 aLin, Xiang1 aWang, Weiyan1 aZhang, Baojun1 aWang, Dong0 tAgricultural water management.g2022 Apr. 30, v. 264 p.107505-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.1075053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03791naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245010500170300001600275520212700291592002802418650001702446650001102463650002202474650002902496650002502525650002902550650001002579650002702589650003502616650002902651650002602680650001102706650002002717650002402737650001702761650001602778650001402794650001602808650002002824650001802844650001002862653002802872653001402900653002402914653001602938700002002954700001802974700001802992700001703010773010203027856008703129852000903216655001203225IND60531957020221120123629.0170719e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053195702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.07.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamastra, L.12aA novel fuzzy expert system to assess the sustainability of the viticulture at the wine-estate scale  ap. 724-733.  aThe wine industry is definitely committed in sustainability: the stakeholders' interest for the topic is constantly growing and a wide number of sustainability programs have been launched in recent years. Most of these programs are focusing on the environmental aspects as environmental sustainability indicators, greenhouse gases emissions and the use of Life Cycle Assessment methodology. Among the environmental indicators the carbon and the water footprint are often used. These indicators, while being useful to assess the sustainability performance of the winegrowing farms, do not take into account important aspects related to the agronomic management of the vineyard. To fill this gap a new indicator called “Vigneto” (Vineyard in Italian language) has been developed. “Vigneto” is a multidimensional indicator to evaluate the sustainability of management options adopted at field scale. It considers the main agronomic aspects, which can have an impact on the environment. These include (i) pest management, (ii) soil management (erosion and compaction), (iii) fertility management (soil organic matter management and fertilizer application), (iv) biodiversity management. Those aspects have been related by fuzzy logics and implemented in web GIS software. The application of the model allows obtaining a general judgment of the agronomic sustainability of the vineyard management: the judgment varies from “A” (excellent) to “E” (completely unsustainable). The produced model was validated and tested by four Italian wine estate. The model output reports that the tested wineries have different management strategies: producers manage vineyards in different ways, depending on the different geographical position. The main differences are related to the soil management and to the presence of natural areas different from vineyard.The developed model can be defined as an environmental decision support system that can be used by wine companies' technicians to define the vineyard practices sustainability performance and support them in the definition of more sustainable management practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acarbon 3acomputer software 3adecision support systems 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental indicators 3afarms 3afertilizer application 3ageographic information systems 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3alife cycle assessment 3amodels 3apest management 3asoil organic matter 3astakeholders 3atechnicians 3avineyards 3aviticulture 3awater footprint 3awine industry 3awines 0aVineyard sustainability 0aIndicator 0aEnvironmental model 0aFuzzy logic1 aBalderacchi, M.1 aDi Guardo, A.1 aMonchiero, M.1 aTrevisan, M.0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 572 p.724-733dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.07.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245006900151300001600220500002000236520146200256592002801718596009101746596006201837596006201899596005901961596004702020596008202067650001402149650001802163650001002181650002202191650001802213650001302231650001402244650002202258650002502280650001002305650000902315700001302324700001202337700001302349700001202362700001202374700001202386700001202398700001202410700001202422773011502434856007302549852000902622655001202631IND60614882820221119135845.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061488282DNAL7 a10.1111/age.127032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, X.10aAccumulation of deleterious mutations in the domestic yak genome  ap. 384-392.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDeleterious mutations play an important functional role, affecting trait phenotypes in ways that decrease the fitness of organisms. Estimating the frequency of occurrence and abundance has been a topic of much interest, especially in crops and livestock. The processes of domestication and breeding allow deleterious mutations to persist at high frequency, and identifying such deleterious mutations is particularly important for breed improvement. Here, we assessed genome‐wide patterns of deleterious variation in 59 domestic and 13 wild yaks using genome resequencing data. Based on the intersection of results given by three methods (provean, polyphen2 and sift4g), we identified 3187 putative deleterious mutation sites affecting 2586 genes in domestic yaks and 2067 affecting 1701 genes in wild yaks. Multiple lines of evidence indicate a significant increase in the load of deleterious mutations in domesticated yaks compared to wild yaks. Private deleterious genes were found to be associated with the perception of smell and detection of chemical stimulus. We also identified 36 genes related to Mendelian genetic diseases involved in sensory perception, skeletal development and the nervous and immune systems. This study not only adds to the understanding of the genetic basis of yak domestication but also provides a rich catalog of variants that will facilitate future breeding‐related research on the yak genome and on other bovid species.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013AA102505 3–2cNational High Technology Research and Development Program of China  a31661143020cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41620104007cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31322052cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a151105cFok Ying Tung Education Foundation  alzujbky‐2016‐k04cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aBos mutus 3adomestication 3agenes 3agenetic disorders 3aimmune system 3amutation 3aphenotype 3asequence analysis 3askeletal development 3asmell 3ayaks1 aYang, Y.1 aRen, Q.1 aDing, X.1 aBao, P.1 aYan, B.1 aYan, X.1 aHan, J.1 aYan, P.1 aQiu, Q.0 tAnimal genetics.g2018 Oct., v. 49, no. 5 p.384-392dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl38565x0268-91467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/age.127033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03440naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245011800178500001900296520147100315592002801786650002901814650001701843650001401860650001101874650001701885650002401902650001801926650001601944650002301960650002701983650001702010653002102027653002902048653001502077653001102092653001502103700002302118700002402141700002802165700002502193700001902218700002502237700002302262700003002285700002702315700001802342700002102360700001502381700002702396700001902423700003402442700002602476700002302502700002202525700001802547700002402565773010702589856008502696852000902781655001202790IND60722708720221118154945.0210215e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072270872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2020.1088892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalhi, Y.q(Yadvinder),14aThe Global Ecosystems Monitoring network: Monitoring ecosystem productivity and carbon cycling across the tropics  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA rich understanding of the productivity, carbon and nutrient cycling of terrestrial ecosystems is essential in the context of understanding, modelling and managing the future response of the biosphere to global change. This need is particularly acute in tropical ecosystems, home to over 60% of global terrestrial productivity, over half of planetary biodiversity, and hotspots of anthropogenic pressure. In recent years there has been a surge of activity in collecting data on the carbon cycle, productivity, and plant functional traits of tropical ecosystems, most intensively through the Global Ecosystems Monitoring network (GEM). The GEM approach provides valuable insights by linking field-based ecosystem ecology with the needs of Earth system science. In this paper, we review and synthesize the context, history and recent scientific output from the GEM network. Key insights have emerged on the spatial and temporal variability of ecosystem productivity and on the role of temperature and drought stress on ecosystem function and resilience. New work across the network is now linking carbon cycling to nutrient cycling and plant functional traits, and subsequently to airborne remote sensing. We discuss some of the novel emerging patterns and practical and methodological challenges of this approach, and examine current and possible future directions, both within this network and as lessons for a more general terrestrial ecosystem observation scheme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity 3abiosphere 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3aecological function 3aglobal change 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3awater stress 0aTropical forests 0aNet primary productivity 0aAllocation 0aTraits 0aMonitoring1 aGirardin, Cécile,1 aMetcalfe, Daniel B.1 aDoughty, Christopher E.1 aAragão, Luiz E.O.C.1 aRifai, Sami W.1 aOliveras, Immaculada1 aShenkin, Alexander1 aAguirre-Gutiérrez, Jesus1 aDahlsjö, Cecilia A.L.1 aRiutta, Terhi1 aBerenguer, Erika1 aMoore, Sam1 aHuasco, Walter Huaraca1 aSalinas, Norma1 ada Costa, Antonio Carlos Lola1 aBentley, Lisa Patrick1 aAdu-Bredu, Stephen1 aMarthews, Toby R.1 aMeir, Patrick1 aPhillips, Oliver L.0 tBiological conservation.g2021 Jan., v. 253 p.108889-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.1088893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245027300156300001600429500002000445520139300465592002801858650001401886650001401900650002501914650001401939650001801953651001001971700001801981700005601999700005402055700001302109700002202122700001602144773013402160856007302294852000902367655001202376IND60602085220221121115053.0180709e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060208522DNAL7 a10.1111/jeu.124992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLian, Chunyu10aMorphological and Molecular Redefinition of Euplotes platystoma Dragesco & Dragesco‐Kernéis, 1986 and Aspidisca lynceus (Müller,1773) Ehrenberg, 1859, with Reconsideration of a “Well‐known” Euplotes Ciliate, Euplotes harpa Stein, 1859 (Ciliophora, Euplotida)  ap. 531-543.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe documented the morphology, infraciliature, silverline system, and molecular data of two euplotid species isolated from China, including two populations of the poorly known Euplotes platystoma Dragesco & Dragesco‐Kernéis, and the previously well described Aspidisca lynceus (Müller,) Ehrenberg, 1830. Based on the information available, an improved diagnosis of Euplotes platystoma is given, including: a narrow adoral zone with 44–68 membranelles, 10 frontoventral, 5 transverse, 2 left marginal and 2 caudal cirri, 11–13 dorsal kineties with 17–25 dikinetids in the mid‐dorsal row, and dorsal silverline system of the double‐eurystomus type. The Chinese population of Aspidisca lynceus closely resembles previously described populations. Phylogenetic analyses inferred from SSU rDNA sequences show that E. platystoma is closely related with E. neapolitanus, and the internal position of A. lynceus within this genus is still not robust. A reconsideration of the “well‐known” Euplotes harpa and a comparison of all SSU rDNA sequences of E. harpa in GenBank are provided. We speculate that the sequences available from GenBank under the name of E. harpa are very likely from misidentified materials, that is, the identity of the species currently associated with the SSU rDNA of this “well‐known” form in molecular databases requires further confirmation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuplotida 3adatabases 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3aChina1 aLuo, Xiaotian1 aFan, Xinpeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1822-79971 aHuang, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1739-18561 aYu, Yuhe1 aBourland, William1 aSong, Weibo0 tjournal of eukaryotic microbiology.g2018 July, v. 65, no. 4 p.531-543dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl49624x1066-52347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeu.124993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001200145245012600157300001600283500001500299520133200314592002801646650002701674650002301701650001101724650001801735650002201753650002201775650003701797650001801834650001301852650002201865650001001887650001401897650001001911651001201921653001801933700001601951700002501967773009601992856004802088852000902136655001202145IND4458893620221122123331.0121003e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445889362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-011-0187-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMay, S.10aLarval fitness and immunogenetic diversity in chytrid-infected and uninfected natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) populations  ap. 805-811.  a2019-12-06  aChytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), an emerging disease, has been decimating amphibian populations around the world for several decades. We quantified aspects of larval fitness, adaptive (major histocompatibility complex) diversity and neutral (microsatellite) diversity in natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) populations in two regions of north-west England. Toads in region one had no evidence of chytrid infection, whereas in region two there was a substantial prevalence of Bd. Larval fitness (growth rate, time to metamorphosis and survival) of B. calamita did not differ between the regions. Genetic diversity at microsatellite loci was much higher in the infected than in the uninfected region, but the converse was true of MHC diversity indicating that genetic drift was unlikely to explain the differences in MHC between the regions. Furthermore, MHC allele frequencies varied significantly between Bd-infected and uninfected populations. Microsatellite diversity was not a robust indicator of larval fitness in these toad populations while MHC genotype frequencies varied in a way that was consistent with directional selection in response to pathogen prevalence. The acquired immune defences may therefore play an important role in determining the susceptibility of amphibian species to chytridiomycosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aselection response 3alarvae 3ametamorphosis 3aemerging diseases 3aEpidalea calamita 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3agenetic drift 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3atoads 3apathogens 3afungi 3aEngland 0aBufo calamita1 aZeisset, I.1 aBeebee, Trevor J.

We investigated changes in protein expression in the alga that allow it to engage in this mutualism. We used quantitative isobaric tagging (iTRAQ) proteomics to determine the L. rostrata proteome grown axenically with B₁₂ supplementation or in coculture with M. loti. Data are available via ProteomeXchange (PXD005046). Using the related Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a reference genome, 588 algal proteins could be identified. Enzymes of amino acid biosynthesis were higher in coculture than in axenic culture, and this was reflected in increased amounts of total cellular protein and several free amino acids. A number of heat shock proteins were also elevated. Conversely, photosynthetic proteins and those of chloroplast protein synthesis were significantly lower in L. rostrata cells in coculture. These observations were confirmed by measurement of electron transfer rates in cells grown under the two conditions. The results indicate that, despite the stability of the mutualism, L. rostrata experiences stress in coculture with M. loti, and must adjust its metabolism accordingly.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aLobomonas 3aMesorhizobium loti 3aalgae 3aalgal proteins 3aamino acids 3aaxenic culture 3abiosynthesis 3achloroplasts 3acoculture 3aelectron transfer 3aenzymes 3afree amino acids 3agenome 3aheat shock proteins 3amutualism 3aphotosynthesis 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asoil bacteria 3avitamin B121 aPandhal, Jagroop1 aCooper, Matthew B.1 aLongworth, Joseph1 aKudahl, Ulrich Johan1 aRusso, David A.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4729-17011 aTomsett, Eleanor V.1 aBunbury, Freddy1 aSalmon, Deborah L.1 aSmirnoff, N.,1 aWright, Phillip C.1 aSmith, Alison G.0 tnew phytologist.g2018 Jan., v. 217, no. 2 p.599-612dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.148323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03593naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245015200162300002000314520126300334592002801597596006301625596006101688596009801749596009801847596010101945596009802046596009702144650001302241650002202254650001702276650001302293650002102306650001202327650003302339653001902372653004502391653002002436653001302456653002902469653003002498700001802528700001302546700002202559700001602581700001502597700001502612700006002627700005502687700005502742773014202797856007902939852000903018655001203027IND60772666520221119085106.0220407e20220324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077266652DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c199322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Yuanyuan10aLiquid-Crystalline Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence: Design, Synthesis, and Application in Solution-Processed Organic Light-Emitting Diodes  ap. 15437-15447.  aRealizing both high efficiency and liquid crystallinity in one molecule remains a challenge in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emission. Herein, two isomeric compounds─m-DPSAc-LC and p-DPSAc-LC with different connection positions between donor and acceptor moieties─were synthesized and characterized. Diphenylsulfone (DPS) was used as the acceptor, acridine (Ac) was used as the donor, and biphenyl derivatives (LC) were employed as the mesogenic group. Both compounds showed a smectic mesophase evidenced by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized optical microscopy (POM), and temperature-dependent small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The compound p-DPSAc-LC clearly exhibited thermally activated delayed fluorescence due to the much more distorted geometry, whereas m-DPSAc-LC showed simple fluorescence. Compared to the parent TADF molecules without appended mesogenic groups (DPS-Ac), these liquid-crystalline emitters possessed higher hole mobilities and improved device performance. The OLEDs fabricated via solution processing using the liquid-crystalline compound p-DPSAc showed a maximum external quantum efficiency of ∼15% and as such is the first example of a liquid-crystalline TADF material in an OLED device.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcUniversity of Yorkdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009001  aNAcRoyal Societydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000288  a51473140cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a51773021cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a51911530197cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aU1663229cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aXCL-102cSix Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100010014 3abiphenyl 3acrystal structure 3afluorescence 3ageometry 3alight microscopy 3aliquids 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 0aliquid crystal 0athermally activated delayed fluorescence 0adiphenylsulfone 0aacridine 0asynthesis and properties 0asolution-processable OLED1 aZeng, Songkun1 aLi, Bing1 aMcEllin, Alice J.1 aLiao, Junxu1 aFang, Zhou1 aXiao, Chen1 aBruce, Duncan W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1365-22221 aZhu, Weiguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4244-26381 aWang, Yafei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6984-69180 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Mar. 24, v. 14, no. 13 p.15437-15447dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c199323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003600148245009400184300001600278500001900294520184500313592002802158650001902186650001702205650002502222650003702247650001202284650001402296650002002310650001402330650001702344700003602361700003802397700003402435700007202469773012202541856008202663852000902745655001202754IND60712442420221120200549.0201009e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071244242DNAL7 a10.1007/s12088-020-00895-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira, Josenildo Cândido14aThe Sensitivity Modifying Activity of Nerolidol and α-Bisabolol Against Trichophyton spp  ap. 505-510.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTrichophyton spp. is one of the main causative agents of dermatophytosis such as tinea ungium and tinea pedis. Resistance to antifungal drugs is a significant clinical problem in dermatophytosis. The main molecular mechanism of antifungal resistance to conventional therapy in dermatophytes is the expression of efflux pumps. Efforts aimed at improving the efficacy of current antifungals such as griseofulvin are relevant. Given this, sesquiterpenes such as α-bisabolol and nerolidol found in essential oils represent promissing alternatives. Griseofulvin sensitivity modulation activity in T. rubrum, T. interdigitale H6, and T. interdigitale Δmdr2 (mutant strain of T. interdigitale) promoted by α-bisabolol and nerolidol were investigated. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the test drugs were determined by microdilution. Subsequently, the effect of the drugs tested on plasma membrane functionality (K⁺ release) was analyzed. The MIC of griseofulvin was determined at sub-inhibitory sesquiterpene concentrations (modulation assay). An association study was performed with griseofulvin and sesquiterpenes (checkerboard). α-bisabolol was more potent than nerolidol; presenting lower MIC values. All of the fungi were sensitive to griseofulvin, starting at 8 µg/mL. With the exception of griseofulvin, all of the test drugs increased K⁺ release (p < 0.05). Nerolidol modulated the sensitivity of all strains to griseofulvin; α-bisabolol sensitivity modulation was limited to T. interdigitale H6 and T. interdigitale Δmdr2. In association with griseofulvin: nerolidol and α-bisabolol respectively presented synergism and additivity. Finally, the results of our study suggest using α-bisabolol and nerolidol compounds as potential antifungal agents and griseofulvin sensitivity modulators for Trichophyton spp.  aPublisher supplied data 3adermatomycoses 3agriseofulvin 3akeratinophilic fungi 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amutants 3anerolidol 3aplasma membrane 3asynergism 3atherapeutics1 ade Vasconcelos Pinto, Ânderson1 ade Medeiros, César Augusto Costa1 aPonte, Hellen Aparecida Silva1 aPereira, Fillipe de Oliveira1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3081-41740 tIndian journal of microbiology.g2020 Dec., v. 60, no. 4 p.505-510dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl14369x0046-89917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12088-020-00895-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03833naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245015600158300001800314520234700332592002802679650002602707650001902733650001602752650001602768650001502784650002002799650000902819650001902828650001202847650001302859651001202872653001402884653001902898653002302917653002002940700001702960700002202977700001602999700001603015700001403031700001403045700002203059700001603081773015403097856007903251852000903330655001203339IND60531873720221116173310.0190318e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053187372DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2016-109112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSüss, D.10aMeasurement of β-hydroxybutyrate in capillary blood obtained from an ear to detect hyperketonemia in dairy cows by using an electronic handheld device  ap. 7362-7369.  aThe primary objective of the present study was to test whether capillary blood obtained by puncturing the skin of an ear with a minimal invasive lancet technique is able to detect hyperketonemia (HYK) in dairy cows. Furthermore, test characteristics of a new available handheld device, the FreeStyle Precision Neo (FSP-Neo, Abbott GmbH & Co. KG, Wiesbaden, Germany) for determination of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations in bovine blood were evaluated by comparing the measurements with a laboratory reference. The BHB concentration was determined with the FSP-Neo device in 720 capillary blood samples from 3 different sampling sites (left, right ear, and repeated measurement) and in 240 samples from a coccygeal vessel. The concentration of BHB in serum harvested from the coccygeal blood samples was analyzed at the laboratory and was used as reference. The Spearman correlation coefficient (ρs) between the BHB concentrations in capillary blood measured with the handheld device and the reference test was between 0.76 and 0.81. Using capillary blood, the mean ± standard deviation BHB difference compared with the reference test was 0.20±0.47 mmol/L for all 3 sampling locations at the ears. The receiver operating characteristic analyses for the FSP-Neo device resulted in an optimized threshold for the detection of subclinical ketosis (SCK) in capillary blood of 1.3 mmol/L (left and right ear) and 1.2 mmol/L (repeated measurements). Applying these adjusted threshold sensitivities (Se) for all 3 capillary sampling sites at the ear were 100%, and specificities (Sp) ranged between 93 and 94%. Hence, we conclude that all sampling locations were suitable to identify cows suffering from SCK. The reference test compared with BHB measurements in coccygeal blood resulted in a ρs of 0.92 with a mean ± standard deviation of 0.02±0.21 mmol/L. The receiver operating characteristic analyses for the FSP-Neo device resulted in an optimized threshold for the detection of SCK in coccygeal blood of 1.1 mmol/L, with a corresponding Se and Sp of 100 and 95%, respectively. Because capillary blood is easily achievable from an ear, particularly if animals are fixed in headlocks for routine checkups, this technique is considered as an additional minimally invasive method for the identification of dairy cows suffering from HYK.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acorrelation 3adairy cows 3adetection limit 3aears 3ahyperketonemia 3aketosis 3aselenium 3aGermany 0adairy cow 0ahyperketonemia 0aβ-hydroxybutyrate 0acapillary blood1 aDrillich, M.1 aKlein-Jöbstl, D.1 aWagener, K.1 aKrieger, S.1 aThiel, A.1 aMeyer, L.1 aSchwendenwein, I.1 aIwersen, M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2016 Sept., v. 99, no. 9 p.7362-7369dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-109113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03845naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003000166245017700196300001600373520159000389592002801979650001002007650001902017650001902036650001902055650001102074650002002085650002202105650002002127650001002147650003102157650001502188650001102203650001602214650002002230650001002250650001402260650002602274650001202300650001302312650001202325650002102337650002802358650001202386650002402398650001102422650005502433650003402488650004802522650001102570650007602581650000902657650005602666650006502722650003502787650001502822651001102837651002602848700002802874700003202902700003202934773011202966856004803078852000903126655001203135IND50062475920221118234201.0130322e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006247592DNAL7 a229929472pmid7 a10.1007/s11250-012-0265-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValdéz-Cruz, Maura Pilar10aGastrointestinal nematode burden in working equids from humid tropical areas of central Veracruz, Mexico, and its relationship with body condition and haematological values  ap. 603-607.  aThe east coast of Veracruz, Mexico, has an important equine population used for working in rural production systems. The objectives of this study were (1) to calculate the prevalence of tropical working equids (donkeys, mules and horses) infected with gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) and the GINs involved, and (2) to measure the body condition score (BCS) and haematological values for each working equid and its relationship with faecal worm egg count (EPG). One hundred and forty working equids were randomly selected from five different villages along the central coast of the state of Veracruz and faecal and blood samples were obtained from each animal. Gastrointestinal parasite burdens were determined using the McMaster technique. Packed cell volume, total plasma proteins, red blood cell count and white blood cell count were measured from each blood sample. Prevalence of infected equids was higher than 90 %. Mules had the highest median faecal worm egg counts (875 EPG), followed by horses and donkeys with 400 EPG. There was no correlation between EPG and BCS or haematological values (p > 0.05). Results suggest that despite the high prevalence and parasite burdens, equids involved in this trial are not being seriously affected. This study provides information which might help in designing future strategies to control nematode infections in working equids in the Mexican tropics; more emphasis should be placed on other inputs (nutrition perhaps), with individual anthelminthic treatment to those animals with the highest EPG or when signs present themselves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasses 3ablood proteins 3ablood sampling 3abody condition 3acoasts 3adisease control 3aerythrocyte count 3afecal egg count 3afeces 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3ahematocrit 3ahorses 3alabor force 3aleukocyte count 3amules 3anutrition 3aproduction technology 3atropics 3avillages 2aAnimals 2aBody Composition 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aEquidae 2aFecesxparasitology 2aFemale 2aHelminthiasis, Animalxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aHematologic Testsxveterinary 2aHorse Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aHorses 2aIntestinal Diseases, Parasiticxepidemiologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aMale 2aNematodaxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aNematode Infectionsxepidemiologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aParasite Egg Countxveterinary 2aPrevalence 3aMexico 0aMexicoxepidemiology.1 aHernández-Gil, Mariano1 aGalindo-Rodríguez, Leticia1 aAlonso-Díaz, Miguel Ángel0 tTropical animal health and production.g2013 Feb., v. 45, no. 2 p.603-607dSpringer-Verlagx0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-012-0265-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245010200200300002000302520131600322592002801638596009801666596009201764596009901856650002101955650001501976650001201991653003802003653002102041653001002062653001502072653004502087700005702132700005502189700005702244773014202301856007902443852000902522655001202531IND60772666720221119085026.0220407e20220228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077266672DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c211832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jun-Ho,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1999-473310a2D PdTe₂ Thin-Film-Coated Current Collectors for Long-Cycling Anode-Free Rechargeable Batteries  ap. 15080-15089.  aThe practical implementation of anode-free batteries is limited by factors such as lithium dendrite growth and low cycling Coulombic efficiency (CE). In this study, the improvement in the electrochemical performance of anode-free rechargeable lithium batteries bearing a Cu current collector (CC) coated with PdTe₂ thin films is reported. The optimized thickness and sputtering heating conditions of the PdTe₂ layer are 15 nm and 473.15 K, respectively. Upon deposition on a CC, PdTe₂ works as a seed layer that considerably improves the CE in half-cells, owing to its unique 2D structure that reduces the nucleation overpotential. A further contribution to the high performance is brought about by a CuTe interphase between the coating layer and Cu CC formed during heating. Such an interphase contributes to the high CE by improving the uniformity of the current density distribution on the CC that suppresses lithium dendrite growth. A low nucleation overpotential and uniform current density distribution, in turn, result in a smooth morphology of the plated Li. The full cell obtained with the PdTe₂-coated CC exhibits a capacity retention of 70.7% after the 100th cycle, with an average CE of 99.65% at a 0.2C rate─an outstanding result in view of the rapid development of lithium-ion batteries.  aPublisher supplied data  aFA2386-20-1-4081cAir Force Office of Scientific Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000181  aNAcKorea University of Technology and Educationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002519  a2021R1F1A1047375cNational Research Foundation of Koreadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003725 3aelectrochemistry 3ainterphase 3alithium 0aanode-free rechargeable batteries 0alithium dendrite 0aPdTe2 0asputtering 0atransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)1 aCho, Yoon-Gyo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4554-19811 aGu, Dongeun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4688-88481 aKim, Suk-Jun,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4172-78180 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Feb. 28, v. 14, no. 13 p.15080-15089dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c211833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245009600164300001800260520144100278592002801719650003201747650001301779650001901792650001201811650002001823650001601843650000901859650001701868650001001885650003401895650001401929650001301943650001801956650002001974650001801994650001502012650001802027650002202045650003002067650002202097653003402119653001402153653001102167653002802178700002502206700002502231700002402256700001902280773015402299856007902453852000902532655001202541IND60531873820221116173246.0190318e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053187382DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2015-106972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qianqian10aGenome-wide association study for longevity with whole-genome sequencing in 3 cattle breeds  ap. 7289-7298.  aLongevity is an important economic trait in dairy production. Improvements in longevity could increase the average number of lactations per cow, thereby affecting the profitability of the dairy cattle industry. Improved longevity for cows reduces the replacement cost of stock and enables animals to achieve the highest production period. Moreover, longevity is an indirect indicator of animal welfare. Using whole-genome sequencing variants in 3 dairy cattle breeds, we carried out an association study and identified 7 genomic regions in Holstein and 5 regions in Red Dairy Cattle that were associated with longevity. Meta-analyses of 3 breeds revealed 2 significant genomic regions, located on chromosomes 6 (META-CHR6–88MB) and 18 (META-CHR18–58MB). META-CHR6–88MB overlaps with 2 known genes: neuropeptide G-protein coupled receptor (NPFFR2; 89,052,210–89,059,348 bp) and vitamin D-binding protein precursor (GC; 88,695,940–88,739,180 bp). The NPFFR2 gene was previously identified as a candidate gene for mastitis resistance. META-CHR18–58MB overlaps with zinc finger protein 717 (ZNF717; 58,130,465–58,141,877 bp) and zinc finger protein 613 (ZNF613; 58,115,782–58,117,110 bp), which have been associated with calving difficulties. Information on longevity-associated genomic regions could be used to find causal genes/variants influencing longevity and exploited to improve the reliability of genomic prediction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aHolstein 3aanimal welfare 3acalving 3acattle industry 3achromosomes 3acows 3adairy cattle 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3alongevity 3amastitis 3ameta-analysis 3amilk production 3aneuropeptides 3aprediction 3aprofitability 3asequence analysis 3avitamin D-binding protein 3azinc finger motif 0agenome-wide association study 0alongevity 0acattle 0awhole-genome sequencing1 aGuldbrandtsen, Bernt1 aThomasen, Jørn Rind1 aLund, Mogens Sandø1 aSahana, Goutam0 tJournal of dairy science.g2016 Sept., v. 99, no. 9 p.7289-7298dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-106973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012400162300001600286520151100302592002801813650001901841650001201860650001101872650001301883650001101896650001101907650001001918650001401928650001901942650001901961650001201980651001101992700001502003700001702018700001402035700002002049773009002069856008102159852000902240655001202249IND60437403120221117070538.0151022e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043740312DNAL7 a10.1007/s00040-015-0430-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenske, J.10aOlfactory associative learning in two African stingless bee species (Meliponula ferruginea and M. bocandei, Meliponini)  ap. 507-516.  aWorldwide only a few of the more than 500 stingless bee species has been studied in any detail. Most studies on stingless bees have been conducted in the Neotropics, whereas a very few have been undertaken in Africa. Foraging success is dependent to a greater or lesser extent on olfactory cues or signals. A prerequisite to effective foraging via odors is that the bees are able to associate odors with a nectar reward and memorize this information. In the context of olfactory learning, only five species of stingless bees have been studied using classical conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex (PER). Foragers are capable of using previously experienced olfactory information when choosing food sources, but they rarely respond in differential PER assays. This study examines for the first time the olfactory learning abilities of African stingless bees. A differential conditioning assay was used to study learning and memory of Meliponula ferruginea and Meliponula bocandei. Our results clearly show that both stingless bee species associate odors with a reward. Learning performance of both stingless bee species was poor compared to Apis m. scutellata. This might reflect that the experimental procedure has been optimized for Apis mellifera. However, the PER paradigm seems to be suitable to study learning, memory, and olfactory perception in Meliponula. As in honeybees, this paradigm will open the way to answer ecological, psychological, and neurobiological questions in these species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aTrigona 3aassays 3aforaging 3amemory 3anectar 3aodors 3aproboscis 3asocial insects 3astingless bees 3atropics 3aAfrica1 aKrausa, K.1 aHager, F.

A particular barrier to quantitative assessment of the risk of failures is the lack of knowledge of the geotechnical properties of peat and its role in failures. In order to advance the understanding of these issues case history data is invaluable. This paper describes a case study from the Wicklow mountains where a desk and remote sensing based study was used to identify peat slope failures. Subsequently, detailed field studies were carried out at two failure locations. It was found that although the full causal factors at the time of failure are unknown, a common factor was that the failure took place in a zone of highly decomposed and relatively low-fibre-content peat. A revision of the standard test method for fibre content for use in peat soils is proposed.</p>  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3afiber content 3afield experimentation 3amountains 3apeat 3apeat soils 3aquantitative risk assessment 3aremote sensing 3aIreland1 aLong, M.0 tBiology and environment.g2010 Jan. 1, v. 110, no. 3 p.173-184dThe Royal Irish Academyx0791-79457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3318%2FBIOE.2010.110.3.1733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03481naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245013400163500001400297520219400311592002802505650001102533650002002544650001202564650002002576650002202596650001602618650001802634650001202652650001602664650001702680650002002697650002402717650000902741650001502750650001702765650003002782650001102812700002002823773012002843856007502963852000903038655001203047IND60729168120221120060642.0210228e20210203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072916812DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110203882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmadori, Massimo 14aThe Autumn Low Milk Yield Syndrome in High Genetic Merit Dairy Cattle: The Possible Role of a Dysregulated Innate Immune Response  aNAL-light  aThe analysis of milk yield data shows that high genetic merit dairy cows do not express their full production potential in autumn. Therefore, we focused on metabolic stress and inflammatory response in the dry and peripartum periods as possible causes thereof. It was our understanding that some cows could not cope with the stress imposed by their physiological and productive status by means of adequate adaptation strategies. Accordingly, this study highlights the noxious factors with a potential to affect cows in the above transition period: hot summer climate, adverse genetic traits, poor coping with unfavorable environmental conditions, outright production diseases and consequences thereof. In particular, the detrimental effects in the dry period of overcrowding, photoperiod change and heat stress on mammary gland development and milk production are highlighted in the context of the autumn low milk yield syndrome. The latter could be largely accounted for by a “memory” effect on the innate immune system induced in summer by diverse stressors after dry-off, according to strong circumstantial and indirect experimental evidence. The “memory” effect is based on distinct epigenetic changes of innate immunity genes, as already shown in cases of bovine mastitis. Following a primary stimulation, the innate immune system would be able to achieve a state known as “trained immunity”, a sort of “education” which modifies the response to the same or similar stressors upon a subsequent exposure. In our scenario, the “education” of the innate immune system would induce a major shift in the metabolism of inflammatory cells following their reprogramming. This would entail a higher basal consumption of glucose, in competition with the need for the synthesis of milk. Also, there is strong evidence that the inflammatory response generated in the dry period leads to a notable reduction of dry matter intake after calving, and to a reduced efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. On the whole, an effective control of the stressors in the dry period is badly needed for better disease control and optimal production levels in dairy cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3abovine mastitis 3aclimate 3adisease control 3adry matter intake 3aepigenetics 3agenetic merit 3aglucose 3aheat stress 3ainflammation 3ainnate immunity 3amammary development 3amilk 3amilk yield 3amitochondria 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3asummer1 aSpelta, Chiara 0 tAnimals.g2021 Feb. 03, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110203883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245008400161300002000245520119000265592002801455596010301483596010301586650001201689650001301701650002001714650001201734653002001746653001601766653003901782653002501821653003201846700005401878700002001932773014201952856007902094852000902173655001202182IND60772666920221119084952.0220407e20220322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077266692DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c220482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Eunsik10aDeep-Learning-Based Microfluidic Droplet Classification for Multijet Monitoring  ap. 15576-15586.  aInkjet printing, the deposition of microfluidic droplets on a specified area, has gained increasing attention from both academia and industry for its versatility and scalability for mass production. Inkjet printing productivity depends on the number of nozzles used in a multijet process. However, droplet jetting conditions can vary for each nozzle due to multiple factors, such as the surface wetting condition of the nozzle, properties of the ink, and variances in the manufacturing of the nozzle head. For these reasons, droplet jetting conditions must be continuously monitored and evaluated by skillful engineers. The present study presents a deep-learning-based method to identify the droplet jetting status of a single-jet printing process. A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based on the MobileNetV2 model was employed with optimized hyperparameters to classify the inkjet frames containing images captured with a CCD camera. By accumulating the classified class data in order by frame time, the jetting conditions could be evaluated with high accuracy. The method was also successfully demonstrated with a multijet process, with a test time of less than a second per image.  aPublisher supplied data  akitech JH-22-0002cKorea Institute of Industrial Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003695  aNRF-2021R1I1A3059714cNational Research Foundation of Koreadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003725 3acameras 3adroplets 3aneural networks 3anozzles 0ainkjet printing 0ajetting map 0aconvolutional neural network (CNN) 0aframe classification 0ahyperparameter optimization1 aAn, Kunsik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4128-06731 aKang, Kyung-Tae0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Mar. 22, v. 14, no. 13 p.15576-15586dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c220483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02162naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009400163300001600257520112000273592002801393650001501421650001601436650001601452650001901468650001501487650000901502650001001511650001401521650001901535650001301554650001101567651001301578700001701591773009001608856008101698852000901779655001201788IND60437403620221117065742.0151022e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043740362DNAL7 a10.1007/s00040-015-0426-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeeters, C.10aPredation on large millipedes and self-assembling chains in Leptogenys ants from Cambodia  ap. 471-477.  aVarious ants can link their bodies in chains or other structures, a striking example of cooperation. Chain behavior in Leptogenys sp. functions for the collective transport of large millipedes. This undescribed Leptogenys species is a swarm raider with a small range of prey: millipedes belonging to four orders (Polydesmida, Spirostreptida, Spirobolida, Sphaerotheriida), and occasional earthworms. Small prey were carried individually or dragged by a few ants, while chains made it possible to move millipedes weighing up to 16.4 g. Chains (either linear or branched) changed according to obstacles along the way to the nests. Between 2 and 52 workers were observed to drag single prey items, with only a few ants directly grasping the prey. One 15-cm-long millipede was captured rodeo-style after being encircled by 25–30 ants. As it uncurled from a defensive coil, the ants held back except one that tried to sting between its legs. The millipede started thrashing about which caused many ants to attempt stinging. While four other ponerine genera hunt millipedes solitarily, chains have never been reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeptogenys 3aPolydesmida 3aSpirobolida 3aSpirostreptida 3aearthworms 3alegs 3anests 3apredation 3asocial insects 3astinging 3aswarms 3aCambodia1 aDe Greef, S.0 tInsectes sociaux.g2015 Nov., v. 62, no. 4 p.471-477dSpringer Baselx0020-18127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00040-015-0426-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245009100200300001800291500002000309520178700329592002802116596005002144650001802194650002602212650001002238650002102248650003002269650001402299700001802313700002002331700002902351700002202380773012502402856007302527852000902600655001202609IND60614883420221119135426.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061488342DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.133832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillips, Anna G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0183-413310aEffects of phylogeny and geography on ecomorphological traits in passerine bird clades  ap. 2337-2347.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: To compare phylogenetic effects with geographic effects across multiple clades of passerine birds to understand the roles of evolutionary history and geographic patterns on the ecomorphological characteristics of species. LOCATION: Global. METHODS: We combine phylogenetic and geographic approaches to investigate and compare their effects on patterns of ecomorphological distinctness, i.e. the relative position of species in multidimensional ecomorphological trait space. The trait space was based on measurements from preserved specimens, representing ecologically relevant morphological adaptations across almost 500 species in eight clades of the order Passeriformes. RESULTS: Ecomorphological distinctness increased with phylogenetic distance across species in all clades, whereas there was no significant relationship between geographic and ecomorphological distinctness in any clade. However, we observed a significant interaction between phylogenetic and geographic effects on ecomorphological distinctness. Closely related species were ecomorphologically indistinct if in geographic proximity, while at large geographic distances, there was no relationship between phylogenetic and ecomorphological distinctness. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that phylogenetic relationships are influential in shaping ecomorphological traits in passerine bird clades, but that this effect depends on the geographic distributions of species. Closely related species were only ecomorphologically similar when geographically close, suggesting a signal of allopatric speciation. Our results imply that studies identifying phylogenetic effects in species’ traits should not focus exclusively on these but instead evaluate the interaction of phylogenetic effects with geographic effects.  aPublisher supplied data  aDFG FR 3246/2‐1cGerman Research Foundation 3aPasseriformes 3aallopatric speciation 3abirds 3agenetic distance 3ageographical distribution 3aphylogeny1 aTöpfer, Till1 aRahbek, Carsten1 aBöhning‐Gaese, Katrin1 aFritz, Susanne A.0 tJournal of biogeography.g2018 Oct., v. 45, no. 10 p.2337-2347dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl9765x0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.133833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03620naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001600180245011700196300001600313500002000329506007600349520150800425592002801933506003701961650002001998650002302018650001702041650002402058650002002082650002002102650001002122650001102132650001502143650001602158650002202174650001502196650001502211650001402226650002302240650002202263650001702285650002002302650004302322650001602365650001502381650000902396650001902405700002202424700002902446700002002475700002302495700002402518700002002542700001902562700002502581700001902606700001802625700002202643700005802665773011602723856007402839852000902913655001202922IND60588367120221207060544.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058836712DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.148472doi7 aPMC57654472pmcid7 a290830392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Guowei10aChanges in the allocation of endogenous strigolactone improve plant biomass production on phosphate‐poor soils  ap. 784-798.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStrigolactones (SLs) are carotenoid‐derived phytohormones shaping plant architecture and inducing the symbiosis with endomycorrhizal fungi. In Petunia hybrida, SL transport within the plant and towards the rhizosphere is driven by the ABCG‐class protein PDR1. PDR1 expression is regulated by phytohormones and by the soil phosphate abundance, and thus SL transport integrates plant development with nutrient conditions. We overexpressed PDR1 (PDR1 OE) to investigate whether increased endogenous SL transport is sufficient to improve plant nutrition and productivity. Phosphorus quantification and nondestructive X‐ray computed tomography were applied. Morphological and gene expression changes were quantified at cellular and whole tissue levels via time‐lapse microscopy and quantitative PCR. PDR1 OE significantly enhanced phosphate uptake and plant biomass production on phosphate‐poor soils. PDR1 OE plants showed increased lateral root formation, extended root hair elongation, faster mycorrhization and reduced leaf senescence. PDR1 overexpression allowed considerable SL biosynthesis by releasing SL biosynthetic genes from an SL‐dependent negative feedback. The increased endogenous SL transport/biosynthesis in PDR1 OE plants is a powerful tool to improve plant growth on phosphate‐poor soils. We propose PDR1 as an as yet unexplored trait to be investigated for crop production. The overexpression of PDR1 is a valuable strategy to investigate SL functions and transport routes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPetunia hybrida 3abiomass production 3abiosynthesis 3acomputed tomography 3acrop production 3agene expression 3agenes 3aleaves 3amicroscopy 3amycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aphytomass 3aplant architecture 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3aplant nutrition 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arhizosphere 3aroot hairs 3asoil 3astrigolactones1 aPfeifer, Johannes1 ade Brito Francisco, Rita1 aEmonet, Aurelia1 aStirnemann, Marina1 aGübeli, Christian,1 aHutter, Olivier1 aSasse, Joëlle1 aMattheyer, Christian1 aStelzer, Ernst1 aWalter, Achim1 aMartinoia, Enrico1 aBorghi, Lorenzo1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9631-96940 tnew phytologist.g2018 Jan., v. 217, no. 2 p.784-798dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.148473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245019700172300001600369520132100385592002801706650001301734650001701747650002101764650001401785650001601799650001101815650001401826650001001840651001001850653001901860653000801879653001501887653001601902653000801918653003901926700002101965700002301986700002502009773010602034856008402140852000902224655001202233IND60123187920221118024555.0150325e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012318792DNAL7 a10.1080/14772000.2014.9001332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrylova, Elena M.10aAustrogena: a new genus of chemosymbiotic bivalves (Bivalvia; Vesicomyidae; Pliocardiinae) from the oxygen minimum zone off central Chile described through morphological and molecular analyses  ap. 225-246.  aA new genus, Austrogena , is established for a new species of vesicomyid bivalve (A. nerudai sp. nov.) described from sediments within the oxygen minimum zone off El Quisco, Chilean margin (∼33°S) from ∼340 m depth. The new genus is distinguished by a unique combination of conchological and anatomical features for vesicomyids, including the presence of an escutcheon, a lunular incision, an elongated 4-b tooth in the left valve, a subumbonal pit, both inner and outer pairs of demibranchs and the absence of pallial sinus and processes on the inner vulva of the inhalant siphon. In comparison with the majority of highly specialized pliocardiins, the alimentary gut of Austrogena is not straight and its middle gut changes direction twice. Molecular analysis, based on COI sequences, confirms that A. nerudai sp. nov. is not related to any other pliocardiin. So far, Austrogena gen. nov. is the only endemic vesicomyid genus in the south-eastern Pacific area and A. nerudai sp. nov. is the fourth species of vesicomyids reported from chemosynthetic communities of the Chilean margin. The description of the new genus further contributes to knowledge of biodiversity of chemosymbiotic assemblages in the south-eastern Pacific. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:476A9734-B510-4954-A623-2C0E1F254F9A.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3abiodiversity 3adigestive system 3anew genus 3anew species 3aoxygen 3asediments 3avulva 3aChile 0aChilean Margin 0aCOI 0amorphology 0anew species 0aOMZ 0aPliocardiinae reducing environment1 aSellanes, Javier1 aValdes, Francisco,1 aD’Elía, Guillermo0 tSystematics and biodiversity.g2014 Apr. 3, v. 12, no. 2 p.225-246dTaylor & Francisx1478-09337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14772000.2014.9001333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015900171500001900330520115300349592002801502650002001530650001701550650002501567650001601592650001601608650001101624650001001635650001501645650001101660650002601671653001601697653001901713653001001732700001901742700001801761700001601779700001801795700002201813700001701835700001901852773010901871856008601980852000902066655001202075IND60697849820221122020821.0201104e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069784982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1095042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Rui-Xing10aAssessing the functional role of color-related CaMYB gene under cold stress using virus-induced gene silencing in the fruit of pepper (Capsicum annuum L.)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAnthocyanin as secondary metabolites exits wildly in the plant kingdom, and its accumulation is regulated by transcription factors. However, little is known about role of CaMYB in fruit color of pepper. In this study, a purple-fruited pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) was selected and observed at 8 different stages (Z1−1–Z1−8) during fruit ripening (18, 23, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, and 55 days after flowering). The results showed that higher accumulation of anthocyanin content was observed at 3 different stages (Z1−1– Z1−3) of fruit ripening and decreased in the following stage during fruit ripening, which primarily reflected in change of fruit color (from purple to yellow, and then to red). Expression of genes, especially CaMYB, in the biosynthetic pathway of anthocyanin was responsible for fruit color at 3 different stages (Z1−1– Z1−3) of fruit ripening. Further analysis showed that silencing of CaMYB resulted in poor accumulation of anthocyanin, suggesting the positive role of CaMYB in the metabolism of anthocyanin in pepper fruit. Our study will provide a basic insight for anthocyanin synthesis in fruit color formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3aanthocyanins 3abiochemical pathways 3acold stress 3afruit color 3afruits 3agenes 3ametabolism 3apepper 3asecondary metabolites 0aAnthocyanin 0aGene silencing 0aCaMYB1 aCheng, Guo-Xin1 aLiu, Gui-Ting1 aChen, Si-Yu1 aHaq, Saeed ul1 aK̲h̲ān, Ābid,1 aLi, Quan-Hui1 aGong, Zhen-Hui0 tScientia horticulturae.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 272 p.109504-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1095043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04049naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245016700166300001600333500001900349520222100368592002802589596009102617596009102708596007302799596007302872596007502945650002003020650002603040650002803066650003003094650001503124650001503139650001403154650001003168650000903178700001903187700001703206700001503223700001303238700001403251700001803265700001603283700001803299700001303317773012203330856008203452852000903534655001203543IND60712443020221120223259.0201009e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071244302DNAL7 a10.1007/s12088-020-00885-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Guangli10aComparison Between the Gut Microbiota in Different Gastrointestinal Segments of Large-Tailed Han and Small-Tailed Han Sheep Breeds with High-Throughput Sequencing  ap. 436-450.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCommensal microorganisms are essential to the normal development and function of many aspects of animal biology. However, the dynamic shift patterns of the microbiota of different gut segments in sheep and the correlation between fat type large-tailed phenotype and microbiota remain poorly unknown. This study therefore sought to assess the composition and distribution of the intestinal microbiome, and compared the difference of gut microbiota from different gastrointestinal segments within breeds and same intestinal sections between breeds. For these analyses, 16S rRNA V4 regions from 4 gut sections prepared from each of six individuals (3 from each breed) were sequenced to detect the microbiome composition in these samples. These analyses revealed the presence of 51,173 operational taxonomic units distributed across 24 phyla and 420 genera in these samples, with Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes being the most prevalent phyla of microbes present in these samples. Moreover, the bacterial composition showed distinct microbial communities in different gastrointestinal segments within breed, but showed similar and relative fixed bacterial abundance in the same intestinal segments from individuals of different breeds. We also found that only a few bacterial species (Lachnospiraceae, Akkermansia) were needed to distinguish between Small-tailed Han sheep (STH) and Large-tailed Han sheep (LTH) and their metabolic process maybe influence the fat type large-tailed phenotype formation in sheep. The functional profile analysis revealed that the environment information processing, genetic information processing, and metabolic pathways were enriched in all samples. The main functional roles of the gut microbiota were amino acid metabolism, replication and repair, carbohydrate metabolism, and membrane transport. Finally, our findings suggested that distinguished gut species between STH and LTH have relative fixed and the potential correlation is existing between the intestinal microorganisms and the large-tailed phenotype trait formation of sheep, which may offer clues for further investigation to detect the roles of intestinal microbiota in the metabolism and fat deposition in the tail of sheep.  aPublisher supplied data  a102300410143cHe’nan Research Program of Foundation and Advanced Technology of China  a132300410398cHe’nan Research Program of Foundation and Advanced Technology of China  a12B230011cthe Foundation of He’nan Educational Committee of China  a14B230017cthe Foundation of He’nan Educational Committee of China  a182107000041cScience and Technology Department of Henan Province (CN) 3aLachnospiraceae 3aamino acid metabolism 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3amicrobiome 3aphenotype 3asheep 3atail1 aZhang, Shuhong1 aLi, Zhiqiang1 aHuang, Jie1 aLiu, Yan1 aLiu, Ying1 aWang, Qiankun1 aLi, Xiangyu1 aYan, Yongfeng1 aLi, Ming0 tIndian journal of microbiology.g2020 Dec., v. 60, no. 4 p.436-450dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl14369x0046-89917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12088-020-00885-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03495naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245016300170300001400333520166600347592002802013650002802041650001502069650001202084650001902096650002802115650002502143650001702168650002302185650001502208650002202223650002302245650001202268650001502280650001302295650001102308650002102319650001102340650001502351650001902366650002502385651001002410653002802420653001902448653002302467653001402490653003702504653000802541700001602549700001802565700001602583700001902599700001802618700001702636700001602653773010402669856008702773852000902860655001202869IND60531544020221118002241.0170713e20160701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053154402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Haijun10aEvaluating management tradeoffs between economic fiber production and other ecosystem services in a Chinese-fir dominated forest plantation in Fujian Province  ap. 80-90.  aChinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) is not only a valuable timber species, but also plays an important role in the provision of ecosystem services. Forest management decisions to increase the production of fiber for economic gain may have negative impacts on the long-term flow of ecosystem services from forest resources. Such tradeoffs should be taken into account to fulfill the requirements of sustainable forest management. Here we employed an established, ecosystem-based, stand-level model (FORECAST) in combination with a simplified harvest-scheduling model to evaluate the potential tradeoffs among indicators of provisional, regulating and supporting ecosystem services in a Chinese-fir-dominated landscape located in Fujian Province as a case study. Indicators included: merchantable volume harvested, biomass harvested, ecosystem carbon storage, CO2 fixation, O2 released, biomass nitrogen content, pollutant absorption, and soil fertility. A series of alternative management scenarios, representing different combinations of rotation length and harvest intensity, were simulated to facilitate the analysis. Results from the analysis were summarized in the form of a decision matrix designed to provide a method for forest managers to evaluate management alternatives and tradeoffs in the context of key indicators of ecosystem services. The scenario analysis suggests that there are considerable tradeoffs in terms of ecosystem services associated with stand and landscape-level management decisions. Longer rotations and increased retention tended to favor regulating and supporting services while the opposite was true for provisional services.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCunninghamia lanceolata 3aabsorption 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3acarbon sequestration 3acase studies 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aforest management 3aforest plantations 3aforests 3alandscapes 3amanagers 3amodels 3anitrogen content 3aoxygen 3apollutants 3asoil fertility 3asustainable forestry 3aChina 0aCunninghamia lanceolata 0aEconomic value 0aEcosystem services 0aTradeoffs 0aAlternative management scenarios 0aLST1 aSeely, Brad1 aWang, Guangyu1 aInnes, John1 aZheng, Dexiang1 aChen, Pingliu1 aWang, Tongli1 aLi, Qinglin0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 July 01, v. 557-558 p.80-90dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04362naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006100144245010500205300002000310520178000330592002802110596010102138596011302239596008002352596012402432596009502556596009002651650001202741650001702753650001402770650001302784650001502797650001902812650002202831650001902853650002802872650002302900650001902923650001302942653002602955653002302981653003103004653002003035653002303055700001803078700002403096700001903120700002303139700005803162700002403220700002003244700006103264700006503325700006103390700005503451773014203506856007903648852000903727655001203736IND60772667320221119085250.0220407e20220328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077266732DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c228692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFanni, Adeline M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7240-279210aControlled and Selective Photo-oxidation of Amyloid-β Fibrils by Oligomeric p-Phenylene Ethynylenes  ap. 14871-14886.  aPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) has been explored as a therapeutic strategy to clear toxic amyloid aggregates involved in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. A major limitation of PDT is off-target oxidation, which can be lethal for the surrounding cells. We have shown that a novel class of oligo-p-phenylene ethynylenes (OPEs) exhibit selective binding and fluorescence turn-on in the presence of prefibrillar and fibrillar aggregates of disease-relevant proteins such as amyloid-β (Aβ) and α-synuclein. Concomitant with fluorescence turn-on, OPE also photosensitizes singlet oxygen under illumination through the generation of a triplet state, pointing to the potential application of OPEs as photosensitizers in PDT. Herein, we investigated the photosensitizing activity of an anionic OPE for the photo-oxidation of Aβ fibrils and compared its efficacy to the well-known but nonselective photosensitizer methylene blue (MB). Our results show that, while MB photo-oxidized both monomeric and fibrillar conformers of Aβ40, OPE oxidized only Aβ40 fibrils, targeting two histidine residues on the fibril surface and a methionine residue located in the fibril core. Oxidized fibrils were shorter and more dispersed but retained the characteristic β-sheet rich fibrillar structure and the ability to seed further fibril growth. Importantly, the oxidized fibrils displayed low toxicity. We have thus discovered a class of novel theranostics for the simultaneous detection and oxidization of amyloid aggregates. Importantly, the selectivity of OPE’s photosensitizing activity overcomes the limitation of off-target oxidation of traditional photosensitizers and represents an advancement of PDT as a viable strategy to treat neurodegenerative disorders.  aPublisher supplied data  a5R25GM075149cNational Institute of General Medical Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000057  a1R21NS111267-01cNational Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000065  a1207362cDivision of Materials Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000078  a1605225cDivision of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systemsdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000146  a1560058cDivision of Engineering Education and Centersdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000149  aHDTRA1-08-1-0053cDefense Threat Reduction Agencydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000774 3aamyloid 3afluorescence 3ahistidine 3alighting 3amethionine 3amethylene blue 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotooxidation 3aphotosensitizing agents 3aprecision medicine 3asinglet oxygen 3atoxicity 0aAlzheimer’s disease 0aamyloid aggregates 0aoligo-p-phenylene ethylene 0aphoto-oxidation 0afibril disassembly1 aOkoye, Daniel1 aMonge, Florencia A.1 aHammond, Julia1 aMaghsoodi, Fahimeh1 aMartin, Tye D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0987-06061 aBrinkley, Gabriella1 aPhipps, M.

SARD1 itself is strongly inducible by infection. Here, we investigated the transcriptional control of SARD1. We used yeast one‐hybrid assays to identify WRKY70. The WRKY70 binding site was defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and its importance was investigated using an Arabidopsis thaliana protoplast system. The effect of wrky70 mutations was studied by measurements of pathogen growth, SA concentrations, and gene expression by RNA‐seq. WRKY70 binds to a GACTTTT motif in the SARD1 promoter in yeast and Arabidopsis protoplasts. Plants with wrky70 mutations have elevated expression of SARD1 in the absence of pathogens, but not when infected. Expression profiling revealed that WRKY70 represses many pathogen‐inducible genes in the absence of pathogens, yet is required for activation of many other pathogen‐inducible genes in infected plants. The GACTTTT motif is enriched in the promoters of both these gene sets, and conserved in SARD1 orthologs within the Brassicaceae. WRKY70 represses SARD1 by binding the motif GACTTTT in the absence of pathogens. Conservation of the WRKY70 binding among the Brassicaceae suggests that WRKY70 repression of SARD1 is important for fitness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3abinding sites 3agel electrophoresis 3agene expression 3agenes 3aimmunity 3amutation 3apathogens 3aprotoplasts 3asalicylic acid 3asequence analysis 3atranscription (genetics) 3ayeasts1 aLu, You1 aBethke, Gerit1 aHarrison, Brian T.1 aHatsugai, Noriyuki1 aKatagiri, Fumiaki1 aGlazebrook, Jane0 tnew phytologist.g2018 Jan., v. 217, no. 2 p.700-712dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.148463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03586naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245011900166500002000285520234000305592002802645650002502673650002202698650001802720650001002738650003502748650002302783650002602806650001402832650001402846650001902860650001302879700002602892700001902918700002302937773015302960856007803113852000903191655001203200IND60602086220221121063211.0180709e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060208622DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2018001032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParadiso, Vito M.10aEverything Should Be as Simple as It Can Be. But Not Simpler. Does Food Lipid Oxidation Require an Omics Approach?  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLipid oxidation remains a major challenge for the food industry and for researchers. Current methods and knowledge often fail to adequately represent what is consistently observed in real systems. Practical experience strongly suggests the need for new paradigms to fully comprehend lipid oxidation. This viewpoint article aims to mention some critical aspects of current approaches in evaluating lipid oxidation in food systems, and to search for new epistemological and therefore experimental approaches by adopting an interdisciplinary perspective. Herein, suggestions are formulated for a holistic perspective by combining elements ranging from philology to community ecology and systems biology. Lipids undergoing oxidation are compared to ecological communities and living systems, to be considered as a whole, whose patterns change with space and time. As omics is an inductive, hypothesis‐generating, circular approach, involving multiparametric analysis, data integration/fusion, and multivariate statistical analysis (both supervised and unsupervised), it could thus provide a useful contribution to better understanding of oxidation and antioxidation processes, enabling laboratory results to be matched with what is observed in real complex foods. Practical applications: There is still a large gap between the wealth of natural compounds with antioxidant activity and the availability of natural products able to prevent rancidity in food products. Moreover, healthy, highly unsaturated fatty acids still require appropriate methods to monitor oxidative spoilage. Dispersed systems and multidomain foods pose new daily challenges regarding oxidation assessment and control. These are critical issues in the food industry, indicating the need to identify a new approach to lipid oxidation in food systems, and this viewpoint article is a contribution to the ongoing debate. A new epistemological paradigm for lipid oxidation in food systems. It consists of the reiteration of hypothesis‐generating studies (oxidomics), requiring multiparametric, comprehensive profiling of the oxidation patterns (oxidome) and their changes. The outcome is a progressive improvement in the knowledge of complex systems and the selection of appropriate predisposition, prognostic and diagnostic marker patterns for the oxidation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3acommunity ecology 3afood industry 3afoods 3ahighly unsaturated fatty acids 3alipid peroxidation 3amultivariate analysis 3aoxidation 3arancidity 3aspace and time 3aspoilage1 aPasqualone, Antonella1 aSummo, Carmine1 aCaponio, Francesco0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2018 July, v. 120, no. 7 p.e1800103-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3921629x1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.2018001033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014400162300001600306520189100322592002802213650001502241650001402256650001002270650002202280650001802302650001202320650001902332650000902351700001402360773009002374856008102464852000902545655001202554IND60437406220221117060509.0151022e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043740622DNAL7 a10.1007/s00040-015-0419-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRömer, D.10aAvailable space, symbiotic fungus and colony brood influence excavation and lead to the adjustment of nest enlargement in leaf-cutting ants  ap. 401-413.  aThe size of underground ant nests positively correlates with their worker number, suggesting that during colony growth, workers respond to increased space demands by enlarging the existing nest. In leaf-cutting ants, the presence of brood and a growing symbiotic fungus are expected to generate spatial demands workers should respond to. We investigated to what extent the presence of in-nest stores, such as brood and fungus, and actual space availability influence the digging behavior of leaf-cutting ants and lead to the adjustment of nest enlargement. In the laboratory, we offered worker groups of Acromyrmex lundi a nest site consisting of either a tunnel, representing reduced available space, or a tunnel and a small chamber, representing ample available space as a starting point for nest enlargement. Workers could move and store offered brood and fungus into the nest structure, and enlarge it as needed. The presence of brood and fungus influenced digging activity as well as the architecture of the nest. In the presence of relocated brood, digging activity was higher in reduced space than in ample space, suggesting that high worker density stimulated excavation. When workers relocated fungus and brood into ample space, digging activity was similar as in their absence, yet a larger chamber and fewer tunnels were excavated. During the process of nest enlargement, workers were observed to initially excavate space in excess, which was refilled with part of the removed soil pellets, thus leading to a reduction of available space. Pellet deposition seemed to be opportunistic, with workers refilling unused space. Results indicate that the size of a leaf-cutting ant nest does not simply depend on the number of inhabiting workers. Rather, workers adjust the enlargement of their nest space depending on the current space available and the presence of in-nest stores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcromyrmex 3aant nests 3afungi 3aleaf-cutting ants 3anesting sites 3apellets 3asocial insects 3asoil1 aRoces, F.0 tInsectes sociaux.g2015 Nov., v. 62, no. 4 p.401-413dSpringer Baselx0020-18127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00040-015-0419-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03882naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001800149245016900167300001800336500001500354520237700369592002802746650002002774650001902794650001802813650002302831650002402854650001602878650001902894650002602913650002102939650001302960650001902973650001502992650001703007650002103024650001103045650001503056650002003071651001003091653001103101700001703112700001803129700001603147700001803163773010103181856008503282852000903367655001203376IND4459919220221118234428.0141112e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445991922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2011.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCreamer, C.A.10aControls on soil carbon accumulation during woody plant encroachment: Evidence from physical fractionation, soil respiration, and Î´Â¹Â³C of respired COâ  ap. 1678-1687.  a2019-12-06  aWoody plant encroachment into grasslands and savannas is a globally extensive land-cover change that alters biogeochemical processes and frequently results in soil organic carbon (SOC) accrual. We used soil physical fractionation, soil respiration kinetics, and the isotopic composition of soil respiration to investigate microbial degradation of accrued SOC in sandy loam soils along a chronosequence of Câwoody plant encroachment into a Câ-dominated grassland in southern Texas. Our previous work in this system demonstrated significant changes in the chemistry and abundance of lignin and aliphatic biopolymers within particulate soil fractions during the first 40Â yrs of woody plant encroachment, indicating selective accrual of purportedly more recalcitrant plant chemicals. However, during the long-term soil laboratory incubation presented herein, a greater proportion of SOC was mineralized in soils from older woody stands (34â86Â yrs) than in soils from younger woody stands (14â23Â yrs) and grasslands, providing no evidence for greater biochemical recalcitrance as a controlling mechanism for SOC accrual. In addition, Î´Â¹Â³C values of respired COâ indicate that the mineralized SOC was predominately of Câ origin from all woody stands along the chronosequence, and that respired COâ was primarily derived from the free light fraction (density <1.0Â g/cmÂ³) and macroaggregate-sized soil fraction. Our data suggested that the location of SOC among soil fractions was more important than plant polymer chemistry in determining SOC turnover rates during incubation. Surprisingly, estimates of the size and turnover rate of the active SOC pool based on respiratory kinetics did not increase with woody encroachment, and the turnover rate of the slower SOC pool decreased, again supporting the notion that increases in biochemically recalcitrant biopolymers did not hinder decomposition in the lab. These data indicate environmental conditions that may allow for C accrual in the field were alleviated during the controlled incubation. Therefore, C accrual in these sandy loam soils following woody encroachment should not be assumed stable, and this factor should be taken into account when considering responses of SOC to climate change or when making management decisions regarding land cover impacts on SOC.  aPublisher supplied data 3achronosequences 3acarbon dioxide 3afractionation 3aplant biochemistry 3asoil organic carbon 3abiopolymers 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental factors 3asoil respiration 3asavannas 3abiodegradation 3aland cover 3awoody plants 3asandy loam soils 3alignin 3agrasslands 3adecision making 3aTexas 0acarbon1 aFilley, T.R.1 aBoutton, T.W.1 aOleynik, S.1 aKantola, I.B.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2011 Aug., v. 43, no. 8 p.1678-1687dElsevier Ltdx0038-07177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2011.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245012500167300001800292520128900310592002801599650002201627650001501649650001101664650000901675650001301684650001001697650001301707651001501720700002301735700002601758773012101784852000901905856008201914655001201996IND4427143220221118225442.0200905e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442714322DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-009-1277-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Aileen K.10aFlexible foraging strategies of gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua over 5 years in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica  ap. 2527-2537.  aGentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua show considerable plasticity in their diet, diving, and foraging behaviors among colonies; we expected that they might exhibit similar variability over time, at a single site, since flexible foraging habits would provide a buffer against changes in prey availability. We examined interannual changes in the foraging strategies and diet of gentoo penguins in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, over 5 years with variable prey abundance. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the primary diet item, and fish the secondary, though the importance of these items varied among years. Diving behavior also varied over time: different dive depth distributions were observed among years. Nonetheless, chick-rearing success remained relatively constant, indicating that gentoo penguins were able to maintain chick provisioning by altering their foraging strategy among years. Variable abundance of krill in the region did not have observable impacts on the diet, foraging behaviors or chick-rearing success of gentoo penguins. We suggest that foraging plasticity may be one reason that gentoo penguin populations have remained stable in the region, while their congeners (P. antarctica and P. adeliae) with less flexible foraging strategies have declined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuphausia superba 3aPygoscelis 3achicks 3adiet 3aforaging 3akrill 3apenguins 3aAntarctica1 aKarnovsky, Nina J.1 aTrivelpiece, Wayne Z.0 tMarine biology.g2009 Nov., v. 156, no. 12 p.2527-2537dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-009-1277-z3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01895naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007600164520075500240592002800995650002401023650002501047650001801072650001801090650001101108650004401119653003001163653001301193653002801206700001701234700001601251700001701267700001401284700001401298773011801312856008201430852000901512655001201521IND60697850320221119213440.0200614e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069785032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2020.1040802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lingsong10aChemical constituents from the leaves of Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb.)

However, its microbiological diversity remains unclear. Based on the clone library and quantitative PCR techniques, the bacterial flora and mycobiota of 3 different samples (larva, stromata/sclerotia, and surface soil) from natural O.sinensis specimens were investigated using primer sets that targeted the 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA. The results showed that the abundance of bacterial and fungal communities in the soil attached to the surface of O.sinensis was (6.4 ± 1.4) × 10⁶ and (6.0 ± 0.3) × 10⁷ copies/g dry matter, respectively, which was the highest compared with that in the larva and stromal samples. The main groups of bacteria in the O.sinensis samples were Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, while Ascomycota was the most dominant fungal group in the 3 samples. At the genus level, Geomyces, Phoma, and Trichocladium were the dominant genera in the larval sample, while Geomyces and Cladosporium were the dominant genera in the stromal sample. In conclusion, a great number of bacterial and fungal species were present in naturally occurring O.sinensis specimens, and there was a high diversity of bacterial and fungal communities. These findings contribute to the understanding of the bacterial and fungal community structure of this valuable medicinal fungus and lay the foundation for the future discovery of new medicinal microorganism resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aCladosporium 3aDNA primers 3aGeomyces 3aOphiocordyceps sinensis 3aPhoma 3aProteobacteria 3abacteria 3acommunity structure 3afruiting bodies 3afungal communities 3agenes 3ainsect larvae 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amedicinal fungi 3amycobiota 3aparasitism 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3asclerotia 3asoil 3asoil fungi 3atranscription (genetics) 0aOphiocordyceps sinensis 0a16S rRNA gene 0aITS region 0amicroorganism 0acommunity1 aLiu, Yan1 aShen, Guang-Rong1 aGuo, Lian-Xian1 aZhou, Xuan-Wei0 tCanadian journal of microbiology.g2014 Nov. 3, v. 61, no. 2 p.104-111dNRC Research Pressx1480-32757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2014-06103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245009000167300001800257520161700275592002801892650001701920650002801937650001101965650001101976650001301987650002202000650002402022650001802046650001302064651001902077700001902096700002402115773012102139852000902260856008202269655001202351IND4427143320221118225357.0200905e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442714332DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-009-1278-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLetessier, Tom B.10aDrivers of euphausiid species abundance and numerical abundance in the Atlantic Ocean  ap. 2539-2553.  aMid-ocean ridges are common features of the world’s oceans but there is a lack of understanding as to how their presence affects overlying pelagic biota. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) is a dominant feature of the Atlantic Ocean. Here, we examined data on euphausiid distribution and abundance arising from several international research programmes and from the continuous plankton recorder. We used a generalized additive model (GAM) framework to explore spatial patterns of variability in euphausiid distribution on, and at either side of, the MAR from 60°N to 55°S in conjunction with variability in a suite of biological, physical and environmental parameters. Euphausiid species abundance peaked in mid-latitudes and was significantly higher on the ridge than in adjacent waters, but the ridge did not influence numerical abundance significantly. Sea surface temperature (SST) was the most important single factor influencing both euphausiid numerical abundance and species abundance. Increases in sea surface height variance, a proxy for mixing, increased the numerical abundance of euphausiids. GAM predictions of variability in species abundance as a function of SST and depth of the mixed layer were consistent with present theories, which suggest that pelagic niche availability is related to the thermal structure of the near surface water: more deeply-mixed water contained higher euphausiid biodiversity. In addition to exposing present distributional patterns, the GAM framework enables responses to potential future and past environmental variability including temperature change to be explored.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuphausiacea 3ainterspecific variation 3amodels 3aoceans 3aplankton 3aresearch programs 3asurface temperature 3asurface water 3avariance 3aAtlantic Ocean1 aCox, Martin J.1 aBrierley, Andrew S.0 tMarine biology.g2009 Nov., v. 156, no. 12 p.2539-2553dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-009-1278-y3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03592naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245009700165300001800262520219800280592002802478650001502506650001902521650001202540650002102552650002202573650001502595650001402610650001102624650001202635650002002647650001902667650002402686650001502710653001102725653001102736653002002747653002702767653003202794700001502826700002002841700001902861773015402880856007903034852000903113655001203122IND60531874520221116173213.0190318e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053187452DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2015-106072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpoliansky, Roii10aDevelopment of automatic body condition scoring using a low-cost 3-dimensional Kinect camera  ap. 7714-7725.  aBody condition scoring (BCS) is a farm-management tool for estimating dairy cows’ energy reserves. Today, BCS is performed manually by experts. This paper presents a 3-dimensional algorithm that provides a topographical understanding of the cow’s body to estimate BCS. An automatic BCS system consisting of a Kinect camera (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) triggered by a passive infrared motion detector was designed and implemented. Image processing and regression algorithms were developed and included the following steps: (1) image restoration, the removal of noise; (2) object recognition and separation, identification and separation of the cows; (3) movie and image selection, selection of movies and frames that include the relevant data; (4) image rotation, alignment of the cow parallel to the x-axis; and (5) image cropping and normalization, removal of irrelevant data, setting the image size to 150×200 pixels, and normalizing image values. All steps were performed automatically, including image selection and classification. Fourteen individual features per cow, derived from the cows’ topography, were automatically extracted from the movies and from the farm’s herd-management records. These features appear to be measurable in a commercial farm. Manual BCS was performed by a trained expert and compared with the output of the training set. A regression model was developed, correlating the features with the manual BCS references. Data were acquired for 4 d, resulting in a database of 422 movies of 101 cows. Movies containing cows’ back ends were automatically selected (389 movies). The data were divided into a training set of 81 cows and a test set of 20 cows; both sets included the identical full range of BCS classes. Accuracy tests gave a mean absolute error of 0.26, median absolute error of 0.19, and coefficient of determination of 0.75, with 100% correct classification within 1 step and 91% correct classification within a half step for BCS classes. Results indicated good repeatability, with all standard deviations under 0.33. The algorithm is independent of the background and requires 10 cows for training with approximately 30 movies of 4 s each.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abody condition 3acameras 3acommercial farms 3acomputer software 3adairy cows 3adatabases 3aenergy 3aexperts 3afarm management 3aimage analysis 3aregression analysis 3atopography 0asensor 0acattle 0acomputer vision 0abody condition scoring 0aprecision livestock farming1 aEdan, Yael1 aParmet, Yisrael1 aHalachmi, Ilan0 tJournal of dairy science.g2016 Sept., v. 99, no. 9 p.7714-7725dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-106073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03740naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245010800163300001800271520207300289592002802362650002702390650001302417650002302430650001102453650001802464650001402482650001002496650001302506650002002519650001102539650001802550650002602568650001802594650001202612650001002624650001302634650001002647650002602657650001102683650001702694650001302711650001302724650002302737700001802760700002402778700001602802700002802818700002402846700002402870700002102894700002302915773012102938852000903059856008203068655001203150IND4427143520221118225513.0200905e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442714352DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-009-1281-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavarro, Joan10aSeasonal changes in the diet of a critically endangered seabird and the importance of trawling discards  ap. 2571-2578.  aPelagic seabirds obtain food from oceans where the availability of their prey changes rapidly both seasonally and spatially. Here, we investigated changes in the trophic habits of the critically endangered Balearic shearwater (Puffinus mauretanicus) through the breeding season and tested for dietary differences between sexes and age classes. We analysed δ¹⁵N and δ¹³C values in blood of adults during the pre-incubation, incubation and chick-rearing periods and of their chicks. Using a two-isotope mixing model, we estimated dietary contributions based on isotope values from potential prey species which included small pelagic species available naturally and demersal fish species available only from trawling discards. Balearic shearwaters showed clear isotopic and dietary variation through the breeding season. During pre-incubation, breeding adults appeared to exploit demersal fish, whereas during the incubation and chick-rearing period, they fed mainly on pelagic anchovies (Engraulis encrasicolus) and pilchards (Sardina pilchardus). Similarly, chicks were fed mainly with anchovies, a resource with a high energetic value. This variation in the dietary habits of adult shearwaters during the breeding season was probably related to both natural and fishery-induced seasonal changes in the availability of potential prey species within their main feeding grounds. However, changes in the nutritional requirements of the shearwaters could also play an important role. Indeed, diet differed between sexes during pre-incubation: females fed less on trawling discards and more on small pelagic fish than males. This sexual segregation in diet could be the consequence of higher nutritional requirements of females during this period. Our study reveals the differential importance of both trawling discards and small pelagic fish species for a pelagic seabird depending on the breeding period and illustrates the importance of considering the entire breeding season when making inferences about the importance of specific prey in seabird dietary studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEngraulis encrasicolus 3aPuffinus 3aSardina pilchardus 3aadults 3aage structure 3aanchovies 3ablood 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3achicks 3ademersal fish 3adiet study techniques 3aeating habits 3afemales 3afoods 3aisotopes 3amales 3anutrient requirements 3aoceans 3apelagic fish 3asardines 3aseabirds 3aseasonal variation1 aLouzao, Maite1 aIgual, José Manuel1 aOro, Daniel1 aDelgado, A.q(Antonio),1 aArcos, José Manuel1 aGenovart, Meritxell1 aHobson, Keith A.1 aForero, Manuela G.0 tMarine biology.g2009 Nov., v. 156, no. 12 p.2571-2578dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-009-1281-33Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02638naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245016900162300001600331520135100347592002801698650002301726650001801749650002801767650002201795650001801817650001101835650002201846650002101868650001901889650002001908650002101928650001901949650001201968700001601980700001501996700001702011773011002028856008102138852000902219655001202228IND60574053720221120062045.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057405372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-016-3001-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKohler, J.10aUnraveling the role of hyphal networks from arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in aggregate stabilization of semiarid soils with different textures and carbonate contents  ap. 273-281.  aAIMS: Our study was intended to elucidate the involvement of three species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the formation and stabilization of aggregates in semiarid soils with different textures and calcium carbonate contents. METHODS: We used a root-hyphae compartment approach to compare the effect of three AMF (Rhizophagus irregularis, Septoglomus deserticola, and Gigaspora gigantea) on the structural stability of the hyphosphere (root-free hyphae) and mycorrhizosphere (hyphae + root) soil of Olea europaea plants grown in two soils differing in their texture (sandy loam and silty loam) and calcium carbonate content. RESULTS: Only the R. irregularis strain significantly increased the percentage of stable aggregates in both types of soil, being the increases higher in the hyphosphere compartment (on average, about 30 % compared to non-inoculated soil). In the hyphosphere compartment of both soils, the hyphal length developed by plants inoculated with R. irregularis was 81 % greater than that of non-inoculated plants. The effect of the AMF on soil aggregation was mediated by mechanical entanglement of mycorrhizal fungal hyphae but without a contribution of labile carbohydrates. CONCLUSION: The ability of extraradical hyphae to improve soil structure was independent of the soil texture and content of carbonates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGigaspora gigantea 3aOlea europaea 3aRhizophagus irregularis 3acalcium carbonate 3acarbohydrates 3ahyphae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3asandy loam soils 3asemiarid soils 3asilt loam soils 3asoil aggregation 3asoil structure 3atexture1 aRoldán, A.1 aCampoy, M.1 aCaravaca, F.0 tPlant and soil.g2017 Jan., v. 410, no. 1-2 p.273-281dSpringer International Publishingx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-016-3001-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03663naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100001800188245015000206300001200356506007600368520226400444592002802708506003702736650001402773650002502787650001302812650001802825650001502843650001202858650000902870650001302879650000902892650002502901700001702926700002102943700002002964700002302984773013103007856008203138852000903220655001203229IND60548509120221207071115.0220927e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054850912DNAL7 aPMC48045422pmcid7 a270045522pmid7 a10.1186/s12906-016-1084-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAirosa, Fanny10aCaring touch as a bodily anchor for patients after sustaining a motor vehicle accident with minor or no physical injuries - a mixed methods study  ap. 106.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Patients who sustain a motor vehicle accident may experience long-term distress, even if they are uninjured or only slightly injured. There is a risk of neglecting patients with minor or no physical injuries, which might impact future health problems. The aim of this study was to explore patients’ subjective experiences and perspectives on pain and other factors of importance after an early nursing intervention consisting of “caring touch” (tactile massage and healing touch) for patients subjected to a motor vehicle accident with minor or no physical injuries. METHODS: A mixed method approach was used. The qualitative outcomes were themes derived from individual interviews. The quantitative outcomes were measured by visual analogue scale for pain (VAS, 0-100), sense of coherence (SOC), post-traumatic stress (IES-R) and health status (EQ-5D index and EQ-5D self-rated health). Forty-one patients of in total 124 eligible patients accepted the invitation to participate in the study. Twenty-seven patients completed follow-up after 6 months whereby they had received up to eight treatments with either tactile massage or healing touch. RESULTS: Patients reported that caring touch may assist in trauma recovery by functioning as a physical “anchor” on the patient’s way of suffering, facilitating the transition of patients from feeling as though their body is “turned off” to becoming “awake”. By caring touch the patients enjoyed a compassionate care and experience moments of pain alleviation. The VAS pain ratings significantly decreased both immediately after the caring touch treatment sessions and over the follow-up period. The median scores for VAS (p < 0.001) and IES-R (p 0.002) had decreased 6 months after the accident whereas the EQ-5D index had increased (p < 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences of the SOC or EQ-5D self-rated health scores over time. CONCLUSIONS: In the care of patients suffering from a MVA with minor or no physical injuries, a caring touch intervention is associated with patients’ report of decreased pain and improved wellbeing up to 6 months after the accident.

The associated complications can potentially affect multiple systems throughout the body, including eyes, ears, skin and nervous system. Although the pathogenesis of VKH syndrome remains unclear, it has been established that the various genetic factors, epigenetic factors and the imbalance in immune regulation can significantly contribute to the development of this disease. In addition, the experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) has been commonly used to further explore the pathogenesis of the disease. Herein, in this review article, we discuss about the major research advances made in understanding of the different epigenetic factors and gut microbes involved in the pathogenesis of VKH syndrome as well as EAU.

This study reports a series of cases obtained from a retrospective analysis of traumatic FARs occurring in motorcycle drivers, with the aim of defining the injury patterns and correlating them with the mechanisms of FAR production.Circumstantial, autopsy and histology data were collected through a retrospective analysis of post mortem examinations performed at the Institute of Legal Medicine of the University of Padova between 2014 and 2016. Among 151 traffic related victims, 8 were motorcycle drivers and displayed traumatic FAR and were thus included in the study.In 7 cases, the presence of abdominal/thoracic injuries suggested that the external compression due to the accident was at least a concurrent cause of FAR, being the predominant mechanism of aortic injury in 4 cases, through the “osseous pinch” or the “waterhammer effect” mechanisms. Our study highlights the well-known role of “preventative forensic pathology”, which has become routinary in traffic medicine since many years, also for defining the points of impact and the injury patterns of motorcyclists sustaining traumatic FAR, thereby facilitating the development of new prevention strategies and devices. Further studies, however, are needed in order to widen the investigated population and to estimate the real number of victims for which traumatic FAR might hypothetically be prevented with specific countermeasures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3aetiology 3aforensic sciences 3ahistology 3amedicine 3amotorcycles 3anecropsy 3aretrospective studies 3atraffic 3aItaly 0aPreventative forensic pathology 0aMotorcycle accidents 0aBlunt trauma 0aFatal aortic rupture 0aInjury pattern 0aCountermeasures1 aCecchetto, Giovanni1 aViero, Alessia1 aDe Matteis, Maria1 aViel, Guido1 aMontisci, Massimo0 tForensic science international.g2017 Dec., v. 281 p.121-126dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.10.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02460naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245013700162300001500299520123800314592002801552650001001580650002201590650001201612650001401624650002801638650003501666650001501701650001201716651000901728653001801737653002801755653002201783653000901805700001801814700001801832773012301850856008001973852000902053655001202062IND60573133920180620000000.0180620e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057313392DNAL7 a10.1515/cerce-2017-00182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlizadeh, M.10aGeographic Information System (GIS) as a Tool in the Epidemiological Assessment of Wetwood Disease on Elm Trees in Tabriz City, Iran  ap. 91-100.  aPlants disease epidemiology provides us with some information about the spread of diseases in different regions with various climates and helps us conduct suitable managing operations and predictions about the spread of disease to other areas. Geographic Information System (GIS) has been widely used as an important tool in epidemiological studies. Wetwood disease is one of the most important bacterial diseases on elm trees found in the Northwest of Iran. The disease has spread in different regions of Tabriz (located in the Northwest of Iran), which has become terribly epidemic. Geographic Information System as an appropriate tool in epidemiological examination of plant disease is useful in various ways. In this study, the epidemiology of bacterial wetwood disease on elm trees in Tabriz was investigated using GIS databases. The results indicate that the disease has become epidemic in different areas of Tabriz. According to the results, although the disease was not found in some regions, its severity was very high in some other areas. Based on the distribution map, the wetwood disease most highly exists in the central regions and some parts of the northern regions of the city, but eastern regions are least affected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUlmus 3abacterial wetwood 3aclimate 3adatabases 3aepidemiological studies 3ageographic information systems 3aprediction 3awetwood 3aIran 0aplant disease 0aepidemiological studies 0abacterial wetwood 0aIran1 aMoharrami, M.1 aRasouli, A.A.0 tCercetări agronomice în Moldova.g2017 June 1, v. 50, no. 2 p.91-100dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:6287x2067-18657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/cerce-2017-00183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009900166300001800265520109300283592002801376650004401404650002301448650002201471650001501493650001301508650002401521650001801545650001601563650002101579650003801600700001501638700002001653700001301673700001801686700002001704773010501724856008101829852000901910655001201919IND60119712120221119015525.0150412e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011971212DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-014-8691-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xiang-feng10aTemplate-free preparation of a few-layer graphene nanomesh via a one-step hydrothermal process  ap. 1317-1322.  aGraphene nanomesh was prepared via one-step hydrothermal process in a teflon-lined autoclave. The graphite flakes were used as the raw materials and no templates were adopted during the preparation. Experiment results showed that as the hydrothermal temperature increased, there was an obvious transition in the structure and morphology of the final products. When the temperature was set at 95 °C, the graphite was oxidized to graphite oxide. The structural transition of the sample could be observed at 115 °C, part of the sample was reduced during the hydrothermal treatment. When the temperature reached to 135 or 155 °C, there appeared signals related to graphene; no obvious information about graphene oxide could be detected. Some holes were discovered in the samples. These structural changes were confirmed by X-ray diffraction, thermo-gravimetric analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and laser Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, atomic force microscope and transmission electron microscope revealed the as-prepared graphene was monolayer or few-layer nanomesh.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aautoclaves 3agraphene 3ahot water treatment 3araw materials 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopes1 aZhang, Jie1 aZhuang, Ya-fang1 aLi, Jing1 aHan, Liu-chun1 aXiao, Feng-juan0 tJournal of materials science.g2015 Feb., v. 50, no. 3 p.1317-1322dSpringer-Verlagx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-014-8691-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03468naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245019800164300001800362520185100380592002802231650002202259650001902281650001302300650001002313650001302323650002202336650001402358650001502372650001302387650002702400650001402427650000902441650001202450650001702462650001402479650002202493650001402515650001602529650001202545650001002557651000902567700001802576700002702594700002602621700002902647700002102676700001902697773012002716856008102836852000902917655001202926IND60520745620221119070606.0160522e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052074562DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-016-1180-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaaf, Salar14aThe grain Hardness locus characterized in a diverse wheat panel (Triticum aestivum L.) adapted to the central part of the Fertile Crescent: genetic diversity, haplotype structure, and phylogeny  ap. 1259-1275.  aWheat belongs to the most important crops domesticated in the Fertile Crescent. In this region, fortunately, locally adapted wheat landraces are still present in farmers’ fields. This material might be of immense value for future breeding programs. However, especially wheat germplasm adapted to the central part of the Fertile Crescent has been poorly characterized for allelic variation at key loci of agricultural importance. Grain hardness is an important trait influencing milling and baking quality of wheat. This trait is mainly determined by three tightly linked genes, namely, Puroindoline a (Pina), Puroindoline b (Pinb), and Grain softness protein-1 (Gsp-1), at the Hardness (Ha-D) locus on chromosome 5DS. To investigate genetic diversity and haplotype structure, we resequenced 96 diverse wheat lines at Pina-D1, Pinb-D1, Gsp-A1, Gsp-B1, and Gsp-D1. Three types of null alleles were identified using diagnostic primers: the first type was a multiple deletion of Pina-D1, Pinb-D1, and Gsp-D1 (Pina-D1k), the second was a Pina-D1 deletion (Pina-D1b); and the third type was a deletion of Gsp-D1, representing a novel null allele designated here as Gsp-D1k. Sequence analysis resulted in four allelic variants at Pinb-D1 and five at Gsp-A1, among them Gsp-A1-V was novel. Pina-D1, Gsp-B1 and Gsp-D1 sequences were monomorphic. Haplotype and phylogenetic analysis suggested that (1) bread wheat inherited its 5DS telomeric region probably from wild diploid Ae. tauschii subsp. tauschii found within an area from Transcaucasia to Caspian Iran; and that (2) the Ha-A and Ha-B homoeoloci were most closely related to sequences of wild tetraploid T. dicocco ides. This study provides a good overview of available genetic diversity at Pina-D1, Pinb-D1, and Gsp-1, which can be exploited to extend the range of grain texture traits in wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3abaking quality 3abreeding 3acrops 3adiploidy 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3ahaplotypes 3ahardness 3ainheritance (genetics) 3alandraces 3aloci 3amilling 3anull alleles 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3atelomeres 3atetraploidy 3atexture 3awheat 3aIran1 aSharma, Rajiv1 aBaloch, Faheem Shehzad1 aBadaeva, Ekaterina D.1 aKnüpffer, H.q(Helmut),1 aKilian, Benjamin1 aÖzkan, Hakan,0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2016 June, v. 291, no. 3 p.1259-1275dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-016-1180-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02864naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245004600159300001600205520148500221592002801706650001601734650001401750650001101764650002001775650002301795650002101818650001601839650002001855650001101875650001301886650001901899650002601918650001101944650001101955650001901966650001201985650001001997651001302007653002602020653003902046653001402085700001502099700001502114700001602129773012402145856008002269852000902349655001202358IND60573134120180620000000.0180620e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057313412DNAL7 a10.1515/cerce-2017-00202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManan, A.10aConsumer Demand for Beverages in Pakistan  ap. 109-120.  aThis current research endeavors to study important factors having significant impact on consumer’s choice of beverages in Punjab province of Pakistan. Beverages in two major categories of ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ have been studied to examine consumer consumption pattern. Data has been collected through interview from 80 respondents belonging to two major cities of Punjab, i.e. Lahore and Faisalabad, by incorporating stratified random sampling technique. These two cities of Punjab were selected because of big departmental stores opening like Metro Cash and Carry store, Al-Fateh and others. A pre tested and well-arranged questionnaire was used for data gathering from respondents. To estimate the outcome of factors affecting choices of consumers (demand function), multivariate analysis was incorporated. Results of this research showed that consumption pattern of cold beverages was affected significantly by consumer income, cold beverages prices, city selected for survey and number of adolescents in a family, whereas factors which affected the consumption of hot beverages were food expenditure, living area, marital status, income, working persons in a family, family size. Due to availability of copious brands of beverages, consumption is escalating with the passage of time and consumers are eager to pay but owing to high rates they are not relishing full taste of beverages.

The analysis was achieved with a mobile phase of solvent A (water) : solvent B (acetonitrile) : solvent C (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) = 35 : 45 : 20. The flow rate was 0.30 mL min⁻¹ and total run time was 2.0 minutes. The method was linear over the concentration range of 25–1000 ng mL⁻¹ with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 25 ng mL⁻¹. Inter- and intra-day precisions (RSD%) were all within 10.2% and the accuracy (RE%) was equal to or lower than 9.3%. Recoveries of kaempferide and IS were more than 78.4%. Stability studies showed that kaempferide was stable under a variety of storage conditions. The method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study, involving the intravenous administration of kaempferide to rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3adiazepam 3aintravenous injection 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3aparticle size 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 3asolvents 3astorage conditions 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3awavelengths1 aWang, Xiang-Hong1 aWang, Bo1 aLi, Hong-Wei1 aZhang, Xiao-Lei1 aChʻen, Li-li,1 aJi, Qinghu1 aXu, Jiemei0 tAnalytical methods.g2015 Dec. 7, v. 7, no. 24 p.10238-10242dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ay01789k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245009600169520137200265592002801637650001201665650001601677650002801693650001101721650001501732650001801747650001201765650001701777650002501794650001601819650002501835650001301860653001301873653001201886653002001898653002101918653001901939700001501958700001401973700001801987700001802005773011002023856008802133852000902221655001202230IND60773250020221119070753.0220531e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077325002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.1061752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Kexin10aAnnual variation of the landscape pattern in the Liao River Delta wetland from 1976 to 2020  aThe Liao River Delta wetland is an important breeding base for rare waterbirds in the world. In recent years, with the immense disturbance of human activities, the wetland has degraded. It is a prerequisite for wetland conservation and restoration to accurately extract and monitor changes in wetland area and spatial distribution. Here, based on Landsat time-series images from 1976 to 2020 in the Liao River Delta wetland, we used a synthesized upon object-oriented classification and hierarchical classification method to detect the wetland changes. We analyzed the driving factors of these change. The study found that the total wetland area have reduced by 188.00 km² by human activities during the 45 years, among which the decrease was the most drastic from 2009 to 2012. Natural wetland area have decreased by 414.90 km², with a large reduction in intertidal muds, mainly due to the increase in human activities after the establishment of the city in 1984. Human-made wetland area have increased by 226.90 km², mainly influenced by changes in the transfer of intertidal muds to aquaculture ponds and paddy fields. A significant increase in the area of construction land among non-wetlands, mainly caused by the completion of Panjin New Port in 2009. Human activities were the main factors causing the extravagant changes in the Liao River Delta wetland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aaquaculture 3acoastal zone management 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3alittoral zone 3apaddies 3ariver deltas 3atime series analysis 3awater birds 3awetland conservation 3awetlands 0aWetlands 0aLandsat 0aLand-use change 0aHuman activities 0aRemote sensing1 aCong, Pifu1 aQu, Limei1 aLiang, Shuxiu1 aSun, Zhaochen0 tOcean & coastal management.g2022 June 01, v. 224 p.106175-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.1061753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245012800213300001600341520121300357592002801570650001201598650002201610650002401632650001601656650001601672650002101688650001301709650001301722650001401735650002301749650001201772650001201784650001901796650001501815650000901830650001901839650001501858651001401873700006101887700001901948773014501967856008202112852000902194655001202203IND60748802520221119091448.0210827e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074880252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-021-03280-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScherger, Leonardo E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8361-631510aImpact of Urea and Ammoniacal Nitrogen Wastewaters on Soil: Field Study in a Fertilizer Industry (Bahía Blanca, Argentina)  ap. 565-573.  aNitrogen compounds in industrial effluents are considered a serious threat to the environment. The aim of this work is to identify the effect produced by nitrogen-rich wastewater on alkaline soils from industrial land. Two plots were irrigated with wastewater as ammoniacal nitrogen (31 to 53 g N m⁻²) and urea (167–301 g N m⁻²) sources named P1 and P2, respectively. Inorganic nitrogen (N) concentrations (N-NH₃ + N-NH₄, N-NO₂, N-NO₃), soil pH, and N-NH₃ volatilization were monitored during a 2-year period. Variations in the fate of N compounds were distinguished according to the quantity and source of N applied to the soil. A higher N input in the form of urea was related to a greater concentration of nitrates and soil acidification in the topsoil (0–30 cm). Otherwise, ammoniacal N wastewater showed greater relative ammonia losses due to volatilization. Ammonia losses were estimated as 24.2% and 7.43% of the total N applied in P1 and P2, respectively. Besides, in P1 ammoniacal N predominated over nitrate, unlike results obtained in P2. The correct management of nitrogen-rich wastewaters in fertilizer industries could greatly reduce soil and groundwater degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3afertilizer industry 3afertilizers 3agroundwater 3aindustrial sites 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3apollution 3asoil acidification 3asoil pH 3atopsoil 3atotal nitrogen 3atoxicology 3aurea 3avolatilization 3awastewater 3aArgentina1 aZanello, Victoria1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8889-19251 aLexow, Claudio0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2021 Sept., v. 107, no. 3 p.565-573dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-021-03280-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03190naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006600153245015000219520154800369592002801917650002801945650001101973650001801984650001802002650001402020650001402034650002102048651001002069653001802079653002402097653002202121653001202143653002102155700002402176700002302200700006302223700006402286700005602350700002202406700006002428700002402488773012302512856008802635852000902723655001202732IND60773250120221119070754.0220509e20220515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077325012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.1061772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaviarasan, Thanamegam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1746-821110aImpact of multiple beach activities on litter and microplastic composition, distribution, and characterization along the southeast coast of India  aA regional understanding of beach litter abundance, distribution, and composition is fundamental to formulate strategies to manage litter pollution in a particular area. The present study aimed to quantify and characterize the macro (2.5 cm to 1m), meso (5 mm–2.5 cm), and micro litter (≤5 mm) in the intertidal and backshore area of six sandy beaches utilized for various activities along the southeast coast of India. Macro litter was collected within 100m transects, while meso and micro litter was collected within 1 m² quadrats (n = 5) from each beach's intertidal and backshore regions. In this study, the average beach litter concentrations were 0.24 ± 0.14 items/m² (macro), 8.2 ± 5.6 items/m² (meso), and micro litter was 505 ± 121 particles/kg of dry sediment. The backshore had a higher litter concentration than the intertidal area. Beaches closer to urban centers and multiple activities had higher litter abundance than more remote beaches. Using the Clean Coast Index (CCI), four beaches i.e., Neelankarai, Kovalam, Auroville, and Paradise are characterized as moderately clean beaches, whereas, the other two beaches i.e., Nemmeli and Palar are clean and very clean, respectively. Even though the beaches were found to be moderately clean, there is an urgent need to improve local waste management of beach litter. We suggest regular cleaning of river banks, a strict ban of single-use plastic in the beach area, and raising awareness e.g., by involving school and college students adopting a local beach.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoastal zone management 3acoasts 3alittoral zone 3amicroplastics 3apollution 3asediments 3awaste management 3aIndia 0aMarine litter 0aSingle-use plastics 0aClean coast index 0aTourism 0aBeach management1 aDhineka, Kuppuswamy1 aSambandam, Murugan1 aSivadas, Sanitha K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9243-13471 aSivyer, D.q(David),1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7538-52811 aHoehn, Danja1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3238-32831 aPradhan, Umakanta1 aMishra, Pravakar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6213-25571 aRamana Murthy, M.V.0 tOcean & coastal management.g2022 May 15, v. 223 p.106177-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.1061773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03478naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245014100174300001300315520185000328592002802178650001502206650002902221650001602250650001202266650001102278650002302289650001102312650001702323650001202340650001502352650001502367650001002382650001102392650002002403650001002423650002102433650002402454651001102478653001702489653001402506653001402520653001602534653000802550653003302558653001302591653002002604653001902624700002102643700001502664700002102679773011002700856008102810852000902891655001202900IND60604452120221122155715.0180717e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060445212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2015.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehl, Ingvild Kristine10aCultural landscape development on a west–east gradient in western Norway – potential of the Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm (LRA)  ap. 1-16.  aPollen analysis is the main method to obtain information on human impact on the vegetation through time. In this study, pollen records from one large lake, Kalandsvatn (inner coast), and three small lakes, Herøyvatn (outer coast), Fitjar (inner coast) and Herandsvatn (inner fjord) in Hordaland County, western Norway are investigated. The three small sites reflect different vegetation, climate and landscape types, resulting in different cultural landscapes. A recently developed approach, the Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm (LRA), is used to reconstruct regional and local vegetation cover in five hundred year time intervals, on a gradient from the coast to the inner fjord of western Norway. The regional estimates of vegetation cover as well as local differences between the sites are clearly demonstrated. The coast has been more open than the inner region in all time periods, with less than c. 70% tree cover prior to 5700 cal. BP. On a regional scale the tree cover was c. 90% in the same time period. Gradual opening of the regional forest started between 5700 and 5200 cal. BP. Forest disturbances, probably related to agriculture, are found both at the inner coast and in the inner fjord prior to 4200 cal. BP. Marked openings of the forests took place c. 4200 cal. BP at the outer coast, and c. 3700 cal. BP at the inner coast and inner fjord. From this time, heathlands dominated the open landscape at the coast. In the inner fjord region, grasslands in combination with cereal cultivation characterized the landscape. The inner coast area shows mixed vegetation cover with heathlands, grasslands and cultivated fields. Implementation of LRA suggests a stronger west–east vegetation gradient than indicated in the pollen percentage diagrams. The results show the potential of the LRA-approach in archaeological research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarchaeology 3aclimate 3acoasts 3acultural landscape 3afields 3afjord inlets 3aforests 3agrasslands 3aheathlands 3alakes 3apollen 3apollen analysis 3atrees 3avegetation cover 3avegetation gradient 3aNorway 0aForest cover 0aGrassland 0aHeathland 0aCultivation 0aLRA 0aQuantitative reconstructions 0aOpenness 0aPollen analysis 0aWestern Norway1 aOverland, Anette1 aBerge, Jan1 aHjelle, Kari Loe0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2015 Sept., v. 61 p.1-16dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2015.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245014000173300001800313500001500331520137900346592002801725650002601753650001601779650002501795650001401820650001501834650001401849650002201863650001901885650001201904653001001916700002201926773012001948856008102068852000902149655001202158IND60520745920221119070057.0160522e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052074592DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-016-1186-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaranwal, Vinay Kumar10aGenome-wide analysis, expression dynamics and varietal comparison of NAC gene family at various developmental stages in Morus notabilis  ap. 1305-1317.  a2019-12-06  aNAC genes are important transcription factors and forms a large family in plants. They have shown to play an important role in growth and development and have also been shown to involve in regulation of stress-responsive genes. In the present study, a repertoire of NAC genes in recently published mulberry genome has been identified which consists of a total of 79 members. Structural analysis revealed that most of the NAC genes in mulberry contain two introns. The proteins encoded by them show a wide range of isoelectric points suggestive of their varied roles in varying microcellular environment. Phylogenetic and conserved motif analysis elucidate the presence of 15 sub-groups of these genes along with two novel sub-groups having distinct conserved motifs which are not present in Arabidopsis. Gene ontology term enrichment analysis and cis-element identification from their putative 1 K upstream regulatory region indicates their possible role in important biological processes like organ formation, meristem establishment, senescence, and various biotic and abiotic stresses. Expression analysis across various developmental stages led to identification of their preferential expression in diverse tissues. Taken together, this work provides a solid background information related to structure, function, expression and evolution of NAC gene family in mulberry.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factors 3aArabidopsis 3adevelopmental stages 3ameristems 3amulberries 3aphylogeny 3aisoelectric point 3aabiotic stress 3aintrons 0agenes1 aKhurana, Paramjit0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2016 June, v. 291, no. 3 p.1305-1317dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-016-1186-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02243naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245007200167300001800239520095900257592002801216650001301244650002201257650001801279650001401297650001201311650002001323650001501343650002101358650001401379650000901393650004401402700001901446700001401465700001801479700001801497700001601515700001901531700001601550773011701566856008201683990002301765852000901788655001201797IND60091121820221120231202.0141103e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009112182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.09.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Baoshun10aSynthesis and anti-hyperglycemic activity of hesperidin derivatives  ap. 7194-7197.  aA series of hesperidin derivatives were prepared and identified by IR, ¹H NMR, and MS spectra. These compounds were evaluated in vitro and in vivo based on α-glucosidase inhibition, glucose consumption of HepG2 cells, and blood glucose level in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. The results revealed that all the compounds exhibited anti-hyperglycemic activities. The inhibition at 10⁻³M of compounds 3 and 7a on α-glucosidase were 55.02% and 53.34%, respectively, as compared to 54.80% by acarbose. Treated by compound 3 and the reference drug metformin, glucose consumption of HepG2 cell were 1.78 and 2.11mM, respectively. After the streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice were oral administrated with compound 3 at 100mgkg⁻¹d⁻¹ for 10days, the blood glucose level of 3 treated mice (13.23mM, P<0.05) showed significant difference when compared to model control (23.03mM). Thus, compound 3 exhibited promising anti-hyperglycemic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacarbose 3aalpha-glucosidase 3ablood glucose 3achemistry 3aglucose 3aglycemic effect 3ahesperidin 3ahuman cell lines 3ametformin 3amice 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy1 aChen, Tingting1 aChen, Zhu1 aWang, Mingxue1 aZheng, Dengyu1 aWu, Jinfeng1 aJiang, Xiaofei1 aLi, Xuegang0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 22, no. 23 p.7194-7197dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.09.0493Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03361naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012400166500002200290520154800312592002801860650001101888650001401899650001101913650001101924650001301935650002701948650002601975650003102001650001702032650002102049650002202070650001402092650002102106651001002127651000902137651001002146653001602156653001902172653003402191653001402225653002602239700006002265700007102325700005802396700006102454700006202515700006302577773012102640856004902761852000902810655001202819IND60795604120221123035217.0221004e20220926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079560412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2022.1025022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCatani, Linda10aEssential oils and their applications in agriculture and agricultural products: A literature analysis through VOSviewer  aPre-press version  aIn agriculture, more attention has been paid to limit the amount of chemical plant protection products. A potential alternative solution has been found in essential oils (EOs), which appear as promising candidates for their properties (safe, bioactive, biodegradable products) in managing plant diseases in agriculture. Therefore, a co-occurrence analysis was carried out on the available literature on Scopus database, through network maps created by VOSviewer software in order to identify the EOs used in agriculture, agricultural products and their target application. USA and India appeared as the most productive countries in terms of documents and citations followed by Iran and Italy. The co-occurrence analysis revealed eight, more frequently used, EOs in agriculture, in particular, they found more applications as antibacterial and insecticidal agents. On the contrary, any specific EO for nematicidal and acaricidal activity emerged from the analysis. The EOs with the largest applicability were Thymus (mainly T. vulgaris), Citrus, Rosmarinus officinalis, Origanum, Lavandula, Mentha, Ocimum (mainly O. basilicum). Thanks to EOs main features, is possible to invest more in the research, as demonstrated by the increasing trend of documents published in the last decades and the list of high-quality journals interested in this topic. An easier interpretation of the great amount of data enables to identify what has been investigated till nowadays to shape the potential future progression and prospective in this research field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aLavandula 3aMentha 3aOcimum 3aOriganum 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3aacaricidal properties 3aagricultural biotechnology 3abiocatalysis 3abiodegradability 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3aplant protection 3aIndia 3aIran 3aItaly 0aAgriculture 0aEssential oils 0aAgriculture target activities 0aVOSviewer 0aBibliometric analysis1 aGrassi, Eleonora1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7096-011X1 aCocozza di Montanara, Adele1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5375-98761 aGuidi, Loretta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9009-95201 aSandulli, Roberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3340-32981 aManachini, Barbara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8857-48471 aSemprucci, Federica1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1360-72420 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2022 Sept. 26,  p.102502-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2022.102502  aDNAL 7aarticle01632naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010800166300001400274520045500288592002800743653002700771653000800798653002400806653001400830653000900844653004000853653001000893653002400903653001400927653001100941700001800952700002300970700006000993773011201053856008401165852000901249655001201258IND60531955020221120084447.0161016e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053195502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anicom.2016.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBomassi, E.10aInterstitial idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and Sick-Sinus-Syndrome in a West Highland white terrier dog  ap. 61-66.  aAn eleven-year-old West Highland white terrier treated for a Sick-Sinus-Syndrome since 2 years with a VVIR pacemaker was presented for exercise intolerance and panting due to interstitial idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

It plays an important role in catalyzing the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate. The present study was to investigate the potent effect of GLS2 on radioresistance of cervical carcinoma. GLS2 was examined in 144 cases of human cervical cancer specimens (58 radioresistant specimens, 86 radiosensitive specimens) and 15 adjacent normal cervical specimens with immunohistochemistry. HeLa cells were treated with a cumulative dose of 50Gy X-rays, over 6months, yielding the resistant sub-line HeLaR. The expressions of GLS2 were measured by Western blot. Radioresistance was tested by colony survival assay. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. The levels of glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS), NAD⁺/NADH ratio and NADP⁺/NADPH ratio were detected by quantization assay kit. Xenografts were used to confirm the effect of GLS2 on radioresistance in vivo. The expressions of GLS2 were significantly enhanced in tumor tissues of radioresistant patients compared with that in radiosensitive patients. In vitro, the radioresistant cell line HeLaR exhibited significantly increased GLS2 levels than its parental cell line HeLa. GLS2 silenced radioresistant cell HeLaR shows substantially enhanced radiosensitivity with lower colony survival and higher apoptosis in response to radiation. In vivo, xenografts with GLS2 silenced HeLaR were more sensitive to radiation. At the molecular level, knock-down of GLS2 increased the intracellular ROS levels of HeLaR exposed to irradiation by decreasing the productions of antioxidant GSH, NADH and NADPH. GLS2 may have an important role in radioresistance in cervical cancer patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3areactive oxygen species 3aWestern blotting 3aX-radiation 3aglutathione 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aglutaminase 3apatients 3airradiation 3atissues 3aapoptosis 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3ametabolism 3ahumans 3aglutamine 3ahydrolysis 3aradiation resistance 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aflow cytometry 3aglutamic acid 0aantioxidants1 aXie, Ganfeng1 aLiu, Chen1 aZhou, Jie1 aChen, Jianfang1 aYu, Songtao1 aLi, Jianjun1 aPang, Xueli1 aShi, Hang1 aLiang, Houjie0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.

However, given widespread changes in climate and land-use in the Amazon in the past 20 years, it is not clear whether current rates of carbon uptake by SFs reflect estimates based on dividing the carbon stock by the estimated age of the forest. This is important, as differences between methodological approaches could lead to important discrepancies in estimates of carbon accumulation. Furthermore, we know little about how carbon uptake rates of secondary forests vary across some of the most deforested regions of the Amazon, where reforestation actions are most needed. Here, we compare the rates of carbon accumulation estimated over the lifetime of a stand (by stand age) with the contemporary rates estimated by recensus data, based on 28 permanent SFs plots distributed across four regions. Then, we compare how carbon uptakes rates vary across regions and how they compare to previous studies. The average rates of contemporary (1.23 ± 0.57 Mg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) and lifetime (1.14 ± 0.63 Mg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) carbon accumulation were strongly correlated (r = 0.78) and similar between regions. Overall, our carbon accumulation rates were much lower than other estimates of Amazonian SFs, which suggests that regions with the greatest opportunities for large-scale implementation of SFs have some of the slowest rates of carbon accumulation. Contrary to predictions from chronosequence analysis, the lack of difference between lifetime and contemporary rates of carbon accumulation suggests forests are maintaining a consistent rate of growth in the first decades after abandonment. These results—combined with the high rates of ongoing environmental change - highlight the importance of continuing to monitor the rate of carbon accumulation in secondary forests. This is necessary to support the implementation and monitoring of large-scale passive restoration in the highly-deforested Amazon.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadministrative management 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sinks 3achronosequences 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adeforestation 3aforest ecology 3aland use 3areforestation 3astand age 3aAmazonia 0aAboveground biomass 0aNatural regeneration 0aNature based-solutions 0aUN restoration decade1 aFerreira, Joice1 aResende, Angélica F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9875-11221 aBerenguer, Erika1 aFrança, Filipe1 aSmith, Charlotte C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3767-65871 aSchwartz, Gustavo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1717-44911 aNascimento, Rodrigo O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4630-00951 aGuedes, Matheus1 aChesini Rossi, Liana1 aMaria Moraes de Seixas, Marina1 aMelo da Silva, Carolina1 aBarlow, Jos0 tForest ecology and management.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 508 p.120053-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2022.1200533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013700164300001800301506011700319506007600436520136100512592002801873506003701901650001801938650001701956650002001973650002001993650001802013650001702031650001302048650002202061650001302083650001402096650001502110653000902125653001902134653002902153653003302182700001402215700001402229700005402243700001602297700001802313700001602331700001802347773012802365856004902493852000902542655001202551IND60795604320221207121823.0221004s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079560432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2022.09.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jinhui10aPyroptosis-related gene expression patterns and corresponding tumor microenvironment infiltration characterization in ovarian cancer  ap. 5440-5452.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPyroptosis, a form of inflammatory programmed cell death, is accompanied by inflammation and participate in the body's immune response. The expression of pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) is associated with tumor prognosis in ovarian cancer (OC), but it is still unknown whether pyroptosis can affect tumor immune microenvironment (TME) of OC. Based on 30 PRGs, we comprehensively assessed the pyroptosis patterns by using PRGscore and correlated them with TME features in 474 OC patients. Finally, we identified three pyroptosis modification patterns and TME immune characteristics of these patterns were in response to three immune phenotypes (immune-desert, immune-inflamed, and immune-excluded phenotypes). PRGscore can predict patient survival, staging, grading, and immunotherapy efficacy. Low PRGscore was associated with better survival advantage and increased mutation burden. Low PRGscore patients showed significantly better therapeutic effects and clinical results in chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Besides, the capability of PRGscore in predicting prognosis and immunotherapy sensitivity was further verified in other three tumor cohorts. In conclusion, the comprehensive assessment of OC pyroptosis modifications can help enhancing our understanding of TME immune infiltration and provide better personalized treatment tactics for OC patients.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiotechnology 3adrug therapy 3agene expression 3aimmune response 3aimmunotherapy 3ainflammation 3amutation 3aovarian neoplasms 3apatients 3aprognosis 3apyroptosis 0aTCGA 0aOvarian cancer 0aTumor immune environment 0aImmune checkpoint inhibitors1 aChen, Can1 aGeng, Rui1 aShao, Fang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2551-29561 aYang, Sheng1 aZhong, Zihang1 aNi, Senmiao1 aBai, Jianling0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2022, v. 20 p.5440-5452dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2022.09.037  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245011000188300001600298520132100314592002801635650001701663650001401680650001701694650001101711650001501722650002401737650003001761650001101791650001201802650001501814650002501829650007701854650002101931650006901952650001102021650003902032650002102071651001202092651001202104700001502116700001502131700001502146700001502161700001602176773011502192856005502307852000902362655001202371IND4480081620221121034105.0120313e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448008162DNAL7 a223243522pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2012.03220.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmdiouni, H.10aDetection and molecular identification of human adenoviruses and enteroviruses in wastewater from Morocco  ap. 359-366.  aAims: Reclaimed wastewater is a considerable water resource in Morocco. Its agricultural reuse requires an assessment of viral contamination. The aim of this study was to detect both infectious and noninfectious human adenoviruses (HAdV) and enteroviruses (EV) in raw wastewater and treat effluent from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and domestic sewage in Morocco. Methods and Results: A total of 22 samples were analysed. A polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation method was used, followed by integrated cell culture‐PCR (ICC‐PCR) using two cell lines: human rhabdomyosarcoma tumour tissue and laryngeal carcinoma cells (RD and Hep2 cells). Furthermore, viral genome amplification was confirmed by sequencing. HAdV were detected in 10 (45·5%) of the 22 samples involving two species: HAdV‐B and HAdV‐D. EV was detected in 5 (23%) samples belonging to Coxsackievirus B5 and poliovirus vaccine strain (Sabin 2). Conclusions: Human adenoviruses and EV were detected in the analysed samples from two WWTPs and HAdV in domestic sewage. Significance and Impact of the Study: This work is the first study in Morocco using cell culture, PCR and sequencing of enteric viruses from wastewater. The presence of infectious HAdV and EV in treated effluent emphasizes the need of wastewater treatment surveillance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3acarcinoma 3acell culture 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asewage 3aviruses 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 2aAdenoviruses, Humanxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aEnterovirusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aHumans 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSewagexvirology 3aMorocco 0aMorocco1 aFaouzi, A.1 aFariat, N.1 aHassar, M.1 aSoukri, A.1 aNourlil, J.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2012 Apr., v. 54, no. 4 p.359-366dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2012.03220.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245012800171300001600299520156900315592002801884650001501912650002201927650001901949650001201968650002101980650001702001650001302018650002502031650001502056650002202071650001402093650001102107650002102118650001402139650003002153650001202183650001902195650001102214650001002225651001002235651001002245700001902255700002202274700002502296700002202321773009502343856004802438852000902486655001202495IND50067093620221117235322.0130614e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006709362DNAL7 a10.1007/s11842-012-9212-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoudhary, Dyutiman10aMarketing of Bay Leaf in Nepal and Northern India: Lessons for Improving Terms of Participation of Small Farmers in Markets  ap. 289-305.  aNon-timber forest product commercialisation requires information on what and who is involved in markets, but this is rarely documented. This paper presents the findings of a study to assess the structure and dynamics of markets for bay leaf (Cinnamomum tamala Nees and Eberm) in Nepal and in Uttarakhand state in India. Data were collected from key informant interviews with stakeholders from the governments of the two countries, research agencies, user groups and traders associations, from focus group discussion involving 100 farmers and district and wholesale level traders, and from stakeholder meeting and interviews with traders using an open-ended questionnaire in the two countries. It was found that of the 2,500 tons of bay leaf traded in Nepal in 2009, 86 % was exported to India. The total size of the bay leaf market in Uttarakhand is estimated at 1,470 tons, with the spice industry as the main consumer. Nepalese bay leaf sustains the demand in Indian markets that were studied. Processing of leaves into essential oil and powder by wholesale traders takes place in Nepal and India respectively, but no regional trade in essential oil was observed. Three quality grades are sold in markets which are not known to the farmers. The bay leaf trade is increasing, creating an opportunity for farmers to engage in its cultivation. There is a need for transferring market information and improving policy implementation to promote transparent and equitable market linkages that enhance benefits to mountain farmers. © 2012 Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCinnamomum 3acommercialization 3aessential oils 3afarmers 3afarmers' markets 3afocus groups 3aindustry 3ainformation exchange 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3aleaf oils 3aleaves 3amarket structure 3amountains 3anontimber forest products 3apowders 3aquestionnaires 3aspices 3atrade 3aIndia 3aNepal1 aKala, Surendra1 aTodaria, Nagendra1 aDasgupta, Sabyasachi1 aKollmair, Michael0 tSmall-scale forestry.g2013 June, v. 12, no. 2 p.289-305dSpringer-Verlagx1873-76177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11842-012-9212-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245007300172300001600245520128400261592002801545650001401573650001501587650001501602650001401617650002301631650001501654650001301669650001001682650001101692650001201703651001801715700002301733773009401756852000901850856008101859655001201940IND4399864120221119064951.0160903e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439986412DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-007-9008-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlasby, Christopher J.10aGlobal diversity of polychaetes (Polychaeta; Annelida) in freshwater  ap. 107-115.  aA literature review of Polychaeta (Annelida) including Aphanoneura (the oligochaete-like Aeolosomatidae and Potamodrilidae), living in freshwater yielded 168 species, 70 genera and 24 families representing all of the major polychaete clades, but less than 2% of all species. The best-represented families were, in order, Nereididae, Aeolosomatidae, Sabellidae, Spionidae and Histriobdellidae. Fourteen families were represented by a single species and genus. Regions supporting the highest diversity of freshwater polychaetes were in order, Palaearctic, Neotropical, Oriental, Nearctic, Australasian, and Afrotropical. More than half of all species and genera inhabitat lakes and rivers, followed by lagoons/estuaries, which have a high proportion of euryhaline species, and inland seas. Less common, atypical polychaete habitats include subterranean waters, the hyporheic zone of rivers and plant container habitats (phytotelmata). At least three distinct ecological/historical processes appear to account for the colonisation of continental waters: invasion of a clade prior to the break-up of Gondwana, as in Aphanoneura, Namanereis, Stratiodrilus, and Caobangia; relatively recent stranding of individual species (relicts); and the temporary visitation of euryhaline species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaobangia 3aNereididae 3aSabellidae 3aestuaries 3aeuryhaline species 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3alakes 3arivers 3atropics 3aArctic region1 aTimm, T.q(Tarmo),0 tHydrobiologia.g2008 Jan., v. 595, no. 1 p.107-115dSpringer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9008-23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02900naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245008200174300001800256520174800274592002802022650002502050650001402075650000902089650001602098650001302114650001502127650001702142650001102159650001402170650002202184650001102206651001002217700002102227700002502248773014802273856008402421852000902505655001202514IND60123489820221118071821.0150325e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012348982DNAL7 a10.1080/00028487.2013.7974942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuckmeier, David L.10aAlligator Gar Movement and Macrohabitat Use in the Lower Trinity River, Texas  ap. 1025-1035.  aUsing acoustic telemetry, we characterized movements and macrohabitat use of 46 Alligator Gars Atractosteus spatula in the lower 180 km of the Trinity River, Texas. Although several Alligator Gars used over 100 km of the river, 83% of the tagged fish had linear home ranges less than 60 km during the 22 months of study. As a result, home ranges of fish that were tagged in different parts of the study area rarely overlapped. Home range size varied by season, with the smallest home ranges occurring in winter. Greatest movements occurred during the spawn (May–June) and postspawn (July–October) seasons, and movements were correlated with increasing water temperatures based on detections of tagged fish at fixed receiver stations. Tagged Alligator Gars were most often associated with main-channel habitats when river stage was at base level and during small flood pulses (<3-m rise). When in the main channel, tagged Alligator Gars selected water that was deeper than the average within their home ranges. In contrast, during large flood pulses (≥3-m rise), tagged fish were found in tributaries and inundated floodplains, regardless of season. Use of tailwater and estuarine macrohabitats was seasonal and limited to fish that had been tagged near those areas. Limited home ranges and observed spatial segregation of fish tagged near the upper and lower boundaries of the 180-km study area suggest that the fish have access to critical habitats needed for reproduction, feeding, and migration within relatively small spatial scales. As such, Alligator Gars in the lower Trinity River do not appear to represent a single panmictic population, indicating that localized rather than regional management efforts would be appropriate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAtractosteus spatula 3aacoustics 3afish 3afloodplains 3ahabitats 3ahome range 3areproduction 3arivers 3atelemetry 3awater temperature 3awinter 3aTexas1 aSmith, Nathan G.1 aDaugherty, Daniel J.0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2013 July 1, v. 142, no. 4 p.1025-1035dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:19703x1548-86597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2013.7974943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245017700160300001800337500001500355520132100370592002801691650001901719650000901738650002201747650001601769650003601785650001301821650001001834650002001844650002501864650001301889650002301902650000901925650002301934650001201957650002201969650002501991650002102016653001702037700001902054700001802073700002102091700002002112700001902132773009802151856007302249852000902322655001202331IND60517867220221120105043.0160405e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051786722DNAL7 a10.1111/are.126242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Xue‐Lian10aEffects of a dietary administration of purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea) on growth, antioxidant activities and 8 miRNAs expressions in crucian carp (Carassius auratus)  ap. 1631-1638.  a2019-12-06  aEchinacea purpurea (EP), a globally popular herbal medicine, has been used to treat various diseases in human and animals. However, little has been reported about its effects in fish. In this study, crucian carp (Carassius auratus) were selected to evaluate the effects of EP on growth performance and antioxidant response and the expressions of microRNAs. The results showed EP could stimulate the growth of crucian carp with the best effect was observed at dose of 4 g kg⁻¹. In serum, the content of hydroxyl radical (·OH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) decreased by EP supplementation, whereas the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) increased. Similarly, the content of ·OH decreased, and the activities of CAT, GPX and GR increased in liver of crucian carp. Furthermore, in livers of crucian carp, EP supplements upregulated the expressions of the microRNAs (miR‐16, miR‐21, miR‐125b, miR‐146a, miR‐155, miR‐181a and miR‐223), which had been confirmed to participate in regulating antioxidant and immune function in mammals. Our results suggest EP supplements in diets stimulated growth performance and antioxidant response of crucian carp. In liver, the upregulation of specific miRNAs may participate in the antioxidant effects of EP diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahuman diseases 3adiet 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ablood serum 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3acatalase 3aliver 3amalondialdehyde 3asuperoxide dismutase 3amicroRNA 3aEchinacea purpurea 3afish 3agrowth performance 3amammals 3aCarassius auratus 3aantioxidant activity 3aherbal medicines 0aantioxidants1 aFu, Jing‐Hua1 aLi, Zhi‐Hua1 aFang, Wei‐Ping1 aYang, Jian‐Yu1 aZou, Ji‐Xing0 tAquaculture research.g2016 May, v. 47, no. 5 p.1631-1638dBlackwell Sciencex1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.126243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245013200163300001600295520118800311592002801499650001001527650001301537650001201550650001401562650000901576650001101585650002601596650001701622650001101639650000901650650001201659650001401671650001201685650001101697650001101708650001801719650000901737650001801746650002501764650002101789650002601810650000901836651001801845651001101863653001701874653001801891653001801909653000901927653001901936700002201955700002401977700003702001700002302038700002102061700002102082700002302103700002602126700001802152700002302170700001802193700001802211773012902229856007802358852000902436655001202445IND60573135020221117232000.0180620e20170627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057313502DNAL7 a10.1515/eces-2017-00152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKłos, Andrzej14aThe Origin of Heavy Metals and Radionuclides Accumulated in the Soil and Biota Samples Collected in Svalbard, Near Longyearbyen  ap. 223-238.  aHeavy metals and radioactive compounds are potentially hazardous substances for plants, animals and humans in the Arctic. A good knowledge of the spatial variation of these substances in soil and primary producers, and their sources, is therefore essential. In the samples of lichen Thamnolia vermicularis, Salix polaris and Cassiope tetragona, and the soil samples collected in 2014 in Svalbard near Longyearbyen, the concentrations of the following heavy metals were determined: Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb and Hg, as well as the activity concentrations of the following: K-40, Cs-137, Pb-210, Pb-212, Bi-212, Bi-214, Pb-214, Ac-228, Th-231 and U-235 in the soil samples. The differences in the concentrations of the analytes accumulated in the different plant species and soil were studied using statistical methods. Sea aerosol was indicated as the source of Pb, Hg, Cs-137, Pb-210 and Th-231 in the studied area. A relatively high concentration of nickel was determined in the biota samples collected near Longyearbyen, compared to other areas of Svalbard. It was supposed that nickel may be released into the atmosphere as a consequence of the local coal mining around Longyearbyen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalix 3aaerosols 3acadmium 3achemistry 3acoal 3acopper 3aecosystem engineering 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3alead 3alichens 3amanganese 3amercury 3amining 3anickel 3aradionuclides 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3astatistical analysis 3atoxic substances 3atrophic relationships 3azinc 3aArctic region 3aNorway 0aheavy metals 0aradioisotopes 0abiomonitoring 0asoil 0aArctic regions1 aZiembik, Zbigniew1 aRajfur, Małgorzata1 aDołhańczuk-Śródka, Agnieszka1 aBochenek, Zbigniew1 aBjerke, Jarle W.1 aTømmervik, Hans1 aZagajewski, Bogdan1 aZiółkowski, Dariusz1 aJerz, Dominik1 aZielińska, Maria,1 aKrems, Paweł1 aGodyń, Piotr0 tEcological Chemistry and Engineering.g2017 June 27, v. 24, no. 2 p.223-238dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23149x2084-45497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/eces-2017-00153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245017100212300001600383520094900399592002801348650001401376650001101390650002101401650001401422650001201436650001801448650001301466650000901479650001001488650001801498650001601516650001101532700002101543700002101564700001601585773008701601856008501688852000901773655001201782IND60625061020221119081130.0210114e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062506102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.12.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinoshita, Toshiya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0486-911X10aTwo step floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition including in situ fabrication of catalyst nanoparticles and carbon nanotube forest growth with low impurity level  ap. 152-160.  aCarbon nanotube (CNT) forest with very low concentration of metallic impurity particle was grown by a two-step floating-catalyst chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Fe catalyst nanoparticles were uniformly formed on the substrate by flowing ferrocene/ethanol mist generated by an ultrasonic nebulizer. Then, the growth of the CNT forest was followed by a thermal CVD process in an identical furnace with acetylene as a carbon source. The separated process of catalyst formation and CNT growth leads to no formation of impurity particles on the CNT surfaces with a lower impurity level of 0.8 wt%. The gas-phase flow of the catalyst solution enables precise control of catalyst formation including diameter, radius of curvature and areal density of catalyst particle for long and dense CNT forest.

The optimal treatment with 1-MCP to suppress ripening of fruit harvested at the green/yellow stage of maturity was 300 nl l–¹ for 24 h at 20°C, as evaluated by delayed colour development, retention of firmness, and low weight loss. This treatment also significantly reduced chilling injury (CI) and the development of decay, compared with non-treated fruit, or fruit treated with 150 nl l–¹ 1-MCP. However, 1-MCP did not suppress senescence in fruit harvested at the yellow stage of maturity, as evaluated by external and internal quality parameters. 1-MCP did not affect total soluble solids contents. When fruit was harvested at the green stage, 450 nl l–¹ 1-MCP reduced the rate of post-harvest ripening significantly, resulting in fruit of unacceptable colour development and firmness. 1-MCP delayed by 8 – 9 d the onset of the climacteric peak of CO₂ production and ethylene evolution in fruit harvested at the green/yellow stage of maturity. The quantities of CO₂ and ethylene production in 1-MCP-treated fruit were lower than those in controls.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-methylcyclopropene 3aCucumis melo 3abiotechnology 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimacteric fruits 3acolor 3aethylene production 3afirmness 3amelons 3aweight loss1 aAlkalai-Tuvia, Sharon1 aElkind, Yonatan1 aFallik, Elazar0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2006 Jan. 1, v. 81, no. 6 p.975-982dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12181x2380-40847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2006.115121853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01599naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245010700166300001800273500001900291520059600310592002800906650002400934650001400958650001500972700001900987700001601006700006301022773012001085856008301205852000901288655001201297IND60738207320221120054649.0210521e20210506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073820732DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c007662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPali, Pragya10aPhoto-oxidative Ruthenium(II)-Catalyzed Formal [3 + 2] Heterocyclization of Thioamides to Thiadiazoles  ap. 3809-3813.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAn operationally simple and sustainable one-pot photo-oxidative formal [3 + 2] heterocyclization of β-ketothioamides with aryldiazonium salts catalyzed by Ru(bpy)₃Cl₂ has been realized to provide 2,4-disubstituted 5-imino-1,2,3-thiadiazoles in good to high yields under mild reaction conditions for the first time.

In this work, the interaction between quercetin and asolectin-based magnetoliposomes was investigated by monitoring the hydration degree, vibrational, rotational and translational mobility parameters of the system as well as its thermodynamic properties. The efficiency of the encapsulation of maghemite magnetic nanoparticles was detected by high resolution-continuum source flame atomic absorption spectrometry (HR-CS FAAS). The magnetic behavior of the system was studied by vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) technique. The size and surface charge of magnetoliposomes were detected by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential (ζ-potential) measurements. The influence of quercetin on the physico-chemical parameters of the magnetoliposomes was evaluated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), 31P and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques. In vitro antioxidant and antitumoral assays were also performed for the magnetoliposomes. An insertion of quercetin into magnetoliposomes reduced the efficiency of the encapsulation of maghemite nanoparticles by 11%, suggesting a significant interaction between flavonoid and nanoparticles in a specific region of the system. Quercetin discreetly decreased the saturation magnetization of magnetoliposomes, but did not affect the superparamagnetic behavior of the system. 31P and 1H NMR results showed that quercetin did not alter the inverted hexagonal system phase state but decreased lipid polar head mobility. The flavonoid also seems to reorient the choline group above the bilayer phosphate membrane plane, as indicated by ζ-potential system values. FTIR, NMR and DSC responses showed that quercetin disordered the carbonyl and the methylene regions of the magnetoliposomes. Quercetin, as the nanoparticles, seems to be located in the polar head regions of magnetoliposomes, ordering it and diminishing the lipid intermolecular communication in the membrane carbonyl and non-polar regions. The lipid peroxidation of the magnetoliposomes was prevented 8-fold by the presence of quercetin in the system. Also, the flavonoid was responsible for a 45% reduction in the viability of glioma cells. Location and interactions between quercetin and magnetoliposomes components were discussed in order to be correlated with the results of biological activity, contributing to the design of more stable and efficient magnetoliposomes to be applied as contrast and antitumoral agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aantioxidants 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abioactive properties 3acholine 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aencapsulation 3aglioma 3alight scattering 3alipid peroxidation 3alipids 3amaghemite 3amagnetism 3amonitoring 3ananoparticles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aphysicochemical properties 3aquercetin 3astable isotopes 3athermodynamics 3aviability 3azeta potential 0aQuercetin 0aMagnetoliposomes 0aMaghemite 0aAsolectin 0aHyperthermia1 aOsti Silva, Nichole1 ados Santos Espinelli, João Batista1 aGermani Marinho, Marcelo Augusto1 aVieira Borges, Zeane1 aBruzamarello Caon Branco, Natália1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4846-42021 aFaita, Fabrício Luiz1 aMeira Soares, Bruno1 aHorn, Ana Paula1 aParize, Alexandre Luís1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9986-19561 aRodrigues de Lima, Vânia0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2019 Jan., v. 218 p.22-33dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl20199x0009-30847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2018.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245017100162300002000333520135300353592002801706650002001734650002101754650001101775650001301786650001701799650001601816650001501832653002701847653003101874653001601905653002301921653004301944700001501987700001102002700001702013700002002030700001502050700001602065700001502081700001702096700001802113700001802131700005402149773014202203856007802345852000902423655001202432IND60655134620221120195712.0190731e20190708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065513462DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b078592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Jianchang10aSide-Chain Polymers as Dopant-Free Hole-Transporting Materials for Perovskite Solar Cells—The Impact of Substituents’ Positions in Carbazole on Device Performance  ap. 26928-26937.  aSide-chain polymers have the potential to be excellent dopant-free hole-transporting materials (HTMs) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) because of their unique characteristics, such as tunable energy levels, high charge mobility, good solubility, and excellent film-forming ability. However, there has been less research focusing on side-chain polymers for PSCs. Here, two side-chain polystyrenes with triphenylamine substituents on carbazole moieties were designed and characterized. The properties of the side-chain polymers were tuned finely, including the photophysical and electrochemical properties and charge mobilities, by changing the positions of triphenylamine substituents on carbazole. Owing to the higher mobility and charge extraction ability, the polymer P2 with the triphenylamine substituent on the 3,6-positions of the carbazole unit showed higher performance with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.45%, which was much higher than the PCE (16.78%) of P1 with 2,7-positions substituted. These results clearly demonstrated that side-chain polymers can act as promising HTMs for PSC applications and the performance of side-chain polymers could be optimized by carefully tuning the structure of the monomer, which provides a new strategy to design new kinds of side-chain polymers and obtain high-performance dopant-free HTMs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic amines 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3amoieties 3apolystyrenes 3asolar cells 3asolubility 0aperovskite solar cells 0ahole-transporting material 0adopant-free 0aside-chain polymer 0asubstituents’ positions in carbazole1 aLiu, Chang1 aLi, Bo1 aGu, Fenglong1 aZhang, Luozheng1 aHu, Manman1 aDeng, Xiang1 aQiao, Yuan1 aMao, Yongyun1 aTan, Wenchang1 aTian, Yanqing1 aXu, Baomin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2868-06130 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 July 08, v. 11, no. 30 p.26928-26937dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b078593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245016000166300001400326520184400340592002802184650002702212650001902239650001702258650002502275650002202300650001802322651001102340700001902351700002002370700002202390700002102412773011702433856008102550852000902631655001202640IND4387730920221120091345.0151024e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438773092DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-006-9252-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoughriet, Abdel10aEnvironmental Impacts of Heavy Metal Discharges from a Smelter in Deûle-canal Sediments (Northern France): Concentration Levels and Chemical Fractionation  ap. 83-95.  aHeavy metal pollution in sediments derived from the Deûle canal and sampled at different sites not far from a smelting plant has been examined in the present work in order to identify the sources of these metals and to assess the sediment environmental quality. The total concentrations of lead, zinc, cadmium, thallium, indium and tin in the samples were determined using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Our investigations have revealed that metal pollution is readily apparent in the studied sediments, with metals contents largely exceeding those measured in the background soils: maximum values are obtained for sediments collected near the industrial zone. The chemical forms of Pb, Zn, Cd, Tl, In and Sn in these sediments have also been studied using a sequential extraction method in order to evaluate their possible mobility, bioavailability and toxicity in this aquatic environment. Overall, the averaged fractionation of Pb and Zn is dominated, in a decreasing order, by the easily reducible, oxidizable and carbonate fractions. The importance of oxidizable phase (which is assumed to be composed mainly of organic matter and sulphides) in the Pb and Zn fractionations has been confirmed by the detection of X-ray diffraction peaks ascribed to galena (PbS) and wurtzite (ZnS) in contaminated sediment samples. Anthropogenic Tl, In, and Cd are mainly retained in Fe–Mn oxides/hydroxides, whereas anthropogenic Sn predominates in aluminosilicates/clays. We suspect that elevated percentage levels of Pb, Zn, Cd and In in the reducible fraction constitute a particular potential risk to this aquatic environment in case early diagenetic phenomena (that are observed in the sedimentary material) and physical disturbances (that occur in the water column) both take place strongly in the medium.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediment contamination 3asoil pollution 3aheavy metals 3aenvironmental impact 3achemical analysis 3afractionation 3aFrance1 aProix, Nicolas1 aBillon, Gabriel1 aRecourt, Philippe1 aOuddane, Baghdad0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2007 Mar., v. 180, no. 1-4 p.83-95dKluwer Academic Publishersx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-006-9252-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03650naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151242019200179245015500371300001600526520108700542536008701629592002801716596009001744650002501834650001701859650001701876650002401893650000901917650002201926650001701948650001801965650001001983650001801993650002402011650001402035650001702049650002302066650001102089650003302100650002502133650001602158650002102174653002102195653001402216653002202230653003102252653001802283653002302301653002502324653003002349653001502379653002702394653001902421653002602440653002702466700002502493700003302518700003702551700003202588700002902620700003702649700002802686773011902714856008602833852000902919655001202928IND60679278420221119060205.0200509e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067927842DNAL7 a10.1080/19476337.2019.15662762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelgado-Nieblas, Carlos10aEfecto de la extrusión sobre propiedades fisicoquímicas, nutricionales y antioxidantes de cereales para desayuno producidos a partir de salvado y subproductos de naranjita deshidratados10aEffect of extrusion on physicochemical, nutritional and antioxidant properties of breakfast cereals produced from bran and dehydrated naranjita pomace  ap. 240-250.  aExtrusion technology is widely used for the production of breakfast cereals (BC). In order to improve their nutritional/nutraceutical quality, the addition of citrus fruit pomace rich in bioactive compounds has been suggested. The objective of this work was to study the effect of extrusion temperature (ET, 88.79–131.21°C) and dehydrated naranjita pomace content (DNP, 0.64–13.36%) on physicochemical, nutritional and antioxidant properties of BC. For statistical analysis, the response surface methodology was used. When ET was elevated, the bulk density, breaking stress, color b* and soluble dietary fiber increased, whereas when DNP was higher, the water solubility index, color b*, soluble dietary fiber, total phenolic compounds, and antioxidant activity increased. The extrusion process decreased the β-glucans content compared to a non-extruded control. These findings indicated that it is possible to produce BC with acceptable physicochemical, nutritional and antioxidant characteristics by adding DNP, whose consumption presents potential benefits in human health.  aThis work was supported by the Universidad Autónoma de Sinaloa [PROFAPI2014/239].  aPublisher supplied data  aPROFAPI2014/239cUniversidad Autónoma de Sinaloadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008989 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abeta-glucans 3abioactive compounds 3abran 3abreakfast cereals 3abulk density 3acitrus fruits 3acolor 3adietary fiber 3adietary supplements 3aextrusion 3ahuman health 3aphenolic compounds 3apomace 3aresponse surface methodology 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3awater solubility 0aNaranjita pomace 0aextrusion 0abreakfast cereals 0aphysicochemical properties 0adietary fiber 0aphenolic compounds 0aantioxidant activity 0asubproductos de naranjita 0aextrusión 0acereales para desayuno 0afibra dietaria 0acompuestos fenólicos 0aactividad antioxidante1 aRuiz-Beltrán, Karen1 aSánchez-Lizárraga, Jessica1 aZazueta-Morales, José de Jesús1 aAguilar-Palazuelos, Ernesto1 aCarrillo-López, Armando1 aCamacho-Hernández, Irma Leticia1 aQuintero-Ramos, Armando0 tCyTA: journal of food.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 17, no. 1 p.240-250dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000065x1947-63457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19476337.2019.15662763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03481naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001200144245014900156300002000305520180200325592002802127650002202155650001102177650001402188650001102202650001702213650001302230650002102243650001402264650001402278650002102292650001102313653002502324653003102349653003602380653002502416653001402441700001502455700001902470700005602489700001402545700005802559700005502617700001802672700002002690700002402710773014202734856007802876852000902954655001202963IND60655134720221120195823.0190731e20190704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065513472DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b078652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Jie10aIon-Doping-Site-Variation-Induced Composite Cathode Adjustment: A Case Study of Layer–Tunnel Na₀.₆MnO₂ with Mg²⁺ Doping at Na/Mn Site  ap. 26938-26945.  aComposite cathodes have attracted great attention due to the integrated advantages of each pure structure. Also, the component ratio deserves a careful modulation to further improve the corresponding electrochemical performance. Mn-based layer–tunnel hybrid composite became a focus in sodium-ion batteries due to the superiority in terms of high performance, low cost, and nontoxicity. In the previous reports, the structure modulation was carried out via changing the synthesis condition, varying the transition-metal-element ratio, and different ion doping. Also, it is still challenging to explore a more feasible method to simplify the adjustment process. Herein, we introduced Mg²⁺ into Na sites or transition-metal sites in Na₀.₆MnO₂ and first discovered the doping-site-variation-induced structural adjustment phenomenon. Specifically, Mg doping in transition-metal sites could be beneficial for the growth of the P2-type structure, while layer/tunnel component ratio decreased when locating Mg²⁺ in Na sites. The P2–O2 phase transformations could be effectively suppressed by locating Mg²⁺ in both sites in high-voltage regions and thus improve the cycling performance. The designed material, Na₀.₆Mn₀.₉₉Mg₀.₀₁O₂, could attain a decent capacity of 100 mA h g–¹ at 1000 mA g–¹ and a satisfied retention of 76.6% after 500 cycles. Additionally, ex situ X-ray diffraction analysis experiments verify the excellent structural stability of Mg-substituted samples during charge–discharge processes. Moreover, the Na₀.₆Mn₀.₉₉Mg₀.₀₁O₂ also displays superior sodium-ion full-cell properties when merged with hard carbon anode. Thus, this research may indicate a proper novel thread for designing high-performance composite electrodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acarbon 3acase studies 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3aphase transition 3asodium 0asodium-ion batteries 0aMn-based cathode materials 0alayer−tunnel hybrid composite 0astructure adjustment 0aMg doping1 aWang, Dong1 aYang, Zu-guang1 aWu, Zhen-guo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8153-21691 aQiu, Lang1 aGuo, Xiao-dong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2180-19851 aLi, Jun-tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9650-63851 aZhong, Ben-he1 aChen, Xian-chun1 aDou, S.q(Shi Xue),0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 July 04, v. 11, no. 30 p.26938-26945dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b078653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001300142245008000155300002000235520100500255592002801260650001101288650001401299650001301313650002101326650001901347650001201366650001401378650002101392650001701413650001101430700001901441700001901460700002201479700001601501700001501517700001401532700001601546700002601562700001301588700001801601700003101619700002001650773013501670856007801805852000901883655001201892IND60541627120221122023438.0160822e20150930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054162712DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b078202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Tao10aEnhancing the Reversibility of Mg/S Battery Chemistry through Li+ Mediation  ap. 12388-12393.  aMg metal is a promising anode material for next generation rechargeable battery due to its dendrite-free deposition and high capacity. However, the best cathode for rechargeable Mg battery was based on high molecular weight MgₓMo₃S₄, thus rendering full cell energetically uncompetitive. To increase energy density, high capacity cathode material like sulfur is proposed. However, to date, only limited work has been reported on Mg/S system, all plagued by poor reversibility attributed to the formation of electrochemically inactive MgSₓ species. Here, we report a new strategy, based on the effect of Li⁺ in activating MgSₓ species, to conjugate a dendrite-free Mg anode with a reversible polysulfide cathode and present a truly reversible Mg/S battery with capacity up to 1000 mAh/gₛ for more than 30 cycles. Mechanistic insights supported by spectroscopic and microscopic characterization strongly suggest that the reversibility arises from chemical reactivation of MgSₓ by Li⁺.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy density 3alithium 3amagnesium 3amolecular weight 3aspectroscopy 3asulfur1 aNoked, Malachi1 aPearse, Alex J1 aGillette, Eleanor1 aFan, Xiulin1 aZhu, Yujie1 aLuo, Chao1 aSuo, Liumin1 aSchroeder, Marshall

In this study, extracts of M. oleifera leaves from South Korea and Cambodia were evaluated for their antioxidant and antiobesity activities and for food and natural medicine use. The extracts were made using water and ethanol with leaves from South Korea and Cambodia, and then, the ethanol extracts were further fractionated with ethyl acetate. The antioxidant and antiobesity activities of fractionated ethanol extracts were higher than those of water extracts. Although the expression of C/EBPα in 3T3‐L1 cell differentiation did not have a concentration‐dependent inhibitory effect on the M. oleifera leaf extracts, the expression of PPARγ, FAS, and ACC was inhibited in a concentration‐dependent manner with the M. oleifera leaf extracts. This study shows that M. oleifera leaves from South Korea and Cambodia may be an effective candidate for antiobesity prevention. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Antioxidants and antiobesity factors are important for metabolic syndrome including obesity. Recently, natural antiobesity medication containing polyphenol ingredients has been developed to replace synthetic antiobesity medication, which has various side effects. This study evaluates the antioxidant and antiobesity activities of Moringa oleifera leaves from different cultivation regions. The leaves grow rapidly and leaf extracts contain a large amount of nutrients and phytochemicals, which enables commercial production of the leaves as natural antiobesity medications including functional foods and nutraceuticals.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019cChosun University 3aMoringa oleifera 3aantioxidants 3acell differentiation 3adietary supplements 3adrug therapy 3aethanol 3aethyl acetate 3afractionation 3aleaves 3amedicine 3ametabolic syndrome 3aobesity 3aphytochemicals 3apolyphenols 3aCambodia 3aSouth Korea1 aChoi, Moon‐Hee1 aShin, Hyun‐Jae1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2618-56430 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2020 July, v. 44, no. 7 p.e13282-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.132823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03512naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245011000159300002000269520160300289592002801892650002701920650002701947650002901974650001602003650001802019650002502037650001202062650001402074650002302088650001802111650002002129650001802149650002002167650002202187650001102209650002502220650001302245650001702258650001802275650002202293650001702315650001402332650001802346653002202364653002502386653004002411653002802451700001402479700001602493700001302509700001602522700001802538700002002556700001702576700005202593773014202645856007802787852000902865655001202874IND60655134820221120195907.0190731e20190702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065513482DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b078662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yanan10aEnzyme-Responsive Mesoporous Ruthenium for Combined Chemo-Photothermal Therapy of Drug-Resistant Bacteria  ap. 26590-26606.  aThe rapid mutation of drug-resistant bacteria and the serious lag of development of new antibiotics necessitate research on novel antibacterial agents.

Here, an enzyme-responsive nanosystem, AA@Ru@HA-MoS₂, with a synergistic chemo-photothermal therapy function is proposed to treat bacterial infections. Mesoporous ruthenium nanoparticles (Ru NPs) were used as nanocarriers, loading prodrug ascorbic acid (AA) and encapsulated by hyaluronic acid (HA). Then, molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) precoated with ciprofloxacin was used as a catalyst with targeting effect binding to the outer surface. When the nanosystem gathered at the infection site, Hyal secreted by bacteria could degrade the HA capping and trigger the release of AA and then generated hydroxyl radicals (•OH) in situ by the catalysis of MoS₂. In addition, taking advantage of the good photothermal property of Ru NPs, combined chemo-photothermal antibacterial therapy could be achieved. The nanosystem exhibited potent bactericidal activity against drug-resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, it could break down the biofilm, inhibit the contained bacteria, and prevent the formation of a new biofilm. The in vivo bacterium-infected model also proved accelerated wound healing. The study showed a high potential of AA@Ru@HA-MoS₂ as a novel enzyme-responsive nanosystem for combating drug-resistant bacterial infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3aascorbic acid 3abacterial infections 3abiofilm 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aciprofloxacin 3adrug resistance 3aencapsulation 3ahyaluronic acid 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amodels 3amolybdenum disulfide 3amutation 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3aphotochemotherapy 3aporous media 3aruthenium 3atissue repair 0aenzyme-responsive 0amesoporous ruthenium 0acombined chemo-photothermal therapy 0adrug-resistant bacteria1 aLin, Ange1 aLiu, Jiawei1 aChen, Xu1 aZhu, Xufeng1 aGong, Youcong1 aYuan, Guanglong1 aChen, Lanmei1 aLiu, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2237-93090 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 July 02, v. 11, no. 30 p.26590-26606dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b078663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01402naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245005400159300001800213520031800231592002800549650002300577650001300600650001900613650001800632650002100650650002300671650003600694650001300730650001100743700002000754700002800774700002100802773013400823856007400957852000901031655001201040IND60660250920221122085522.0190823e20140626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066025092DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc03650f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakida, Yusuke10aNickel-catalysed carboxylation of organoboronates  ap. 8010-8013.  aA nickel/N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysed carboxylation of aryl-, heteroaryl- and alkenylboronates, affording the corresponding carboxylic acids, has been developed.

The combination of imaging properties and controlled photorelease of active molecules within the same nanoconjugate has a great potential for theranostic applications. In this study, a system for NIR light-triggered release of molecular cargos induced by the second harmonic emission from bismuth ferrite harmonic nanoparticles (BFO HNPs) is presented. Silica-coated BFO HNPs were covalently conjugated to a photocaging tether based on coumarin (CM) and l-tryptophan (Trp) as a model molecular cargo. Upon femtosecond pulsed irradiation at 790 nm, Trp was efficiently released from the NP surface in response to the harmonic emission of the nanomaterial at 395 nm. The emitted signal induced the photocleavage of the CM-Trp carbamate linkage resulting in the release of Trp, which was monitored and quantified by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS). While a small fraction of the uncaging process could be attributed to the nonlinear absorption of CM derivatives, the main trigger responsible for Trp release was established as the second harmonic signal from BFO HNPs. This strategy may provide a new way for the application of functionalized HNPs in dual imaging delivery theranostic protocols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abismuth 3achemical bonding 3acoumarin 3adrug resistance 3aferrimagnetic materials 3aimage analysis 3airradiation 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3atryptophan 3aultraviolet radiation 0acoumarin-based photosensitive tether 0aharmonic nanoparticles 0alight-triggered uncaging 0arelease quantification 0asurface functionalization1 aGaulier, Geoffrey1 aDe Matos, Raphaël1 aOrtiz, Daniel1 aMenin, Laure1 aCampargue, Gabriel1 aMas, Christophe1 aConstant, Samuel1 aLe Dantec, Ronan1 aMugnier, Yannick1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1923-65531 aBonacina, Luigi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0476-44731 aGerber-Lemaire, Sandrine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6519-27820 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 July 05, v. 11, no. 30 p.27443-27452dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b079543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151242013100169245012000300300001600420520102600436536010801462592002801570596010401598650003501702650002901737650001601766650001601782650001301798650001101811650004401822650001701866650001201883650001601895650001601911650002601927650000701953650001401960650001101974653001901985653001402004653001602018653003502034653002902069653002002098653001502118653001702133653003502150653002902185700001902214700002102233700002602254700001602280773011902296856008602415852000902501655001202510IND60679278720221119060051.0200509e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067927872DNAL7 a10.1080/19476337.2019.15691662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Guohua10aSucesión de microbiota y cambios en el metabolito durante la fermentación de la masa madre tradicional de pan chino al vapor10aMicrobiota succession and metabolite changes during the traditional sourdough fermentation of Chinese steamed bread  ap. 172-179.  aThis study was conducted to evaluate the changes in microbial communities and metabolites during the Chinese traditional sourdough fermentation. A gradual decrease in pH values was observed throughout the fermentation process. A considerable increase in LAB and yeasts counts was noticed during the primary stage of fermentation with the corresponding increase in amino acids, glucose, lactic acid and acetic acid. During the secondary fermentation stage, LAB count started decreasing slowly, while yeast count still increased, and reached to the maximum value. However, glucose, amino acid, lactic acid and acetic acid contents decreased slightly. PCR-DGGE results identified nine bacteria, six yeasts and one mold species during the whole fermentation process. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis were the predominant species. These results would help to understand the LAB and yeasts influence on the metabolic process during the fermentation of steamed bread by Chinese traditional sourdoughs.  aThis research was supported by Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province [Grant NO. 201701D221151].  aPublisher supplied data  a201701D221151cNatural Science Foundation of Shanxi Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004480 3aLactobacillus sanfranciscensis 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacetic acid 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3abreads 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3afermentation 3aglucose 3alactic acid 3ametabolites 3amicrobial communities 3apH 3asourdough 3ayeasts 0aMicroorganisms 0asourdough 0aamino acids 0alactobacillus sanfranciscensis 0asaccharomyces cerevisiae 0aMicroorganismos 0aMasa madre 0aAminoácidos 0aLactobacillus sanfranciscensis 0aSaccharomyces cerevisiae1 aZhang, Weizhen1 aSadiq, Faizan A.1 aArbab, Sakandar Hafiz1 aHe, Guoqing0 tCyTA: journal of food.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 17, no. 1 p.172-179dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000065x1947-63457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19476337.2019.15691663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245015700202300001800359520130300377592002801680596009801708596009801806596007901904650002201983650001102005650002302016650002702039650001602066700001702082700001602099700001902115700001502134700005602149700005302205700005202258773013602310856008102446852000902527655001202536IND60791212620221118043659.0220826e20220816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079121262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c044212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDou, Xiangyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4219-577710aPhysical Insight into the Conditions Required in the Solid-Phase Molecular Self-Assembly of SDS Revealed by Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Simulation  ap. 6345-6353.  aMolecular self-assembled materials have attracted considerable interest in recent years. As part of the efforts to overcome the shortcoming that the solution-based methods were hardly applicable in preparing bulk macroscopic molecular self-assemblies, Yan [ CCS Chem.2020, 2, 98–106] developed a strategy of solid-phase molecular self-assembly (SPMSA) that allows scaling up the generation of massive supramolecular films. It is highly desired to understand the physical insight into the SPMSA at a molecular level. Here, in combination with the experimental study, we report molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the SPMSA of the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) using a coarse-grained method with the Martini force field model. The MD simulations clearly manifest that a small amount of water is required to endow the SDS molecules with sufficient mobility to self-assemble, and the smaller size of the preassembled SDS particles favors their further fusion into mesophases by reducing the total surface Gibbs free energy, while the smaller interparticle distance decreases the time for the particle fusion. The simulation results agree well with the conditions required in the experiment, confirming that SMPSA is a free-energy-favored process leading to bulk self-assembled materials.  aPublisher supplied data  a21972003cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22172004cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aNAcBeijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aGibbs free energy 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asurfactants1 aJin, Hongjun1 aWu, Tongyue1 aHuang, Jianbin1 aZhang, Bin1 aLiu, Zhirong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5070-80481 aChen, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6686-18211 aYan, Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8759-39180 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2022 Aug. 16, v. 126, no. 33 p.6345-6353dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c044213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245009200168300001800260520176400278592002802042596008102070650001502151650001502166650001902181650001702200650001602217650001202233650001102245650002302256650001302279650001702292650001502309650001802324650001602342650002202358700002202380700006002402773013602462856008102598852000902679655001202688IND60791212720221118043733.0220826e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079121272DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c045432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorgan, Wesley J.10aTemperature Effects in Flexible Adsorption Processes for Amorphous Microporous Polymers  ap. 6354-6365.  aA collection of atomistic molecular simulations is reported that illustrate the impact of adsorption temperature on species uptake and adsorbate-induced structural rearrangement for amorphous polymers of intrinsic microporosity. Temperature-sensitive structural rearrangement is evaluated by contrasting two methods: standard grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations using a rigid framework approximation and a combined Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics approach that fully incorporates framework flexibility. We report single-component gas phase adsorption isotherms for CH₄, C₂H₄, C₂H₆, C₃H₆, C₃H₈, and CO₂ across a temperature range of 250–400 K for models of an archetypal polymer of intrinsic microporosity, PIM-1. A quadratic model is presented that captures two main mechanisms of temperature-dependent adsorption-induced deformation of PIM-1 up to a relative swelling of 1.15: thermal expansion and an increased propensity to swell as a function of species uptake. Two case studies are reported that highlight the critical role of operating temperature in industrial storage and separation applications. The first study focuses on methane storage and delivery applications using a pressure–temperature swing adsorption application (PTSA). We demonstrate that larger working capacities are accompanied by increased volumetric strain between adsorption–desorption steps. The second case study considers PIM-1 as an adsorbent to separate an exemplar ternary syngas mixture at operating temperatures ranging 300–550 K.

Besides, this new versatile methodology provides a wide scope for the synthesis of different functionally substituted benzoxazine scaffolds and can be further exploited as building blocks for the synthesis of multifaceted molecular structures, especially for pharmaceutical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkylation 3acyclization reactions 3adiastereomers 3adiastereoselectivity 3aorganic chemistry 3aschiff bases1 aKushwaha, Babita1 aKarpoormath, Rajshekhar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7814-09651 aMahlalela, Mavela Cleopus1 aShinde, Suraj Raosaheb0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2020 May 14, v. 85, no. 12 p.8221-8229dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.0c004633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012100164300001600285520181500301592002802116650001702144650001302161650001402174650001002188650002002198650001602218650001302234650001102247650001302258650001502271650001502286650001502301650001802316651001402334700002502348700002302373700001802396700001902414773011102433856008202544852000902626655001202635IND60777727720221119022648.0220520e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077772772DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078220301622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJudeh, Tariq10aUse of GIS, Statistics and Machine Learning for Groundwater Quality Management: Application to Nitrate Contamination  ap. 503-514.  aGroundwater NO₃ contamination (GNC) threatens the drinkability of water in many countries worldwide. It could cause serious health problems and sometimes lead to death. This paper aims to introduce a comprehensive approach that combines GIS, statistics and Machine Learning (ML) for the groundwater quality management including both water quality assessment and prediction. The performances of this approach are discussed through its application on assessing and predicting nitrate (NO₃) concentrations in the Eocene Aquifer, Palestine. Spatiotemporal records of NO₃ over the period 1982–2019 are integrated in a database and used in this research. The database includes the following factors: well depth, well use, anthropogenic on-ground activities, watersheds, soil type and land use. Geo-statistical assessment using GIS and statistical boxplots is employed to assess the variability of NO₃ concentrations and how they are affected by the independent indicators. Assessment outcomes (NO₃ distribution and the influencing factors) were used to build the Random Forest (RF) prediction model. Such model is used to predict GNC level in groundwater based on multi-influencing factors. Assessment results indicate increasing and decreasing trends of GNC in the southern and middle parts of the study area, respectively. It also provides the RF model by the main influencing factors affecting GNC in the study area which are: well depth, well use, anthropogenic on-ground activities, watersheds and land use. Results indicate that RF has an average and maximum prediction accuracy of 88.5 and 91.7%, respectively. The well depth has the highest influence on GNC. This research could support water authority decision-makers toward the adoption of sustainable groundwater protection plans in Palestine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEocene epoch 3aaquifers 3adatabases 3adeath 3adecision making 3agroundwater 3aland use 3amodels 3anitrates 3aprediction 3asoil types 3astatistics 3awater quality 3aPalestine1 aAlmasri, Mohammad N.1 aShadeed, Sameer M.1 aBian, Hanbing1 aShahrour, Isam0 tWater resources.g2022 June, v. 49, no. 3 p.503-514dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl7406x0097-80787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S00978078220301623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151242009400179245007900273300001600352520103500368592002801403650002801431650001701459650001701476650002001493650001901513650001101532650003101543650002001574650001501594650000901609650001301618650002301631650002401654653001201678653003201690653001201722653002001734653001501754653001301769653003501782653001301817653002601830653001701856700003301873773011901906856008602025852000902111655001202120IND60679279020221119061534.0200509e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067927902DNAL7 a10.1080/19476337.2019.15709752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzydłowska, Aleksandra10aElaboración de postres congelados de calabaza potencialmente probióticos y simbióticos10aDevelopment of potentially probiotic and synbiotic pumpkin frozen desserts  ap. 251-259.  aThe aim of this work was the development of novel potentially probiotic and synbiotic sorbets using one variety of pumpkin in laboratory conditions and estimation of products quality during storage. Five kinds of fermented pumpkin sorbets were produced with one probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lock 0900, concentrations of 17% added sugar with or without pineapple juice addition. The fruit-pumpkin sorbets contained 1%, 2%, 3% of inulin addition. Products were frozen and stored for 6 months at −30°C. On the basis of the research carried out, the hypothesis assumed was proved: it was possible to use a probiotic bacterial strain and conditions of fermentation of pumpkin pulp, which is a semi-finished product, for sensory acceptable sorbet, containing an appropriate number of probiotic bacteria. Developed pumpkin sorbets, after storage at −30°C were characterized by good sensory quality and contained an appropriate probiotic bacterial number, therefore could be considered as potentially probiotic products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aadded sugars 3afermentation 3afrozen desserts 3afrozen storage 3ainulin 3alaboratory experimentation 3apineapple juice 3aprobiotics 3apulp 3apumpkins 3asensory properties 3astorage temperature 0aPumpkin 0aprobiotic bacterial strains 0asorbets 0afunctional food 0aprebiotics 0acalabaza 0acepas probióticas bacterianas 0asorbetes 0aalimentos funcionales 0aprebióticos1 aKołożyn-Krajewska, Danuta,0 tCyTA: journal of food.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 17, no. 1 p.251-259dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000065x1947-63457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19476337.2019.15709753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01705naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011800161300001800279520053200297592002800829650001600857650002300873650002300896650002300919650003300942650002500975700002901000700001801029700001801047700001901065700002001084700002201104773013401126856007401260852000901334655001201343IND60660251320221122062037.0190823e20140729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066025132DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc03660c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRegenass, Pierre10aDiastereoselective synthesis of novel aza-diketopiperazines via a domino cyclohydrocarbonylation/addition process  ap. 9657-9660.  aHerein, we report an unprecedented, short and diastereo-selective synthesis of newly reported aza-diketopiperazine (aza-DKP) scaffolds starting from amino acids.

However, several serious outbreaks of foodborne illness have been recorded in European countries, Japan, and North America. Many companies in Latvia nowadays are producing this type of products. The aim of this study was to characterize the incidence of Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Salmonella spp., and Listeria spp. in microgreens, sprouts, and seeds intended for domestic production of microgreens on retail market in Riga, Latvia, from January to April 2019. The background microflora was identified as well. A total of 45 samples were purchased, including fresh and processed sprouts, microgreens, baby greens, as well as seeds intended for domestic production of microgreens and sprouts. The samples were processed according to the methods set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)—ISO/TS 13136:2012 for STEC, ISO 6579-1:2017 for Salmonella spp., and ISO 11290-1:2017 for Listeria spp. Molecular detection of Salmonella spp. was also performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The typical and atypical colonies isolated from selective plates were identified with matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Listeria monocytogenes was not detected in any of the tested samples. However, the presence of Listeria innocua was detected in two (4.4%) of the samples. Three (6.7%) samples of dried sprouts were positive for the STEC virulence genes. Salmonella spp. was detected in one (2.2%) sample of common sunflower seeds. Altogether, 46 different background bacterial species were identified. The majority were environmental bacteria characteristic to soil, water, and plants, including coliform bacteria. The results provide evidence that microgreens and seeds available for Latvian consumers are generally safe, however, attention has to be paid to dried sprouts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aInternational Organization for Standardization 3aListeria innocua 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella 3aShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli 3abusiness enterprises 3acoliform bacteria 3adesorption 3afoodborne illness 3agenes 3agreen leafy vegetables 3ahealthy diet 3amass spectrometry 3amicrogreens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aretail marketing 3aseeds 3asoil 3asunflower seed 3avirulence 3avirulent strains 3aJapan 3aLatvia 3aNorth America 0amicrogreens 0asprouts 0aseeds 0aSTEC 0aListeria spp 0aSalmonella spp1 aOzola, Aija1 aMiltiņa, Elizabete1 aAlksne, Laura1 aMeistere, Irēna1 aCibrovska, Alla1 aGrantiņa-Ieviņa, Lelde0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2020 July 01, v. 17, no. 7 p.420-428dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl3973649x1556-71257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2019.27333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01990naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001900149245011300168300001600281520094800297592002801245650002601273650001801299650001001317650001801327650001901345650001401364650001401378700002601392700001901418700002101437773010001458856008501558852000901643655001201652IND4460242020221122155338.0141111e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446024202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2011.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTobin, John T.14aThe effect of native and modified konjac on the physical attributes of pasteurized and UHT-treated skim milk  ap. 790-797.  aThe aim of the current study was to examine the influence of addition of mechanically modified konjac glucomannan, on the physical properties of pasteurized and ultra-high-temperature (UHT) treated skim milk. The effect of adding modified konjac (0–0.12%, w/w) on the viscosity and stability of skim milk, following pasteurization or UHT treatment, was investigated. It was possible to add modified konjac at levels up to 0.12% (w/w) without phase separation, as compared to <0.03% (w/w) native konjac. Addition of modified konjac increased the viscosity of pasteurized and UHT skim from ∼2.0 to 3.6 mPa s, with UHT samples having increased stability to sedimentation during simulated storage. The addition of modified konjac had little effect on particle size or colour of the skim milk post heating. Addition of modified konjac could provide a mechanism to enhance the physical properties of both pasteurized and UHT-treated skim milk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmorphophallus konjac 3aUHT treatment 3acolor 3aparticle size 3apasteurization 3askim milk 3aviscosity1 aFitzsimons, Sinead M.1 aKelly, Alan L.1 aFenelon, Mark A.0 tInternational dairy journal.g2011 Oct., v. 21, no. 10 p.790-797dElsevier Ltdx0958-69467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2011.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245016500179520155200344592002801896650002701924650000801951650002401959650002001983650001402003650001502017650001902032650003302051650003002084650001102114650002802125650001402153650001102167650001202178651001202190653001702202653001602219653003002235653001702265653002702282700006502309700002702374700001802401700002302419700002302442700002302465700002002488700002202508700002702530700001802557773009702575856009002672852000902762655001202771IND60679880220221123045313.0200824e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067988022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2019.1053262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkeke, Ogochukwu C.10aReport of high prevalence of schistosome infection in Biomphalaria snails from a geographic area with no previous prevalence of human schistosomiasis in Nigeria  aPrevious study using the traditional method of screening snails for infection reported shedding of Schistosoma cercaria by Biomphalaria snails from a river in Nkalagu, southeastern Nigeria. This is contrary to published reports that Biomphalaria from this part of the country does not shed schistosome cercaria. Here, we employed the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods to screen and characterize the Biomphalaria snails from Nkalagu. Snails were collected from the River Uzuru in dry season, identified and subjected to molecular assays. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from whole tissues of the 212 Biomphalaria snails and amplified using conventional PCR to check for the schistosome infection level. Assay for the detection of S. mansoni infection was further done using a nested PCR (nPCR). We amplified the entire internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) regions from gDNA of the 212 snails. The representative samples were sequenced and subjected to BLAST searches to confirm snail species. Of the 212 snails screened, 164 (77.4%) of the snails were infected with schistosomes, but only 16 (9.76%) of the snails were positive for S. mansoni infection. Amplification of the snails’ ITS2 region yielded a product of 460 bp, and BLAST searches confirmed the snails to be B. pfeifferi, and BLAST searches confirmed the snails to be B. pfeifferi. This paper reports for the first time the presence of S. mansoni positive B. pfeifferi in Nkalagu, which suggest there may be cases of intestinal schistosomiasis in this part of Nigeria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBiomphalaria pfeifferi 3aDNA 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3aanimal diseases 3acercariae 3adry season 3ahuman diseases 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arivers 3aschistosomiasis mansoni 3ascreening 3asnails 3atissues 3aNigeria 0aBiomphalaria 0aNeested PCR 0aPolymerase chain reaction 0aSchistosomes 0aS. mansoni, Sequencing1 aAkinwale, Olaoluwa P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1054-93931 aUbachukwu, Patience O.1 aGyang, Pam V.1 aHenry, Emmanuel U.1 aNwafor, Timothy E.1 aDaniel, Bilkisu M.1 aEbi, Sowechi E.1 aAnorue, Chioma O.1 aChukwuka, Christian O.1 aDido, Mann S.0 tActa tropica.g2020 Oct., v. 210 p.105326-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2019.1053263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03389naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001500188245007800203300001600281506007600297520177000373592002802143506003702171650003002208650002802238650002502266650002302291650001002314650001202324650001402336650001902350650001602369650001002385650002402395650002202419650001602441650002302457650001802480650001402498650001102512650001402523650001402537700001202551700001802563700001502581700002002596700001902616773011002635856008102745852000902826655001202835IND60580685320221207140148.0170930e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058068532DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-017-3207-z2doi7 aPMC58890862pmcid7 a296324162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jun10aArsenic methylation by a genetically engineered Rhizobium-legume symbiont  ap. 259-269.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Arsenic (As) is one of the most widespread environmental contaminants. The aim of our study was to test a novel bioremediation system based on the symbiosis between leguminous plant and genetically engineered rhizobia. METHODS: The arsenite [As(III)] S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase gene (CrarsM) from the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was inserted into the chromosome of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii strain R3. The As methylation ability of the recombinant Rhizobium was tested under free living conditions and in symbiosis with red clover plants. Arsenic speciation was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Under free-living conditions, CrarsM-recombinant R. leguminosarum gained the ability to methylate As(III) to methylated arsenicals, including methylarsenate [MAs(V)], dimethylarsenate [DMAs(V)] and trimethylarsine oxide [TMAs(V)O]. Red clover plants were inoculated with either control (non-recombinant) or CrarsM-recombinant R. leguminosarum and exposed to 5 or 10 μM arsenite. No methylated As species were detected in red clover plants inoculated with control R. leguminosarum. In contrast, all three methylated species were detected in both the nodules and the shoots when the recombinant Rhizobium established symbiosis with red clover, accounting for 74.7–75.1% and 29.1–42.4% of the total As in the two plant tissues, respectively. The recombinant symbiont also volatilized small amounts of As. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that engineered rhizobia expressing an algal arsM gene can methylate and volatilize As, providing a proof of concept for potential future use of legume-rhizobia symbionts for As bioremediation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3aS-adenosylmethionine 3aTrifolium pratense 3aalgae 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3abioremediation 3achromosomes 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3amass spectrometry 3amethylation 3amethyltransferases 3aplant tissues 3apollution 3ashoots 3asymbionts 3asymbiosis1 aXu, Yan1 aCao, Tingting1 aChen, Jian1 aRosen, Barry P.1 aZhao, Fang-Jie0 tPlant and soil.g2017 July, v. 416, no. 1-2 p.259-269dSpringer International Publishingx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-017-3207-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245014800166500001400314520156900328592002801897650002401925650001701949650001401966650001501980650001501995650001002010650001602020650001502036650001702051650001202068650001102080650002802091650001902119650000902138650001002147650001702157700002102174700004102195700002002236700002402256700002102280700002302301700002702324700002202351700002702373773012602400856007702526852000902603655001202612IND60711639520221119025446.0200928e20200903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071163952DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox90908212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJado, Juan  Carlos10aNephroprotective Effect of Cilastatin against Gentamicin-Induced Renal Injury In Vitro and In Vivo without Altering Its Bactericidal Efficiency  aNAL-light  aGentamicin is a used antibiotic that causes nephrotoxicity in 10–20% of treatment periods, which limits its use considerably. Our results have shown that cilastatin may be a promising therapeutic alternative in toxin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). Here, we investigated its potential use as a nephroprotector against gentamicin-induced AKI in vitro and in vivo. Porcine renal cells and rats were treated with gentamicin and/or cilastatin. In vivo nephrotoxicity was analyzed by measuring biochemical markers and renal morphology. Different apoptotic, oxidative and inflammatory parameters were studied at cellular and systemic levels. Megalin, mainly responsible for the entry of gentamicin into the cells, was also analyzed. Results show that cilastatin protects cells from gentamicin-induced AKI. Cilastatin decreased creatinine, BUN, kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and severe morphological changes previously increased by gentamicin in rats. The interference of cilastatin with lipid rafts cycling leads to decreased expression of megalin, and therefore gentamicin uptake and myeloid bodies, resulting in a decrease of apoptotic, oxidative and inflammatory events. Moreover, cilastatin did not prevent bacterial death by gentamicin. Cilastatin reduced gentamicin-induced AKI by preventing key steps in the amplification of the damage, which is associated to the disruption of megalin-gentamicin endocytosis. Therefore, cilastatin might represent a novel therapeutic tool in the prevention and treatment of gentamicin-induced AKI in the clinical setting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute kidney injury 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3abiomarkers 3acreatinine 3adeath 3aendocytosis 3agentamicin 3akidney cells 3akidneys 3alipids 3anephroprotective effect 3anephrotoxicity 3arats 3aswine 3atherapeutics1 aHumanes, Blanca 1 aGonzález-Nicolás, María  Ángeles1 aCamaño, Sonia 1 aLara, José  Manuel1 aLópez, Beatriz,1 aCercenado, Emilia 1 aGarcía-Bordas, Julio 1 aTejedor, Alberto 1 aLázaro, Luis Alberto,0 tAntioxidants.g2020 Sept. 03, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90908213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245015400162500001400316520139500330592002801725650002501753650001701778650001301795650001601808650001701824650001201841650002101853650002001874650002301894650001501917650002001932650001101952650002101963650001301984650001601997700002002013700002002033700001602053700001802069700002102087700002002108773012602128856007702254852000902331655001202340IND60711639620221119025439.0200928e20200903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071163962DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox90908232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Jianzhang,10aUbiquinone Supplementation with 300 mg on Glycemic Control and Antioxidant Status in Athletes: A Randomized, Double-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Trial  aNAL-light  aThe aim of this study is to investigate the glycemic profile, oxidative stress, and antioxidant capacity in athletes after 12 weeks of ubiquinone supplementation. It was a double-blinded, randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled study. Thirty-one well-trained college athletes were randomly assigned to ubiquinone (300 mg/d, n = 17) or placebo group (n = 14). The glycemic profile [fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI)], plasma and erythrocyte malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and ubiquinone status were measured. After supplementation, the plasma ubiquinone concentration was significantly increased (p < 0.05) and the level of erythrocyte MDA was significantly lower in the ubiquinone group than in the placebo group (p < 0.01). There was a significant correlation between white blood cell (WBC) ubiquinone and glycemic parameters [HbA1c, r = -0.46, p < 0.05; HOMA-IR, r = -0.67, p < 0.01; QUICKI, r = 0.67, p < 0.01]. In addition, athletes with higher WBC ubiquinone level (≥0.5 nmol/g) showed higher erythrocyte TAC and QUICKI and lower HOMA-IR. In conclusion, we demonstrated that athletes may show a better antioxidant capacity with higher ubiquinone status after 12 weeks of supplementation, which may further improve glycemic control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aathletes 3acorrelation 3aerythrocytes 3aglucose 3aglycemic control 3aglycohemoglobin 3ainsulin resistance 3aleukocytes 3amalondialdehyde 3amodels 3aoxidative stress 3aplacebos 3aubiquinones1 aZhang, Bosheng,1 aChen, Hung-Wun 1 aLee, Po-Fu 1 aZhang, Yunji,1 aTseng, Ching-Yu 1 aLin, Ping-Ting 0 tAntioxidants.g2020 Sept. 03, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90908233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01597naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006200145245011800207300001800325520053900343592002800882650002200910650001400932650002300946650001300969650001200982650002200994700005801016773013301074856007901207852000901286655001201295IND60699473920221119155023.0200619e20200514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069947392DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.0c004812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartolo, Nicole D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9907-777410aEvidence against Single-Electron Transfer in the Additions of Most Organomagnesium Reagents to Carbonyl Compounds  ap. 7848-7862.  aA radical clock system was developed to investigate single-electron transfer (SET) in the reactions of organomagnesium reagents with carbonyl compounds.

Evidence-based decision making for the progressive control of the disease requires spatially-explicit information on its occurrence and prevalence, as well as on the distribution and abundance of the tsetse vector.In the framework of the continental Atlas of tsetse and African animal trypanosomosis (AAT), a geo-referenced database was assembled for Nigeria, based on the systematic review of 133 scientific publications (period January 1990 - March 2019).The three main species of trypanosomes responsible for the disease (i.e. Trypanosoma vivax, T. congolense and T. brucei) were found to be widespread, thus posing a national-level problem. Their geographic distribution extends beyond the tsetse-infested belt, owing to the combined effect of animal movement and mechanical transmission by non-tsetse vectors. T. simiae, the major trypanosomal pathogen in pigs, T. godfreyi and the human-infective T. brucei gambiense were also reported. AAT was reported in a number of susceptible host species, including cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, camels, horses, donkeys and dogs, while no study on wildlife was identified. Estimates of prevalence are heavily influenced by the sensitivity of the diagnostic techniques, ranging from an average of 3.5% for blood films to 31.0% for molecular techniques.Two riverine tsetse species (i.e. Glossina palpalis palpalis and G. tachinoides) were found to have the broadest geographical range, as they were detected in all six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. By contrast, the distribution of savannah species (i.e. G. morsitans submorsitans and G. longipalpis) appears to be highly fragmented, and limited to protected areas. Very little information is available for forest species, with one single paper reporting on G. fusca congolensis and G. nigrofusca nigrofusca in the Niger Delta region.The future development of a national Atlas of tsetse and AAT, relying on both published and unpublished information, could improve on the present review and provide further epidemiological evidence for decision making.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlossina longipalpis 3aGlossina morsitans submorsitans 3aGlossina palpalis palpalis 3aGlossina tachinoides 3aTrypanosoma brucei 3aTrypanosoma congolense 3aTrypanosoma gambiense 3aTrypanosoma simiae 3aTrypanosoma vivax 3aanimal health 3aasses 3ablood 3acamels 3acattle 3aclimate 3aconservation areas 3adatabases 3adecision making 3adiagnostic techniques 3adisease control 3adogs 3aforests 3ageographical distribution 3ageoreferencing 3agoats 3ahorses 3ahosts 3aland cover 3apathogens 3apolitics 3ariparian areas 3ariver deltas 3asavannas 3asheep 3aswine 3asystematic review 3atrypanosomiasis 3awildlife 3aNigeria 0aTsetse 0aTrypanosomosis 0aGIS 0aNeglected tropical diseases 0aAbbreviations.

Results showed an important spatial heterogeneity in the nutrient content and water properties of lowland catchment due to the effects of the small dam and the effluents of a sewage treatment work. Taking into account the values of hydraulic retention time, the dam could be considered as an optimally dimensioned pre-dam. Therefore, it removed on average more than 25% of total phosphorus (TP) while no net removal was obtained for TN during the studied period. Palmones River exported 11.3 TonsP year⁻¹ of TP and 72.1 TonsN year⁻¹ of TN to the estuary showing important seasonal differences. Less than 10% from the total amount of nutrient was exported during low flow conditions, while in four months with important flooding events, the percentage of total nitrogen exported exceeded 64%.  aPublisher supplied data 3arivers 3aestuaries 3adams (hydrology) 3apollution load 3apollution control 3aseasonal variation 3aphosphorus 3anitrogen 3aMediterranean climate 3ahydrochemistry 3awater flow 3aSpain1 aNiell, F.

Based on the results of DPPH and HPLC, contribution ratio of each tea compound was analyzed by the Pearson correlation analysis and the partial least squares regression (PLSR). The Pearson correlation analysis showed that the order of correlation between the area of 13 peaks and the antioxidant ability of tea samples was x8 > x6 > x3 > x13 > x10 > x7 > x2 > x5 > x11 > x9 > x4 > x12 > x1; the regression equation fit by PLSR was Y = 47.258 − 0.760x1 + 0.287x2 − 1.484x3 − 0.569x4 + 0.674x5 + 2.257x6 + 1.698x7 + 1.389x8 − 0.188x9 + 0.467x10 + 0.297x11 + 1.314x12 + 0.963x13. We identified nine common peaks by reference standard substances: the x3 was gallic acid (GA), x4 was theobromine, x5 was catechuic acid (CA), x6 was epigallocatechin (EGC), x8 was epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), x9 was caffeine, x10 was epicatechin (EC), x12 was epicatechin gallate (ECG), and x13 was gallocatechin gallate (GCG). Based on the study of spectrum‐effect correlation, we obtain a better understanding of the antioxidant activity of complex tea polyphenols component. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Identify the contribution of specific chemical compound to antioxidant activity by the coefficients in PLSR equation and provide a deeper insight into the joint effect of multiple ingredients of tea. Further, we can infer the DPPH free radical scavenging ability of a new kind of tea by the PLSR equation without chemical detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3abeverages 3ablack tea 3acaffeine 3aepicatechin 3aepigallocatechin gallate 3aequations 3afree radicals 3agallic acid 3agreen tea 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aoolong tea 3apolyphenols 3areference standards 3atheobromine 3awhite tea1 aLin, Yong1 aLi, Qingsheng1 aGu, Yuxuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8680-35220 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2020 July, v. 44, no. 7 p.e13270-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.132703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245012200175520154200297592002801839650002901867650001701896650001701913650001601930650002101946650002001967650001401987650001002001650001402011650001302025650000902038650001302047650001902060650001702079650001702096653001702113653002502130653001802155700001902173700002402192700001602216773009702232856009002329852000902419655001202428IND60679880820221123045425.0200318e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067988082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2019.1053222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOzpinar, Necati10aAmoebicidal activity of benzothiazole on Acanthamoeba castellanii cysts and trophozoites and its cytotoxic potentials  aAcanthamoeba spp. are free-living amoebae isolated from many ecological areas such as swimming pools, dams and lakes, and soil. Granulomatous amebic encephalitis and amebic keratitis, caused by Acanthamoeba spp., usually occurs in chronically ill, debilitated individuals, in immunosuppressed patients and treatment is quite difficult. This study aimed to determine the effect of benzothiazole on trophozoite and cyst forms of Acanthamoeba castellanii (A.castellanii). Axenic cultures of A. castellanii trophozoites and cysts were prepared to test the amoebicidal activity of benzothiazole. The concentrations of benzothiazole in 24-well plates were prepared as 0.08%, 0.04%, 0.02%, 0.01%, 0.005%, and A. castellanii cysts and trophozoites were added to these cultures. Parasites were counted at 0, ½, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h in the cell counter after staining with trypan blue. Cytotoxicity of benzothiazole on the WI-38 human fibroblast cell line was also tested. Between 0.08% and 0.01% concentrations of benzothiazole showed a strong amoebicidal activity at 24 and 48 h. A significant decrease in 0.005% concentration in the number of live trophozoites and cysts was detected between 6 and 48 h. As a result of the cytotoxicity studies, benzothiazole did not show any cytotoxic effect on the WI-38 human fibroblast cell line even at 1% concentration. Benzothiazole could be concluded as a new therapeutic agent against Acanthamoeba. On the other hand, in vivo studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of the biological effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthamoeba castellanii 3acytotoxicity 3aencephalitis 3afibroblasts 3ahuman cell lines 3ain vivo studies 3akeratitis 3alakes 3aparasites 3apatients 3asoil 3astaining 3aswimming pools 3atherapeutics 3atrophozoites 0aAcanthamoeba 0aAmoebicidal activity 0aBenzothiazole1 aOzpinar, Hulya1 aBakay, Berna Baysal1 aTunc, Tutku0 tActa tropica.g2020 Mar., v. 203 p.105322-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2019.1053223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04236naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245013900165500001400304520217500318592002802493650003402521650001502555650001102570650002102581650003102602650002802633650002502661650001402686650001102700650001402711650002102725650001902746650002502765650001102790650001502801650003502816650001802851650002402869650001202893650001502905650001602920650001302936650000902949650001102958650001902969650001302988650001303001650002803014650001303042650002403055650001703079650002503096651001003121700002203131700002303153700002303176700001803199700002203217700002203239700002503261700002803286773012603314856007703440852000903517655001203526IND60711639920221119025823.0200928e20200903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071163992DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox90908262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrindisi, Matteo 10aChemical Profile, Antioxidant, Anti-Inflammatory, and Anti-Cancer Effects of Italian Salvia rosmarinus Spenn. Methanol Leaves Extracts  aNAL-light  aIn this study, we evaluated and compared the chemical composition, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-proliferative effects of four methanol extracts (R1–R4), of Salvia rosmarinus Spenn. in two different sites of Southern Italy obtained by maceration or ultrasound-assisted extraction. Extracts of S. rosmarinus collected on the Ionian coast are indicated with the abbreviations R1 (maceration) and R2 (ultrasound-assisted extraction). Extracts of S. rosmarinus collected on the Tyrrhenian coast are indicated with the abbreviations R3 (maceration) and R4 (ultrasound-assisted extraction). The chemical composition was analyzed using High Pressure liquid chromatography–Diod-Array detection–Electrospray ionization–Quadrupole–Mass Spectroscopy (HPLC-DAD-ESI-Q-MS). The antioxidant activity was analyzed by 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), β-carotene bleaching, and Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) assays. Antioxidant features were also assessed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW-264.7 murine macrophages, evaluating Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production; in the same experimental model, the anti-inflammatory activity of the extracts was investigated. Interestingly, all extracts displayed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. They exhibited significative nitrite production inhibitory activity, whith IC₅₀ values ranging from 3.46 to 5.53 µg/mL, without impairing cell viability. The anti-inflammatory activity was also investigated by Western Blotting and immunofluorescence assay, highlighting the R3 and R4 extracts ability to reduce NF-κB translocation, as well as to disrupt the MAPKs signaling pathway. Extracts exhibited both potential anti-proliferative activity on breast cancer cells, inducing apoptosis, without affecting non-tumorigenic cells, and the ability to inhibit MDA-MB-231 cells’ motility. Finally, the rosemary extracts treatment significantly reduced the power of conditioned media, from MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells to induce nitrite production on RAW 264.7 cells, confirming their promising anti-inflammatory activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aRosmarinus 3aSalvia 3aWestern blotting 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3aassays 3ableaching 3abreast neoplasms 3acell viability 3achemical composition 3acoasts 3aextraction 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aleaf extracts 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliquids 3amaceration 3amacrophages 3amethanol 3amice 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3anitrites 3apressure 3areactive oxygen species 3arosemary 3asignal transduction 3aspectroscopy 3aultrasonic treatment 3aItaly1 aBouzidi, Chouaha 1 aFrattaruolo, Luca 1 aLoizzo, Monica  R.1 aTundis, Rosa 1 aDugay, Annabelle 1 aDeguin, Brigitte 1 aCappello, Anna  Rita1 aCappello, Maria  Stella0 tAntioxidants.g2020 Sept. 03, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90908263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01673naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245012400157300002000281520061300301592002800914650002400942650001300966650001800979650001900997700002401016700001501040700002801055700001501083700002701098773013501125856007801260852000901338655001201347IND60541628220170629000000.0160822e20150930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054162822DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b086142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMo, Zhenbo10aFacile Reversibility by Design: Tuning Small Molecule Capture and Activation by Single Component Frustrated Lewis Pairs  ap. 12227-12230.  aA series of single component FLPs has been investigated for small molecule capture, with the finding that through tuning of both the thermodynamics of binding/activation and the degree of preorganization (i.e., ΔS⧧) reversibility can be brought about at (or close to) room temperature.

Due to their functions and location, RPE cells are constantly exposed to oxidative stress. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have shown to have antioxidant effects by different mechanisms. For this reason, we designed an in vitro study to compare 10 formulations of DHA and EPA supplements from different origins and combined in different proportions, evaluating their effect on cell viability, cell proliferation, reactive oxygen species production, and cell migration using ARPE-19 cells. Furthermore, we assessed their ability to rescue RPE cells from the oxidative conditions seen in diabetic retinopathy. Our results showed that the different formulations of n3-PUFAs have a beneficial effect on cell viability and proliferation and are able to restore oxidative induced RPE damage. We observed that the n3-PUFA provided different results alone or combined in the same supplement. When combined, the best results were obtained in formulations that included a higher proportion of EPA than DHA. Moreover, n3-PUFA in the form of ethyl-esters had a worse performance when compared with triglycerides or phospholipid based formulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3acell movement 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3acells 3adiabetic retinopathy 3adietary supplements 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aepithelium 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3ametabolism 3aoxidative stress 3aphospholipids 3areactive oxygen species 3aretina 3atriacylglycerols1 aHernandez, María 1 aBilbao-Malavé, Valentina 1 aFernandez-Robredo, Patricia 1 aGonzález-Zamora, Jorge 1 aGarcia-Garcia, Laura 1 aIspizua, Nahia 1 aRecalde, Sergio 1 aGarcia-Layana, Alfredo 0 tAntioxidants.g2020 Sept. 04, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90908283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01158naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245009400164300001800258520017100276592002800447650002700475650002300502650002300525700002100548700002400569700001900593700002700612773013300639856007500772852000900847655001200856IND60659052120221120141840.0190827e20110802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065905212DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc13405a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbright, Thomas A.10aReversible intercyclobutadiene haptotropism in cyclopentadienylcobalt linear [4]phenylene  ap. 9039-9041.  aCyclopentadienylcobalt complexes of linear [4]phenylene undergo thermally reversible photoinduced metallahaptotropism between the inner and outer cyclobutadiene ring.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions1 aOldenhof, Sander1 aOloba, Oluwakemi A.1 aPadilla, Robin1 aVollhardt, K.

We found that total polyphenols and flavonoids contents of tumorous stem mustard leaf extracts (TSMLE) were significant higher than that of tumorous stem mustard stem extracts (TSMSE). The percentage of isorhamnetin 5-O-hexoside, methyl quercetin O-hexoside, and luteolin O-hexosyl-O-hexosyl-O-hexoside in TSMLE were 170, 230 and 694 times higher than that in TSMSE. TSMLE presented stronger antioxidant capacity against 2,2'-Azino-bis[3-ethylbenzothiazoline]-6-sulfonic acid cationic free radical (ABTS⁺) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicals, and it also showed higher reducing power and ferric reducing antioxidant power. Both TSMLE and TSMSE inhibited lung carcinoma cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, while TSMLE was more effective against A549 cells than TSMSE. This is the first report indicates that tumorous stem mustard, especially its leaf, is a potential diet source in preventing of oxidative stress and cancer.  aThis study was supported by the Plan for Supporting the Development of Youth Scientific Research Talent of Yangtze Normal University, and Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Commission (KJQN201801436).  aPublisher supplied data  aKJQN201801436cYangtze Normal University, and Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Commission 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aBrassica juncea var. tumida 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantioxidant activity 3acell growth 3achemical composition 3adiet 3adose response 3afree radicals 3aisorhamnetin 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3alung neoplasms 3aluteolin 3aneoplasm cells 3aoxidative stress 3apolyphenols 3aquercetin 3araw materials 3astem extracts 3asulfonic acids 0aTumorous stem mustard 0aantioxidant activity 0aanti-tumor activity 0aphytochemicals 0aphenolics 0aMostaza de tallo tumoral 0aActividad antioxidante 0aActividad antitumoral 0aFitoquímicos 0aFenólicos1 aYang, Hongyan1 aLi, Changman1 aTan, Si1 aGao, Xiaoxv1 aYao, Min1 aZheng, Qiaoran0 tCyTA: journal of food.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 17, no. 1 p.272-279dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000065x1947-63457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19476337.2019.15773033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008900168300001600257520110600273592002801379650001801407650001901425650002101444650002001465650001001485650001201495650003101507650002501538650002601563650000901589650001301598650004001611650001201651653002401663653003701687653001701724653002601741653000801767700001601775700001601791700001801807700001501825700001401840773012101854856008201975852000902057655001202066IND60533239220221121102529.0160728e20151002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053323922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.08.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJianqiang, Peng10aExpression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha ameliorate myocardial ischemia in rat  ap. 691-695.  aHypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1a), the upstream regulator of Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is the vital hypoxia related gene expression control factor. To evaluate HIF-1a therapeutic efficacy to acute myocardial infarction, the HIF-1a expressing recombinant Adeno-associated virus (rAAV) was constructed. The Wistar rat ischemic heart animal model was established with left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. The ischemic rats were treated with HIF-1a expressing and GFP expressing rAAVs respectively. Four weeks post the injection, the cardiac function of treated rat was compared by TM_WAVE system; size of infracted area was calculated by Evan's blue stain and capillary density was determined by CD31 immunohistochemical staining. Compare to the control group, the rats received HIF-1a expressing rAAV have smaller infracted heart size, the better heart function and higher capillary density than vehicle control group. The results show that the injection of HIF1a expressing rAAV can improve cardiac function and ameliorate acute myocardial ischemia (AMI) in rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3acardiac output 3acoronary vessels 3agene expression 3aheart 3ahypoxia 3ahypoxia-inducible factor 1 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amyocardial infarction 3arats 3astaining 3avascular endothelial growth factors 3aviruses 0aMyocardial ischemia 0aHypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha 0aGene therapy 0aAdeno-associate virus 0aRat1 aPing, Zhang1 aXinmin, Fan1 aZhenhua, Yuan1 aMing, Zhou1 aYing, Guo0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Oct. 02, v. 465 p.691-695dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.08.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01752naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245004800159300002000207520084400227592002801071650001601099650001601115650001301131650002101144650001801165700002201183700002401205773013401229856007801363852000901441655001201450IND60541628420221122023444.0160822e20151007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054162842DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b045902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yitao10aAza-Glycine Induces Collagen Hyperstability  ap. 12422-12425.  aHydrogen bonding is fundamental to life on our planet, and nature utilizes H-bonding in nearly all biomolecular interactions. Often, H-bonding is already maximized in natural biopolymer systems such as nucleic acids, where Watson–Crick H-bonds are fully paired in double-helical structures. Synthetic chemistry allows molecular editing of biopolymers beyond nature’s capability. Here we demonstrate that substitution of glycine (Gly) with aza-glycine in collagen may increase the number of interfacial cross-strand H-bonds, leading to hyperstability in the triple-helical form. Gly is the only amino acid that has remained intolerant to substitution in collagen. Our results highlight the vital importance of maximizing H-bonding in higher order biopolymer systems using minimally perturbing alternatives to nature’s building blocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abiopolymers 3acollagen 3ahydrogen bonding 3anucleic acids1 aMalamakal, Roy M.1 aChenoweth, David M.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Oct. 07, v. 137, no. 39 p.12422-12425dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b045903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03439naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245025800167300001200425520159600437592002802033650004402061650002202105650001502127650000802142650001602150650001602166650001002182650002202192650001502214650001302229650001202242650002602254650001202280650001902292650001702311650000702328650001702335650003302352650001902385650002302404650002202427650001602449650002102465650002702486650001002513700001802523700002202541700002102563700002002584700002402604773014102628856008302769852000902852655001202861IND60777728720221119022855.0220628e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077772872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-022-05655-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain, Harshita13aAn Eco-sustainable Green Approach for Biosorption of Methylene Blue Dye from Textile Industry Wastewater by Sugarcane Bagasse, Peanut Hull, and Orange Peel: A Comparative Study Through Response Surface Methodology, Isotherms, Kinetic, and Thermodynamics  ap. 187.  aThe present work focuses on the feasibility of elimination of Methylene Blue dye from the textile wastewater with the use of economical organic biosorbents like Sugarcane Bagasse (SCB), Peanut Hull (PHB) and Orange peel (OPB). Batch adsorption tests were performed based on pH, temperature, contact time, initial adsorbate concentration, and dose of biosorbents as independent variables by employing a central composite design (CCD) approach of response surface methodology (RSM). After 90 min of contact time, the dye adsorption equilibrium was reached. It was explained with the help of Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms for the full concentration ranges of 20–100 mg/L. RSM combined with CCD is used to optimize the experiments for achieving the optimum conditions for the removal of dye. The adsorption data are used for the kinetic modeling from the pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order kinetic equations. Thermodynamic parameters such as changes in entropy (∆S), enthalpy (∆H), and free energy (∆G) were investigated, also showed that the adsorption was natural and endothermic by removing the randomness of color at the solid and liquid interface. Biosorbent characterization was additionally performed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to study the adsorption of Methylene Blue before and after the tests. The dimensionless separation factor (RL) and expected results illustrated that SCB, PHB, and OCB could be used to substitute commercially available biosorbents for aqueous solutions and eliminate Methylene Blue dye from textile wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGibbs free energy 3aadsorption 3aair 3abiosorbents 3abiosorption 3acolor 3acomparative study 3aendothermy 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3aindustrial wastewater 3aliquids 3amethylene blue 3aorange peels 3apH 3apeanut hulls 3aresponse surface methodology 3asoil pollution 3asorption isotherms 3asugarcane bagasse 3atemperature 3atextile industry 3atextile mill effluents 3awater1 aYadav, Varsha1 aRajput, Vishnu D.1 aMinkina, Tatiana1 aAgarwal, Smriti1 aGarg, Manoj Chandra0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2022 June, v. 233, no. 6 p.187-187dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-022-05655-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245010800166300001800274520116800292592002801460650001501488650001201503650001101515650001201526650001701538650002201555650002001577650002501597650001101622650001101633650000901644650001301653650001101666650001501677650001301692651001001705653001801715653002101733653001501754653002201769653001901791653002901810700002201839773011401861856008601975852000902061655001202070IND60600252020221119070533.0180703e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060025202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2014.06.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdwin, M.10aTechno-economic studies on hybrid energy based cooling system for milk preservation in isolated regions  ap. 1023-1030.  aIn developing countries like India, about 70% of the population is engaged in the production of milk, fruits and vegetables. Due to the lack of proper storage and transit facilities, the agricultural produce, in remote areas loses its value. This spoilage could be prevented at the local village level, by providing cooling units for short term preservation. In this paper, the possibility of a hybrid energy based thermally operated cold storage has been considered to meet the cooling needs of the villages in the southern parts of India, where biomass, biogas and gobar gas are available in abundance. A milk cooling system that uses various combinations of locally available renewable energy sources to operate an aqua ammonia vapour absorption cooling system has been analysed using the Matlab software. The impact of various combinations of renewable energy sources on the Coefficient of Performance (COP), Net Present Value (NPV) and payback period of the total cooling system has been studied. The analysis shows that the COP and payback period of the proposed hybrid renewable energy based milk cooling system are 0.16–0.23 and 4–6years respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aammonia 3abiogas 3abiomass 3acold storage 3acomputer software 3acooling systems 3adeveloping countries 3aenergy 3afruits 3amilk 3aspoilage 3avapors 3avegetables 3avillages 3aIndia 0aHybrid system 0aRenewable energy 0aBio-energy 0aEconomic analysis 0aPayback period 0aAbsorption refrigeration1 aJoseph Sekhar, S.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 Oct., v. 86 p.1023-1030dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2014.06.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002300191245011200214300001600326506007600342520177800418592002802196506003702224650001202261650001902273650002202292650001502314650001002329650001502339650005002354650004302404650003302447650001902480650001802499650002502517650001502542651001002557651001502567700002402582700001702606700001902623773009902642856005102741852000902792655001202801IND50088074520221207121413.0140412e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008807452DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2011.5518472doi7 aPMC31343692pmcid7 a217660452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuller, Douglas O.10aLand cover in Upper Egypt assessed using regional and global land-cover products derived from MODIS imagery  ap. 171-180.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIrrigation along the Nile River has resulted in dramatic changes in the biophysical environment of Upper Egypt. In this study we used a combination of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data and Landsat imagery to identify areas that changed from 2001 to 2008 as a result of irrigation and water-level fluctuations in the Nile River and nearby waterbodies. We used two different methods of time series analysis – principal components analysis (PCA) and harmonic decomposition – applied to the MODIS 250 m Normalized Difference Vegetation Index images to derive simple three-class land-cover maps and then assessed their accuracy using a set of reference polygons derived from 30 m Landsat 5 and 7 imagery. We analysed our MODIS 250 m maps against a new MODIS global land-cover product (MOD12Q1 collection 5) to assess whether regionally specific mapping approaches are superior to a standard global product. Results showed that the accuracy of the PCA-based product was greater than the accuracy of either the harmonic decomposition or MOD12Q1 products for the years 2001, 2003 and 2008. However, the accuracy of the PCA product was only slightly better than the MOD12Q1 for 2001 and 2003. Overall, the results suggest that our PCA-based approach produces a high level of user and producer accuracies, although the MOD12Q1 product also showed consistently high accuracy. Overlay of 2001–2008 PCA-based maps showed a net increase of 12,129 ha of irrigated vegetation, with the largest increase found from 2006 to 2008 around the districts of Edfu and Kom Ombo. This result was unexpected in light of ambitious government plans to develop 336,000 ha of irrigated agriculture around the Toshka Lakes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLandsat 3aimage analysis 3airrigated farming 3airrigation 3alakes 3aland cover 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aprincipal component analysis 3aremote sensing 3asurface water 3atime series analysis 3avegetation 3aEgypt 3aNile River1 aParenti, Michael S.1 aGad, Adel M.1 aBeier, John C.0 tRemote sensing letters.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 3, no. 2 p.171-180dTaylor & Francisx2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2011.551847  aDNAL 7aarticle04263naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245008700159520255800246592002802804650001602832650002002848650001702868650001202885650001202897650001602909650001502925650002002940650003502960650001602995650000903011650002103020650001803041650001503059650001703074650001803091650002103109650001903130650002203149650001603171650001903187650002603206650001303232650001803245650002003263650002303283651001003306700001903316700001703335700002003352700001903372700001703391700001703408700001403425773012203439856007903561852000903640655001203649IND60794320520221119124816.0220922e20220910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079432052DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111823642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Ming 10aProanthocyanidins Alleviate Cadmium Stress in Industrial Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.)  aIndustrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L.), an annual herbaceous cash crop, is widely used for the remediation of heavy metal-contaminated soils due to its short growth cycle, high tolerance, high biomass, and lack of susceptibility to transfer heavy metals into the human food chain. In this study, a significant increase in proanthocyanidins was found in Yunnan hemp no. 1 after cadmium stress. Proanthocyanidins are presumed to be a key secondary metabolite for cadmium stress mitigation. Therefore, to investigate the effect of proanthocyanidins on industrial hemp under cadmium stress, four experimental treatments were set up: normal environment, cadmium stress, proanthocyanidin treatment, and cadmium stress after pretreatment with proanthocyanidins. The phenotypes from the different treatments were compared. The experimental results showed that pretreatment with proanthocyanidins significantly alleviated cadmium toxicity in industrial hemp. The transcriptome and metabolome of industrial hemp were evaluated in the different treatments. Proanthocyanidin treatment and cadmium stress in industrial hemp mainly affected gene expression in metabolic pathways associated with glutathione metabolism, phenylpropanoids, and photosynthesis, which in turn altered the metabolite content in metabolic pathways of phenylalanine, vitamin metabolism, and carotenoid synthesis. The combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis revealed that proanthocyanidins mitigated cadmium toxicity by enhancing photosynthesis, secondary metabolite synthesis, and antioxidant synthesis. In addition, exogenous proanthocyanidins and cadmium ions acted simultaneously on EDS1 to induce the production of large amounts of salicylic acid in the plant. Finally, overexpression of CsANR and CsLAR, key genes for proanthocyanidins synthesis in industrial hemp, was established in Arabidopsis plants. The corresponding plants were subjected to cadmium stress, and the results showed that CsLAR transgenic plants were more tolerant to cadmium than the CsANR transgenic and wild-type Arabidopsis plants. The results showed that salicylic acid and jasmonic acid were increased in Arabidopsis overexpressing CsLAR compared to AT wild-type Arabidopsis, and levels of secondary metabolites were significantly higher in Arabidopsis overexpressing CsLAR than in AT wild-type Arabidopsis. These results revealed how proanthocyanidins alleviated cadmium stress and laid the foundation for breeding industrial hemp varieties with higher levels of proanthocyanidins and greater tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aCannabis sativa 3aantioxidants 3abiomass 3acadmium 3acarotenoids 3acash crops 3agene expression 3agenetically modified organisms 3aglutathione 3ahemp 3ahuman food chain 3ajasmonic acid 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3aphenylalanine 3aphenylpropanoids 3aphotosynthesis 3aproanthocyanidins 3aremediation 3asalicylic acid 3asecondary metabolites 3atoxicity 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3avitamin metabolism 3aChina1 aPan, Langlang 1 aLiu, Junfei 1 aYang, Xiaojuan 1 aTang, Huijuan 1 aZhou, Yuxin 1 aHuang, Siqi 1 aPan, Gen 0 tPlants.g2022 Sept. 10, v. 11, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111823643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245007800165500001400243520125200257592002801509650001801537650003101555650001701586650001401603650002001617650001401637650002001651650002301671650001601694650001801710650000901728650004201737650001701779650000901796650001301805650001401818650002101832650001801853650001701871773012601888856007702014852000902091655001202100IND60711640320221119031443.0200928e20200904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071164032DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox90908292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurante, William 10aTargeting Heme Oxygenase-1 in the Arterial Response to Injury and Disease  aNAL-light  aHeme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) catalyzes the degradation of heme into carbon monoxide (CO), iron, and biliverdin, which is rapidly metabolized to bilirubin. The activation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) plays a critical role in mediating the aberrant arterial response to injury and a number of vascular diseases. Pharmacological induction or gene transfer of HO-1 improves arterial remodeling in animal models of post-angioplasty restenosis, vascular access failure, atherosclerosis, transplant arteriosclerosis, vein grafting, and pulmonary arterial hypertension, whereas genetic loss of HO-1 exacerbates the remodeling response. The vasoprotection evoked by HO-1 is largely ascribed to the generation of CO and/or the bile pigments, biliverdin and bilirubin, which exert potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, these molecules inhibit vascular SMC proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and phenotypic switching. Several therapeutic strategies are currently being pursued that may allow for the targeting of HO-1 in arterial remodeling in various pathologies, including the use of gene delivery approaches, the development of novel inducers of the enzyme, and the administration of unique formulations of CO and bilirubin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3aatherosclerosis 3abilirubin 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalytic activity 3adegradation 3agene transfer 3aheme 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3ahypertension 3airon 3amyocytes 3aphenotype 3apulmonary artery 3asmooth muscle 3atherapeutics0 tAntioxidants.g2020 Sept. 04, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90908293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03643naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100003400181245016500215300001800380506007600398520133800474592002801812506003701840650002201877650001401899650001401913650002201927650002201949650002601971650001501997650001102012650001402023650001802037650001702055650001302072650001302085650001302098650002102111650003802132650001702170650001202187650001702199650003102216650003002247650003602277650001302313650002602326650001902352650002402371650006102395650003102456650003502487653002202522653003402544653001302578653001202591653001202603653003902615700001802654700001902672700002402691773012302715856007402838852000902912655001202921IND60118919320221207110520.0141127e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011891932DNAL7 a246879802pmid7 aPMC40859522pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/eru0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVon Caemmerer, S.q(Susanna),10aExploiting transplastomically modified Rubisco to rapidly measure natural diversity in its carbon isotope discrimination using tuneable diode laser spectroscopy  ap. 3759-3767.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCarbon isotope discrimination (Δ) during C3 photosynthesis is dominated by the fractionation occurring during CO2-fixation by the enzyme Rubisco. While knowing the fractionation by enzymes is pivotal to fully understanding plant carbon metabolism, little is known about variation in the discrimination factor of Rubisco (b) as it is difficult to measure using existing in vitro methodologies. Tuneable diode laser absorption spectroscopy has improved the ability to make rapid measurements of Δ concurrently with photosynthetic gas exchange. This study used this technique to estimate b in vivo in five tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Petit Havana [N,N]) genotypes expressing alternative Rubisco isoforms. For transplastomic tobacco producing Rhodospirillum rubrum Rubisco b was 23.8±0.7‰, while Rubisco containing the large subunit Leu-335-Val mutation had a b-value of 13.9±0.7‰. These values were significantly less than that for Rubisco from wild-type tobacco (b=29‰), a C3 species. Transplastomic tobacco producing chimeric Rubisco comprising tobacco Rubisco small subunits and the catalytic large subunits from either the C4 species Flaveria bidentis or the C3-C4 species Flaveria floridana had b-values of 27.8±0.8 and 28.6±0.6‰, respectively. These values were not significantly different from tobacco Rubisco.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aC3 photosynthesis 3aC3 plants 3aC4 plants 3aFlaveria bidentis 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aRhodospirillum rubrum 3aabsorption 3acarbon 3achimerism 3afractionation 3agas exchange 3agenotype 3aisotopes 3amutation 3aprotein subunits 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aspectroscopy 3atobacco 2aCarbon Cycle 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aCarbon Isotopesxanalysis 2aFlaveriaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGenotype 2aLasers, Semiconductor 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Transpiration 2aRibulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSpectrum Analysisxmethods 2aTobaccoxenzymologyxgenetics. 0aC4 photosynthesis 0acarbon isotope discrimination 0aFlaveria 0aRubisco 0atobacco 0atuneable diode laser spectroscopy.1 aTazoe, Youshi1 aEvans, John R.1 aWhitney, Spencer M.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 July, v. 65, no. 13 p.3759-3767dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eru0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002500180245014400205300001800349500001500367506007600382520160900458592002802067506003702095650001802132650002002150650001802170650003202188650001302220650002302233650002202256650001202278650002502290650001402315650002002329650001402349650001802363653002002381700002202401700002202423700001402445700002202459700002002481773010302501856007502604852000902679655001202688IND60531006320221207074250.0160723e20121016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053100632DNAL7 a10.1021/bi300639d2doi7 aPMC35673072pmcid7 a230029292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAudu, Christopher
O.10aReining in Polyoma Virus Associated Nephropathy: Design and Characterization of a Template Mimicking BK Viral Coat Protein Cellular Binding  ap. 8092-8099.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe BK polyoma virus is a leading cause of chronic post kidney transplantation rejection. One target for therapeutic intervention is the initial association of the BK virus with the host cell. We hypothesize that the rate of BKV infection can be curbed by competitively preventing viral binding to cells. The X-ray structures of homologous viruses complexed with N-terminal glycoproteins suggest that the BC and HI loops of the viral coat are determinant for binding and thereby infection of the host cell. The large size of the viral coat precludes it from common biophysical and small molecule screening studies. Hence, we sought to develop a smaller protein template incorporating the identified binding loops of the BK viral coat in a manner that adequately mimics the binding characteristics of the BK virus coat protein to cells. Such a mimic may serve as a tool for the identification of inhibitors of BK viral progression. Herein, we report the design and characterization of a reduced-size and soluble template derived from a four-helix proteinTM1526 of Thermatoga maritima archaea bacteriawhich maintains the topological display of the BC and HI loops as found in the viral coat protein, VP1, of BKV. We demonstrate that the GT1b and GD1b sialogangliosides, which bind to the VP1 of BKV, also associate with our BKV template. Employing a GFP-tagged template, we show host cell association that is dose dependent and that can be reduced by neuraminidase treatment. These data demonstrate that the BKV template mimics the host cell binding observed for the wild-type virus coat protein VP1.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acoat proteins 3agraft rejection 3adose response 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3atopology 3abinding properties 3akidney transplant 3aviruses 3aHuman polyomavirus 1 3asialidase 3akidney diseases 3ascreening 3aglycoproteins 0aBK polyomavirus1 aO’Hara, Bethany1 aPellegrini, Maria1 aWang, Lei1 aAtwood, Walter J.1 aMierke, Dale F.0 tBiochemistry.g2012 Oct. 16, v. 51, no. 41 p.8092-8099dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi300639d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245014200175300001200317500001400329500001100343520120000354592002801554650003001582650001801612650001601630650001001646650001901656650001401675650001601689650001601705650001001721650001501731650001201746650002801758650001501786650002501801650003801826650001101864650002701875650001701902650001001919700002001929700003001949700002101979773011402000856008302114852000902197655001202206IND60711339820221118021435.0210216e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071133982DNAL7 a10.1007/s12038-020-00080-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMallikarjuna, Kokkanti10aElucidation and genetic intervention of CO2 concentration mechanism in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii for increased plant primary productivity  ap. 115.  aNAL-light  aReview  aThe rising global population is forcing the need for adapting alternative sustainable technologies for enhanced crop productivity. The CO₂ Concentration Mechanisms (CCMs) evolved in algae to counter the inefficient CO₂ fixing enzyme, RuBisCo and slower diffusion of CO₂ in water offers good scope for the above purpose. The CCMs are single-celled CO₂ supply mechanisms that depend on multiple CO₂/HCO ₃⁻ transporters and acclimation states and accumulate 100-fold more CO₂ than low CO₂ environments. Although some insights have been obtained regarding the CCMs of blue-green algae and green algae like Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, further progress needs to take place to understand the molecular and biochemical basis for intracellular transport of CO₂. In this review, complete information pertaining to the core CCM is presented and discussed in light of the available literature. In addition to this, information on CO₂/HCO ₃⁻ sensing, photo-acclimation in low CO₂, liquid-like nature of pyrenoid, untapped potential of high CO₂ responses and high CO₂ requiring mutants, and prospects of engineering CCM components into higher plants are presented and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aCyanobacteria 3aacclimation 3aalgae 3acarbon dioxide 3adiffusion 3aengineering 3ainformation 3alight 3aliterature 3amutants 3aphysiological transport 3apopulation 3aprimary productivity 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3asupply 3asustainable technology 3atransporters 3awater1 aNarendra, Kelam1 aRagalatha, Ragireddypalem1 aRao, Basuthkar J0 tJournal of biosciences.g2020 Dec., v. 45, no. 1 p.115-115dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl31976x0250-59917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12038-020-00080-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01652naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100004700140245012400187300001800311520076700329592002801096650002301124650001601147650002401163773012801187856007401315852000901389655001201398IND60636334120221120082220.0190408e20190404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063633412DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ay90041a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnalytical Methods Committee AMCTB No 87, 14aThe correlation between regression coefficients: combined significance testing for calibration and quantitation of bias  ap. 1845-1848.  aIn the analytical sciences regression methods have two main uses – in calibrations in instrumental analysis, and in testing for bias in method comparison studies. In first order (straight line) regression the true values of the intercept α and the slope β are independent of each other but their estimated values  and  are not independent. This can be appreciated visually by considering the straight lines joining all the individual pairs of points; those with a large slope will have a small intercept and vice versa, so the correlation between  and  is negative and possibly substantial. This correlation has important consequences when the estimated coefficients are used for significance testing in the interpretation of the regression line.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3acalibration 3aregression analysis0 tAnalytical methods.g2019 Apr. 4, v. 11, no. 14 p.1845-1848dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ay90041a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04010naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002000185245009800205300001800303506007600321520236200397592002802759506003702787650001402824650001402838650002602852650001302878650001302891650001402904650001502918650001702933650001702950650001302967650000902980650001502989650001903004650001903023650001403042650001603056650001303072650001603085650002703101650001903128650001603147650001203163650002203175651001803197700002103215773012103236856007803357852000903435655001203444IND60459367720221207131721.0151109e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6045936772DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2014005532doi7 aPMC46901982pmcid7 a267262932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Ashok R.10aComparative evaluation of structured oil systems: Shellac oleogel, HPMC oleogel, and HIPE gel  ap. 1772-1781.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn lipid‐based food products, fat crystals are used as building blocks for creating a crystalline network that can trap liquid oil into a 3D gel‐like structure which in turn is responsible for the desirable mouth feel and texture properties of the food products. However, the recent ban on the use of trans‐fat in the US, coupled with the increasing concerns about the negative health effects of saturated fat consumption, has resulted in an increased interest in the area of identifying alternative ways of structuring edible oils using non‐fat‐based building blocks. In this paper, we give a brief account of three alternative approaches where oil structuring was carried out using wax crystals (shellac), polymer strands (hydrophilic cellulose derivative), and emulsion droplets as structurants. These building blocks resulted in three different types of oleogels that showed distinct rheological properties and temperature functionalities. The three approaches are compared in terms of the preparation process (ease of processing), properties of the formed systems (microstructure, rheological gel strength, temperature response, effect of water incorporation, and thixotropic recovery), functionality, and associated limitations of the structured systems. The comparative evaluation is made such that the new researchers starting their work in the area of oil structuring can use this discussion as a general guideline. Practical applications: Various aspects of oil binding for three different building blocks were studied in this work. The practical significance of this study includes (i) information on the preparation process and the concentrations of structuring agents required for efficient gelation and (ii) information on the behavior of oleogels to temperature, applied shear, and presence of water. This information can be very useful for selecting the type of structuring agents keeping the final applications in mind. For detailed information on the actual edible applications (bakery, chocolate, and spreads) which are based on the oleogel systems described in this manuscript, the readers are advised to refer our recent papers published elsewhere.

It is found that 20 nm citrate-capped AuNPs have strong interactions with these two dyes that result in red-shifted absorption peaks in their electronic absorption spectra. Transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering measurements show that this can be attributed to these AuNPs combining into large agglomerates. Eventually, precipitation is observed. The agglomeration process is triggered when the dye reaches or exceeds a threshold concentration and then does not stop until all the AuNPs have agglomerated into large particles and precipitated. Calculations suggest that the threshold concentration corresponds to having sufficient dye molecules to form a monolayer on the surface of AuNPs. We also observe similar red-shifting in the absorption peaks of the electronic absorption spectra of 11–50 nm citrate-capped AuNPs formed by both single step and seeded growth methods. No such interactions were observed in the UV-vis spectra of the dyes with Tris-capped AuNPs, gold nanoclusters or gold/silver nanoclusters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3agentian violet 3agold 3amethylene blue 3ananogold 3ananosilver 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aPanariello, Luca1 aWu, Gaowei1 aGavriilidis, Asterios1 aFielding, Helen H.1 aParkin, Ivan P.0 tRSC advances.g2021 May 14, v. 11, no. 29 p.17694-17703dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra03459f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01689naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011100161300001800272520047900290592002800769650002300797650002600820650001100846650002500857650001700882650001000899650000900909650001400918650001100932650002200943650002400965700001600989700001701005700001201022700001401034700001501048773013301063856007401196852000901270655001201279IND60636334220221120101447.0190408e20190402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063633422DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc00009g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Zhi-Qiang10aNi(ii)-doped anionic metal–organic framework nanowire arrays for enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction  ap. 4023-4026.  aHerein, an anionic metal–organic framework nanowire array not only directly grew on Cu foam, but also captured Ni(ii) ions at an ultra-small particle level.

D. Adams (Asteraceae) was spotted and collected in 2015 along Afe Babalola University road, Ado‐Ekiti, Ekiti State, Nigeria with coordinates 7°36′59.99″N, 5°12′60.00″E. However, upon closer observation some distinct and peculiar characteristics that clearly distinguished it from Aspilia africana were revealed, e.g. sterility of the disc florets and production of achenes by ray florets only. Another striking character of the plant was total emptying of the capitulum after achene maturation, leaving an empty capitulum cup on the plant. Literature and herbarium searches revealed that the plant had neither been reported from West Tropical Africa nor collected in any herbarium in Nigeria before. The plant was eventually identified as Melampodium divaricatum (L.) which is an annual erect herb, distributed in tropical and subtropical regions but mostly restricted to Mexico, North America and Central America. Morphological, reproductive and cytological studies carried out on the plant revealed it to possess a highly branched erect pigmented stem, simple opposite sub sessile leaves with acute apex and distantly serrated margins, capitula with yellow unisexual disc and ray florets, sterile disc florets, fertile ray florets, relatively high pollen fertility (92.85%), a somatic chromosome number of 2n = 24 and regular formation of 12 bivalents, indicating the plant to be a diploid species. Further studies on Melampodium in Nigeria and a general revision of the flora of West Tropical Africa is suggested as well as the need to monitor M. divaricatum in the region since it appears to have the capacity to become invasive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspilia africana 3aMelampodium 3achromosome number 3adiploidy 3aflora 3aflorets 3afruits 3aherbaria 3aleaves 3apollen 3asubtropics 3aCentral America 3aMexico 3aNigeria1 aOjo, Funmilola Mabel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8870-43491 aAbraham, Olubukola Grace1 aFrancis, Joseph1 aBalogun, Sunday0 tNordic journal of botany.g2019 Apr., v. 37, no. 4dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl33104x0107-055X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/njb.023063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245010500167520130700272592002801579650001501607650001601622650002401638650001801662650001301680650001201693650001101705650001101716650001001727700001601737700002101753700003501774700002401809700002201833700002001855700002401875773012301899856007502022852000902097655001202106IND60787834620221119233622.0220811e20220803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078783462DNAL7 a10.3390/nu141531882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarnowski, Caroline A.10aFluid Balance and Carbohydrate Intake of Elite Female Soccer Players during Training and Competition  aThis study examined sweat rate, sweat sodium concentration [Na⁺], and ad-libitum carbohydrate and fluid intakes in elite female soccer players during training (n = 19) and a match (n = 8); eight completed both for comparisons. Body mass (kg) was obtained before and after exercise to calculate sweat rate. The sweat [Na⁺] was determined from absorbent patches on the thigh or back. Sweat rate, percentage body mass change, and sweat [Na⁺] for 19 players during training were 0.47 ± 0.19 L·h⁻¹, +0.19 ± 0.65%, and 28 ± 10 mmol·L⁻¹, respectively. Sweat rate was higher during a match (0.98 ± 0.34 L·h⁻¹) versus training (0.49 ± 0.26 L·h⁻¹, p = 0.007). Body mass losses were greater post-match (−1.12 ± 0.86%) than training (+0.29 ± 0.34%, p = 0.003). Sweat [Na⁺] was similar for training (29 ± 9 mmol·L⁻¹) and a match (35 ± 9 mmol·L⁻¹) (p = 0.215). There were no differences in match versus training carbohydrate intakes (2.0 ± 2.3 g·h⁻¹, 0.9 ± 1.5 g·h⁻¹, respectively, p = 0.219) or fluid intakes (0.71 ± 0.30 L·h⁻¹, 0.53 ± 0.21 L·h⁻¹, respectively, p = 0.114). In conclusion, female soccer players’ sweat rates were higher during a match than during training, and carbohydrate intakes were below recommendations for matches and training.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3abody weight 3acarbohydrate intake 3acarbohydrates 3aexercise 3afemales 3asodium 3asports 3asweat1 aRollo, Ian 1 aCarter, James M.1 aLizarraga-Dallo, Maria Antonia1 aOliva, Mireia Porta1 aClifford, Thomas,1 aJames, Lewis J.1 aRandell, Rebecca K.0 tNutrients.g2022 Aug. 03, v. 14, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141531883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245015200172300001600324500001900340520100400359592002801363596006701391650003401458650001301492650001601505650001801521650002001539650001801559650001301577650002101590650002001611650000701631650001901638650001301657650001301670650001101683650001701694650001601711653001501727653001101742653003001753700001901783700002101802700002001823773013601843856008501979852000902064655001202073IND60692754920221119145602.0200503e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069275492DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2015.10883772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharmin, Sultana10aCharacterization of a novel thiosulfate dehydrogenase from a marine acidophilic sulfur-oxidizing bacterium, Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans strain SH  ap. 273-278.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA marine acidophilic sulfur-oxidizing bacterium, Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans strain SH, was isolated to develop a bioleaching process for NaCl-containing sulfide minerals. Because the sulfur moiety of sulfide minerals is metabolized to sulfate via thiosulfate as an intermediate, we purified and characterized the thiosulfate dehydrogenase (TSD) from strain SH. The enzyme had an apparent molecular mass of 44 kDa and was purified 71-fold from the solubilized membrane fraction. Tetrathionate was the product of the TSD-oxidized thiosulfate and ferricyanide or ubiquinone was the electron acceptor. Maximum enzyme activity was observed at pH 4.0, 40 °C, and 200 mM NaCl. To our knowledge, this is the first report of NaCl-stimulated TSD activity. TSD was structurally different from the previously reported thiosulfate-oxidizing enzymes. In addition, TSD activity was strongly inhibited by 2-heptyl-4-hydroxy-quinoline N-oxide, suggesting that the TSD is a novel thiosulfate:quinone reductase.  aPublisher supplied data  cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology 3aAcidithiobacillus thiooxidans 3abacteria 3abioleaching 3abiotechnology 3aenzyme activity 3aferricyanides 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3aoxidoreductases 3apH 3asolubilization 3asulfates 3asulfides 3asulfur 3athiosulfates 3aubiquinones 0aacidophile 0amarine 0athiosulfate dehydrogenase1 aYoshino, Eriko1 aKanao, Tadayoshi1 aKamimura, Kazuo0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2016 Feb. 1, v. 80, no. 2 p.273-278dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2015.10883773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03489naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245018200170500001900352520195700371592002802328650001502356650001102371650001702382650002402399650001602423650001002439650001502449650001902464650001902483650001602502650001902518650001702537650002002554651001702574653001302591653002102604653002802625653003302653700001602686700001902702700001502721700001202736700001502748700001802763773010602781856008702887852000902974655001202983IND60713979220221119053350.0201125e20210105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071397922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1255822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Dongcheng10aFabrication of redox-mediator-free Z-scheme CdS/NiCo2O4 photocatalysts with enhanced visible-light driven photocatalytic activity in Cr(VI) reduction and antibiotics degradation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTremendous efforts have been made to design novel type semiconductor photocatalysts as promising candidates to solve the problem of aquatic pollution. However, the exploration of photocatalysts with high activity and stability for removing heavy metal ions and antibiotics from water through visible light photocatalysis is still a challenge. In this work, a series of Z-scheme photocatalysts X% CdS/NiCo₂O₄ (X = 30, 40, 50, 60, 70) have been successfully constructed by a hydrothermal method. By anchoring the CdS nanoparticles on the surface of NiCo₂O₄ nanosheets, the obtained CdS/NiCo₂O₄ exhibits the narrower bandgap energy compare to CdS nanoparticles, which can enhance the visible light harvesting efficiency and suppress the electron-hole recombination, improving the photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the introduction of NiCo₂O₄ nanosheets cannot only inhibit the aggregation of CdS nanoparticles and increase the stability of the composite, but also improve the adsorption of pollutants on the surface of the composite. By virtue of these advantages, the best-performing CdS/NiCo₂O₄ (60 % CdS/NiCo₂O₄) revealed outstanding visible-light driven photocatalytic activity toward the degradation of Cr (VI) and Tetracycline Hydrochloride (TC−HCl) under the irradiation of a low energy consuming light (LED lamp, 5 W). Compared with pure CdS nanopaticles, the catalytic performance of 60 % CdS/NiCo₂O₄ for Cr (VI) and TC−HCl increased approximately 3.9 times and 32.7 times, respectively. Furthermore, the 60 % CdS/NiCo₂O₄ exhibits fantastic recyclability, its catalytic activity is nearly unchanged even after six cycles. Meaningfully, as an efficient visible-light photocatalyst, 60 % CdS/NiCo₂O₄ can be applied to reduction of Cr (VI) and degradation of TC−HCl in natural water samples (Yellow River water, which collected in Lanzhou section), which greatly expanded its application in practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aenergy 3aheavy metals 3ahot water treatment 3airradiation 3alight 3ananosheets 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3ariver water 3asemiconductors 3atetracycline 3awater pollution 3aYellow River 0aZ-scheme 0aCr(VI) reduction 0aAntibiotics degradation 0aVisible-light photocatalysis1 aXu, Youyuan1 aZhang, Shengya1 aTu, Jibing1 aLi, Min1 aZhi, Lihua1 aLiu, Jiacheng0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Jan. 05, v. 608 p.125582-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1255823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245012000164300001800284520182400302592002802126650001402154650002002168650001602188650001902204650001302223650002202236650001302258650001202271650002302283650002202306700003002328773012102358856007802479852000902557655001202566IND60459367820221120045828.0151109e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6045936782DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2014005642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMing, Chiu Chih10aEffects of industrial sorbitan monolaurate on the crystallization and consistency of zero trans‐fat from soybeans  ap. 1754-1761.  aSoybean‐based zero trans‐fats have been widely used in the production of fat products as an alternative to hydrogenated fats. Recent studies have shown the use of emulsifiers to modify fat crystallization and texture. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of industrial sorbitan monolaurate (SMLa; from different suppliers) to soybean‐based interesterified fat (SIF). The samples were classified as follows: SIF without the addition of SMLa (control) and SIF with 0.5% SMLa A, 0.5% SMLa B, and 0.5% SMLa C. All samples were evaluated based on the following parameters: solid‐fat content, isothermal crystallization, thermal behavior, and consistency. The results showed that the addition of SMLa influenced the fat crystallization mechanism and texture. In addition, the effects of emulsifiers from different suppliers varied in their intensity. The SMLa B fat was consistent at 15°C. The differences in the results for the analyzed parameters depending on the source may be related to a deviation in the sorbitan ester composition, which may be caused by differences in the chain lengths of the esterified fatty acids and the relative amounts of sorbitan mono‐, di‐, and tri‐esters in the sorbitan molecule. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Additives can have a significant effect on the crystallization of fat. It is shown that the effects of industrial emulsifiers from different suppliers vary. The figure shows the peak force of hardness of soybean‐based interesterified fat with added 0.5% sorbitan monolaurate from supplier A (SMLa A), 0.5% sorbitan monolaurate from supplier B (SMLa B), and 0.5% sorbitan monolaurate from supplier C (SMLa C) at 15°C. The parameter showed results of different intensities upon utilization of the same emulsifier from different suppliers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3acrystallization 3aemulsifiers 3aesterification 3ahardness 3ahydrogenated oils 3asoybeans 3atexture 3athermal properties 3atrans fatty acids1 aGonçalves, Lireny Ap.

Since the fillings are often softer than the chocolate coatings, the filling lipids can function as an activator for diffusion processes with the formation of fat bloom as a consequence. Filling lipids can merge with chocolate during production or storage. However, in most studies concerning crystallization or migration cocoa butter and hazelnut oil were analyzed, investigations on chocolate are rare. To cover a broad variety of fillings, dark chocolate was blended with hazelnut oil, butterfat, and coconut oil and crystallization was analyzed. All investigated lipids reduced the solid fat content to the same extend. However, crystallization behavior of the blended samples differed. Hazelnut oil accelerated crystallization rate and did not affect crystallization time, while butterfat reduced crystallization rate and time. The effect of coconut oil addition was in between those of hazelnut oil and butterfat. Nucleation and crystal growth rate, which affect the crystallization speed, have been shown to be affected by the type of filling lipid. Additionally, there is evidence that crystal transformation during crystallization is also affected by filling lipids. Practical applications: Based on the results of this study, manufacturers of filled chocolate products may adapt their processing parameters such as temperature and retention time in the cooling tunnel accordingly. The analytical methods may be used to control the production of confectionery and to determine filling fat concentrations in the chocolate shells of freshly produced pralines. As different filling lipids in small contents cause similar softening of chocolate shells, the solid fat content (SFC) of chocolate is an appropriate method to control filling lipid migration into chocolate. Isothermal crystallization of non‐tempered samples shown as solid fat content (SFC) versus time indicate that hazelnut oil has a less retarding effect on crystallization than butterfat and the effect of coconut oil is in between, but closer to hazelnut oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3achocolate 3acoatings 3acocoa butter 3acoconut oil 3acooling 3acrystallization 3ahazelnut oil 3alipid content 3alipids 3amilk fat 3asweets 3atemperature1 aDanzl, Wolfgang0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2015 Nov., v. 117, no. 11 p.1714-1721dWiley-VCHx1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.2014005523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245012100161300001800282520147400300592002801774650001201802650001101814650001201825650002001837650001401857650001501871650001301886650001101899650001401910650001101924650000901935650001501944650002001959650002301979650001802002650001502020650001702035650001502052650001002067651001002077700001702087700002202104700001802126700001902144773011602163856008102279852000902360655001202369IND60440602220221118024038.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044060222DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-014-3780-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Yan10aUsing stable isotopes to quantify water uptake by Cyclobalanopsis glauca in typical clusters of karst peaks in China  ap. 1039-1046.  aIn this study, stable isotopes (¹⁸O and ²H) were used to determine the sources of water for Cyclobalanopsis glauca in two habitats: limestone outcrops and thin soils in clusters of karst peaks in southwest China, where soils are scattered only in rock gaps and are underlain by rigid carbonate rocks. We used a direct inference approach and the IsoSource mixing model to estimate the contributions of different sources to the plant xylem water. The results showed that adult C. glauca growing on limestone outcrops mainly used water from soils in rock gaps, which comprised 65 % of all water sources during the rainy season, and water from rainwater sources during the rain-dry season and dry season; the proportion of deep water used increased during the dry season. In contrast, young C. glauca growing on limestone outcrops relied on a mixture of rainwater and soil water during the rainy and the rain-dry seasons, and on rainwater in the dry season, accounting for 66.3 and 64.0 % of water use, respectively. Adult C. glauca on thin soils mainly used soil water in rainy seasons, a mixture of soil water and rain water in the rain-dry season, and rainwater in the dry season. Water held within bedrock was essential for meeting plant transpiration requirements in karst peak cluster areas. The results will provide knowledge for the effective protection of vulnerable karst environments and for the recovery of vegetation on karst rocky desertification areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus 3aadults 3abedrock 3adesertification 3adeuterium 3adry season 3ahabitats 3akarsts 3alimestone 3aoxygen 3arain 3asoil water 3astable isotopes 3astatistical models 3atranspiration 3avegetation 3awater uptake 3awet season 3axylem 3aChina1 aKuo, Yi-Ming1 aJiang, Zhongcheng1 aQin, Xingming1 aJin, Zhenjiang0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 July, v. 74, no. 2 p.1039-1046dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3780-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008400167300001800251520133800269592002801607650001301635650002001648650001901668650001401687650001301701650001801714650002401732650001401756650001701770650001501787650002201802650001301824650000901837650001701846700002001863700002301883700002201906773011601928856008102044852000902125655001202134IND60440602320221118024127.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044060232DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4153-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshrafi, Khosro10aNumerical simulation of aerodynamic suspension of particles during wind erosion  ap. 1569-1578.  aThe wind erosion is the main cause of many environmental phenomena such as desertification, dust haze, sandstorms, and energy balance changes in the atmosphere. Wind erosion occurs when the friction velocity exceeds the threshold friction velocity. Threshold friction velocity depends on many parameters such as surface roughness, heat flux, moisture of soil and soil texture. In this article, the horizontal and vertical fluxes of particles due to wind erosion have been studied using a numerical method. Atmospheric boundary layer has been modeled with computational fluid dynamic for different wind profiles and the flow field near the surface has been solved. The values of velocity’s components of air flow have been used to calculate wind erosion fluxes according to balance equations of particles. The erosion flux of particles in terms of suspension, saltation and creeping have been calculated according to threshold friction velocities. Finally, the relation between fluxes has been determined and the correlation of erosion flux and direct suspension in terms of friction velocity and particle diameter has been presented. Comparing the results with previous works revealed that the value of direct suspension of particle C (kg/ms) is related to total erosion flux Q (kg/ms) as Q = 30,553 C ² + 6.4316 C + 0.0017.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3adesertification 3aenergy balance 3aequations 3afriction 3aheat transfer 3amathematical models 3aparticles 3asoil texture 3asoil water 3asurface roughness 3avelocity 3awind 3awind erosion1 aKalhor, Mostafa1 aShafie-Pour, Majid1 aEsfahanian, Vahid0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 July, v. 74, no. 2 p.1569-1578dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4153-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245015300158520155100311592002801862650001801890650001901908650001101927650001701938650004101955650001701996650002302013650001102036650000902047650002102056650002402077700002202101700002002123700001802143700002402161700001602185700002002201700001902221773012302240856007502363852000902438655001202447IND60787834920221119233711.0220811e20220722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078783492DNAL7 a10.3390/nu141530192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yuanying 10aDietary Patterns Derived from Reduced Rank Regression Are Associated with the 5-Year Occurrence of Metabolic Syndrome: Aichi Workers’ Cohort Study  aThe aim of the present study was to derive dietary patterns to explain variation in a set of nutrient intakes or in the measurements of waist circumference (WC) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) using reduced rank regression (RRR) and to prospectively investigate these patterns in relation to the risk of developing metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components during the follow-up. The study participants were comprised of 2944 government employees aged 30–59 years without MetS. RRR was applied with 38 food groups as predictors and with two sets of response variables. The first set included intake of putatively beneficial nutrients, and the first factor retained was named the Healthy Dietary Pattern (HDP). The second one included baseline WC and FBG, and the first factor was named the Unhealthy Dietary Pattern (UHDP). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals with adjustments for age, sex, total energy consumption and other potential confounders. During the 5-year median follow-up, we ascertained 374 cases of MetS. The HDP score was inversely associated with the incidence of MetS (p-trend = 0.009) and hypertension (p-trend = 0.002) and marginally significantly associated with elevated triglyceride and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p-trend = 0.08). The UHDP score was linearly positively associated with the incidence of MetS and all its components (all p-trend < 0.05). Both the HDP and UHDP predicted the development of MetS and its components.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3acohort studies 3aenergy 3ahazard ratio 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahypertension 3ametabolic syndrome 3amodels 3arisk 3atriacylglycerols 3awaist circumference1 aYatsuya, Hiroshi 1 aWang, Chaochen 1 aUemura, Mayu 1 aMatsunaga, Masaaki 1 aHe, Yupeng 1 aKhine, Maythet 1 aOta, Atsuhiko 0 tNutrients.g2022 July 22, v. 14, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141530193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012000157500002000277520122000297592002801517650002401545650001201569650002101581650001401602650002001616650002201636650001901658650001701677650002101694650001401715650002501729651001001754700002001764700001601784700001701800700001901817700001501836700005501851773011601906856007302022852000902095655001202104IND60642312620221117214111.0190507e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064231262DNAL7 a10.1111/njb.022512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shuzhen10aGenetic diversity and population structure of Rhododendron simsii (Ericaceae) as revealed by microsatellite markers  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRhododendron simsii Planch. (Ericaceae) is a valuable horticultural and medicinal plant species. In this study, the genetic diversity of eight wild R. simsii populations from the Dabie Mountains (central China) was investigated with 29 microsatellite markers. The results showed that R. simsii harbored a high level of genetic diversity (HE: 0.64–0.79; HO: 0.71–0.94; I = 1.917; h = 0.826), and 84.34% of this genetic variation was maintained within populations, while variation among populations only accounted for 15.66%. The number of alleles ranged from 6 to 11, with an average of 9.069. Heterozygote excess was found, with the mean FIS and FIT values of −0.1739 and 0.0092, respectively. The average value of gene flow (Nm) was 1.3525. Within‐population, genetic diversity (I) ranged from 1.131 to 1.681. Cluster analyses divided the eight populations into two clades: the ‘Ltjiuzihe’ population formed its own cluster, while the other seven populations clustered together. There was a weak negative correlation between genetic and geographic distance. The results are highly relevant for the conservation and sustainable utilization of wild R. simsii germplasm resources in central China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhododendron simsii 3aalleles 3acluster analysis 3agene flow 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3ahorticulture 3amedicinal plants 3amountains 3apopulation structure 3aChina1 aJin, Zhengqiang1 aLuo, Yanyan1 aLi, Zhiliang1 aFang, Yuanping1 aXiang, Jun1 aJin, Weibin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5433-49520 tNordic journal of botany.g2019 Apr., v. 37, no. 4dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl33104x0107-055X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/njb.022513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245009200169300001800261520195000279592002802229650002002257650002702277650001702304650001602321650001502337650001102352650001102363650001602374650002102390773012102411856007802532852000902610655001202619IND60459368120221120031709.0151109e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6045936812DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2015000472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAladedunye, Felix A.10aCurbing thermo‐oxidative degradation of frying oils: Current knowledge and challenges  ap. 1867-1881.  aDeep fat frying is an ancient process with a lot of open questions. This deceptively simple food preparation technique is immensely complicated by the stringent conditions applied during the process, coupled with the inherent lability of the frying medium and the unavoidable meddling from the food materials and other minor components. The various factors affecting frying stability and performance of oil can be broadly categorized into two groups: (1) The external factors, which include frying temperature, frying time, presence of oxygen, and type of fryers, among others, are factors that can be manipulated by the frying operators; (2) the internal or endogenous factors are oil‐specific and include fatty acid composition and their distribution on triacylglycerols, and the amounts and composition of the minor components. Limiting thermo‐oxidative degradation and consequently extending the useful life of frying oils often involves deliberate optimization and control of some of these factors. Available techniques for curbing thermo‐oxidative decomposition of frying oils and the inherent challenges are discussed. Practical applications: This review provides updates to our current knowledge of the salient factors affecting frying performance of oils/fats and specifically highlights both the opportunities for optimization and the accompanying daunting challenges. With this information, institutional frying operators can practically extend the discard point of their frying oils and deliver healthier fried products, while ensuring the safety of the frying facility and the technicians. A trigonal bipyramid model showing the three basic optimizable parameters of frying. The base (striped) represents the optimized region for highest stability of the frying oil and the best quality fried product (operator's target). Higher values (bold lines) tapers off stability while lower values (dotted lines) decrease food quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeep fat frying 3afatty acid composition 3afood quality 3afried foods 3afrying oil 3amodels 3aoxygen 3atemperature 3atriacylglycerols0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2015 Nov., v. 117, no. 11 p.1867-1881dWiley-VCHx1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.2015000473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245011200172300001600284520101400300592002801314650003101342650002501373650001701398650002301415650001701438650002801455650001601483650001301499650001301512650001701525700001901542700001701561700002301578773012301601856008901724852000901813655001201822IND60543403720221119204710.0190410e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054340372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2014.12.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHemalatha, K.10a2,3-Dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)-ones: Visible light mediated synthesis, solvatochromism and biological activity  ap. 139-147.  aThe photochemical synthesis of a series of 2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)-ones were evaluated under the irradiation of visible light (>390nm).

This antioxidant was confirmed to be anthrasesamone F, an anthraquinone derivative previously isolated from different black sesame seeds and biogenetically related to other anthrasesamones in sesame roots. The radical scavenging assay showed that anthrasesamone F had more potent activity than Trolox. The content of anthrasesamone F in different parts and at different developmental stages of black sesame seeds was investigated to clarify the accumulation pattern of this antioxidant in the black seeds. Anthrasesamone F was localized in the seed coat of black seeds and accumulated after the seed coat color changed to black. The content of anthrasesamone F increased gradually with seed maturation and drastically on air-drying, the final stage in sesame cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data  cKagawa University Specially Promoted Research Fund. 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aSesamum indicum 3aactive ingredients 3aair drying 3aanthraquinones 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acolor 3acrop production 3adevelopmental stages 3afractionation 3amethanol 3aroots 3aseed coat 3aseed extracts 3aseed maturation 3asesame seed 0ablack sesame seed 0aseed maturity 0aantioxidant 0aanthrasesamone F1 aNishimoto, Kiyoshi0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2016 Feb. 1, v. 80, no. 2 p.350-355dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2015.10917173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012200168300001600290500001900306520161300325592002801938650001301966650001101979650001801990650001002008650001402018650002402032650001302056650001702069650001102086650001702097650002302114650001702137650001502154650001002169650001102179650001102190650002302201650002302224700001502247700002302262773014102285856008602426852000902512655001202521IND60694319420221120210814.0200511e20060101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069431942DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2006.115121242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRizzolo, A.10aInfluence of harvest date on ripening and volatile compounds in the scab-resistant apple cultivar ‘Golden Orange’  ap. 681-690.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe quality of scab-resistant apple cv. ‘Golden Orange’, as influenced by harvest time, was evaluated in comparison with the scab-susceptible cv. ‘Golden Delicious’ (clone B) (Golden B). Fruits from both cultivars were harvested on three different dates and ripened at 20°C. Quality parameters at harvest [fruit mass, flesh firmness, starch hydrolysis, soluble solids content (SSC), titratable acidity (TA)], colour, ethylene production (EP), development of headspace volatiles during post-harvest ripening, and sugar and organic acid compositions at the end of ripening were measured. At harvest, firmness, SSC, TA, starch hydrolysis and Streif Index indicated that ‘Golden Orange’ apples were less mature than ‘Golden B’ apples, even if their skin colour was more yellow. Generally, during post-harvest ripening, ‘Golden Orange’ apples showed lower EP, lower total volatile production, and their skin turned as yellow as ‘Golden B’. ‘Golden Orange’ apples differed from ‘Golden B’ in their sugar, organic acid and volatile compound compositions. These differences were independent of harvest date and could explain the different sensory descriptions peculiar to this cultivar. Compounds that contributed most to the characteristic aroma were ethyl 2-methylbutanoate and hexyl and 2-methylbutyl acetate in ‘Golden B’ apples, and ethyl and hexyl 2-methylbutanoate, ethyl hexanoate and hexyl acetate in ‘Golden Orange’ fruit, at all harvest times. The concentrations of these volatiles were largely dependent on harvest date and on the length of post-harvest ripening.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aapples 3abiotechnology 3acolor 3acultivars 3aethylene production 3afirmness 3afruit weight 3afruits 3aharvest date 3aheadspace analysis 3ahorticulture 3ahydrolysis 3aodors 3astarch 3asugars 3atitratable acidity 3avolatile compounds1 aGrassi, M.1 aEccher Zerbini, P.0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2006 Jan. 1, v. 81, no. 4 p.681-690dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12181x2380-40847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2006.115121243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245014700175300001800322520173500340592002802075650001402103650001102117650002402128650001902152650001502171650001202186650001302198650001802211700002502229700001902254773010002273856008602373852000902459655001202468IND60577518520221118080431.0170809e20160927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057751852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b022382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBradford, Stephen
M.10aLigand Shell Composition-Dependent Effects on the Apparent Hydrophobicity and Film Behavior of Gold Nanoparticles at the Air–Water Interface  ap. 9790-9796.  aNanoparticles with well-defined interfacial energy and wetting properties are needed for a broad range of applications involving nanoparticle self-assembly including the formation of superlattices, stability of Pickering emulsions, and for the control of nanoparticle interactions with biological membranes. Theoretical, simulated, and recent experimental studies have found nanometer-scale chemical heterogeneity to have important effects on hydrophobic interactions. Here we report the study of 4 nm gold nanoparticles with compositionally well-defined mixed ligand shells of hydroxyl−(OH) and methyl−(CH₃) terminated alkylthiols as Langmuir films. Compositions ranging from 0–25% hydroxyl were examined and reveal nonmonotonic changes in particle hydrophobicity at the air–water interface. Unlike nanoparticles capped exclusively with a methyl-terminated alkylthiol, extensive particle aggregation is found for ligand shells containing <2% hydroxyl-terminated chains. This aggregation was lessened upon increasing the quantity of OH-terminated chains. Nanoparticles capped with 25% OH yield films of well-separated nanoparticles exhibiting a fluid-phase regime in the surface pressure vs area isotherm. Compression–expansion hysteresis, monolayer collapse, and mean nanoparticle area measurements support the TEM-observed changes in film morphology. Such clear changes in the hydrophobicity of nanoparticles based on very small changes in the ligand shell composition are shown to impact the process of interfacial nanoparticle self-assembly and are an important demonstration of nanoscale wetting with consequences in both materials and biological applications of nanoparticles that require tunable hydrophobicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemulsions 3aenergy 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3ahysteresis 3aligands 3ananogold 3ananoparticles1 aFisher, Elizabeth A.1 aMeli, M.-Vicki0 tLangmuir.g2016 Sept. 27, v. 32, no. 38 p.9790-9796dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b022383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009800159520152200257592002801779650001101807650001101818650002001829650001901849650001901868650001701887650001201904650002801916650001101944650002101955650001401976650001601990650001402006650001002020650001102030650001502041650001702056700001902073700001802092700001902110700002102129700002402150773012302174856007502297852000902372655001202381IND60787835220221119235354.0220811e20220804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078783522DNAL7 a10.3390/nu141531922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalli, Gloria 10aSex–Gender Differences in Adult Coeliac Disease at Diagnosis and Gluten-Free-Diet Follow-Up  aCoeliac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by gluten ingestion. At CD diagnosis, gender differences have been previously reported, but data regarding follow-up are scant. We investigated gender differences in CD adult patients both at the time of diagnosis and at follow-up after the start of the gluten-free diet (GFD). This is a longitudinal cohort study on adult CD patients diagnosed between 2008 and 2019. Clinical, biochemical, and histological data were assessed and compared between males and females. At diagnosis, female gender was significantly associated with signs of malabsorption (OR 3.39; 95% CI: 1.4–7.9), longer duration of symptoms and/or signs before the diagnosis (OR 3.39; 95% CI: 1.5–7.5), heartburn (OR 2.99; 95% CI: 1.1–8.0), dyspepsia (OR 2.70; 95% CI: 1.1–6.5), nausea/vomit (OR 3.53; 95% CI: 1.1–10.9), and constipation (OR 4.84; 95% CI: 1.2–19.6) and less frequently associated to higher body mass index (OR 0.88; 95% CI: 0.8–0.9) and osteopenia/osteoporosis (OR 0.30; 95% CI: 0.1–0.7) compared to male patients. After 12–30 months, females presented lower median BMI, performed less frequently histological control, and had more frequently anaemia and hypoferritinaemia compared to males. No significant differences concerning the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms, adherence to GFD, and Marsh score were found. Gender differences found at CD diagnosis mostly disappear at the follow-up, showing that these differences can be solved over time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanemia 3abody mass index 3aceliac disease 3acohort studies 3aconstipation 3afemales 3agastrointestinal system 3agluten 3agluten-free diet 3ahistology 3aindigestion 3aingestion 3amales 3anausea 3aosteopenia 3aosteoporosis1 aAmici, Giulia 1 aConti, Laura 1 aLahner, Edith 1 aAnnibale, Bruno 1 aCarabotti, Marilia 0 tNutrients.g2022 Aug. 04, v. 14, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141531923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245017600172300001600348520172600364592002802090650001202118650003002130650001902160650002302179650004602202650002102248650003302269650000702302650002002309650001802329700001402347700001702361773009502378856008402473852000902557655001202566IND60113026520221116192227.0141111e20121207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011302652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.06.0972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Pinxteren, D.10aHollow fibre liquid-phase microextraction of functionalised carboxylic acids from atmospheric particles combined with capillary electrophoresis/mass spectrometric analysis  ap. 178-188.  aA method was developed to enrich various mono- and dicarboxylic acids from aqueous extracts of atmospheric particles by three-phase hollow fibre liquid-phase microextraction. Analysis was performed by capillary electrophoresis/electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry applying a previously reported separation method. Several extraction parameters (pH of donor and acceptor phase, composition of supported liquid membrane, shaking speed, and extraction time) were tested for their influence on analyte recovery. A strong dependence of the recovery on the acceptor phase pH was observed. The final method consisted of 10% (w/v) trioctylphosphine oxide in dihexylether as supported liquid membrane, 1.8ml aqueous particle extract, acidified by sulfuric acid to a pH of 2 as donor phase, and 15μl of 50mM aqueous ammonia solution as acceptor phase. The extraction devices were shaken at 2200rpm for 2h. With this method, the recoveries from aqueous standards were between 10 and 80% with a repeatability of 4–14% for most compounds. Generally, more polar compounds were extracted less efficient than less polar ones. A few of the most polar compounds showed recoveries <10% with a repeatability of 20–55%. The enrichment factor was typically 10–100. The analyte recovery from real samples was found to strongly depend on the sample matrix due to co-extraction of mineral acids and organic acidic material present in atmospheric particles. Quantification was achieved by the method of standard addition. The easy handling of the hollow fibre devices, the low costs per extraction and the possibility to do many extractions in parallel allowed for an application of the developed method to a large set of real samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acapillary electrophoresis 3achromatography 3adicarboxylic acids 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aliquid membranes 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3apH 3apolar compounds 3asulfuric acid1 aTeich, M.1 aHerrmann, H.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 Dec. 7, v. 1267 p.178-188dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.06.0973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01546naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245011600164300001800280520040100298592002800699650001800727650002300745650002300768650001400791650002400805650002000829650001200849650001800861650002200879650002100901700002400922700002200946773013300968856007401101852000901175655001201184IND60636334920221120173014.0190408e20190404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063633492DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc00254e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrzybylski, Cédric12aA microscale double labelling of GAG oligosaccharides compatible with enzymatic treatment and mass spectrometry  ap. 4182-4185.  aA novel double labelling of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) oligosaccharides by thia-Michael addition and deuterium incorporation at the non-reducing and reducing ends, respectively, was introduced.

The extents of aggregation and surface dissolution of AgNPs, as well as the amount of SH-PEG adsorption and desorption, were able to be characterized simultaneously for the kinetic study. The results show that the SH-PEG with a molecular mass of 6 kg/mol (SH-PEG6K) was able to adsorb to the surface of AgNP to form PEG6K-HS-AgNP conjugates, with the maximum surface adsorbate density of ∼0.10 nm–². The equilibrium binding constant for SH-PEG6K on AgNPs was calculated as ∼(4.4 ± 0.9) × 10⁵ L/mol, suggesting a strong affinity due to thiol bonding to the AgNP surface. The formation of SH-PEG6K corona prevented PEG6K-HS-AgNP conjugates from aggregation under the acidic environment (pH 1.5), but dissolution of core AgNPs occurred following a first-order reaction. The rate constant of Ag dissolution from PEG6K-HS-AgNP was independent of the starting surface packing density of SH-PEG6K on AgNP (σ₀), indicating that the interactions of H⁺ with core AgNP were not interfered by the presence of SH-PEG6K corona. The surface packing density of SH-PEG6K decreased simultaneously following a first-order reaction, and the desorption rate constant of SH-PEG6K from the conjugates was proportional to σ₀. Our work presents the first quantitative study to illustrate the complex mechanism that involves simultaneous aggregation and dissolution of core AgNPs in combination with adsorption and desorption of SH-PEG. This work also provides a prototype method of coupled experimental scheme to quantify the change of particle mass versus the corresponding surface density of functional molecular species on nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adesorption 3agases 3amolecular weight 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3apH 3apolyethylene glycol 3aprotons 3aprototypes 3asilver 3athiols1 aTai, Jui-Ting1 aWang, Xiaofang,1 aHo, Rong-Ming1 aHsiao, Ta-Chih1 aTsai, De-Hao0 tLangmuir.g2016 Sept. 27, v. 32, no. 38 p.9807-9815dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b023383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04679naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245014700214300001600361500001900377520305900396592002803455650002803483650002503511650002003536650002203556650001703578650002303595650003003618650000903648650001803657650001903675650001603694650001303710650002203723650001903745650002103764650001303785650002903798700001903827700003203846700001703878700002303895700002703918773012403945856008204069961001304151852000904164655001204173IND60711341120221122175505.0200922e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071134112DNAL7 a10.1007/s12230-020-09795-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHollingshead, Andrew K1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5260-105710aEvaluation of Biological Control Agents and Conventional Products for Post-Harvest Application on Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) to Manage Leak  ap. 477-488.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBiological control agents applied post-harvest may provide an effective way to manage leak of potatoes by competing with Pythium ultimum. The objective of this paper was to test the efficacy of various biological control agents and conventional post-harvest fungicides to manage leak. Two studies were performed with a Pseudomonas fluorescens triculture including desiccation tolerant variants of strains S11P12, P22Y05, and S22T04 in three formulations (a “fresh” triculture, dried on Kenite 700, or dried on Attapulgite clay) applied at a rate of 3.5 mL kg⁻¹. A third study contained treatments of the P. fluorescens “fresh” triculture, triculture dried on Kenite, triculture dried on Kenite blended with a fungicide containing a three-way mixture of azoxystrobin, fludioxonil, and difenoconazole (Azo+Flu+Dfz, 0.033 mL kg⁻¹), and triculture dried on Kenite rehydrated with nutrient broth Medium 1 blended with the same fungicide. Other treatments included Pseudomonas syringae (3.5 mL kg⁻¹) in Studies 1 and 2, while hydrogen peroxide and peroxyacetic acid (0.042 mL kg⁻¹), phosphorous acid (4.2 mL kg⁻¹), and Azo+Flu+Dfz (0.033 mL kg⁻¹) were used in all three studies. The three studies were each repeated twice using unwashed tubers (cv. ‘Russet Burbank’) that were wounded and inoculated with P. ultimum. After inoculation, tubers were treated, then stored at 21 C for four days prior to disease evaluation. In Study 1, none of the formulations of P. fluorescens triculture significantly controlled leak compared to the inoculated control; however, the “fresh” triculture formulation significantly decreased leak incidence by 24% in Study 2. In all three studies the three-way fungicide mixture Azo+Flu+Dfz resulted in lower leak incidence (1, 7, and 24%, in studies 1, 2, and 3 respectively) compared with the inoculated control (12, 37, and 50% leak incidence, in studies 1, 2, and 3 respectively). Study 3 showed the formulations of P. fluorescens strains were not effective in leak control but when combined with Azo+Flu+Dfz leak incidence significantly decreased compared to the inoculated control. The lowest leak incidence was seen when the triculture component of the fungicide mix was rehydrated with Medium 1 in Study 3. The P. fluorescens triculture formulations mixed with Azo+Flu+Dfz and rehydrated with Medium 1 had slightly higher bacterial counts than the “fresh” triculture and the triculture dried on Kenite, potentially indicating a greater activity level afforded by cell revival in dilute culture medium. P. syringae, phosphorous acid and hydrogen peroxide-peroxyacetic acid were ineffective in controlling leak in all three studies. The efficacy of the Azo+Flu+Dfz mixture appears promising for the management of leak in storage. The efficacy of P. fluorescens tricultures used alone was inconsistent in limiting leak incidence (only significant in 1 of 3 studies), and additional research and development may be warranted to realize its potential as biological control agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aPseudomonas syringae 3aPythium ultimum 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aazoxystrobin 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aclay 3aculture media 3adifenoconazole 3afludioxonil 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aperacetic acid 3aphosphorous acid 3apotatoes 3aresearch and development1 aOlsen, Nora L.1 aThornton, Michaelc(Tubist)1 aMiller, Jeff1 aSchisler, David A.1 aSlininger, Patricia J.0 tAmerican journal of potato research.g2020 Oct., v. 97, no. 5 p.477-488dSpringer USwJournal:jnl56713x1099-209X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12230-020-09795-z3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011100167300001600278520120200294592002801496650001401524650001701538650001401555650001301569650001601582650001901598650001601617650003801633650003701671700001901708700005901727700002301786700001501809700006501824773008701889856008501976852000902061655001202070IND60625058920221121035748.0210114e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062505892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.11.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohns, Steve10aFormation of carbon nanostructures in nuclear graphite under high-temperature in situ electron-irradiation  ap. 908-914.  aDefect evolution in nuclear graphite has been studied in real time using high-temperature in situ transmission electron microscopy. In situ electron-irradiation was conducted at 800 °C on a 200 kV transmission electron microscope with a dose rate, given in terms of displacements per atom per second, of approximately 1.46 × 10⁻³ dpa/s. Defect domains consisting of ordered arrangements of pentagons, hexagons, and heptagons exist intrinsically in nuclear graphite and in addition are readily produced via electron-irradiation; however, at elevated temperatures these defect domains undergo atomic rearrangements resulting in the formation of carbon nanostructures via curling and closure of the basal planes. The formation of fullerenes and other structures due to thermal annealing or high-temperature electron-irradiation has been observed in disordered regions of the microstructure and interstitially between basal planes. These defect structures result in localized swelling and expansion of crystallites along the c axis; thus, it is proposed as one of the many atomic mechanisms involved in the dimensional change of nuclear graphite subjected to high-temperature irradiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acrystallites 3afullerene 3agraphene 3airradiation 3amicrostructure 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aPoulsen, Tyler1 aKane, Joshua J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1714-46871 aWindes, William E.1 aUbic, Rick1 aKarthik, Chinnathambi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4078-13100 tCarbon.g2019 Mar., v. 143 p.908-914dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.11.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002700142245012900169520164100298592002801939650002001967650002701987650002502014650001402039650002302053650001802076650001302094650001702107650001202124650003602136650001202172650001202184650003102196650001102227650002102238650001502259650002102274650001002295650002502305650001302330650002902343700002202372700001902394700002402413700001502437773010202452856007702554852000902631655001202640IND60792036220221118164734.0220904e20220829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079203622DNAL7 a10.17221/46/2022-pps2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoustafa, Moataz A.

Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the toxicity of eight bioinsecticides on the black cutworm Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) to understand the relationships between insecticide exposure and insect response at the individual and population levels. The bioassay results showed that emamectin benzoate had high toxicity against A. ipsilon second instar larvae with an LC<sub>50</sub> of 0.007 (mg/L). Sublethal concentration (LC<sub>30</sub>) of emamectin benzoate, spinosyn group and Bacillus thuringiensis formulation (Dipel 2X) had significantly prolonged pupal period. In addition, emamectin benzoate significantly decreased the number of eggs laid per female (135.3 ± 6.919) compared with the control treatment. Thus, the formulation of chlorfenapyr showed a 1.26-fold reduction in hatching rate. Meanwhile, the activities of oxidative stress enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, lipid peroxidase, and glutathione reductase) were significantly affected due to exposure to sublethal concentration. Changes in adipokinetic hormone (AKH) transcriptional regulation were detected via SQ-PCR via using cDNA synthesized from mRNA isolated from treated A. ipsilon larvae. The results showed a higher transcription rate of AKH in spinotram-treated larvae with a 1.42-fold increase over untreated larvae. Our results provide useful information for integrated pest management programs for A. ipsilon by using bioinsecticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrotis ipsilon 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aadipokinetic hormone 3abioassays 3abiological control 3abiopesticides 3acatalase 3achlorfenapyr 3afemales 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ainsects 3ainstars 3aintegrated pest management 3alipids 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxidase 3aplant protection 3apupae 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity 3atranscription (genetics)1 aElmenofy, Wael H.1 aOsman, Engy A.1 aEl-Said, Nourhan A.1 aAwad, Mona0 tPlant Protection Science.dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21418x1212-25807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/46/2022-pps3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024003700134040001800171100001700189245009100206500001900297506007600316506003100392520131700423592002801740596003001768506003701798650002801835650001301863650001501876650001501891650000901906650002301915650001101938650001001949650001601959650001501975650002101990650001102011650000902022650001802031650002302049650001702072650001602089653002902105653002102134653002302155653002102178700002002199700001902219773011602238856008402354852000902438655001202447IND60700783820221207090436.0200831e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070078382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1063372chorus7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1063372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTran, Dat Q.10aSpatial economic predictions of managed aquifer recharge for an agricultural landscape  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aGroundwater banking through managed aquifer recharge (MAR) can augment the irrigation water supply with less social and environmental opposition than dams. Our high spatial resolution hydro-economic model investigates the influence of site conditions such as natural recharge, proximity to surface water sources, and the agronomic conditions of crops on four model outcomes: optimal MAR, final groundwater level, present value of farm net returns, and the cost-effectiveness of a MAR subsidy. We find that less irrigation intensive crops are a substitute for MAR while rice and dryland crops are a complement for MAR. Optimal MAR is larger at a site with greater net returns to rice and dryland soybeans, lower net returns to irrigated corn and soybeans, and lower natural recharge. MAR increases groundwater conservation most at the sites with higher net returns to dryland and irrigated soybeans and lower net returns to corn and cotton. MAR raises the present value of economic returns from agriculture more where the net returns from rice are large, but the cost-effective locations for a MAR subsidy are sites with large net returns to crops like cotton and soybeans. Higher natural recharge at a site correlates with a lower present value of economic returns from MAR and a less cost-effective MAR subsidy.  aPublisher supplied data  cEconomic Research Service0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural landscapes 3aaquifers 3aarid lands 3acomplement 3acorn 3acost effectiveness 3acotton 3afarms 3agroundwater 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3amodels 3arice 3asurface water 3awater conservation 3awater supply 3awater table 0aManaged aquifer recharge 0aSpatial analysis 0aCost-effectiveness 0aSlippage effects1 aKovacs, Kent F.1 aWest, Grant H.0 tAgricultural water management.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 241 p.106337-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1063373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002800136245009500164300001600259520105900275592002801334653001901362653002901381653001201410653002001422653001601442653002401458653002001482700002301502700002001525700002001545700002001565700002201585700002201607773015501629856007001784852000901854655001201863IND60131646720221120144556.0151127e200406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013164672DNAL7 a10.1638/01-0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKetz-Riley, Cornelia J.10aParesis secondary to an extradural hematoma in a sumatran tiger (panthera tigris sumatrae)  ap. 208-215.  aA 15-yr-old female Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae) was presented to the Boren Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at Oklahoma State University with a 3-wk history of progressive hind limb weakness. Neurologic evaluation was limited to review of videotape that demonstrated weakness and ataxia with conscious proprioceptive deficits of the tiger's pelvic limbs. Spinal radiography demonstrated disc space narrowing, and myelography demonstrated a large extradural compressive lesion at the level of L₂₋₃. Computed tomography did not reveal bone involvement. Surgery was performed to decompress the spinal cord and obtain a definitive diagnosis. A right hemilaminectomy was performed after a dorsal approach to the lumbar spine. Histologic examination of the mass revealed a consolidated extradural spinal hematoma, presumed to be secondary to intervertebral disc herniation. Despite incomplete resection of the mass and plastic deformation of the spinal cord, the tiger returned to normal ambulation within 3 wk of surgical decompression.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSumatran tiger 0aPanthera tigris sumatrae 0aparesis 0adisc herniation 0amyelography 0acomputed tomography 0ahemilaminectomy1 aGalloway, David S.1 aHoover, John P.1 aRochat, Mark C.1 aBahr, Robert J.1 aRitchey, Jerry W.1 aCaudell, David L.0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2004 June, v. 35, no. 2 p.208-215dAmerican Association of Zoo VeterinarianswJournal:jnl43569x1937-28257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638/01-0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01786naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245013000165300001800295520056400313592002800877650001200905650001600917650002200933650002800955700002100983700002901004700008001033700005701113700006701170773013401237856008001371852000901451655001201460IND60738205220220413000000.0210927e20210430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073820522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.1c003332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelasco, Noelia10aFrom Propargylic Alcohols to Substituted Thiochromenes: gem-Disubstituent Effect in Intramolecular Alkyne Iodo/hydroarylation  ap. 7078-7091.  aThis work describes the 6-endo-dig cyclization of S-aryl propargyl sulfides to afford 2H-thiochromenes. The substitution at the propargylic position plays a crucial role in allowing intramolecular silver-catalyzed alkyne hydroarylation and N-iodosuccinimide-promoted iodoarylation. Additionally, a PTSA-catalyzed thiolation reaction of propargylic alcohols was developed to synthesize the required tertiary S-aryl propargyl ethers.

Trace elements, a kind of micronutrient that is very important to female reproductive function, are affected by intestinal absorption, which is regulated by gut microbiota. Enterotype is the classification of an intestinal microbiome based on its characteristics. Whether or not Prevotella-enterotype and Bacteroides-enterotype are associated with blood trace elements among infertile women remains unclear. The study aimed to explore the relationship between five main whole blood trace elements and these two enterotypes in women with infertility. This retrospective cross-sectional study recruited 651 Chinese women. Whole blood copper, zinc, calcium, magnesium, and iron levels were measured. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on all fecal samples. Patients were categorized according to whole blood trace elements (low levels group, <5th percentile; normal levels group, 5th‒95th percentile; high levels group, >95th percentile). There were no significant differences in trace elements between the two enterotypes within the control population, while in infertile participants, copper (P = 0.033), zinc (P < 0.001), magnesium (P < 0.001), and iron (P < 0.001) in Prevotella-enterotype was significantly lower than in Bacteroides-enterotype. The Chi-square test showed that only the iron group had a significant difference in the two enterotypes (P = 0.001). Among infertile patients, Prevotella-enterotype (Log(P/B) > −0.27) predicted the low levels of whole blood iron in the obesity population (AUC = 0.894; P = 0.042). For the high levels of iron, Bacteroides-enterotype (Log(P/B) <−2.76) had a predictive power in the lean/normal group (AUC = 0.648; P = 0.041) and Log(P/B) <−3.99 in the overweight group (AUC = 0.863; P = 0.013). We can infer that these two enterotypes may have an effect on the iron metabolism in patients with infertility, highlighting the importance of further research into the interaction between enterotypes and trace elements in reproductive function.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3acalcium 3achi-square distribution 3acopper 3across-sectional studies 3afemales 3aintestinal microorganisms 3airon 3airon absorption 3amagnesium 3aobesity 3apregnancy 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3azinc1 aZuo, Na 1 aGuan, Wenzheng 1 aFu, Lingjie 1 aJiang, Shuyi 1 aJiao, Jiao 1 aWang, Xiuxia 0 tNutrients.g2022 Aug. 04, v. 14, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141531953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245007900170300001800249520160500267592002801872650001601900650001401916650001901930650002001949650001101969650002601980650001702006650001902023650001902042650001702061650001202078650002102090650001702111650001102128651001102139651001802150700001902168700001902187700002102206773011602227856008102343852000902424655001202433IND60440603220221118024149.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044060322DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4173-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarmona, Johana M.10aDust emission modeling for the western border region of Mexico and the USA  ap. 1687-1697.  aThe border area between northwestern Mexico and the southwestern USA is composed of arid and semi-arid regions that are highly vulnerable to wind erosion. As a result, dust resuspension events take place that result in episodes of high concentrations of fine particulate matter in the atmosphere. In winter, air quality standards on both sides of the border are often exceeded. However, accurate estimates of the emission of windblown dust are rare, particularly for Mexico. In this study, emissions of particulate matter from mineral origin (dust) with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 and 10 μm (PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀, respectively) were estimated for the border area for a short winter episode (January 4–12, 2006). For this purpose, a mesoscale meteorological model and a wind erosion model were used. The wind erosion model had a horizontal spatial resolution of 4 km × 4 km and a temporal resolution of 1 h. A georeferenced database of surface conditions obtained from satellite data was used in conjunction with soil parameter digital maps to generate the inputs required by the wind erosion model. The PM₁₀ emissions for the entire domain and episode were estimated at ~643 g km⁻² h⁻¹ and the PM₂.₅ emissions were estimated at ~47 g km⁻² h⁻¹. The wind erosion model was subject to three sensitivity tests based on perturbation of the input surface parameters. The model output was more sensitive to changes in soil parameters (soil density and plastic pressure) than to changes in land surface data (leaf area index and fraction of vegetation cover).  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3adatabases 3ageoreferencing 3aleaf area index 3amodels 3aparticulate emissions 3aparticulates 3aremote sensing 3asemiarid zones 3asoil density 3atesting 3avegetation cover 3awind erosion 3awinter 3aMexico 3aUnited States1 aVanoye, Ana Y.1 aLozano, Fabian1 aMendoza, Alberto0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 July, v. 74, no. 2 p.1687-1697dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4173-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012900166300001600295520184700311592002802158650002202186650001102208650001902219650002602238650002502264650001702289650001902306650001102325650001102336650002002347650001502367650001502382651001002397700001702407700001602424700001602440700001602456700001702472773011402489856008102603852000902684655001202693IND60440603320221118024155.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044060332DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-014-3788-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Liankai10aEstimation of carbon sink fluxes in the Pearl River basin (China) based on a water–rock–gas–organism interaction model  ap. 945-952.  aCarbon sequestration resulting from carbonate rock weathering is closely linked to the global carbon cycle and has turned out to be important in the adjustment of atmospheric CO₂ levels. Traditional karst dynamic models based on water–rock–gas interactions underestimate carbon sink fluxes related to carbonate rock weathering because they ignore the utilization of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) by aquatic organisms. In this study, a new model based on water–rock–gas–organism interactions was applied in the Pearl River basin, China, to recalculate atmospheric CO₂ consumption and to develop an accurate estimation model for carbon sink fluxes at catchment scale. Stable carbon isotope (δ¹³C) and C/N ratios were used in the counting processes. Data were collected from published literature as well as through field investigation and laboratory analysis. Results show that the Pearl River carbon sink in the Pearl River is 4.31 × 10⁹ kg/a, i.e., 15.8 × 10⁹ kg of atmospheric CO₂ per year. Of this, the carbon sink resulting from carbonate rock weathering amounts to 2.14 × 10⁹ kg/a, i.e., 49.7 % of the total. The three largest tributaries of Pearl River, Dongjiang, Beijiang, and Xijiang, respectively absorb 0.5 × 10⁹, 1.19 × 10⁹, and 2.62 × 10⁹ kg of carbon from the atmosphere annually, accounting for 12, 28 and 60 % of the river’s total carbon sink. When compared with the results of previous researches that disregarded the role of aquatic organisms, the new calculation method provides a carbon sink flux value that is 1.2–3.3 times higher, and 1.6 times higher on an average. To improve the calculation accuracy of atmospheric CO₂ consumption in global karstic rivers, further research is needed regarding carbon sequestration mechanisms that involve aquatic organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic organisms 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3adynamic models 3akarsts 3arivers 3astable isotopes 3awatersheds 3aweathering 3aChina1 aQin, Xiaoqun1 aLiu, Pengyu1 aHuang, Qibo1 aLan, Funing1 aJi, Hongbing0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 July, v. 74, no. 2 p.945-952dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3788-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245009000162300001800252520142700270592002801697650001401725650002501739650002101764650002101785650002101806650001201827650001101839650001501850650001201865650001701877650002901894650001901923650002201942650001101964650001101975700002201986700002002008700005502028700006402083773013302147856007902280852000902359655001202368IND60738205320221116195537.0210521e20210512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073820532DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.1c003482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaito, Yohei10aSynthesis of Thio-lignan Analogues, Bioequivalent Salvinal without Unfavored Aldehyde  ap. 7092-7106.  aThe oxygen in the benzofuran (BF) of three antiproliferative natural neolignans, salvinal (1), obovaten (2), and 2-[7-methoxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-methylbenzofuran-5-yl]ethanol (3), was replaced with sulfur to form the new biological scaffold benzothiophene (BT) thio-lignans 4–6. Compounds 1–6 and 18 synthesized derivatives were evaluated for antiproliferative activity against five human cancer cell lines, including a multidrug-resistant cell line. Thio-salvinal (4) displayed significant antiproliferative effects with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) values of 0.57–0.95 μM against all tested cell lines, except for the HER2 negative breast cancer cell line MCF-7. This thio-lignan was 6.5–9.4 times more potent than parent 1. However, the related thio-lignans, 5 and 6, showed much weaker antiproliferative effects than 4 and were less potent than the parent natural benzofuran lignans 2 and 3. Newly synthesized thio-lignan 33 affected cell cycle progression at 24 and 48 h in the G2/M transition and S phase, respectively, as well as promoted sub-G1 induction by stimulating microtubule depolymerization and nuclear fragmentation. Since a highly reactive aldehyde in salvinal is generally not appropriate for drug development, we have successfully found nonaldehyde derivative 33 showing biological activity similar to salvinal by replacing BF with BT and an aldehyde with 1,3-dioxolane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3abioactive properties 3abreast neoplasms 3adepolymerization 3adrug development 3aethanol 3ahumans 3ainterphase 3alignans 3amicrotubules 3amultiple drug resistance 3aneoplasm cells 3aorganic chemistry 3aoxygen 3asulfur1 aKobayashi, Yukiko1 aYoshida, Nanami1 aGoto, Masuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9659-14601 aNakagawa-Goto, Kyoko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1642-65380 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2021 May 12, v. 86, no. 10 p.7092-7106dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.1c003483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245012400167300001800291500001500309520171900324592002802043650001702071650001102088650002002099650002802119650002302147650002502170650001102195650001302206650003002219650002702249650001002276650001602286650002302302650002102325653001702346700002302363700001602386700001802402700001602420700001802436700001502454700001902469773010402488856007302592852000902665655001202674IND60459368820221123011005.0151109e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6045936882DNAL7 a10.1002/tox.220082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashmi, Muhammad Zaffar10aHormetic effects of noncoplanar PCB exposed to human lung fibroblast cells (HELF) and possible role of oxidative stress  ap. 1385-1392.  a2019-12-06  aHormesis, a biphasic dose–response phenomenon, which is characterized by stimulation of an end point at a low‐dose and inhibition at a high‐dose. In the present study we used human lungs fibroblast (HELF) cells as a test model to evaluate the role of oxidative stress (OS) in hormetic effects of non coplanar PCB 101. Results from 3‐(4,5‐dime‐thylthiazol‐2‐yl)‐2,5‐diphenyltetrazo‐lium bromide (MTT) assay indicated that PCB101 at lower concentrations (10⁻⁵ to 10⁻¹ μg mL⁻¹) stimulated HELF cell proliferation and inhibited at high concentrations (1, 5, 10, and 20 μg mL⁻¹) in a dose‐ and time‐dependent manner. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (except 48 h) showed a significant increase at higher concentrations of PCB 101 than those at the lower concentrations with the passage of time. Antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GSH‐Px) exhibited decreasing trends in dose and time dependent manner. Lipid peroxidation assay resulted in a significant increase (P < 0.05) of MDA level in PCB 101‐treated HELF cells compared with controls, suggesting that OS plays a key role in PCB 101‐induced toxicity. Comet assay indicated a significant increase in genotoxicity at higher concentrations of PCB 101 exposure compared to lower concentrations. Overall, we found that HELF cell proliferation was higher at low ROS level and vice versa, which revealed activation of cell signaling‐mediated hormetic mechanisms. The results suggested that PCB 101 has hormetic effects to HELF cells and these were associated with oxidative stress. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Reducing the steric bulkiness of the amide ligand gave rise to two categories of complexes with distinct photophysical and photochemical properties. A structural parameter, the amide cone angle (θ), was applied to differentiate the two categories. Complexes with smaller cone angles (θ < 156°, category B) exhibited more reducing potentials and faster electron-transfer rates than those of complexes with larger cone angles (θ > 173°, category A). And only complexes in the category B could achieve the photocatalytic phenylation of an aryl bromide. These results demonstrated that reducing the steric bulkiness of the amide ligand improved the performance of cerium(iii) bis(guanidinate) mono(amide) photocatalysts in a systematic manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3acerium 3aelectron transfer 3aligands 3aorganobromine compounds 3aphenylation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts1 aCheisson, Thibault1 aManor, Brian C.1 aCarroll, Patrick J.1 aSchelter, Eric J.0 tChemical communications.g2019 Apr. 2, v. 55, no. 28 p.4067-4070dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9cc00282k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245011000175300001600285500001900301520123200320592002801552650001601580650000801596650001801604650002101622650001401643650002101657650002201678650001401700650001701714650001101731650001301742651001001755700002001765700001901785773014101804856008601945852000902031655001202040IND60694320620221121023048.0200511e20060101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069432062DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2006.115121362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSangeeta Kutty, M.10aAnalysis of genetic diversity among Indian short-day onion (Allium cepa L.) cultivars using RAPD markers.  ap. 774-778.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRandomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were used to estimate genetic diversity among 24 cultivars of short-day onions. Total genomic DNA was extracted and subjected to RAPD analysis using 90 arbitrary 10-mer primers. Of these, 15 primers were selected which yielded 137 bands, 91.24% of which were polymorphic. None of the primers produced a unique banding pattern for each cultivar. RAPD data were used to calculate a Squared-Euclidian Distance matrix which revealed a minimum genetic distance between cultivars ‘AFLR-722’ and ‘PBR-140’, and a maximum genetic distance between cultivars ‘PBR-139’ and ‘A.Kalyan’, and ‘MS-48’ and ‘A.Kalyan’. Based on the distance matrix, cluster analysis was done using a minimum variance algorithm.The dendrogram thus generated, based on Ward’s method, grouped the 24 onion cultivars into two major clusters. The first cluster consisted of cultivars from the northern region, and the second of cultivars from the southern region of India. The present study shows that there is high diversity among the onion cultivars selected and indicates the potential of RAPD markers for identification and maintenance of onion germplasm for crop improvement purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3aDNA 3abiotechnology 3acluster analysis 3acultivars 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3ahorticulture 3aonions 3avariance 3aIndia1 aVeere Gowda, R.1 aAnand, Lalitha0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2006 Jan. 1, v. 81, no. 4 p.774-778dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12181x2380-40847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2006.115121363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002100180245009900201300001800300506007600318520114400394592002801538506003701566650001901603650001401622650001401636650001001650650001701660650001301677650002101690650002101711650001301732650001401745650003001759650001701789650002901806700001601835700001801851700002601869700001801895773010301913856007502016852000902091655001202100IND60531007520221207074310.0160723e20121016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053100752DNAL7 a10.1021/bi30092782doi7 aPMC35672572pmcid7 a229948522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWagner, Elise
K.10aIdentification and Characterization of Small Molecule Inhibitors of a Plant Homeodomain Finger  ap. 8293-8306.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA number of histone-binding domains are implicated in cancer through improper binding of chromatin. In a clinically reported case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a genetic fusion protein between nucleoporin 98 and the third plant homeodomain (PHD) finger of JARID1A drives an oncogenic transcriptional program that is dependent on histone binding by the PHD finger. By exploiting the requirement for chromatin binding in oncogenesis, therapeutics targeting histone readers may represent a new paradigm in drug development. In this study, we developed a novel small molecule screening strategy that utilizes HaloTag technology to identify several small molecules that disrupt binding of the JARID1A PHD finger to histone peptides. Small molecule inhibitors were validated biochemically through affinity pull downs, fluorescence polarization, and histone reader specificity studies. One compound was modified through medicinal chemistry to improve its potency while retaining histone reader selectivity. Molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis of JARID1A PHD3 provided insights into the biochemical basis of competitive inhibition.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarcinogenesis 3achemistry 3achromatin 3adrugs 3afluorescence 3ahistones 3amolecular models 3amyeloid leukemia 3apeptides 3ascreening 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3atherapeutics 3atranscription (genetics)1 aNath, Nidhi1 aFlemming, Rod1 aFeltenberger, John B.1 aDenu, John M.0 tBiochemistry.g2012 Oct. 16, v. 51, no. 41 p.8293-8306dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi30092783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245018400165500001900349520170200368592002802070650001602098650001102114650001802125650002102143650001102164650001202175650001402187650001302201650001502214650001102229650001402240653002002254653001602274653003402290653002402324653002302348700001902371700001702390700001802407700002302425700001502448700001402463700001602477773010602493856008702599852000902686655001202695IND60713980320221119053352.0201125e20210105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071398032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1255932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hao10aHigh-effective preparation of 3D hierarchical nanoporous interpenetrating network structure carbon membranes as flexible free-standing anodes for stable lithium and sodium storage  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIdeal lithium/sodium storage requires a simple and effective design of carbon-based anodes with appropriate morphologies/microstructures and excellent flexibility. Herein, an advanced flexible interpenetrating network carbon membrane with 3D hierarchical nanopore structure is designed and fabricated inspired by porous membrane technology via nonsolvent induced phase separation (NIPS) and carbonization. The interpenetrating network structure in the carbon membrane is generated by the NIPS membrane formation process, while the 3D hierarchical nano-porous structure is obtained from polymer decomposition during carbonization. The unique synergistic effect between the even interpenetrating network structure and the developed 3D hierarchical porous structure not only ensured structural integrity of the anodes and provided a high-volume ion transmission reservoir, but also endowed carbon membranes with multiple active sites for energy storage. As flexible anodes, the resulting carbon membranes achieved enhanced electrochemical properties by showing maximum reversible capacitance of 351.8 mA h g⁻¹ in lithium storage and 237.4 mA h g⁻¹ in SIBs at a current density of 50 mA g⁻¹. In both LIBs and SIBs, the carbon membranes exhibit outstanding rate performance even at a high current density of 2000 mA g⁻¹. They also show excellent long-term cycling stability with the coulomb efficiency maintained nearly 100 % after the first few cycles. Therefore, this work provides a simple and high-effective cross-disciplinary approach through membrane technology and carbon materials for the production of high-performance, low-cost carbon membranes for large-scale application anodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3alithium 3ananopores 3apolymers 3aseparation 3asodium 3asynergism 0aCarbon membrane 0aFlexibility 0aHierarchical porous structure 0aLithium ion battery 0aSodium ion battery1 aWei, Chengbiao1 aPeng, Leilei1 aFan, Qingchao1 aMatindi, Christine1 aWang, Yali1 aMa, Chang1 aShi, Jingli0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Jan. 05, v. 608 p.125593-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1255933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02162naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245006500205300001600270520087400286592002801160650001301188650001101201650002401212650001101236650001301247650001301260650001801273650001101291653001301302653001801315653001201333653002501345653003101370700001901401700001701420700001301437700001901450700005401469700001201523773008701535856008501622852000901707655001201716IND60625059220221121045016.0210114e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062505922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.11.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9155-765310aMetal-enhanced hydrogenation of graphene with atomic pattern  ap. 700-705.  aGraphene hydrogenation is an attractive approach to functionalize graphene. However, the hydrogenating treatment could only be achieved under harsh conditions due to the weak hydrogen affinity of graphene. It has also made the direct writing of electronic circuits on graphene by hydrogenation very difficult. Here we propose a metal-enhanced approach to hydrogenate graphene with atomic pattern that enables to produce hydrogenation pattern on demand. First-principles calculations reveal that certain metals (Cu, Ag, Al) attached to graphene can significantly lower the energy barrier for hydrogen binding process, while the hydrogen binding energy itself is much enhanced. Such metal-promoted hydrogenation is spatially localized, which paves the way to precisely write pre-designed hydrogenation patterns on graphene with well-controlled metallic clusters and tips.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acopper 3aelectronic circuits 3aenergy 3agraphene 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3asilver 0aGraphene 0aHydrogenation 0aBandgap 0aH-decoration pattern 0aMetal-assisted lithography1 aZhang, Guozhen1 aWang, Zhaowu1 aYang, Li1 aLee, L.

Delayed luminescence (DL) can reflect charge recombination through the backflow of electrons. However, DL detection has not yet been adapted for whole plants in Petri dishes. To compensate for differences in DL decay between sibling Arabidopsis plants grown under the same conditions, we developed a time-sequential double measurement method. Using this method, we examined the influence of photosynthetic electron flow inhibitors, and differences in the DL decay curves were categorized by considering the initial and late phases of the decay curves, as well as their intermediate slopes. The appearance of concavity and convexity in DL curves in Arabidopsis was different from unicellular algae, suggesting complexity in the photosynthetic machinery of higher plants. This detection method should be invaluable for evaluating photosynthetic defects in higher plants under sterile conditions without interrupting plant culture.  aPublisher supplied data  cuniversity of shizuoka  cministry of education, culture, sports, science and technology(mext) of japan 3aArabidopsis 3aalgae 3aaseptic conditions 3aelectrons 3aluminescence 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant cultural practices 0adelayed luminescence 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0a3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) 0a2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone (DBMIB) 0aantimycin A1 aShimazaki, Azumi1 aShimizu, Masanori1 aKobayashi, Yūko,1 aKatsumata, Masakazu1 aKobayashi, Hirokazu0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2016 Mar. 3, v. 80, no. 3 p.452-460dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2015.11013323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01985naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245009000161300001600251520075900267592002801026650002801054650001501082650002301097650001701120650001901137650001001156650001301166650001501179650001401194653001201208653001001220653001101230653001601241653001801257700001701275700001801292700001201310700001701322773012101339856008201460852000901542655001201551IND60533285220221121211328.0160728e20151225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053328522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.11.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhen10aMiR-661 inhibits glioma cell proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting hTERT  ap. 870-876.  aIn this study, we analyzed the functional role of miR-661 in glioma cell proliferation, migration and invasion. We found that overexpression of miR-661 obviously suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells. MiRNA target prediction algorithms implied that hTERT is a candidate target gene for miR-661. A fluorescent reporter assay confirmed that miR-661 could lead to hTERT gene silencing by recognizing and specifically binding to the predicted site of the hTERT mRNA 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) specifically. Furthermore, hTERT knockdown significantly decreased the growth and viability of glioma cells. These results indicate that miR-661 can inhibit glioma cell proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting hTERT.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3' untranslated regions 3aalgorithms 3acell proliferation 3afluorescence 3agene silencing 3agenes 3amicroRNA 3aprediction 3aviability 0aMiR-661 0ahTERT 0aGlioma 0aCell growth 0aCell invasion1 aLiu, Yunhui,1 aDiao, Hong-yu1 aMa, Jun1 aYao, Yi-long0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Dec. 25, v. 468 p.870-876dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.11.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02048naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245016500159300001800324520066100342592002801003650002201031650002301053650002301076650001801099650001301117650001101130650002001141650001201161650001701173650002101190650001901211650001401230700002001244700001901264700002301283700001901306700002001325700002001345700002101365773013301386856007401519852000901593655001201602IND60636335520221120142650.0190408e20190404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063633552DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc00397e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgienko, A.

Trehalose was used as a model target product. We report the X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis data which add surprising new information to the phase diagram of this previously repeatedly studied system. The freezing protocol has a strong impact on the specific surface area of the trehalose freeze-dried cakes and on the primary drying time.

Batsch] trees following late-season foliar application  ap. 839-844.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLate in the season, a double-labelled solution containing ¹⁵N-enriched urea and ⁶⁸Zn sulphate was painted on the entire leaf area of 15, 1-year-old ‘O’Henry/Nemaguard’ peach trees to quantify N and Zn movement out of leaves following foliar application, and redistribution of these nutrients to new growth in the following Spring. About 47% of the labelled N and only 7% of the labelled Zn painted on the leaf surfaces was recovered in the permanent structure of the trees after leaf fall. Thus, it is concluded that foliar applications of Zn in the Autumn are not very efficient at supplying Zn to peach trees, especially when compared to supplying N as urea sprays in the Autumn. These data raise the possibility that foliar applications of Zn may actually be considered as soil applications, because 90% or more of the foliar-applied Zn may be carried to the orchard floor at the time of leaf fall. Therefore, future research needs to focus on assessing the efficacy of foliar applications for Zn nutrition of fruit trees, and identification of potentially detrimental effects from possible excessive soil accumulation of Zn. Once within the tree, however, labelled Zn was quite mobile and was stored throughout the plant, including in the roots. Of the labelled N and Zn exported from treated leaves prior to leaf fall, a substantial redistribution from storage was evident by 2 weeks after bloom and, by 4 weeks after bloom, 38% and 56% of the labelled N and Zn, respectively, had been redistributed from storage in roots, trunk and 1-year-old shoots to new growth. The biomass of new, above-ground growth tripled between 2 – 4 weeks after bloom and was coincident with a conspicuous influx of both N and Zn from the soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus persica 3abiomass 3abiotechnology 3afoliar application 3afruits 3ahorticulture 3aleaf abscission 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3aorchards 3apeaches 3asoil 3asulfates 3aurea 3azinc1 aWeinbaum, S.

The resulting optimized conditions included 80mM sodium borate buffer, pH 10.07, containing 16.6mM sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 15mM α-cyclodextrin, using a separation voltage of 12.5kV at 23°C. Sensitivity was enhanced employing head-column field amplified sample stacking which resulted in limits of quantification between 30 and 50ng/mL and limits of detection between 10 and 17ng/mL after solid phase extraction of the lipoxygenase products. The method was validated according to the recommendations of the International Conference on Harmonization and applied to the determination of the lipoxygenase metabolites in polymorphonuclear leukocytes upon stimulation with Ca²⁺-ionophore A23187 and arachidonic acid. Robustness was confirmed using a three level resolution IV fractional factorial design. The novel method is suitable for the analysis of various arachidonic acid metabolites produced by cells and may be used for evaluation of lipoxygenase inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-cyclodextrin 3adetection limit 3ahumans 3amicellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3aarachidonic acid 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3aneutrophils 3apH 3atemperature 3aelectrophoresis 3asolid phase extraction 3ametabolites 3asodium borate 0alipoxygenase1 aSchaible, Anja M.1 aWerz, Oliver1 aScriba, Gerhard K.E.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 Dec. 7, v. 1267 p.217-223dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006100165300001800226520132000244592002801564650001101592650002001603650001401623650001501637650002201652650000901674650000901683650002001692650001001712650001401722650001101736650001301747651001601760651001001776700002101786700002401807700002001831773011601851856008101967852000902048655001202057IND60440603820221118024043.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044060382DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4181-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorò, Davide12aA regional rockfall database: the Eastern Alps test site  ap. 1731-1742.  aLandslide databases are essential tools for risk assessment. In the Italian portion of the South-Eastern Alps these archives are managed by the Veneto Region and by the provinces of Bolzano and Trento, as part of the Italian Inventory of Landslides. About 750 rockfall events recorded in these archives were checked, put together and completed to create a new integrated database. Information on 24 new rockfalls were added from different research sources. Descriptive statistic shows that the most affected slopes with the highest frequency of rockfall are the southern ones. The distribution of rockfalls during the year presents three peaks in March, June and November. The most commonly affected lithologies are massive dolomites, effusive rocks and mica schists. Roads proved to be the most commonly involved feature. The hypsographic curves obtained from the DEMs of the provinces of Belluno, Bolzano and Trento have shown that the different areas potentially affected by periglacial processes experience rockfalls during summer and autumn, thus representing a risk to tourists and hikers. This study is the first attempt to collate and extend the available information in the various rockfall databases in the Eastern Italian Alps, with the aim at creating uniform data collection for the whole Alpine range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3adata collection 3adatabases 3alandslides 3ametamorphic rocks 3amica 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aroads 3arockfalls 3asummer 3atourists 3aAlps region 3aItaly1 aGalgaro, Antonio1 aFontana, Alessandro1 aCarton, Alberto0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 July, v. 74, no. 2 p.1731-1742dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4181-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02299naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011000170500001900280520108500299592002801384650000901412650001501421650001201436650003101448650002101479650001101500650001801511650001401529653003001543653001701573653001501590653002701605653002301632700002001655700002401675773010601699856008701805852000901892655001201901IND60713980520221119053259.0201230e20210205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071398052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1255952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeoman, Baran10aOptimization of optical transparency of personal care products using the refractive index matching method  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMany toothpastes and personal care products consist of suspensions of silica particles in aqueous gels of humectants and other soluble constituents. It is highly desirable to develop new formulations that retain the desired characteristics of the original products but also have high optical transparency. Here, we used the refractive index matching method to manufacture highly transparent toothpastes. Accordingly, we determined the refractive indexes of different liquid gels, each containing a different humectant concentration, and measured the light transmittance and turbidity of formulations containing those gels and the silica. By fine tuning the humectant fraction in the gel, we obtained toothpastes with optimal transparency and also determined the effective refractive indexes of different commercial silica. All silica had similar indexes irrespective of their supplier, particle size distribution, and morphology. We believe that this approach could be extended to other commercial products and therefore contribute to the development of new advanced formulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3agels 3ahumectants 3aliquids 3aparticle size distribution 3arefractive index 3asilica 3atransmittance 3aturbidity 0aRefractive index matching 0aTransparency 0aToothpaste 0aPersonal care products 0aSilica dispersions1 aPotanin, Andrei1 aArmenante, Piero M.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Feb. 05, v. 610 p.125595-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1255953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01531naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002000136245007500156300001600231520062900247592002800876653001400904653002400918700002300942700002300965700003100988773015501019856007001174852000901244655001201253IND60131647420221120144646.0151127e200406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013164742DNAL7 a10.1638/03-0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbou-Madi, Noha10aDiagnosis of skeletal injuries in chelonians using computed tomography  ap. 226-231.  aComputed tomography (CT) was used to diagnose the cause of lameness in a radiated tortoise (Geochelone radiata) and to determine the extent of shell and skeletal trauma in two snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina).

Our results show that the conformation and function of luciferase change according to TFE concentration. Limited addition of TFE (below 10%) alters the tertiary structure and proteolytic rate with a similar digestion pattern, without noticeable changes in the secondary structure. Conformational changes result in loss of enzymatic activity. More addition of TFE (between 20% and 30%) disrupts the tertiary structure, and consequently the activity completely disappears without recovery upon dilution. Furthermore, at high protein concentration, significant aggregation is observed in this range of TFE concentration. A further increase in TFE concentration (above 30%) induces more helical structure, which is more resistant to tryptic attack. Overall, in spite of large conformational changes of luciferase induced by TFE, the prime-sites of proteolytic cleavage are still located at the same chain segments.  aPublisher supplied data 3adigestion 3aenzyme activity 3aluciferase 3aproteolysis 3aspectral analysis1 aHosseinkhani, Saman0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2015 Mar., v. 144 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009600164300002000260520134900280592002801629650001501657650001101672650002201683650001701705650002801722650001701750650001301767650001301780650001101793650002201804650001601826650002201842700001601864773010401880856008101984852000902065655001202074IND60580682720221118063203.0170926e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058068272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-017-1489-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuillén, C.10aNanocrystalline copper sulfide and copper selenide thin films with p-type metallic behavior  ap. 13886-13896.  aCopper chalcogenide materials are interesting for multiple applications due to the feasibility of suiting their optical absorption and electrical conduction by the creation of copper vacancies. Here, Cu ₓ S and Cu ₓ Se nanocrystalline films with p-type conductivity have been obtained by heating evaporated copper layers of various thicknesses with elemental sulfur or selenium, at temperatures ranging from 250 to 400 °C. These preparation parameters determine the composition and the crystalline structure of the samples, which in turn control their morphology, optical and electrical properties. Thus, the surface roughness increases with the mean crystallite size, whereas the hole concentration increases as the copper atomic proportion (or x value) decreases. Owing to the high carrier densities achieved, around 10²² cm⁻³, the samples show a metallic behavior with plasmonic absorption in the near infrared and electrical transport dominated by phonon scattering. Apart from such common behavior, some differences have been established between the sulfide and selenide films. One is the superior thermal stability of hexagonal CuS, present in all the temperature range, with respect to hexagonal CuSe, which evolves to cubic Cu₁.₈Se above 300 °C. Other is about the bandgap, wider for the sulfide than selenide samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acopper 3acrystal structure 3acrystallites 3aelectrical conductivity 3ananocrystals 3aselenium 3asulfides 3asulfur 3asurface roughness 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aHerrero, J.0 tJournal of materials science.g2017 Dec., v. 52, no. 24 p.13886-13896dSpringer USx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-017-1489-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03807naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151242019200168245016100360300001400521520139800535536015001933592002802083596010102111650001202212650001302224650002702237650001402264650002102278650001402299650001002313650001102323650001002334650002502344650001402369650002402383650002002407650001502427650001002442650001702452650001102469653003002480653004302510653002702553653001502580653003002595653003502625653005102660653003302711653004102744653003302785700001902818700002002837700002302857700002102880700002102901700002302922773011702945856008603062852000903148655001203157IND60679277020221119194606.0200509e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067927702DNAL7 a10.1080/19476337.2018.15519362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiss, Attila10aCambios en la composición de ácido graso libre y en el número de bacterias lácticas en tres productos funcionales de leche caprina y ovina fortificados con inulina o aceite de pescado10aChanges of free fatty acid composition and number of lactic acid bacteria in three functional goat and sheep milk products fortified with inulin or fish oil  ap. 51-59.  aInulin and fish oil rich in omega-3 fatty acid were applied to yoghurt, kefir, and smearcase made from goat and sheep milk, and their impact on fatty acid composition was investigated at 8°C throughout 40 days. The number of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was significantly diminished within 16 days, and by the end of the storage period the population size was decreased by 3 orders of magnitude in fish oil fortified samples. In inulin-fortified samples, a significant decrease in LAB number (by 2.5–3 orders of magnitude) was observed just by the end of the storage time, while the amount of unsaturated free fatty acids was increased. The extent of lipolysis and the resulted amount of free fatty acids exhibited varying feature depending on the composition of the product. Goat and sheep milk products exhibit analogous trends in terms of change in fatty acid composition with one exception: the ratio of free C16:0 was increased by 10% for goat milk products, while for the sheep milk products only by 3%. Ratio of C16:0 did not change during storage of sheep yoghurt as a result of inulin fortification. In contrast, 13% increase of this parameter was observed in case of the product variant prepared with fish oil addition. It might be stated that fortification with prebiotics can be regarded as a better way to improve the biological value of dairy products than that with fish oil.  aThe present work was funded by the National Research, Development and Innovation Office within the FUNKMILK project no.

Herein, we designed an effective strategy to optimize the interface architecture by depositing molybdenum disulfide on the copper foil surface (Cu–MoS₂) via magnetron sputtering. The Cu–MoS₂ is directly used as a current collector and supports the Li₄Ti₅O₁₂ anode (Cu–MoS₂–LTO). Typically, after being cycled at 1 A g–¹ for 300 cycles, the capacities of the Cu–LTO cell and Cu–MoS₂ cell are about 114.94 and 128.35 mA h g–¹, respectively, whereas the capacity of the Cu–MoS₂–LTO cell is as high as 373.9 mA h g–¹ with a capacity retention rate of 89.1%. The MoS₂ not only optimizes the interfacial architecture but also provides an additional capacity contribution to the Cu–MoS₂–LTO cell. Based on scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy test analysis, we propose a dual interface model. It is revealed that the molybdenum disulfide film can significantly improve the charge-transfer efficiency and uniformity of the interface, reduce internal resistance of the batteries, prevent oxidation of the copper foil, and thereby improve the chemical stability of the current collector. In addition, magnetron sputtering technology has large-scale productivity and greatly enhances the industrial application of this strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aanodes 3acopper 3afoil 3aindustrial applications 3alithium batteries 3amodels 3amolybdenum 3amolybdenum disulfide 3aoxidation 3ascanning electron microscopy 0amagnetron sputtering 0ainterface modification 0aCu−MoS2 current collector 0adual interface model1 aJiang, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4729-83961 aYao, Xiayin1 aLeng, Yongxiang1 aWang, Liping1 aXue, Qunji0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 July 04, v. 11, no. 30 p.26880-26890dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b072693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02056naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245008200164300002000246520098500266592002801251650001801279650001001297650001901307650001901326650001101345650000701356650001301363700001801376700002001394700001701414700002101431700002001452773013501472856007801607852000901685655001201694IND60541625920221120040129.0160822e20150930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054162592DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b067202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchach, Denise
K.10aReversible Activation of a Cell-Penetrating Peptide in a Membrane Environment  ap. 12199-12202.  aCell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are promising molecules as drug carriers. However, because their uptake mainly involves endocytic mechanisms, endosomal trapping of the carrier (and drug) remains a high barrier for biomedical applications. The viral fusion mimic GALA, a pH-triggered CPP, takes advantage of the decreasing pH during endosome maturation to selectively attack endosomal membranes. Below pH 6, the sequence folds into a helix and can disrupt membranes. In this study, we show that the lipid bilayer radius-of-curvature has a negligible effect on GALA-induced leakage kinetics and that GALA remains pH responsive after inserting into a lipid membrane. The peptide can be reversibly “switched” between its inactive and active states after incorporation into the hydrophobic environment of lipid membranes, even after substantially interacting with lipid chains. This ability makes GALA-based delivery a potentially safe and efficient strategy for endosomal escape.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug carriers 3adrugs 3ahydrophobicity 3alipid bilayers 3alipids 3apH 3apeptides1 aRock, William1 aFranz, Johannes1 aBonn, Mischa1 aParekh, Sapun H.1 aWeidner, Tobias0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Sept. 30, v. 137, no. 38 p.12199-12202dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b067203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01301naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245020200164500001400366520030000380592002800680650001700708650001700725650001800742700002500760700002700785773012500812856007700937852000901014655001201023IND60711637320221119025536.0200928e20200828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071163732DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox90908022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStehr, Jan  Eric10aComment on “Calmangafodipir Reduces Sensory Alterations and Prevents Intraepidermal Nerve Fibers Loss in a Mouse Model of Oxaliplatin Induced Peripheral Neurotoxicity” Antioxidants 2020, 9, 594  aNAL-light  aWe have with enthusiasm read the article “Calmangafodipir Reduces Sensory Alterations and Prevents Intraepidermal Nerve Fibers Loss in a Mouse Model of Oxaliplatin Induced Peripheral Neurotoxicity” written by Annalisa Canta, Guido Cavaletti and co-workers and published in Antioxidants [...]  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3anerve fibers 3aneurotoxicity1 aLundström, Ingemar,1 aKarlsson, Jan  Olof G.0 tAntioxidants.g2020 Aug. 28, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90908023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01807naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245005900164300002000223520085500243592002801098650001901126650002001145650001501165650002701180700001401207700001501221700001601236700001801252700001701270773010401287856008101391852000901472655001201481IND60580683120221118063007.0170926e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058068312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-017-1529-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Xiaomei10aElectrospinning of very long and highly aligned fibers  ap. 14004-14010.  aPreviously unattainable success in electrospinning of very long and highly aligned fibers has been achieved using various parallel conducting collectors, e.g., the U-shape collectors that are negatively connected to high-voltage power supply. Unlike the electrically grounded for the conventional gap electrospinning, collector in the negative connection is of effectiveness and ease to guide the charged jet to span across a very large gap and thus to become aligned arrays over large areas. Results demonstrate that well-aligned fibers with length over half a meter can be obtained and the suspended fibers can be further non-destructively transferred to other substrates or structures for specific uses. This work is believed to provide a new insight into fabrication of ultra-long fibers, which should broaden the applications of electrospinning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric power 3aelectrospraying 3ananofibers 3anondestructive methods1 aZhu, Ping1 aLu, Xizhao1 aLiu, Yifang1 aLei, Tingping1 aSun, Daoheng0 tJournal of materials science.g2017 Dec., v. 52, no. 24 p.14004-14010dSpringer USx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-017-1529-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01424naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245008000162300001800242520033600260592002800596650002100624650001600645650002300661650001700684650001300701650001800714650001600732650001100748700002300759700002200782700002100804700002100825773013300846856007400979852000901053655001201062IND60660974120221121052844.0190827e20150604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066097412DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc02771c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCassano, Domenico10aBiodegradable hollow silica nanospheres containing gold nanoparticle arrays  ap. 9939-9941.  aWe introduce biodegradable hollow silica nanocapsules embedding arrays of 3 nm gold nanoparticles.

Inadvertent vaccination during pregnancy may occur during clinical trials that include women of childbearing age. The potential risk associated with dengue vaccination in pregnancy remains unknown. We describe pregnancy outcomes following inadvertent dengue vaccination in pregnancy from CYD-TDV trial data.Data were collected from trials conducted as part of the CYD-TDV clinical development. Women who received CYD-TDV or placebo during the pre-specified pregnancy risk window (from 30 days before the date of their last menstrual period to end of pregnancy) were considered as exposed; pregnancies occurring in non-risk periods during the trials were considered to be non-exposed. Pregnancy losses were defined as abortion (spontaneous or unspecified), death in utero, and stillbirth.615 pregnancies were reported from 19 CYD-TDV trials: 404 in the CYD-TDV arm, and 211 in the placebo arm. Exposure could not be determined for 7 pregnancies (5, CYD-TDV; 2, placebo). In the CYD-TDV arm, 58 pregnancies were considered as exposed. Most of these (n = 47, 81%) had healthy live births; 6 (10.3%) had pregnancy losses; 3 underwent elective termination and 2 had unknown outcome. In the placebo group, 30 pregnancies were considered exposed. Most of these (n = 25, 83%) had healthy births; 4 (13.3%) had pregnancy losses; and 1 had elective termination. Among non-exposed pregnancies, most resulted in healthy live births; 23/341 (6.7%) in the CYD-TDV group and 17/179 (9.5%) in the placebo group had pregnancy losses. Most reported pregnancy losses were in women considered high-risk for adverse pregnancy outcome, primarily due to young age.In the small dataset assessed, no evidence of increased adverse pregnancy outcomes has been identified from inadvertent immunization of women in early pregnancy with CYD-TDV compared with the control group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclinical trials 3adata collection 3adeath 3adengue 3aplacebos 3apregnancy outcome 3arisk 3avaccination 3avaccines 3awomen 0aDengue 0aCYD-TDV 0aDengue vaccine 0aDengvaxia® 0aPregnancy 0aPregnancy outcomes1 aWartel, Tram Anh1 aGailhardou, Sophia0 tVaccine.g2018 May 31, v. 36, no. 23 p.3345-3350dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.04.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03537naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013500163300001800298520176700316592002802083596006902111650003402180650000902214650002502223650002402248650001602272650001002288650001602298650001802314650001102332650002602343650002702369650001502396650002102411650001602432650001802448650001502466650001302481650001102494650002002505650003202525650001302557650002602570650001502596650001802611700002602629700002002655700002002675700002402695700002002719773013002739856008102869852000902950655001202959IND60645676320221120060340.0190529e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064567632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-018-1686-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUribe, Elsa10aEffect of different drying methods on phytochemical content and amino acid and fatty acid profiles of the green seaweed, Ulva spp.  ap. 1967-1979.  aGreen seaweeds are a potential source of proteins, minerals, fatty acids, and essential amino acids, and also often contain bioactive compounds with antioxidant activity. They have the potential to be a source of functional and nutraceutical ingredients. However, their elevated water content shortens shelf life; thus, a preservation method should be employed, such as drying. In the present article, Chilean green seaweed (Ulva spp.) was characterized and the effect of different drying methods (freeze-, vacuum-, solar-, and convective drying) on the quality of dried algae as functional ingredient, along with a description of the drying parameters for each method was evaluated. Proximate composition of fresh Ulva spp. indicated that, other than water, ash, protein, and crude fiber are the main constituents. Ulva samples also had a high amount of total dietary fiber (with an IFD/SFD ~ 1.5). The isotherm curve presented the typical type II sigmoid shape and the BET model gave the best fitting. There was a significant effect of drying method on proximate composition of dried Ulva and the convective drying the method that showed higher values for almost all parameters, except fat content. Color was not affected by drying and the typical green color was present in all samples. Total flavonoid content (TFC), total carotenoids and antioxidant capacity (DPPH and ORAC) were also higher in convective drying. In addition, other minor components with nutritional value were identified, such as essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs with a ω3/ω6 ratio of 1:1) and amino acids. Among the different drying methods applied, convective drying (70 °C, 120 min) better retained the physicochemical parameters and antioxidant capacity of Ulva spp.  aPublisher supplied data  a1160597cFondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aUlva 3aantioxidant activity 3abioactive compounds 3acarotenoids 3acolor 3acrude fiber 3adietary fiber 3adrying 3aessential amino acids 3afatty acid composition 3aflavonoids 3afunctional foods 3aingredients 3alipid content 3amacroalgae 3aminerals 3amodels 3anutritive value 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aproteins 3aproximate composition 3ashelf life 3awater content1 aVega-Gálvez, Antonio1 aGarcía, Vivian1 aPastén, Alexis1 aBohlander, Jessica,1 aGoñi, Gabriela0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2019 June, v. 31, no. 3 p.1967-1979dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-018-1686-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03714naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245007800168300001400246500001100260520217200271592002802443650001102471650002102482650001802503650001602521650002002537650001002557650001202567650001202579650001002591650002702601650001602628650001502644650001202659650001002671650001102681650001502692650001002707650001802717650001302735650002302748650002102771650001102792650000902803650002002812650001202832650001402844650001602858650001302874650001702887650000902904651001402913773010102927856007503028852000903103655001203112IND60440547920221117111559.0181116e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044054792DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029437362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDharmawardene, M. W. N.10aTrends in farm mechanization by sugarcane small land holders in Sri Lanka  ap. 16-22.  aReview  aThe mechanization of farm power is becoming extremely important day by day for the survival, efficiency and competitiveness of all field and plantation crops of the country. Sugarcane crop grown in the dry zone is no exception. In fact in these areas the available manpower is low due to low population densities and harsh climatic conditions and remoteness of locations from major cities. Thus scarcity of labour is common in sugarcane areas for manual work. Furthermore, labourer manual work get easily tired while working in the dry zone compared to the hills due to higher temperatures, harder soils, insolation and dry desiccating winds. Thus output of these workers is low compared to workers in the hills. In addition, cane fields tend to have a high population of poisonous snakes, which also make worker to be careful and slow in the cane fields. Thus timely agricultural operations get neglected causing crop losses while labour wages keep rising day by day especially during planting, weeding and harvesting/loading periods of sugarcane growing. Analysis of the cost components of sugarcane cultivation shows that harvesting of loading of cane comprise 35% of the costs followed by land preparation(21%), planting(16%), weeding(10%), fertilizer application(10%) and irrigation(8%).It is evident that harvesting and loading of cane is the highest cost component in sugarcane cultivation, while weeding fertilizer application, stubble shaving, earthing up, off baring in the ratoons are neglected by small land holder farmers as manual methods are labour intensive leading to considerable losses in crop production. Thus, small holder sugarcane farm mechanization to improve the productivity and ease strain on human labour has become crucial in order to improve sugarcane productivity in Sri Lanka.Some of the smallholder farm tools and implements developed by the Sugarcane Research Institute which can be powered by a two-wheeled tractor such as the SRI tyne cultivator, Fertilizer applicator, Disc ratooner, Furrow opener, and the new design sugarcane harvesting knife as well as the implements for animal drought technology are described in this review.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aclimatic factors 3acost analysis 3acrop losses 3acrop production 3acrops 3adrought 3afarmers 3afarms 3afertilizer application 3afertilizers 3aharvesting 3ahilling 3ahills 3ahumans 3airrigation 3alabor 3amechanization 3aplanting 3apopulation density 3asite preparation 3asnakes 3asoil 3asolar radiation 3astubble 3asugarcane 3atemperature 3atractors 3aweed control 3awind 3aSri Lanka0 tSugar tech.g2006 Mar., v. 8, no. 1 p.16-22dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000000155x0972-15257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF029437363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012800169300001600297500001900313520128800332592002801620650001501648650001101663650001301674650002401687650001301711650001601724653002701740653002101767653002101788653001801809653002301827653003201850700001701882700001901899700002301918700002001941700002201961700002201983700001802005700001902023700001702042700001302059700001402072773009002086856008502176852000902261655001202270IND60720494520221117003334.0210513e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072049452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2020.12.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoppel, Miriam10aIn situ observation of pressure modulated reversible structural changes in the graphitic domains of carbide-derived carbons  ap. 190-200.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCarbons are important in a multitude of applications, and thus, the reversible control of carbon structures is of high interest. Here we report the reversible formation of graphitic structures with three distinct interlayer distances in case of two carbide-derived carbons (CDCs) loaded under hydrogen pressure observed with in situ neutron scattering methods. The formation of these graphitic structures determined with in situ neutron diffraction is brought forth by the confinement of H₂ in the porous structure when the temperature, T, is increased from T = 20 K–50 K under H₂ loading from 68 mbar to 10 bar. The confinement of the desorbing H₂ causes the pressure to increase inside the CDC structure and this increase of pressure is the cause for the reversible formation of graphitic domains. The confinement of H₂ at T = 50 K is possible due to the presence of ultramicropores and suitable curved carbon structures. The three distinct formed graphitic domains correspond to a highly pressurized, conventional highly ordered graphitic, and disoriented graphitic domains with possible H₂/H intercalation. In situ quasi-elastic neutron scattering and gas adsorption methods are used to determine the H₂ transport properties and interactions with the CDCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3ahydrogen 3aneutron diffraction 3aneutrons 3atemperature 0aCarbide-derived-carbon 0aPorous materials 0aEnergy materials 0aH2 adsorption 0aNeutron scattering 0aGraphitic structure control1 aPalm, Rasmus1 aHärmas, Riinu1 aRussina, Margarita1 aMatsubara, Nami1 aMånsson, Martin,1 aGrzimek, Veronika1 aPaalo, Maarja1 aAruväli, Jaan1 aRomann, Tavo1 aOll, Ove1 aLust, Enn0 tCarbon.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 174 p.190-200dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2020.12.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245012400181300002000305520135700325592002801682650002701710650002101737650001701758650001401775650001401789650002101803650001401824650002001838650001601858700001801874700001901892700002801911700001701939700005601956773013202012856008402144852000902228655001202237IND60675328820221120061428.0191105e20190917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067532882DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b028742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD.

Even though untagged flagella are dark to the optical method, the label-free nature of the nanopore sensor allows it to characterize both tagged (Cy3) and pristine forms of flagella (including real-time developments). Flagella were depolymerized to flagellin subunits at ∼65 °C (most commonly reported temperature), ∼70 °C, ∼75 °C, and ∼80 °C to investigate the effect of temperature (Tdₑₚₒₗ) on depolymerization. The change in conductance (ΔG) profiles corresponding to Tdₑₚₒₗ ∼65 °C and ∼70 °C were bracketed within the flagellin monomer profile whereas those of ∼75 °C and ∼80 °C extended beyond this profile, suggesting a change to the native protein state. The molecular radius calculated from the excluded electrolyte volume of flagellin through nanopore-based ΔG characteristics for each Tdₑₚₒₗ of ∼65 °C, ∼70 °C, ∼75 °C, and ∼80 °C yielded ∼4.2 ± 0.2 nm, ∼4.3 ± 0.3 nm, ∼4.1 ± 0.2 nm, and ∼4.7 ± 0.5 nm, respectively. This, along with ΔG (plateaued values) and translocation time profiles, points to the possibility of flagellin misfolding at ∼80 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3adepolymerization 3aelectrolytes 3aflagellin 3aflagellum 3alight microscopy 3ananopores 3asilicon nitride 3atemperature1 aTang, Jiannan1 aSaharia, Jugal1 aRogowski, Louis William1 aAhn, Chi Won1 aKim, Min Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0819-16440 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Sept. 17, v. 91, no. 21 p.13665-13674dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b028743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02288naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094040001800113100002400131245009600155300001600251520145900267592002801726653001601754653001301770653001501783653001601798700002201814773009801836856006701934852000902001655001202010IND60131220520221117002928.0151127e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013122052DNAL7 a10.1672/42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdamowicz, Susan C.10aNew england salt marsh pools: a quantitative analysis of geomorphic and geographic features  ap. 279-288.  aNew England salt marsh pools provide important wildlife habitat and are the object of on-going salt marsh restoration projects; however, they have not been quantified in terms of their basic geomorphic and geographic traits. An examination of 32 ditched and unditched salt marshes from the Connecticut shore of Long Island Sound to southern Maine, USA, revealed that pools from ditched and unditched marshes had similar average sizes of about 200 m², averaged 29 cm in depth, and were located about 11 m from the nearest tidal flow. Unditched marshes had 3 times the density (13 pools/ha), 2.5 times the pool coverage (83 m pool/km transect), and 4 times the total pool surface area per hectare (913 m² pool/ha salt marsh) of ditched sites. Linear regression analysis demonstrated that an increasing density of ditches (m ditch/ha salt marsh) was negatively correlated with pool density and total pool surface area per hectare. Creek density was positively correlated with these variables. Thus, it was not the mere presence of drainage channels that were associated with low numbers of pools, but their type (ditch versus creek) and abundance. Tidal range was not correlated with pool density or total pool surface area, while marsh latitude had only a weak relationship to total pool surface area per hectare. Pools should be incorporated into salt marsh restoration planning, and the parameters quantified here may be used as initial design targets.  aPublisher supplied data 0amarsh pools 0aditching 0asalt marsh 0aNew England1 aRoman, Charles T.0 tWetlands.g2005 June, v. 25, no. 2 p.279-288dSociety of Wetlands Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002300148245009700171300001600268520162200284592002801906650001301934650001901947650000901966650001101975650001701986650001202003650001802015650001602033650001002049650001302059650001302072650001402085650003002099650001602129650000902145650001402154650001102168650000902179700002102188700002102209773010602230856008402336852000902420655001202429IND4458822520221120085846.0141111e20110815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445882252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2011.04.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOblinger, Brent W.10aRed pine harvest debris as a potential source of inoculum of Diplodia shoot blight pathogens  ap. 663-670.  aA high incidence of Diplodia shoot blight (site means ranging 85–100%) was observed on recently planted red pine (Pinus resinosa) seedlings where mature red pine stands previously had been clearcut. An investigation of the potential of harvest debris as a source of inoculum of Diplodia pathogens then was conducted. Cones, bark, needles, stems from shoots bearing needles, and stems from shoots not bearing needles (both suspended above the soil and in soil contact) were collected from harvest debris left at sites where clearcutting occurred. Conidia were quantified, and their germination rate was assessed, and Diplodia species were identified using PCR. Conidia of Diplodia species were found at all study sites and conidia counts increased from samples collected from 6 to 18months after harvest. Germinable conidia were obtained from debris collected 6months to 5years after harvest. Fewer conidia were obtained from debris collected at intervals of up to 4–5years after harvest and the percentage of germinable conidia was lower after longer intervals following harvest. More conidia were obtained and a greater percentage germinated from debris collected above the soil than from debris in soil contact. The host substrate also influenced the number of conidia and the percentage that germinated. Planting red pine seedlings next to debris infested with Diplodia pathogens could provide a persistent source of inoculum. Results should prompt further consideration by land managers and researchers of the potential forest health risks, in addition to benefits, that may be associated with harvest debris.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiplodia 3aPinus resinosa 3abark 3ablight 3aclearcutting 3aconidia 3aforest health 3agermination 3ahosts 3ainoculum 3amanagers 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aresearchers 3arisk 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asoil1 aSmith, Denise R.1 aStanosz, Glen R.0 tForest ecology and management.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 262, no. 4 p.663-670dElsevier B.V.x0378-11277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2011.04.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008500170300001600255520095900271592002801230650002001258650000901278650001901287650001701306650000901323650002801332650001901360650002401379650001001403650001101413650002101424653003001445653003001475653001001505653002301515653002001538700001901558700001501577773009401592856008401686852000901770655001201779IND60479748520221118071323.0160123e20040501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047974852DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.33.2004.2.102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastillo A., L.A.10aEffect of high hydrostatic pressure and nisin on micro-organisms in minced meats  ap. 183-190.  aThe effect of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and nisin was studied on micro-organisms in minced chicken and beef meat. Pressure in the range of 0-800 MPa and nisin (670 IU g<sup>-1</sup>) were applied for vacuum packed minced meat. In chicken meat the total viable cell count decreased by 3 log cycles as an effect of HHP at 300 MPa and by 5 log cycles in combination with nisin. The D value is 35-39 MPa for pseudomonads in minced chicken meat. In case of inoculation with L. monocytogenes, the cell count in beef meat was reduced only by pressure higher than 200 MPa (“shoulder”) with a characteristic value of D=37-38 MPa. B. cereus spores, both dormant and heat activated, were very resistant (D=800 MPa) in beef. However, the survival of pressurised spores after chilled storage (for two weeks at 4 °C) was smaller for non-heat activated spores than for heat activated spores. Efficiency of HHP combined with nisin needs further research work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3abeef 3acell viability 3acold storage 3aheat 3ahigh pressure treatment 3amicroorganisms 3aminced chicken meat 3anisin 3aspores 3avacuum packaging 0ahigh hydrostatic pressure 0ahigh hydrostatic pressure 0anisin 0acombined treatment 0adecontamination1 aMészáros, L.1 aKiss, I.F.0 tActa alimentaria.g2004 May 1, v. 33, no. 2 p.183-190dAkadémiai Kiadóx0139-30067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAlim.33.2004.2.103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245012900161300001400290520135400304592002801658650002101686650001301707650001801720650001201738650002101750650001301771650001701784650001401801650001401815650002001829650002101849650001801870650001701888650001401905650002001919650000701939650001701946653001601963653003101979653002702010653001802037700001602055700002202071773010802093856007902201852000902280655001202289IND60519923820160819000000.0160511e20160305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051992382DNAL7 a10.1515/cerce-2015-00552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYousefi, S.10aBiochemical Properties and Fruit Quality of "Jahangiri" (Prunus armeniaca L.)

The present study was therefore undertaken to assess the effects of CaCl₂ pre harvest treatment on some of the biochemical properties and fruit quality of "Jahangiri" (Prunus armeniaca L.) apricot at harvest time and during four weeks cold storage at 0°C. The combined analysis of variances indicated that year had a significant influence on all studied parameters of "Jahangiri" cultivar. CaCl₂ pre harvest treatments also affected significantly the most of studied parameters. The interaction between year and Ca treatment was also significant. Results of these tests showed that pre harvest application of Ca foliar spray increased some of biochemical properties (protein, free amino acid and non protein) and fruit quality (fruit density) of apricot cultivar "Jahangiri". In addition, the contents of fruit-Ca, -Mg, -N, and vitamin C were higher than those in the control at harvest time and after four weeks storage at 0°C.

Due to the relatively small area of these wildlands, the accuracy of fire risk-assessment plays a significant role in fire management. Introducing the experience of real events can improve accuracy. But this approach is limited by a lack of knowledge of pre-fire conditions, mainly vegetation characteristics as related to their definition as a fuel parameter because of their high temporal variation. To solve this problem, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was designed to reconstruct the spectral characteristics of the vegetation just before the fire with spatial resolution 0.5–2 m from the Landsat image. To test the effectiveness of the proposed methods, the approach has been examined on urban vegetation sites and applied to restore spectral information of the actual vegetation patch before it was burned in 2016 in Haifa, Israel. The results show that the reconstructed RGB image allows for mapping the location of green vegetation with high spatial accuracy. However, spectral data in the visible range have some limitations when it comes to identifying differences between soil and dry plants. The reconstructed image was used to sharp the original data from Landsat. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index maps were produced from the resulting high-resolution multispectral image. The output maps allow to determine the location of vegetation and estimate the level of its dryness on the urban wildland landscape. The proposed method aims to estimate vegetation dryness and, as a result, identify the fuel characteristics at the time of the fire. It has the potential of using for evaluation and improve the weights of the input parameters for the fire-risk assessment and fire-behavior modeling on a specific area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acities 3afire behavior 3afuels 3ainfrastructure 3alandscapes 3amultispectral imagery 3aneural networks 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apopulation characteristics 3arisk assessment 3asoil 3atemporal variation 3avegetation 3awildfires 3awildland 3awildland-urban interface 3aIsrael 0aPre-fire conditions 0aArtificial neural network 0aSatellite imagery 0aUrban vegetation1 aWittenberg, Lea1 aKutiel, Haim1 aBrook, Anna0 tJournal of environmental management.g2019 May 15, v. 238 p.224-234dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.02.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094040001800113100002300131245011900154300001600273520137400289592002801663653002301691653002301714653003001737653003801767653002401805653001801829773009801847856006701945852000902012655001202021IND60131220720221117003528.0151127e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013122072DNAL7 a10.1672/62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD'Angelo, Elisa M.10aPhosphorus sorption capacity and exchange by soils from mitigated and late successional bottomland forest wetlands  ap. 297-305.  aA central tenet of wetland mitigation is that replacement wetlands can sequester nutrients and perform other functions at the same level as natural wetlands. This study evaluated phosphorus (P) sorption capacity and P exchange in flooded soil microcosms obtained from eight early successional (ES) mitigated and eight late successional (LS) bottomland forest wetlands in western Kentucky, USA. The LS soils had three times greater capacity to remove and retain soluble inorganic P than ES soils, which was mostly due to higher amounts of amorphous aluminum (Al) oxides (oxalate extractable), organically-bound Al (CuCl₂ extractable), and organic carbon in LS soils. Phosphorus exchange rates between the soil and water column were not significantly different in LS and ES microcosms, but rates in both systems were strongly related to the molar ratio of Mehlich III extractable P to Al ++ Fe in the soil (r²==0.64). Relationships between P sorption/exchange and organic C, Mehlich III- and oxalate-extractable forms of P, Al, and Fe determined in this study could be useful for (i) identifying suitable mitigation sites that would be P sinks rather than P sources to the water column and (ii) determining replacement ratios that would fairly compensate for P retention capacity losses caused by destruction/alteration of Kentucky bottomland hardwood forest wetlands.  aPublisher supplied data 0awetland succession 0asorption isotherms 0aphosphorus sorption index 0aphosphorus chemical fractionation 0aaluminum speciation 0awater quality0 tWetlands.g2005 June, v. 25, no. 2 p.297-305dSociety of Wetlands Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010800156520152500264592002801789650002301817650002101840650001101861650001001872650003301882650001201915651002101927700001601948773012601964856007402090852000902164655001202173IND60652938520221122030751.0190713e20190510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065293852DNAL7 a10.3390/su110926662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYun, Sunmi 10aWhat Do Coffee Shop Entrepreneurs Need to Do to Raise Pro-Environmental Customer Behavioral Intentions?  aOur research framework, built on the norm activation model (NAM), was designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the formation of consumers&rsquo; pro-environmental behavioral intentions in an eco-friendly coffee shop. We employed the NAM to test its mediating effect of personal environmental norms (PEN), social environmental norms (SEN), and ascription of responsibility (AR) and the moderating effect of the overall green image (OGI) on pro-environmental behavioral intentions. Data were collected through a survey of 530 customers who frequently visited a coffee shop in Korea, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the research hypotheses. The findings generally supported the hypothesized associations of the study variables within our proposed theoretical framework (PEN, SEN, and AR in order of the mediating effect on pro-environmental behavioral intentions) and confirmed OGI&rsquo;s moderating effect. In addition, the study&rsquo;s results have important (1) theoretical and (2) practical implications for the environment. (1) They expand the original NAM by explaining the effect of the relationship between SEN and PEN on pro-environmental customer behavioral intentions (PCBI) and confirm the mediating effect of the NAM (SEN, PEN, AR) on PCBI, as demonstrated in previous studies. (2) Moreover, the findings herein may encourage coffee shops to participate in the prevention of environmental problems by restricting the use of products such as plastic coffee cups and straws.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumers (people) 3aentrepreneurship 3amodels 3astraw 3astructural equation modeling 3asurveys 3aKorean Peninsula1 aKim, Taeuk 0 tSustainability.g2019 May 10, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110926663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245013600178520102300314592002801337650002501365650001701390650002401407650002401431650001901455650001901474650001301493650002001506650001701526650002001543653002701563653003401590653001301624653002301637653001201660653002201672700001701694700001801711773010001729856008701829852000901916655001201925IND60735715120221118182707.0210813e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073571512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1298742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-García, E.10aImpact of the use of pressurized liquids on the extraction and functionality of proteins and bioactives from brewer’s spent grain  aA green methodology based on pressurized liquids (PLE) to extract proteins and obtain highly active extracts from brewer’s spent grain (BSG) is proposed.

Moreover, increasing emphasis has recently been given to the use of low-cost adsorbents (generally solid wastes) for the treatment of polluted water, with a resulting double benefit for the environment.In this paper, the use of red mud and pyrolusite has been investigated for the removal of As and Mn from drinking water. Adsorption equilibrium data have been examined through the application of constant temperature models (isotherms), while batch and dynamic tests have been used to clarify the effects of pH, initial metal ion concentration and temperature on the adsorption performance, aiming at identifying the best conditions for the treatment.The combined use of the two adsorbents allows exploiting their properties synergistically, maximizing efficacy and sustainability without affecting process design and costs. In particular, ‘clean’ water (i.e. water with heavy metals contents below law limits) has been obtained even after the passage of a volume of solution higher than 40 bed volumes, and considering initial unrealistically high concentrations for the metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aarsenic 3acost effectiveness 3adeveloping countries 3adrinking water 3aeconomic resources 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3amanganese 3amodels 3apH 3aprocess design 3asolid wastes 3atemperature 3awastewater treatment 3awater pollution 0aDrinking water 0aMetals removal 0aMetals adsorption 0aLow-cost adsorbents 0aWaste reuse 0aAccessible technologies1 aIppolito, Nicolò Maria1 aFerro, Sergio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0797-795X1 aDovì, Vincenzo Giorgio1 aVocciante, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6824-44880 tJournal of environmental management.g2019 May 01, v. 237 p.526-533dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.02.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245011300158300001400271520139400285592002801679650001301707650002201720650002401742650001901766650000901785650001201794650002601806650000901832650001301841650001001854650001801864650001001882650001001892650001501902650002201917650001401939650001201953650000901965651001001974653001501984653002201999653001402021653004402035653001702079653002602096700001802122700001802140773008902158856007802247852000902325655001202334IND60128222020221118132639.0151115e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012822202DNAL7 a10.3105/018.030.01052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkada, Yuki10aInterpopulation Variation in Sex Ratio of the Japanese Pond Turtle Mauremys japonica (Reptilia: Geoemydidae)  ap. 53-61.  aWe investigated sex ratio in seven populations of the Japanese pond turtle, Mauremys japonica, inhabiting ponds in the central region of Aichi Prefecture, Japan. The sex ratio, calculated as a numerical proportion (%) of males to total individuals sexed, was highly variable among the populations, ranging from no more than 20.0% to no less than 92.9%. Since M. japonica shows a temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) with eggs producing more males under a relatively low incubation temperature and more females under a higher temperature, we hypothesized that the observed remarkable inter-population variation in sex ratio reflects that in the nest temperature. Our field observations indicated that the nesting sites of male-biased populations were largely shaded by wood, thus supposedly under a relatively low ambient temperature, while those of female-biased populations were located in open environments with direct exposure to solar heat. These results offer a circumstantial support to the above hypothesis. Remarkably skewed sex ratios observed in some populations might reflect the effect of substantial habitat fragmentation and severe nesting site limitation caused by recent artificial land development and changes in agricultural land use. If this is actually the case and the effect continues to operate, many of the M. japonica populations may eventually disappear.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReptilia 3aagricultural land 3aambient temperature 3adirect contact 3aeggs 3afemales 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aheat 3aland use 3amales 3anesting sites 3anests 3aponds 3apopulation 3asex determination 3asex ratio 3aturtles 3awood 3aJapan 0aTestudines 0aMauremys japonica 0aSex ratio 0aTemperature-dependent sex determination 0aNesting site 0aHabitat fragmentation1 aYabe, Takashi1 aOda, Sen-Ichi0 tCurrent herpetology.g2011 June, v. 30, no. 1 p.53-61dUniBio Pressx1881-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3105%2F018.030.01053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010600165300001600271520093400287592002801221650004301249650003001292650004401322650003101366650002501397650001401422650001301436650002501449650001101474650001501485650001101500650001401511650001901525650002401544650001201568650000701580650001501587650002401602650001201626650001701638650001201655653001701667653001701684653001201701653002301713653002301736700001501759700002301774773009401797856008301891852000901974655001201983IND60479748920221118071207.0160123e20040501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047974892DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.33.2004.2.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBehrens, J.H.10aFermentation of soymilk by commercial lactic cultures: Development of a product with market potential  ap. 101-109.  aSoymilk supplemented with 2% sucrose was inoculated with a mixture of Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis and Lactobacillus acidophilus.

This study demonstrated that it is possible to formulate highly acceptable soymilk beverages by way of lactic fermentation and addition of flavourings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 3aanalysis of variance 3abeverages 3acoconuts 3aconsumer preferences 3aflavor 3aflavorings 3aguavas 3ahazelnuts 3ahedonic scales 3alactic fermentation 3amarkets 3apH 3apineapples 3aproduct development 3asoymilk 3astrawberries 3asucrose 0afermentation 0afermentation 0asoymilk 0asensory evaluation 0apreference mapping1 aRoig, S.M.1 aDa Silva, M.A.A.P.0 tActa alimentaria.g2004 May 1, v. 33, no. 2 p.101-109dAkadémiai Kiadóx0139-30067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAlim.33.2004.2.23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245013300168300001600301520133400317592002801651650001501679650002301694650001201717650001501729650001601744650001501760650001201775650001401787651001001801651002001811653001401831653001801845653003101863653001401894653001401908773023601922856008402158852000902242655001202251IND60543634820221118052606.0190411e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054363482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2014.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakagi, Etsuro10aHerbivory by Strongylocoris leucocephalus (Hemiptera: Miridae) on a novel host plant Adenophora triphylla var. japonica in Japan  ap. 499-503.  aWhen monophagous and oligophagous insect herbivores colonize new areas, they sometimes use novel hosts. The availability of the new hosts can facilitate further expansion into regions beyond the geographic range of the original hosts, resulting in specialization on different host plant taxa in different parts of the herbivore's geographic range. Strongylocoris leucocephalus Linnaeus (Hemiptera: Miridae), which is a plant bug attacking Campanula spp., is widely distributed in the Eurasian continent, North Africa, and northern Japan. In the process of geographic range expansion, S. leucocephalus may incorporate novel host plants into their host range. I investigated the host plant species of S. leucocephalus in central Japan. Field observations revealed that the plant bug fed on the novel host plant Adenophora triphylla (Thunb.) A. DC. var. japonica (Regel) H. Hara (Campanulaceae), although feeding by S. leucocephalus was not associated with plant mortality. However, S. leucocephalus never fed on Campanula punctata Lam. var. hondoensis (Kitam.) Ohwi, the only Campanula species at the study site. The plant bug S. leucocephalus and the novel host plant A. triphylla var. japonica are not entirely distributed sympatrically, suggesting that the plant bug has expanded its geographic range by incorporating new hosts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenophora 3aCampanula punctata 3aMiridae 3aherbivores 3ahost plants 3ahost range 3ainsects 3amortality 3aJapan 3aNorthern Africa 0aCampanula 0aCampanulaceae 0aGeographic range expansion 0aHalticini 0aPlant bug0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2014 Sept., v. 17, no. 3 p.499-503dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied Entomology, Taiwan Entomological Society and Malaysian Plant Protection Society.wJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2014.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02126naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245008600164520085800250592002801108650001201136650001801148650001401166650001501180650001301195650001701208650000901225650001801234650002601252650002001278650002901298700001401327700001701341700001801358700002401376700001801400700002001418700002101438700002301459773012101482856008001603852000901683655001201692IND60763397120221120141643.0220120e20220112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076339712DNAL7 a10.3390/biology110101232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlli, Abdel A.10aIron Inhibits the Translation and Activity of the Renal Epithelial Sodium Channel  aHypertension is associated with an increased renal expression and activity of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and iron deficiency. Distal tubules absorb iron, causing perturbations that may influence local responses. In this observational study, we investigated the relationship between iron content and ENaC expression and activity using two cell lines and hepcidin knockout mice (a murine model of iron overload). We found that iron did not transcriptionally regulate ENaC in hepcidin knockout mice or in vitro in collecting duct cells. However, the renal tubules of hepcidin knockout mice have a lower expression of ENaC protein. ENaC activity in cultured Xenopus 2F3 cells and mpkCCD cells was inhibited by iron, which could be reversed by iron chelation. Thus, our novel findings implicate iron as a regulator of ENaC protein and its activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXenopus 3aanimal models 3achelation 3aepithelium 3ahepcidin 3ahypertension 3airon 3airon overload 3aobservational studies 3asodium channels 3atranscription (genetics)1 aYu, Ling 1 aWlazlo, Ewa 1 aKasem, Sadat 1 aGholam, Mohammed F.1 aDesai, Dhruv 1 aLugo, Carlos I.1 aVaulont, Sophie 1 aScindia, Yogesh M.0 tBiology.g2022 Jan. 12, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110101233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005400139245012600193500001900319500002000338520134400358592002801702596010101730596007501831650002101906650001901927650002101946650001801967650001001985650001601995650002502011650001002036650001402046650004302060650001002103650002402113650002002137700001302157700001802170700001702188700001502205700001702220773012602237856007302363852000902436655001202445IND60722269620221117175347.0201230e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072226962DNAL7 a10.1111/asj.133782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ling1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4385-002410aEffects of early pregnancy on expression of interferon‐stimulated gene 15, STAT1, OAS1, MX1, and IP‐10 in ovine liver  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInterferon‐tau (IFNT) regulates maternal recognition during early pregnancy in ruminants. The liver can serve as a hematopoietic organ, and it has immune functions. This study hypothesized whether mRNA and proteins of interferon‐stimulated genes (ISGs) induced by early pregnancy are upregulated in maternal liver. Therefore, we determined the expression of interferon‐stimulated gene 15‐kDa protein (ISG15), 2',5'‐oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), myxovirus resistance protein 1 (MX1), interferon‐gamma‐inducible protein 10 (IP‐10), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) in maternal livers during early pregnancy in sheep. Ovine livers were sampled on day 16 of the estrous cycle, and days 13, 16, and 25 of pregnancy, and expression of ISGs was detected by quantitative real‐time PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry analysis. Our results showed that there were increases in expression of the mRNA and proteins of ISG15, OAS1, IP‐10, STAT1, and MX1 during early pregnancy. STAT1 protein was limited to the hepatocytes, and endothelial cells of proper hepatic arteries and hepatic portal veins. In conclusion, the upregulation of ISG15, OAS1, IP‐10, STAT1, and MX1 proteins may be implicated in maternal hepatic immune adjustment and other functions during early pregnancy in sheep.  aPublisher supplied data  aZD2016069cTechnology Research Project of Higher Education Institutions of Hebei Province, China  a18236601DcScience and Technology R&D Project of Hebei Province, China 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal science 3achemokine CXCL10 3aestrous cycle 3agenes 3ahepatocytes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aliver 3apregnancy 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asheep 3asignal transduction 3atransactivators1 aLi, Ning1 aZhang, Leying1 aBai, Jiachen1 aZhao, Zimo1 aWang, Yujiao0 tAnimal science journal =.g2020 Jan., v. 91, no. 1 p.e13378-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867063x1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asj.133783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01882naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006300151245011600214300002000330520062300350592002800973650001201001650001801013650001201031650001401043650002301057650001201080650001001092653001201102653001201114653001901126653001401145653001201159700002501171700005901196773014601255856008601401852000901487655001201496IND60655790120191020000000.0191020e20190711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065579012DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b025202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖtvös, Sándor B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6673-174410aBismuth(III)-Catalyzed Hydration of Terminal Alkynes: Sustainable Synthesis of Methyl Ketones in Batch and Flow  ap. 13286-13293.  aEnvironmentally benign synthesis of methyl ketones is demonstrated via unprecedented bismuth(III)-catalyzed activation and Markovnikov-type hydration of terminal acetylenes.

However, dramatically increased pollution has threatened the safety of drinking water supply in recent years. In the present study, we investigated the contaminations of nutrients and heavy metals in the sediments of an intake and inflow canals in Gonghu Bay, Taihu Lake. Moreover, we also examined the impact of human activities on spatial distribution characteristics of contaminations. Our results showed that the intake presented relatively lower concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen compared with inflow canals. However, the concentrations of Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb in the sediments of the intake exceeded the lowest effect level (LEL) values, indicating a potential risk to drinking water resource. In addition, the concentrations of Ni in the sediments of Tianji Canal and Jinshu Canal exceeded the severe effect level (SEL) value. More importantly, the concentrations of Cu in the sediments of Tianji Canal exceeded three times of the SEL value. Multivariate statistical analysis confirmed that the domestic sewage primarily contributed to the nutrient accumulation, and the leakage of electronic trash dominated the enrichment of metals in the sediments. Taken together, more effort should be made to ensure the security of water resources in Taihu Lake, especially for the treatment of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3achromium 3acopper 3adrinking water 3afreshwater 3aheavy metals 3alakes 3alead 3amultivariate analysis 3anickel 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3arisk 3asediments 3asewage 3awastewater 3awater supply 3azinc 3aChina1 aDing, Shiming1 aZhang, Qi1 aHu, Weiping0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2015 Aug., v. 9, no. 4 p.665-674dHigher Education Pressx2095-22017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-014-0701-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245012500160300001400285520163400299592002801933650001701961650001001978650001001988650001901998650002502017650001102042650002602053650002302079650001902102650002102121650002402142650001402166650001402180650001102194650000902205650001002214650001202224650001402236650002302250650002002273650002502293653001002318653001102328653001202339653000902351653001002360700003002370700001402400700001702414700001402431773010902445856007902554852000902633655001202642IND60519924220160819000000.0160513e20160430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051992422DNAL7 a10.1515/cerce-2016-00022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarwar, N.10aBoron Nutrition Under Intermittent Flooding and Drying Condition Seems Sustainable Nutrient Management Technique in Rice  ap. 17-27.  aWater saving rice cultivation is emerging technique to couple with irrigation water shortage due to climate change all over the world. Major issue in these techniques is to compromise yield and quality fatalities because of higher unfilled grain due to nutrients deficiency. Boron fertilization seems to be big management technique to improve rice agriculture due to having imperative role in pollen viability. Thus, a field experiment was conducted to see the impact of boron fertilization both with basal and foliar application methods in water saving rice cultivation systems. Boron, with basal (3 kg borax/acre) and foliar (2% boron) was applied at different growth stages in rice crop grown under various rice cultivation systems; flooded rice, intermittent flooding and drying and aerobic rice. Boron fertilization both with basal and foliar application technique resulted in improved crop performance in all cultivation systems. Rice plants recorded highest yield, yield attributing parameters like productive tillers, panicle length and grain weight with boron fertilization. Quality parameters like sterile kernels, abortive kernels, opaque kernels were significantly reduced with boron fertilization in all rice cultivation systems. Furthermore, normal kernels were enhanced with basal and foliar application of boron nutrition. Likewise, maximum water use efficiency was recorded in foliar application of boron at panicle stage under intermittent flooding and drying condition. Foliar application of boron nutrition at panicle initiation stage was found to be most appropriate in water saving rice cultivation systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aborax 3aboron 3aclimate change 3adevelopmental stages 3adrying 3afield experimentation 3afoliar application 3ainflorescences 3airrigation water 3anutrient management 3anutrients 3anutrition 3apollen 3arice 3aseeds 3atillers 3aviability 3awater conservation 3awater shortages 3awater use efficiency 0aBoron 0agrowth 0aQuality 0aRice 0aYield1 aCauhdarī, Hādī ʻAlī,1 aIrfan, M.1 aAkhter, M.T.1 aAli, M.T.0 tCercetări agronomice în Moldova.g2016 Apr. 30, v. 49, no. 1 p.17-27dDe Gruyter Openx2067-18657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/cerce-2016-00023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02107naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245010500164300001800269520086300287592002801150650001101178650001001189650001201199650002001211650001801231650001201249650002301261650001601284700001901300700001701319700001801336700002001354700002201374700002101396700001901417700002001436700002201456773012401478856007401602852000901676655001201685IND60662752320221120193348.0190906e20140526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066275232DNAL7 a10.1039/c4gc00274a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKilpeläinen, P.

The hemicellulose yields were 50 wt% for birch and 80 wt% for spruce in both the laboratory and pilot scale. Relative standard deviations for hemicellulose yields were <10% between extractions, so the extraction parameters from the laboratory scale setup can be used in the pilot scale extractions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3aPicea 3abiomass 3agreen chemistry 3ahemicellulose 3asawdust 3astandard deviation 3atemperature1 aHautala, S.

Based on the account of the extended exergy utilization in the sector of urban socio-economic system, which is considered as the composition of extraction (Ex), conversion (Co), agriculture (Ag), industry (In), transportation (Tr), tertiary (Te) and households (Do) sectors, an urban ecological network model is constructed to gain insights into the sustainable urban development process. Taking Beijing city as a model case, the network accounting and related ecological evaluation of a practical urban economy are carried out in this study in the light of flux, utility and structure analysis. The results showed Beijing had made some progress in moving manufacturing economy into service economy during the 10years. The increased output of the domestic sector (labor services) relieves the energy demand being placed on agricultural, industrial, transportation and tertiary sectors. The transportation sector was becoming a controlling factor to fluctuate the other sectors and the cross-regional trade is beginning to overshadow the crucial role of local manufacturing, which is due partly to the restructuring of the Beijing's commodity markets since the 1990s. The major implication of our work is that the exergy-based network analysis can be refined to become an integrative tool for evaluation, policy-making and regulation for ecosystem management concerning structure and efficiency at urban levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccounting 3aecosystem management 3aexergy 3ahouseholds 3alabor 3amanufacturing 3amarkets 3amodels 3atrade 3atransportation 3atrophic relationships 3aurban development 3aChina1 aYang, Z.F.1 aSu, M.R.1 aChen, B.0 tEcological informatics.g2012 July, v. 10 p.2-9dElsevier B.V.x1574-95417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2011.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02459naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014500164300001800309520142800327592002801755650001401783650000901797650002001806650001601826650003101842650000901873650001601882700002001898700002001918773010501938856008102043852000902124655001202133IND60119984620221118013423.0150117e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011998462DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-014-3468-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLatifi, Nima10aAnalysis of strength development in non-traditional liquid additive-stabilized laterite soil from macro- and micro-structural considerations  ap. 1133-1141.  aThe stabilization of soils with additives is a chemically modified method that can be used to improve soils with weak engineering properties. It has been well established that the size, shape, and arrangement of soil particles will affect the treatment process of natural soil with stabilizers. Also, the degree of enhancement is dependent on the morphology of the new formed products that bond the soil particles together. In this paper, unconfined compressive strength (UCS) test was performed as an index of soil improvement on liquid-stabilized (TX-85) mix designs. The time-dependent change in shear properties and compressibility behavior of treated soil was also studied using standard direct shear and consolidation tests. To better understand the structure and surface morphology of treated particles, FESEM, N₂-BET and particle size distribution analysis were performed on soil-stabilizer matrix. From engineering point of view, the UCS results indicated that the degree of improvement for TX-85-stabilized laterite soil was approximately four times greater than the natural soil in a 7-day curing time period. Also, increased compressibility resistance of treated samples with curing time was evident. Based on the results, it was found that the stabilization process modifies the porous network of laterite soil. In addition, new white layers of reaction products were formed on the surface of clay particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aclay 3acompressibility 3aengineering 3aparticle size distribution 3asoil 3astabilizers1 aMarto, Aminaton1 aEisazadeh, Amin0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 Feb., v. 73, no. 3 p.1133-1141dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3468-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008400166520162800250592002801878650002001906650002501926650001101951650002001962650002301982650002402005650002802029650001902057650001702076651001002093651001802103653004302121653002902164653001002193700001502203700002502218700001502243700001802258773010102276856008602377852000902463655001202472IND60754680620221122045116.0211206e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075468062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1083092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Tianyu14aThe spatial spillover effect of transportation networks on ecological footprint  aIn the context of rapid urbanization and regional development worldwide, the efficient and rational spatial distribution of transportation networks is vitally important in achieving sustainable development. In this study, we used an adjusted three-dimensional ecological footprint model (EF₃D) to assess regional sustainable development. We explored the driving factors and spatial influence of transportation networks on the EF₃D in the urban agglomerations in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (UAMRYR), China, in 2010 and 2017, integrating the STIRPAT model and spatialeconometricmodel alongside the transportation network in the research framework. The results show that the EF₃D has been reduced by 1.46% from 2010 to 2017. Although the overall level of sustainable development in UAMRYR has improved, 94.69% of the county units were still in ecological overshoot in 2017. In addition, population density, GDP per capita and the proportion of non-tertiary industries had positive local influences on EF₃D. At the county level, EF₃D had positive spatial autocorrelation, and the spatial spillover effect of EF₃D was confirmed through the transportation network, indicating that the spatial influence of the transportation network was an important factor in explaining EF₃D. Population density and GDP per capita had negative and positive indirect spatial effects, respectively. In the future, the function of transportation systems should be improved to transfer the population pressure of cities and increase natural capital flexibility to reduce the EF and ultimately achieve balanced development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3aecological footprint 3amodels 3anatural capital 3apopulation density 3apopulation pressure 3asustainable development 3atransportation 3aurbanization 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aThree-dimensional ecological footprint 0aSpatial spillover effect 0aUrban1 aZeng, Chen1 aStringer, Lindsay C.1 aYang, Jing1 aWang, Pengrui0 tEcological indicators.g2021 Dec., v. 132 p.108309-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1083093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245013800159300001400297520163300311592002801944650001601972650002301988650002902011650001002040650001302050650000902063650001102072650001502083650001402098650001802112650001202130650001302142650001302155650001402168650001702182650002002199650001102219650002202230650002002252650001202272651001302284653001302297653001102310653001102321653001302332653001002345653001002355653001702365700002602382700001502408773010902423856007902532852000902611655001202620IND60519924320160819000000.0160513e20160430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051992432DNAL7 a10.1515/cerce-2016-00032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarar, H.10aEvaluation of Innovative Cotton Genotypes Against Insect Pest Prevalence, Fiber Trait, Economic Yield and Virus Incidence in Pakistan  ap. 29-39.  aCotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is known as important commodity globally. The experiment was conducted at Cotton Research Station, Multan, Punjab-Pakistan, to evaluate resistance of nine innovative cotton cultivars against insect pest complex were used along with their fiber traits, economic yield and virus incidence. Population of jassid, whitefly and thrips was recorded by using leaf turn method, bollworms by counting whole fruiting parts (buds, flowers and bolls), virus by counting healthy and virus effected plants per plot, yield of seed cotton was determined by hand harvesting method, while qualitative fiber properties were measured through HVI spectrum-1 (high volume instrumentation) method. Cotton genotype NIAB-Bt-2 is resistant to jassid, whitefly and thrips with maximum GOT, staple length. In case of bollworms, all genotypes are resistant to spotted and american bollworm, except FH-142 and MNH-988. No genotype is resistant to pink bollworm in leftover bolls. Best yield performance was recorded on FH-142 (2041.54 kg/ha) with minimum CLCuV incidence. Further our research should recognize the share of one pest species on the yield and fiber quality of cotton by managing other pest species to define better management strategies. Our studies concluded that the genotype NIAB-Bt-2 has less insect attack i.e., sucking pest as well as bollworms, virus and other fiber characteristics like GOT, staple length as compared with other cotton genotypes should be recommended for general cultivation and being a resistant germplasm it should be included in breeding program for the development of new cotton strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAleyrodidae 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aPectinophora gossypiella 3abolls 3abreeding 3abuds 3acotton 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3afiber quality 3aflowers 3afruiting 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3ainsect pests 3ainstrumentation 3aleaves 3amanual harvesting 3astaple (fibers) 3aviruses 3aPakistan 0aWhitefly 0aJassid 0aThrips 0aBollworm 0aYield 0aCLCuV 0aFiber traits1 aMoshtaghzadeh, Majid,1 aAhamad, S.0 tCercetări agronomice în Moldova.g2016 Apr. 30, v. 49, no. 1 p.29-39dDe Gruyter Openx2067-18657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/cerce-2016-00033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012900170300001100299520140100310592002801711650001501739650001501754650002501769650002201794650001301816650001301829650002001842650002401862650001301886650001101899650000701910650003301917650002101950650002301971650001601994700001902010700001802029773012602047856008102173852000902254655001202263IND60634481220221120165610.0190420e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063448122DNAL7 a10.1007/s13201-019-0930-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondal, Naba Kumar10aDecontamination and optimization study of hexavalent chromium on modified chicken feather using response surface methodology  ap. 50.  aPresent research highlighted the efficacy of alkali-treated (1% NaOH) chicken feather toward removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solution through batch study. Box–Behnken design (BBD) by response surface methodology was used to optimize the adsorption process. Kinetics and sorption isotherms have been determined considering the effect of initial metal concentration, adsorbent dose, contract time, and temperature. Batch sorbent data were fitted to various sorption models, and results indicate that Cr(VI) sorption process using alkali-treated chicken feathers followed the pseudo-second-order rate model, while sorption isotherms were described properly by both Langmuir (R²: 0.997) and Freundlich isotherms (R²: 0.979). Based on BBD design, the quadratic models were developed co-relating the adsorption variables to removal efficiency. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was incorporated to judge the adequacy of model (F:3484.72). Model predicted optimized conditions are initial concentration 5.64 mg/L, adsorption dose 0.15 g, contract time 29.60 min, pH 1.06 gave 88.9% removal efficiency. Sorption isotherms show that the experimental maximum sorption capacity of Cr(VI) was found to be 90.91 mg/g at 40 °C and pH 2. Therefore, present results demonstrate that alkali-treated chicken features should be regarded as a low-cost alternative for the removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aanalysis of variance 3aaqueous solutions 3achickens 3achromium 3adecontamination 3aexperimental design 3afeathers 3amodels 3apH 3aresponse surface methodology 3asodium hydroxide 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature1 aBasu, Sambrita1 aDas, Biswajit0 tApplied water science.g2019 Apr., v. 9, no. 3 p.50-50dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22883x2190-54877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-019-0930-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02182naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245009000165300001300255520099000268592002801258650001201286650001801298650001401316650001301330650001401343650001501357650002601372650002001398650001601418651001001434653002001444653001901464653001801483653002401501653002201525700001901547700001901566773008801585856007801673852000901751655001201760IND60128222320221118132701.0151115e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012822232DNAL7 a10.3105/018.030.01082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamamoto, Tomonori14aThe Age Structure of a Breeding Population of Hynobius lichenatus (Amphibia, Caudata)  ap. 7-14.  aUsing the lines of arrested growth (LAGs), we estimated the age structure of a breeding population and individual ages at sexual maturity of a salamander, Hynobius lichenatus, from Sendai, northeastern Japan. No significant sexual differences were detected in either the age structure or the age at maturity, and the breeding individuals ranged from 5 to 14 yrs old, while the age of their maturation ranged from 3 to 7 yrs old. Reasons for this difference in minimal ages remain to be studied. There was no significant correlation between the age and the body size of the salamanders. Hynobius lichenatus does not differ from its close relative H. tokyoensis from Tokyo in age structure, but mature significantly later, with a longer life, than H. tokyoensis from Chiba. These findings suggest that the age structure of these salamander populations is affected at most partially by temperature conditions, and more strongly by other environmental, ecological, or phylogenetic factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaudata 3aage structure 3abody size 3abreeding 3aphylogeny 3apopulation 3asalamanders and newts 3asexual maturity 3atemperature 3aJapan 0aAge at maturity 0aAge estimation 0aAge structure 0aHynobius lichenatus 0aSkeletochronology1 aŌta, Hiroshi,1 aChiba, Satoshi0 tCurrent herpetology.g2011 June, v. 30, no. 1 p.7-14dUniBio Pressx1881-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3105%2F018.030.01083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03361naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245009200208300001800300500001900318520176600337592002802103650001402131650001302145650001402158650002002172650002102192650001402213650002602227650002202253650001202275650001302287653001702300653002702317653002702344653002502371653001002396653000802406653001202414653001002426653000802436653000802444653000702452700002502459700002302484700005902507700002102566700002402587773011302611856008602724852000902810655001202819IND60714943720221119232657.0201104e20201110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071494372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.10.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhai, Yusheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0016-877310aRural, urban, and suburban differences in influenza vaccination coverage among children  ap. 7596-7602.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aInfluenza vaccination is the primary way to prevent influenza, yet influenza vaccination coverage remains low in the United States.

Influenza vaccination coverage among children 6 months–17 years by rural/urban residence during the 2011–12 through 2018–19 influenza seasons was examined using National Immunization Survey-Flu data. The Council of American Survey Research Organizations response rates for National Immunization Survey-Flu ranged from 48% to 65% (2011–12 through the 2017–18 seasons) for the landline sample and 20%–39% (2011–12 through the 2018–19 seasons) for the cellular telephone sample. Children residing in rural areas had influenza vaccination coverage that ranged from 7.9 (2012–13 season) to 12.6 (2016–17 season) percentage points lower than children residing in urban areas, and ranged from 4.5 (2012–13 season) to 7.4 (2016–17 season) percentage points lower than children residing in suburban areas. The differences in influenza vaccination coverage among rural, suburban, and urban children were consistent over the eight seasons studied. Lower influenza vaccination coverage was observed among rural children regardless of child’s age, mother’s education, household income, or number of children under 18 years of age in the household. Rural versus urban and suburban differences in influenza vaccination coverage remained statistically significant while adjusting for selected sociodemographic characteristics. A better understanding of the reasons for lower childhood influenza vaccination coverage for children in rural and suburban areas is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildhood 3achildren 3aeducation 3ahealth services 3ahousehold income 3ainfluenza 3ainfluenza vaccination 3amobile telephones 3asurveys 3avaccines 0aRural health 0aHealthcare disparities 0aInfluenza vaccinations 0aVaccination coverage 0aChild 0aCDC 0aNIS-Flu 0aCASRO 0aMSA 0aOMB 0aCI1 aSantibanez, Tammy A.1 aKahn, Katherine E.1 aSrivastav, Anup1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9970-08721 aWalker, Tanja Y.1 aSingleton, James A.0 tVaccine.g2020 Nov. 10, v. 38, no. 48 p.7596-7602dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.10.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02082naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011300158300001800271520088700289592002801176650002201204650001401226650001401240650002301254650001401277650001201291650002001303650001301323650001301336650001601349650001601365650002401381700001301405700001201418700001801430700001701448773012401465856007401589852000901663655001201672IND60662752420221120193303.0190906e20140526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066275242DNAL7 a10.1039/c4gc00276h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Dongling10aKinetics of DBU-catalyzed transesterification for biodiesel in the DBU–ethanol switchable-polarity solvent  ap. 3218-3223.  aThe production of biodiesel from soybean oil and ethanol was investigated in switchable-polarity solvent (SPS) media of DBU and ethanol. The highest biodiesel yield catalyzed by DBU could reach 97.9% under optimized conditions, i.e. ethanol–oil molar ratio: 12 : 1, DBU–oil molar ratio: 2 : 1, reaction temperature: 70 °C, reaction time: 2 h. According to the kinetic analysis, the reaction order of oil was estimated to be 0.7, the apparent activation energy was 16.763 kJ mol⁻¹, the pre-exponential factor was 561.31 mol⁰.³ mL⁻⁰.³ min⁻¹ using the Arrhenius equation for the first time, which explains the high efficiency of the DBU catalyst. The DBU-catalyzed transesterification in the DBU–ethanol switchable-polarity solvent offered an interesting alternative, which would be used to simplify the transesterification and separation to a single step.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3abiodiesel 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aequations 3aethanol 3agreen chemistry 3akinetics 3asolvents 3asoybean oil 3atemperature 3atransesterification1 aMu, Ying1 aMao, Yu1 aYang, Tiankui1 aXiu, Zhilong0 tGreen chemistry.g2014 May 26, v. 16, no. 6 p.3218-3223dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4gc00276h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245012700159300001400286520158400300592002801884650002201912650002101934650001401955650001301969650001001982650002601992650001102018650001502029650001102044650001902055650001802074650001502092650001902107650001602126653001602142653001502158653001502173653002502188700001702213773010902230856007902339852000902418655001202427IND60519924420160819000000.0160513e20160430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051992442DNAL7 a10.1515/cerce-2016-00042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKizil, S.10aEffects of Sowing Date on Some Agronomic Characteristics and Alkaloid Content of Datura Stramonium in Semi-Arid Conditions  ap. 41-50.  aAlkaloids of diferent plant, including many Solanaceae species, constitute important natural sources for variety of pharmaceutical products. The amounts of various secondary plant products are strongly dependent on the growing conditions and agronomical applications such as planting date, fertilization, irrigation etc. The aim of this was to study the effects of sowing date on some agronomic characteristics and total alkaloid content of thorn apple (Datura stramonium), investigated in the environmental conditions from Dicle University, Agricultural Faculty, Field Crops Department experimental area, during 2010 and 2011 growing years. In the research, plant height, stem diameter, number of branches per plant, number of capsule per plant, capsule width, capsule length, 1000-seed weight, fresh herb yield, herba yield, seed yield and total alkaloid content were examined. At the end of the study, in the trial of thorn apple with sowing dates, according to two years mean, seed yield, fresh herb yield, dry herb yield and total alkaloid yield were changed between 335 kg ha⁻¹ and 704 kg ha⁻¹, 5933 and 20537 kg ha⁻¹, 1613 kg ha⁻¹ and 4800 kg ha⁻¹, and 0.270% and 0.391%, respectively. The effect of sowing date was found significant on the investigated characteristics, when sowing delayed, agronomic characteristics were also decreased. The highest values related with seed yield, fresh and dry herbage of thorn apple were obtained sowing of 01 Apr. Moreover, thorn apple plant showed morphogenetic variation when compared leaf and seed alkaloid contents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDatura stramonium 3aagronomic traits 3aalkaloids 3abranches 3adrugs 3aenvironmental factors 3aforage 3airrigation 3aleaves 3aplant products 3aplanting date 3aseed yield 3asemiarid zones 3asowing date 0aThorn apple 0aSeed yield 0aHerb yield 0aSecondary metabolite1 aTonçer, Ö.0 tCercetări agronomice în Moldova.g2016 Apr. 30, v. 49, no. 1 p.41-50dDe Gruyter Openx2067-18657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/cerce-2016-00043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245013700174300001800311520143900329592002801768650001901796650001801815650002101833650001701854650001001871650002001881650001701901650001901918650001501937650001301952650001501965650002101980650001302001650001202014650001702026650001002043650002102053700002102074700001702095700002202112700001902134700001902153700001802172700002202190700002602212773008602238856009002324852000902414655001202423IND60090506720221121013511.0141102e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009050672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.01.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Keren10aPoly(ethylene glycol)–paclitaxel–alendronate self-assembled micelles for the targeted treatment of breast cancer bone metastases  ap. 3795-3806.  aPaclitaxel (PTX) and alendronate (ALN) are effective drugs used for the treatment of breast cancer bone metastases. Growing evidence suggests that low-dose taxanes and bisphosphonates possess anti-angiogenic properties. However, PTX is water-insoluble and toxic, even if administered at anti-angiogenic dosing schedule. Polymer conjugation of PTX will increase water-solubility and improve its pharmacokinetic profile directing it to the tumor site. We further propose to combine it with ALN for active bone targeting. We conjugated ALN and PTX with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) forming self-assembled micelles where PTX molecules are located at the inner core and the water-soluble ALN molecules at the outer shell. PTX–PEG–ALN micelles exhibited similar in vitro cytotoxic and anti-angiogenic activity as the free drugs. Biodistribution analysis demonstrated preferential tumor accumulation of FITC-labeled PTX–PEG–ALN micelles. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed longer t₁/₂ of the conjugate than free PTX. PTX–PEG–ALN micelles achieved improved efficacy and safety profiles over free PTX in syngeneic and xenogeneic mouse models of mCherry-infected mammary adenocarcinoma in the tibia, as monitored intravitally non-invasively by a fluorescence imaging system. The described data warrants the potential use of PTX–PEG–ALN as bone-targeted anticancer and anti-angiogenic therapy for breast cancer bone metastases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenocarcinoma 3aanimal models 3abreast neoplasms 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3aethylene glycol 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3ametastasis 3amicelles 3apaclitaxel 3apharmacokinetics 3apolymers 3ataxanes 3atherapeutics 3atibia 3awater solubility1 aClementi, Chiara1 aPolyak, Dina1 aEldar-Boock, Anat1 aBenayoun, Liat1 aBarshack, Iris1 aShaked, Yuval1 aPasut, Gianfranco1 aSatchi-Fainaro, Ronit0 tBiomaterials.g2013 May, v. 34, no. 15 p.3795-3806dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.01.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011600168520120400284592002801488650003601516650001901552650001801571650001701589650001901606650001501625650001601640650001301656650001601669650001601685650001201701650001401713650001101727650002101738650001001759653001401769653001601783653001501799653002001814653002501834700002201859700002201881700002301903700002301926700002501949700002101974700002301995773010002018856008702118852000902205655001202214IND60735715320221118182627.0210813e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073571532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1299552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReale, Anna10aBacteria do it better! Proteomics suggests the molecular basis for improved digestibility of sourdough products  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the dynamics of proteolysis during dough fermentation started with different lactic acid bacteria species, through the identification of intermediate and small-sized peptides generated during fermentation. Single-strain cultures of Levilactobacillus brevis, Fructilactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Companilactobacillus alimentarius, and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides were assayed as sourdough starters. Assays were carried out at lab-scale for 48 h of fermentation, using both unstarted and yeast-leavened dough as controls. Physicochemical and microbiological analyses were combined with peptidomic and proteomic profiling, identifying several hundreds of peptides mainly released from the water-soluble wheat proteins, including β-amylase, triticin, and serpins. Both α- and γ-gliadins were hydrolyzed, though only at the N-terminal domain, while the central protein region – encrypting celiac disease epitopes– remained unaffected. The bacterial-mediated consumption of sugars and the concomitant hydrolysis of starch degrading β-amylase could underlie improved digestibility and several nutritionally beneficial effects of sourdough baked products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeuconostoc pseudomesenteroides 3aceliac disease 3adigestibility 3afermentation 3afood chemistry 3ahydrolysis 3alactic acid 3apeptides 3apeptidomics 3aproteolysis 3aserpins 3asourdough 3astarch 3awater solubility 3awheat 0aSourdough 0aProteolysis 0aβ-amylase 0aGluten proteins 0aLactic acid bacteria1 aDi Stasio, Luigia1 aDi Renzo, Tiziana1 aDe Caro, Salvatore1 aFerranti, Pasquale1 aPicariello, Gianluca1 aAddeo, Francesco1 aMamone, Gianfranco0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 359 p.129955-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1299553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002600169245007500195300001600270520180400286592002802090653003202118653002302150653003102173653003102204653001702235653001402252700002202266773009902288856011702387852000902504655001202513IND60131221520221117002344.0151127e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013122152DNAL7 a10.1672/0277-5212(2005)025[0551:MPRADA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinkelstein, Sarah A.10aModern pollen rain and diatom assemblages in a lake erie coastal marsh  ap. 551-563.  aWe present an analysis of modern pollen and diatom assemblages in surficial sediments in a coastal marsh at Rondeau Provincial Park, on the northern shore of Lake Erie in southwestern Ontario, Canada. The objectives of the study were (1) to determine how pollen and diatom assemblages in surface sediments vary as a function of the dominant vegetation community and moisture availability at the sampling site and (2) to analyze pollen-vegetation relationships of four dominant wetland plants: Cephalanthus occidentalis, Phragmites australis, Typha spp., and Zizania aquatica, in order to improve interpretations of fossil sequences. Canonical variate analysis (CVA) was used to compare pollen and diatom spectra from sampling sites in three marsh zones delineated on the basis of moisture availability. Using the pollen or the diatom datasets, the resulting discriminant functions correctly classified 86%% of the wettest sites, 72%% of those with intermediate moisture availability, and only 25%% of the sites in the driest parts of the wetland. Since 35%% of the sampling sites were misclassified by the CVA on the basis of pollen assemblages, a representation factor approach is needed to complement the comparative approach when analyzing pollen datasets from wetland contexts. Percent cover vegetation data at sediment sampling sites are used to illustrate pollen-vegetation relationships for the ecologically important wetland plants at the site. Phragmites australis and Typha spp. produce small amounts of pollen relative to their abundance, while Cephalanthus occidentalis and Zizania aquatica produce abundant pollen, which is deposited highly locally in the case of Cephalanthus. These data will enable improved interpretations of fossil pollen and diatom sequences from wetland contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 0afreshwater coastal wetlands 0amodern pollen rain 0awetland diatom assemblages 0acanonical variate analysis 0apaleoecology 0aLake Erie1 aDavis, Anthony M.0 tWetlands.g2005 Sept., v. 25, no. 3 p.551-563dSociety of Wetlands Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F0277-5212%282005%29025%5B0551%3AMPRADA%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245017600161300001800337520188100355592002802236650001502264650001702279650001202296650001602308650002102324650001102345650002102356650001602377650001202393651001002405700001402415700001602429700001702445773010502462856008102567852000902648655001202657IND60119984820221118013455.0150117e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011998482DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-014-3470-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Dong10aComplexity measure of regional groundwater resources system based on wavelet entropy: a case study of Jiansanjiang Administration of Heilongjiang land reclamation in China  ap. 1033-1043.  aThe present scholars in the study of the evolution of a regional groundwater resource system tend to ignore the complexity of the system itself, making it difficult to truly realize the scientific management of groundwater resources. Thus, the quantization characteristics of the complexity of the regional groundwater resource system have become a hot issue concerned in the field of hydrology. In this paper, taking Jiansanjiang Administration of Agricultural Reclamation, Heilongjiang, China for example, a wavelet entropy method is used for diagnosing each of its monthly groundwater depth sequence complexity to determine the order of the complexity, thus calculating the averaged wavelet entropy of the monthly groundwater depth sequence for each zone and revealing the local monthly groundwater depth sequence complexity has an obvious regional characteristic gradually decreased from north to south. Through comparative analysis of three kinds of complexity measure algorithms, including wavelet entropy, multi-scale semi-square difference dimension, and sample entropy, we find that the diagnostic result of the complexity of the wavelet entropy algorithm has sufficient visibility and high operational efficiency, so that it is an effective way to measure the hydrological sequence complexity. The results of the analysis of the cause of the local monthly groundwater depth sequence complexity show that: changes in precipitation and agricultural production activities are the critical driving factors for the dynamic changes in the local groundwater depth sequence.

Monjurul10aEmpirical Investigation of Barriers and Driving Forces for Efficient Energy Management Practices in Non-Energy-Intensive Manufacturing Industries of Bangladesh  aImproved energy efficiency is being considered as one of the significant challenges to mitigating climate change all over the world. While developed countries have already adopted energy management and auditing practices to improve energy efficiency, the developing countries lag far behind. There are a limited number of studies which have been conducted in the context of developing countries, which mostly revolve around highly energy-intensive sectors. This study looks into the existence and importance of the challenges to and motivating forces for the adoption of energy management practices in Bangladesh, a developing country, focusing on the non-energy-intensive manufacturing industries. Conducted as a multiple case study, the results indicate the existence of several barriers towards adopting and implementing the management of energy practices in the non-energy-intensive industries of Bangladesh, where among them, &ldquo;other preferences for capital venture&rdquo; and &ldquo;inadequate capital expenditure&rdquo; are the most dominant. This study also identified a number of driving forces that can accelerate the acceptance of energy efficiency practices, such as the demands from the owner, loans, subsidies, and a lowered cost&ndash;benefit ratio. Findings of this study could assist the concerned stakeholders to develop beneficial policies and a proper regulatory framework for the non-energy-intensive industries of developing countries like Bangladesh.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3aenergy efficiency 3aissues and policy 3aloans 3astakeholders 3asubsidies 3asustainable manufacturing 3aBangladesh1 aHossain, Rakib 1 aTuhin, Rashedul  Amin1 aSakib, Taiyeb  Hasan1 aThollander, Patrik 0 tSustainability.g2019 May 10, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110926713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013100154300001800285520131400303592002801617650001501645650001401660650002301674650002001697650002001717650001501737650001801752650004401770650001901814650001401833650001601847700001801863700001801881700002001899773012401919856007402043852000902117655001202126IND60662752520221120193320.0190906e20140526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066275252DNAL7 a10.1039/c4gc00279b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Jian10a1,3-Dimethylimidazolium-2-carboxylate: a zwitterionic salt for the efficient synthesis of vicinal diols from cyclic carbonates  ap. 3297-3304.  aThe development of efficient, cheap and recyclable catalysts for reactions under mild reaction conditions is a very attractive topic in green chemistry. Herein, a series of basic ionic liquids (ILs) were investigated as catalysts for the synthesis of vicinal diols via the hydrolysis of cyclic carbonates in order to improve this kind of synthetic process. The effects of the IL structure, the molar ratio of cyclic carbonate to water, and various reaction parameters on the catalytic performance were investigated in detail. It was found that 1,3-dimethylimidazolium-2-carboxylate, a simple halogen-free zwitterionic catalyst, showed high activity (a space-time yield of 1086 h⁻¹) and excellent selectivity for the preparation of ethylene glycol via the hydrolysis of ethylene carbonate. The catalyst could be reused over six times without obvious loss of catalytic activity. Also, it was applicable to a variety of cyclic carbonates for the production of their corresponding vicinal diols with high yields and selectivities. A possible catalytic cycle for this kind of catalytic process was proposed based on the experimental results, NMR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. This reaction protocol opens a new possibility for chemical synthesis as a substitution for traditional base or basic ILs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbonates 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aethylene glycol 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrolysis 3aionic liquids 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aspace and time 3asynthesis 3azwitterions1 aYao, Xiaoqian1 aCheng, Weiguo1 aZhang, Suojiang0 tGreen chemistry.g2014 May 26, v. 16, no. 6 p.3297-3304dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4gc00279b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245013900187300001800326520157700344592002801921650002501949650002301974650002401997650002502021650001102046650002702057650001602084650001802100650001002118650002002128650002602148650001302174653001302187653001402200653002402214653001702238653001202255653001602267700002402283700001902307700001802326700001402344700001702358773008402375856008402459852000902543655001202552IND60088318820221120072502.0160901e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008831882DNAL7 a232869902pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2012.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedescoll, A.10aDesign configurations affecting flow pattern and solids accumulation in horizontal free water and subsurface flow constructed wetlands  ap. 1448-1458.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different horizontal constructed wetland (CW) design parameters on solids distribution, loss of hydraulic conductivity over time and hydraulic behaviour, in order to assess clogging processes in wetlands. For this purpose, an experimental plant with eight CWs was built at mesocosm scale. Each CW presented a different design characteristic, and the most common CW configurations were all represented: free water surface flow (FWS) with different effluent pipe locations, FWS with floating macrophytes and subsurface flow (SSF), and the presence of plants and specific species (Typha angustifolia and Phragmites australis) was also considered. The loss of the hydraulic conductivity of gravel was greatly influenced by the presence of plants and organic load (representing a loss of 20% and c.a. 10% in planted wetlands and an overloaded system, respectively). Cattail seems to have a greater effect on the development of clogging since its below-ground biomass weighed twice as much as that of common reed. Hydraulic behaviour was greatly influenced by the presence of a gravel matrix and the outlet pipe position. In strict SSF CW, the water was forced to cross the gravel and tended to flow diagonally from the top inlet to the bottom outlet (where the inlet and outlet pipes were located). However, when FWS was considered, water preferentially flowed above the gravel, thus losing half the effective volume of the system. Only the presence of plants seemed to help the water flow partially within the gravel matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhragmites australis 3aTypha angustifolia 3abelowground biomass 3aconstructed wetlands 3agravel 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amacrophytes 3aoverland flow 3apipes 3asubsurface flow 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 2aWetlands 0aClogging 0aFlow path 0aSolids distribution 0aPermeability 0aCattail 0aCommon reed1 aSidrach-Cardona, R.1 aSánchez, J.C.1 aCarretero, J.1 aGarfi, M.1 aBécares, E.0 tWater research.g2013 Mar. 01, v. 47 p.1448-1458dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2012.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03846naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245013300163300001400296520234000310592002802650650001702678650001602695650002302711650001302734650001902747650001302766650001902779650001602798650001802814650001902832650002102851650001302872650002502885650001502910650001002925650002802935650002102963651000902984653001702993653001603010653001803026653001603044653001303060700001503073700001603088700001503104773010903119856007903228852000903307655001203316IND60519924520160819000000.0160513e20160430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051992452DNAL7 a10.1515/cerce-2016-00052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdollahi, F.10aEffect of Different Nitrogen Sources on Vegetative Traits, Grain Yield and Essential Oil Yield of Coriander (Coriandrum sativum)  ap. 51-65.  aCoriander (Coriandrum sativum) is one of the medicinal plants that its essential oil yield has abundance medicinal and food value. One of the main concepts in the production of medicinal plants is to increase of yield by biofertilizers. In order to evaluate the separate and combined effect of nitrogen and biofertilizer Nitroxin (mixture of bacteria Azotobacter and Azospirillum) fertilizer on vegetative traits, grain yield and essential oil yield of coriander, an experiment was conducted as a factorial in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications in the field research of Islamic Azad University, Jiroft, Iran. The experiment factors were consisted of three levels of nitrogen (0, 75 and 150 kg·ha⁻¹) and three levels of Nitroxin biofertilizer (0, 2 and 4 L·ha⁻¹). The results showed that application of 150 kg·ha⁻¹ N significantly increased height and stem diameter, number of lateral branches and shoot dry weight, compared with control and application of 75 kg·ha⁻¹ N. Nitroxin biofertilizer significantly improved vegetative traits of coriander when compared with control, so that application of 4 L·ha⁻¹ of Nitroxin caused increase the mean of traits compared to control. In the most evaluated growth traits, the highest means were obtained with combining of 150 kg·ha⁻¹ N with 4 L·ha⁻¹ of Nitroxin. Application of 150 kg·ha⁻¹ N increased the number of umbels per plant, 1000 seeds weigh, seed yield and essential oil yield, 29.9, 33.0, 72.9, 40.7, 147.4 and 177.1 percent, compared with the control, respectively. In the presence of Nitroxin, yield and yield component and essential oil yield of coriander increased significantly. Maximum average of these traits obtained when 4 L·ha⁻¹ of Nitroxin was applied. Integrated of nitrogen and Nitroxin increased yield and yield component and essential oil yield significantly, when compare with application separately of them. So that the maximum mean of these traits obtained with combined application of 150 kg·ha⁻¹ nitrogen and 4 L·ha⁻¹ of Nitroxin. The results of this research was showed that application Nitroxin biofertilizer have an important role in increase of quantity and quality yield of coriander medicinal plant and can be used as an alternative of nitrogen fertilizer in sustainable agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzospirillum 3aAzotobacter 3aCoriandrum sativum 3abacteria 3abiofertilizers 3abranches 3aessential oils 3agrain yield 3agrowth traits 3ainflorescences 3amedicinal plants 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aseed yield 3aseeds 3asustainable agriculture 3ayield components 3aIran 0aAzospirillum 0aAzotobacter 0aEssential oil 0aGrain yield 0aNitrogen1 aSalehi, A.1 aShahabi, R.1 aRahimi, A.0 tCercetări agronomice în Moldova.g2016 Apr. 30, v. 49, no. 1 p.51-65dDe Gruyter Openx2067-18657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/cerce-2016-00053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005900149245010900208300001600317520103900333592002801372650001601400650002701416650001301443650002801456650002501484650002501509650002201534650002701556650002801583650001101611650001601622650001901638650001801657650001401675653002801689653002101717653002401738653003201762653002401794700001801818700001901836700001801855773023601873856008402109852000902193655001202202IND60543635320221118052550.0190411e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054363532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2014.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Tae Young1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6841-725410aSimple and rapid screening of entomopathogenic fungi having radical-scavenging and anticancer activities  ap. 543-547.  aEntomopathogenic fungal metabolites exhibit a wide variety of insecticidal, antimicrobial, anticancer, antioxidant, and antiviral activities, and they have been suggested as potential candidates for the development of new bioactive agents. The rapid and simple screening of entomopathogenic fungi with such bioactivities is important for investigating bioactive substances. The radical-scavenging and anticancer activities of 28 species and 20 genera of 342 isolates of entomopathogenic fungi were evaluated using only culture filtrates. As a result, 23 isolates of Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae, 1 isolate of Pochonia sp., and 1 isolate of Aspergillus sp. showed high radical-scavenging activity. Additionally, anticancer activity in HCT116 human colon cancer cells was also confirmed for selected culture filtrates. This simple screening method of entomopathogenic fungi using culture filtrates may be useful for the rapid detection of related substances with pharmacological activity from a large number of fungal samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3aPochonia 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantiviral properties 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aculture filtrates 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3afree radical scavengers 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3aneoplasm cells 3arapid methods 3ascreening 0aEntomopathogenic fungus 0aCulture filtrate 0aBioactive substance 0aRadical-scavenging activity 0aAnticancer activity1 aBae, Sung Min1 aChoi, Jae Bang1 aWoo, Soo Dong0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2014 Sept., v. 17, no. 3 p.543-547dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied Entomology, Taiwan Entomological Society and Malaysian Plant Protection Society.wJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2014.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03499naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072000900159072000900168072000900177072000900186100001700195245016500212300001400377500002400391500001500415520166600430650002602096650001902122650001702141650001302158650002602171650002102197650001002218650001602228650002002244650001502264650001402279650001902293650001202312650004302324650003502367650002802402650001002430650002302440653002102463653001602484653001502500653001802515653002202533700001502555700002202570773012102592852000902713856008002722930003302802945002502835946001302860655001202873IND4420107020221119001716.0090508e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442010702DNAL7 a192536212pmid7 a10.1603/029.102.01122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF851 0aK510 0aF821 0aK0011 aPawson, S.M.10aUsing Differential Responses to Light Spectra As a Monitoring and Control Tool for Arhopalus ferus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) and Other Exotic Wood-Boring Pests  ap. 79-85.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSeveral longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) and bark beetles (Scolytinae) have been accidentally introduced to New Zealand and are now widespread and abundant. In particular Arhopalus ferus (Mulsant) represents a significant quarantine risk for export timber. Because of this risk timber is fumigated with methyl bromide. Six different light traps baited with different colors (yellow, red, green, white, UV-black light [UV-BL], and UV-black-light-blue [UV-BLB]) were investigated for their population monitoring potential and as a push-pull (incorporating mass trapping) alternative control technique. UV-BLB light traps captured an order of magnitude more A. ferus (122 individuals per night) than yellow light traps (eight individuals per night). The bark beetles Hylurgus ligniperda (F.) and Hylastes ater (Paykull) were most attracted to UV-BL lights that captured 2-4 times more beetles than traps baited with other wavelengths. Results suggest that light traps provide a sensitive method for population monitoring. The responses of these wood borers and bark beetles to different colored light traps provide an opportunity to apply a push-pull control technique. The management of these species could be improved by minimizing the visual attractiveness (push) of wood processing facilities through a conversion to low intensity yellow site lighting, combined with the strategic placement of UV light traps for mass-trapping of residual populations (pull). Light management on its own is unlikely to eliminate the quarantine risk entirely; however, it is likely to reduce populations substantially and contribute toward the aim of reducing methyl bromide use. 3aultraviolet radiation 3aboring insects 3abark beetles 3atrapping 3aequipment performance 3ablacklight traps 3acolor 3awavelengths 3apest monitoring 3aquarantine 3aArhopalus 3ainsect control 2aAnimals 2aAppetitive Behaviorxradiation effects 2aColeopteraxradiation effects. 2aInsect Controlxmethods 2aLight 2aWoodxparasitology 0aquarantine pests 0alight traps 0atrap color 0amass trapping 0apush-pull control1 aWatt, M.S.1 aBrockerhoff, E.G.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2009 Feb., v. 102, no. 1 p.79-85dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/029.102.01123Available from publisher's Web site  a20090615b20090703c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/06/15  aOther US 7aarticle02329naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245013400174300001800308520120800326592002801534650001801562650001001580650001301590650001501603650002101618650001501639650001701654700001501671700001401686700002001700700001901720700001901739700001201758773008601770856009001856852000901946655001201955IND60090506920221120041340.0141102e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009050692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.02.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Fu-Bing10aRecognition and capture of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma cells using aptamer-conjugated quantum dots and magnetic particles  ap. 3816-3827.  aMetastatic recurrence is the most important biological behavior of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the main cause of treatment failure. Early prediction of metastasis is currently impossible due to the lack of specific molecular probes to recognize metastatic HCC cells. Aptamers have recently emerged as promising potential molecular probes for biomedical applications. Two well-matched HCC cell lines including HCCLM9 with high metastatic potential and MHCC97-L with low metastatic potential, were used to select aptamers for HCC metastasis. With a whole-cell-SELEX strategy, in which HCCLM9 cells were used as target cells and MHCC97-L cells as subtractive cell, 6 potential aptamers had been generated. Detailed study on selected aptamer LY-1 revealed that it could bind metastatic HCC cells with high affinity and specificity, not only in cells culture and animal models of HCC metastasis, but also in clinical HCC specimens. Moreover, the aptamer LY-1 and magnetic particles conjugates could efficiently capture the HCC cells from complex mixture whole blood. These studies demonstrated that this HCC specific aptamer LY-1 could be a promising molecular probe to recognize metastatic HCC cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3ablood 3ahepatoma 3ametastasis 3aoligonucleotides 3aprediction 3aquantum dots1 aRong, Yuan1 aFang, Min1 aYuan, Jing-Ping1 aPeng, Chun-Wei1 aLiu, Shao-Ping1 aLi, Yan0 tBiomaterials.g2013 May, v. 34, no. 15 p.3816-3827dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.02.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002000169245011700189300001600306520181300322592002802135653002302163653001902186653002402205653001502229653002902244653002802273653002602301653001902327653001302346653002302359653001502382653001302397700002602410700002302436700002002459773009902479856011702578852000902695655001202704IND60131221820221117003144.0151127e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013122182DNAL7 a10.1672/0277-5212(2005)025[0594:FAAOSP]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraham, Sean A.10aForms and accumulation of soil p in natural and recently restored peatlands——upper klamath lake, oregon, usa  ap. 594-606.  aForms, amounts, and accumulation of soil phosphorus (P) were measured in natural and recently restored marshes surrounding Upper Klamath Lake located in south-central Oregon, USA to determine rates of P accumulation in natural marshes and to assess changes in P pools caused by long-term drainage in recently restored marshes. Soil cores were collected from three natural marshes and radiometrically dated to determine recent (¹³⁷Cs-based) and long-term (²¹⁰Pb-based) rates of peat accretion and P accumulation. A second set of soil cores collected from the three natural marshes and from three recently restored marshes was analyzed using a modification of the Hedley procedure to determine the forms and amounts of soil P. Total P in the recently restored marshes (222 to 311 μμg cm⁻⁻³) was 2––3 times greater than in the natural marshes (103 to 117 μμg cm⁻⁻³), primarily due to greater bulk density caused by soil subsidence, a consequence of long-term marsh drainage. Occluded Fe- and Al-bound Pᵢ, calcium-bound Pᵢ and residual P were 4 times, 22 times, and 5 times greater, respectively, in the recently restored marshes. More than 67%% of the P pool in both the natural and recently restored marshes was present in recalcitrant forms (humic-acid Pₒ and residual P) that provide long-term P storage in peat. Phosphorus accumulation in the natural marshes averaged 0.45 g m⁻⁻² yr⁻⁻¹ (¹³⁷Cs) and 0.40 g m⁻⁻² yr⁻⁻¹ (²¹⁰Pb), providing a benchmark for optimizing P sequestration in the recently restored marshes. Effective P sequestration in the recently restored marshes, however, will depend on re-establishing equilibrium between the P-enriched soils and the P concentration of floodwaters and a hydrologic regime similar to the natural marshes.  aPublisher supplied data 0aUpper Klamath Lake 0aeutrophication 0awetland restoration 0aphosphorus 0aphosphorus fractionation 0aphosphorus accumulation 0anutrient accumulation 0apeat accretion 0apeatland 0aradiometric dating 0aCesium-137 0aLead-2101 aCraft, Christopher B.1 aMcCormick, Paul V.1 aAldous, Allison0 tWetlands.g2005 Sept., v. 25, no. 3 p.594-606dSociety of Wetlands Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F0277-5212%282005%29025%5B0594%3AFAAOSP%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03847naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245010800165520269700273592002802970650001602998650001403014650001803028650001103046650001103057650002803068650001303096650001403109650001103123650001403134650001303148650001003161700001603171700001803187700001703205700001703222773012103239856008003360852000903440655001203449IND60763397620221122051926.0220120e20220113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076339762DNAL7 a10.3390/biology110101272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qiaolin 10aEffect of Displacement Degree of Distal Chevron Osteotomy on Metatarsal Stress: A Finite Element Method  aBackground: The stress of foot bone can effectively evaluate the functional damage caused by foot deformity and the results of operation. In this study, the finite element method was used to investigate the degree of displacement of distal chevron osteotomy on metatarsal stress and metatarsophalangeal joint load; Methods: Four finite element models of displacement were established by using the CT images of a patient with moderate hallux valgus (hallux valgus angle and intermetatarsal angle were 26.74° and 14.09°, respectively), and the validity of the model was verified. Each finite element model consisted of bones and various cartilage structures, ligaments, and plantar fascia, as well as encapsulated soft tissue. Except for soft tissue, the material properties of other parts were isotropic linear elastic material, and the encapsulated soft tissue was set as nonlinear hyperelastic material. The mesh was tetrahedral mesh. Link elements were used in ligament and plantar fascia. A ground reaction force with a half-body weight was applied at the bottom of the floor to simulate the ground reaction when standing. The upper surfaces of the encapsulated soft tissue, distal tibia, and distal fibula were fixed. The stress distribution of metatarsals and the stress of cartilage of the first metatarsophalangeal joint were compared and analyzed; Results: Compared with the hallux valgus without osteotomy, the stress of the first metatarsals and second metatarsals of 2–4 mm decreased, and the stress of the interarticular cartilage of the first metatarsophalangeal joint with 4 mm was reduced. In the case of 6 mm, the stress value between the first metatarsal and the first metatarsophalangeal joint increased, and 4 mm was the most suitable distance; Conclusions: Compared with the hallux valgus without osteotomy, the stress of the first metatarsals and second metatarsals of 2–4 mm decreased, and the stress of the interarticular cartilage of the first metatarsophalangeal joint with 4 mm was reduced. In the case of 6 mm, the stress value between the first metatarsal and the first metatarsophalangeal joint increased, and 4 mm was the most suitable distance. For the degree of displacement of the distal chevron osteotomy, the postoperative stability and the stress distribution of metatarsal bone should be considered. Factors such as hallux valgus angle, intermetatarsal angle, patient’s age, body weight, and metatarsal width should be considered comprehensively. The factors affecting osteotomy need to be further explored. The degree of displacement of osteotomy can be evaluated by FE method before the operation, and the most suitable distance can be obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3acartilage 3aencapsulation 3afascia 3afibula 3afinite element analysis 3aisotropy 3aligaments 3amodels 3aosteotomy 3apatients 3atibia1 aZhang, Yan 1 aHuang, Jialu 1 aTeo, Ee Chon1 aGu, Yaodong 0 tBiology.g2022 Jan. 13, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110101273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02113naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245007100165300001800236520081000254592002801064650002201092650001201114650002101126650002101147650002101168650002001189650000901209650001701218650001201235650001701247650002001264650001401284650002101298650001601319700002501335700002601360700002801386700002501414700002101439773012401460856007401584852000901658655001201667IND60662752720221120183816.0190906e20140526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066275272DNAL7 a10.1039/c4gc00300d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreitas, Denilson V.10aElectrochemical synthesis of TGA-capped CdTe and CdSe quantum dots  ap. 3247-3254.  aThe electrochemical preparation of Te²⁻ and Se²⁻ ions was carried out in NaOH aqueous solution, with high yield and good stability, and applied in the preparation of negatively charged CdTe and CdSe quantum dots (QDs).

The results showed that total aerobic mesophilic bacterial counts decreased during storage at both temperatures. Yeast and mould counts, however, increased especially in the samples stored at room temperature due to increased acidity during storage. The number of aerobic spore-forming bacteria decreased, although it was high at the beginning of storage. The number of psychrotrophic bacteria significantly decreased after 60 days in the samples stored at refrigeration temperature and to a smaller degree decreased in the samples stored at room temperature. The statistical analysis showed that the variety of milks and draining of the yoghurts and their interactions had no effect on the growth/survival of total aerobic mesophilic bacteria and psychrotrophic bacteria (P?0.05). However, storage time had a significant effect on the growth of aerobic mesophilic bacteria and aerobic spore-forming bacteria (P<0.01) and yeast, mould and psychrotrophic bacterial counts (P<0.05).

Our goal in this study was to isolate species of Trichoderma, that exhibit high levels of biocontrol efficacy from natural environments and to investigate the mechanisms by which these strains confer plant protection. In this study, efficacy of the native isolates of Trichoderma species to promote the growth and yield parameters of tomato and to manage Fusarium wilt disease under in vitro and in vivo conditions were investigated. The dominant pathogen, which causes Fusarium wilt of tomato, was isolated and identified as Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (FOL). Twenty eight native Trichoderma antagonists were isolated from healthy tomato rhizosphere soil in different geographical regions of Mazandaran province, Iran. Under in vitro conditions, the results revealed that Trichoderma harzianum, isolate N-8, was found to inhibit effectively the radial mycelial growth of the pathogen (by 68.22%). Under greenhouse conditions, the application of T. harzianum (N-8) exhibited the least disease incidence (by 14.75%). Also, tomato plants treated with T. harzianum (N-8) isolate showed a significant stimulatory effect on plant height (by 70.13 cm) and the dry weight (by 265.42 g) of tomato plants, in comparison to untreated control (54.6 cm and 195.5 g). Therefore, the antagonist T. harzianum (N-8) is chosen to be the most promising bio-control agent for F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. On the base of present study, the biocontrol agents of plant diseases might be exploited for sustainable disease management programs to save environmental risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici 3aFusarium wilt 3aTrichoderma harzianum 3aantagonists 3abiological control 3adisease control 3adisease incidence 3afungal antagonists 3afungi 3agreenhouse production 3amycelium 3apathogens 3aplant protection 3arhizosphere 3arisk 3asoil 3atomatoes 3aIran 0aBiological control 0aFungi antagonist 0aFusarium wilt 0aLycopersicon esculentum0 tCercetări agronomice în Moldova.g2016 Apr. 30, v. 49, no. 1 p.91-98dDe Gruyter Openx2067-18657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/cerce-2016-00083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100003400154245007600188520145100264592002801715650002201743650002301765650001601788650002501804650002001829651001101849653001901860653002901879653002501908653001801933700004601951700003601997700003602033700003102069700003002100700003202130773009602162856008902258852000902347655001202356IND60714944020221119232753.0210527e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071494402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.1051272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Santos, Patrícia Pereira10aGeotechnologies applied to analysis of the rural environmental cadastre  aGeotechnologies have been widely employed in environmental monitoring and process control over the Brazilian territory. To identify perpetrators of environmental violations and promote environmental regularization of private rural properties, the government established a national registration requirement, known as Cadastro Ambiental Rural – CAR (Rural Environmental Cadastre). It is an electronic registration platform, where owners declare the property area and its environmental aspects. This work consisted of analyzing and discussing CAR module tools provided by the Brazilian Federal Government, which were adopted by Rio de Janeiro State, with the equivalent registration modules from Minas Gerais and São Paulo States. The results indicate that while the federal platform has a simple and intuitive interface, prior knowledge of current legislation is essential. Except for São Paulo State platform, the others allow inserting data obtained by different approaches, not establishing a standard mapping scale or spatial resolution. The images provided by Federal Government platform do not fully support visual identification of the required information, especially on small properties, what makes alternative data and software necessary. Although not current, only São Paulo platform provides good quality images to support the identification of features required by CAR. The proposed methodology can be adapted other country areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3afederal government 3aland policy 3alaws and regulations 3aprocess control 3aBrazil 0aRural property 0aEnvironmental regulation 0aEnvironmental policy 0aGeotechnology1 ada Costa de Menezes, Sady Júnior Martins1 ade Jesus Júnior, Waldir Cintra1 ade Almeida Telles, Lucas Arthur1 ade Souza, Marcelo Henrique1 ada Silva, Samuel Ferreira1 aSantos, Alexandre Rosa dos,0 tLand use policy.g2021 Feb., v. 101 p.105127-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.1051273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02027naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245005600174300001600230520112600246592002801372650001501400650001301415650002001428650001301448650001501461700002401476700002301500700003101523773009501554856005501649852000901704655001201713IND4425969820221121152640.0150416e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442596982DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1541-0420.2008.01174.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScherag, AndrÃ©10aFlexible Designs for Genomewide Association Studies  ap. 815-821.  aGenomewide association studies attempting to unravel the genetic etiology of complex traits have recently gained attention. Frequently, these studies employ a sequential genotyping strategy: A large panel of markers is examined in a subsample of subjects, and the most promising markers are genotyped in the remaining subjects. In this article, we introduce a novel method for such designs enabling investigators to, for example, modify marker densities and sample proportions while strongly controlling the familyâwise type I error rate. Loss of efficiency is avoided by redistributing conditional type I error rates of discarded markers. Our approach can be combined with cost optimal designs and entails a greater flexibility than all previously suggested designs. Among other features, it allows for marker selections based upon biological criteria instead of statistical criteria alone, or the option to modify the sample size at any time during the course of the project. For practical applicability, we develop a new algorithm, subsequently evaluate it by simulations, and illustrate it using a real data set.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abiometry 3adata collection 3aetiology 3agenotyping1 aHebebrand, Johannes1 aSchÃ¤fer, Helmut1 aMÃ¼ller, HansâHelge0 tBiometrics.g2009 Sept., v. 65, no. 3 p.815-821dBlackwell Publishing Incx0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0420.2008.01174.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002800145245012900173300001600302520193200318592002802250650001002278650002502288650000902313650002602322650001302348650001102361650001102372650002302383650000902406650001702415650001002432650000902442650002202451700003202473773009202505856004802597852000902645655001202654IND4473801520221118171151.0120313e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447380152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-011-0990-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuelke-Stelling, Monika10aFe isotope fractionation caused by translocation of iron during growth of bean and oat as models of strategy I and II plants  ap. 217-231.  aBACKGROUND: The determination of the plant-induced Fe-isotopic fractionation is a promising tool to better quantify their role in the geochemical Fe cycle and possibly to identify the physiological mechanisms of Fe uptake and translocation in plants. Here we explore the isotope fractionation caused by translocation of Fe during growth of bean and oat as representatives of strategy I and II plants. METHODS: Plants were grown on a nutrient solution supplemented with Fe(III)-EDTA and harvested at three different ages. We used the technique of multi-collector ICP-MS to resolve the small differences in the stable iron isotope compositions of plants. RESULTS: Total bean plants, regardless of their age, were found to be enriched in the light iron isotopes by −1.2‰ relative to the growth solution throughout. During growth plants internally redistributed isotopes where young leaves increasingly accumulated the lighter isotopes whereas older leaves and the total roots were simultaneously depleted in light iron isotopes. Oat plants were also enriched in the light iron isotopes but during growth the initial isotope ratio maintained in all organs at all growth stages. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that isotope fractionation in bean as a representative of strategy I plants is a result of translocation or re-translocation processes. Furthermore we assume that both uptake and translocation of Fe in oat maintains the irons’ ferric state, or that Fe is always bound to high-mass ligands, so that isotope fractionation is virtually absent in these plants. However, in contrast to our previous study in which strategy II plants were grown on soil substrate, oat plants grown on Fe(III)-EDTA contain iron that enriches 54Fe by 0.5 permil over 56Fe. A possible explanation for the enrichment is the prevalence of a constitutive reductive uptake mechanism of iron in the nutrient solution used which is non-deficient in iron.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeans 3adevelopmental stages 3airon 3aisotope fractionation 3aisotopes 3aleaves 3amodels 3anutrient solutions 3aoats 3aplant growth 3aroots 3asoil 3auptake mechanisms1 avon Blanckenburg, Friedhelm0 tPlant and soil.g2012 Mar., v. 352, no. 1-2 p.217-231dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-011-0990-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02460naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245008400176300001600260520121900276592002801495650001601523650002301539650001501562650001101577650001301588650001301601650002401614650001301638653001501651653001201666653002301678653002301701700002501724700002101749700006601770773013101836856008601967852000902053655001202062IND60765882820220314000000.0220204e20211229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076588282DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c007602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarwolińska, Dorota14aThe Influence of Storage on Human Milk Lipidome Stability for Lipidomic Studies  ap. 438-446.  aHuman milk (HM) lipidome stability during storage is crucial in lipidomic studies to avoid misinterpretations. Facing the lack of comprehensive work on the HM lipidome stability, we performed a study on a potential alteration in the lipid profiles of HM samples stored under different conditions. An untargeted LC-Q-TOF-MS-based approach was applied to study the influence of storage conditions as well as the interaction of the storage temperature and time on HM lipid profiles. The samples were stored for 4–84 days at temperatures in the range from 4 to −80 °C and also were exposed to up to three freeze–thaw cycles. The results showed that the storage at 4 °C for just 4 days as well as being subjected to three freeze–thaw cycles can lead to a change in the content of lipids. The observed differences in levels of some lipid species in samples stored at −20 °C in comparison to the concentration level of those lipids in samples stored at −80 °C were not statistically significant, and inter-individual variance regardless of sample storage condition was maintained. The storage of HM samples at −20 °C for up to 3 weeks and −80 °C for up to 12 weeks ensures sample lipidome stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast milk 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3alipidomics 3alipids 3aproteome 3aresearch 3astorage temperature 3avariance 0ahuman milk 0astorage 0alipidome stability 0aLC−MS lipidomics1 aMłynarczyk, Michał1 aKot-Wasik, Agata1 aHewelt-Belka, Weronika1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1990-21300 tJournal of proteome research.g2021 Dec. 29, v. 21, no. 2 p.438-446dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c007603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245017100164500002200335520106400357592002801421650002901449650001601478650002801494650001701522650002101539650002401560650001501584650002001599650002501619650002601644653001501670653002901685653002501714653002001739700001201759700001901771700001301790773008601803856008401889852000901973655001201982IND60543635720221118052621.0160901s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054363572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2013.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSo, Kyun,10aIdentification of the fostriecin biosynthetic gene cluster and characterization of fosH as a novel kinase gene for fostriecin biosynthesis in Streptomyces pulveraceus  aPre-press version  aFostriecin is a unique phosphate monoester antibiotic produced by Streptomyces pulveraceus, which is a novel selective inhibitor for protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and protein phosphatase 4A (PP4A) with potent antitumor activity. However, the biosynthesis mechanism of fostriecin was poorly understood. In this study, we presented the analysis of a putative fostriecin gene cluster isolated from the cosmid library of S. pulveraceus subspecies fostreus ATCC 31906. The entire 73 kb gene cluster contains coding sequences for six modular type I polyketide synthases (FosABCDEF) and seven tailoring enzymes, and the function of two novel ORFs, FosL (putative hydrolase) and FosM (NAD dependent epimerase/dehydratase family protein) was deduced. The in vitro enzymatic functional study of a putative phosphokinase FosH showed that it is responsible for the phosphorylation of fostriecin precursor or its analogs. Our results indicated that FosH acts as a novel kinase with relaxed substrate specificity and is involved in the process of fostriecin biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptomyces pulveraceus 3aantibiotics 3aantineoplastic activity 3abiosynthesis 3amultigene family 3aopen reading frames 3aphosphates 3aphosphorylation 3apolyketide synthases 3asubstrate specificity 0aFostriecin 0aStreptomyces pulveraceus 0aPolyketide synthases 0aPhosphorylation1 aYu, Jia1 aZhao, Xin-Qing1 aTang, Li0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2013, dElsevier B.V.x1389-17237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2013.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02227naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245006400163300001600227520114000243592002801383650002201411650002201433650002001455650002101475650001101496650001401507650000901521650001301530653002101543653002101564653003201585653000901617653001101626700001501637773009601652856008401748852000901832655001201841IND60479749920221118071709.0160123e20040901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047974992DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.33.2004.3.102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVetter, J.10aSelenium level of the cultivated mushroom Agaricus bisporus  ap. 297-301.  aSelenium intake of the human population is very distinct and depends on the Se-content of consumed food.

The main task of this work was to obtain new comparable data on Se content of <i>Agaricus bisporus</i> mushroom. The selenium content of different, common varieties of <i>Agaricus bisporus</i> and of its three cultivation's flushes was determined. The Se content of varieties varies between 0.46 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> d.m. and 5.63 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> d.m., and the average content is 2.82 (± 1.48) mg kg<sup>-1</sup> d.m. The caps of fruit bodies have always higher selenium content than the stipe. The average cap/stipe selenium ratio is 1.29. The changes of Se concentration during the cultivation (in cultivation's flushes) are not significant. The most important cultivated mushroom species of the world (<i>Agaricus bisporus</i>) has, in addition to other more valuable properties, a remarkable Se-content.

Possible adaptive benefits of such behaviour include the acquisition of nutrients, decreased competition for one’s own offspring, and/or increased mating opportunities. Clutch cannibalism has occasionally been observed in several species of Neotropical poison frogs, but the circumstances under which this behaviour occurs has rarely been investigated experimentally. Recent experiments with the poison frog Allobates femoralis have shown that males indiscriminately transport all clutches located inside their own territory to bodies of water, but become highly cannibalistic when taking over a new territory. Females are able to indirectly discriminate between their own and foreign clutches by location and take over transport duties of their own clutches only in the absence of the father. Cannibalism by A. femoralis females has not been previously observed. We thus asked if, and under which circumstances, cannibalism of unrelated clutches by female A. femoralis would occur, by manipulating the presence of the clutch’s father, the female’s own reproductive state, and the female’s familiarity with the environment. RESULTS: Females clearly cannibalize foreign clutches. Cannibalism was most pronounced when the female had not recently produced her own clutch and the father of the foreign clutch was absent. The female’s familiarity with the area had no significant influence on the likelihood of cannibalism to occur. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that both previous oviposition and the father’s presence reduce cannibalistic behaviour in A. femoralis females. Cannibalistic females may gain nutritional benefits or enhanced inclusive fitness by preying on other females’ offspring. The finding that the father’s presence at the clutch site/territory was sufficient to reduce cannibalism by females suggests a prominent role of male territoriality for the evolution of male parental care.  aPublisher supplied data  aP24788-B22cAustrian Science Fund  aT699-B24cAustrian Science Fund  aW1234-G17cAustrian Science Fund0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAllobates femoralis 3aadults 3acannibalism 3aevolution 3afemales 3amales 3anutrients 3anutritive value 3aoviposition 3apoisonous frogs 3aprogeny 3asurface water 3aterritoriality1 aLehner, Marion1 aHuber, Ludwig1 aRingler, Eva1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3273-65680 tFrontiers in zoology.g2019 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.8-8dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001775x1742-99947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12983-019-0304-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245006200161300001600223520126700239592002801506650001801534650001601552650002001568650001201588650001101600650001201611650001101623650001301634650001501647650002601662650000901688650001101697650000801708650002601716650002501742650002301767650001201790650001301802650001901815650001101834650001101845650001401856650001601870650002401886650001001910651001201920653002001932653002001952653000901972653001101981653001201992653001802004653001002022653002302032700001902055700001402074700001302088700002302101700001402124773009502138856008302233852000902316655001202325IND60479747220221118071311.0160123e20031101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047974722DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.32.2003.4.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRurik, I.10aNutritional status of elderly patients living in Budapest  ap. 363-371.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the nutritional status of elderly belonging to one primary care office. Twenty-seven men and 26 women, all over 60 years, were involved. Nutritional assessment, anthropometric measurements were performed, serum proteins, lipid and iron status and haematological parameters were determined. Energy and protein intake was sufficient, but the distribution of energy with a high fat and low carbohydrate was inadequate. Iron, copper, calcium, retinol and folate intake was lower, whereas sodium, ascorbic acid and cobalamin intake was higher than the Hungarian recommendation. The prevalence of obesity characterized by body mass index or waist circumference was higher in women than in men. The percentage of pathological levels of lipid parameters was also higher in women. No iron deficient erythropoesis was detected, but high serum ferritin concentration as a marker of body iron store was determined in some cases. General practitioners have possibilities to influence the nutritional habits of elderly, thereby reducing the incidence of obesity, cardiovascular diseases and stroke. Iron status of Hungarian elderly looks to be satisfactory, so supplementation without testing the iron status would be useless and harmful.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3acalcium 3acopper 3aelderly 3aenergy 3aferritin 3afolic acid 3ageneral practitioners 3airon 3alipids 3amen 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrition assessment 3anutritional status 3aobesity 3apatients 3aprotein intake 3asodium 3astroke 3avitamin A 3avitamin B12 3awaist circumference 3awomen 3aHungary 0anutrient intake 0anutrient intake 0airon 0aenergy 0aelderly 0aanthropometry 0alipid 0anutritional status1 aGyömörei, E.1 aBiró, L.1 aNagy, K.1 aRegöly-Mérei, A.1 aAntal, M.0 tActa alimentaria.g2003 Nov. 1, v. 32, no. 4 p.363-371dAkadémiai Kiadóx0139-30067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAlim.32.2003.4.43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245006300166520129600229592002801525650002801553650001801581650002001599650001401619650003001633650001001663650003301673650001101706650001301717650001301730650003101743650001401774650001501788650002701803650001301830650001001843650001501853650001001868650001001878650001201888651001501900700002501915700002301940700002701963773011901990856007802109852000902187655001202196IND60703677420221117025204.0200721e20200121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070367742DNAL7 a10.3390/plants90201342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNouri, Mohamed  T.10aMacrophomina Crown and Root Rot of Pistachio in California  aIn this study, declining pistachio rootstocks were detected in newly planted commercial pistachio orchards in Kern County, California. Symptoms were characterized by wilted foliage combined with crown rot in the rootstock. From diseased trees, 42 isolates were obtained, and all had similar cultural and morphological characteristics of Macrophomina phaseolina. Analyses of nucleotide sequences of three gene fragments, the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1–5.8S–ITS2), partial sequences of β-tubulin, and translation elongation factor 1-α (TEF1) confirmed this identification, and 20 representative isolates are presented in the phylogenetic study. Testing of Koch’s postulates showed that M. phaseolina, when inoculated to stems and roots of the pistachio rootstocks using mycelial plugs or a microsclerotial suspension, is indeed pathogenic to this host. The widely used clonal University of California Berkeley I (UCBI) rootstock appeared highly susceptible to M. phaseolina, suggesting that this pathogen is an emerging threat to the production of pistachio in California. This study confirmed the association of M. phaseolina with the decline of pistachio trees and represents the first description of this fungus as a crown rot-causing agent of pistachio in California.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrophomina phaseolina 3aPistacia vera 3acrop production 3acrown rot 3afungal diseases of plants 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaves 3amycelium 3aorchards 3apeptide elongation factors 3aphylogeny 3apistachios 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aroot rot 3aroots 3arootstocks 3astems 3atrees 3atubulin 3aCalifornia1 aLawrence, Daniel  P.1 aKallsen, Craig E.,1 aTrouillas, Florent  P.0 tPlants.g2020 Jan. 21, v. 9, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants90201343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04001naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013100164300001800295520210500313592002802418650001102446650000802457650002802465650002002493650002302513650003702536650001402573650001502587650001102602650001102613650001902624650003102643650000902674650001302683650001102696650001102707650001502718650001502733650002402748650001502772650002002787650002302807650001102830651001002841653002402851653002602875653002202901653001502923653003702938653003102975700001803006700001503024700001803039700005603057700001403113700002003127773011203147856008303259852000903342655001203351IND60714942220221119234113.0211114e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071494222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2020.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Hong-qi10aEstimation of skeletal muscle mass by bioimpedance and differences among skeletal muscle mass indices for assessing sarcopenia  ap. 2308-2318.  aIt is crucial to assess age-related muscle mass changes and derived indices differences in geriatric medicine. We aimed to develop and validate four bioimpedance analysis (BIA) prediction equations against dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and magnetic resonance image (MRI) in estimating skeletal muscle mass and to compare the differences among skeletal muscle mass indices, cutoff values, and corresponding prevalence rates of low muscle mass for assessing sarcopenia in Chinese adults.We measured the height (Ht), weight (Wt), appendicular lean mass (ALM) or skeletal muscle mass (ASM), total lean body mass (LBM) or skeletal muscle mass (TSM) obtained using DEXA or MRI, and a multi-frequency BIA (BCA II;50, 250 kHz), in 371 adults aged 18.0–87.0 years. We also collected gender, age, Ht, Wt, and impedance indexes (Ht²/R₅₀, Ht²/R₂₅₀, R₅₀/Ht², R₂₅₀/Ht²) from 30,500 adults aged 18–96 years living in China. Multiple regression analyses were used to derive four prediction equations by BIA, and double cross-validation techniques and Bland-Altman analyses were used to test agreement. Various muscle mass indices and prevalence rates were depicted by line plots in regard to age trends.Satisfactory results were found in the four prediction models as they had the larger R² (0.833–0.930) values and low SEE (1.409–2.335 kg) values. The predictive variables included impedance indexes (Ht²/R₅₀, R₅₀/Ht², R₂₅₀/Ht²), gender, age, Wt, and Ht. The corresponding prevalence rates of low muscle mass exhibited significant differences according to the various muscle mass indices adjusted for Ht, Wt, or body mass index (BMI), in addition to the cutoff values based on two standard deviations (2SD) of young people or the lower 20% of the study group.The BIA equations have the potential to be applied as a practical method of quantifying skeletal muscle mass in Chinese adults. However, the operational methods that are most appropriate for determining the degree of low muscle mass that actually contributes to sarcopenia remains inconclusive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aage 3abioelectrical impedance 3abody mass index 3aclinical nutrition 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3aequations 3aestimation 3agender 3aheight 3alean body mass 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amass 3amedicine 3amodels 3apeople 3aprediction 3aprevalence 3aregression analysis 3asarcopenia 3askeletal muscle 3astandard deviation 3aweight 3aChina 0aMuscle mass indices 0aBioimpedance analysis 0aPrediction models 0aSarcopenia 0aDual energy X-ray absorptiometry 0aMagnetic resonance imaging1 aLiu, Jing-min1 aZhang, Xin1 aXue, Yong-tai1 aShi, Ji-peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1488-51991 aChen, Wei1 aZheng, Xiu-yuan0 tClinical nutrition.g2021 Apr., v. 40, no. 4 p.2308-2318dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2020.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002000094040001800114100002400132245016900156300001600325520123100341592002801572653003001600653002001630653001501650653002901665653001901694700003101713700001801744700002301762773009801785856006801883852000901951655001201960IND60131218920221121222311.0151127e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013121892DNAL7 a10.1672/112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaravaca, Fuensanta10aMicrobial activities and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonization in the rhizosphere of the salt marsh plant inula crithmoides l. along a spatial salinity gradient  ap. 350-355.  aThis study was carried out in a Mediterranean salt marsh in semiarid Southeast Spain to assess whether a spatial salinity gradient can affect the microbiological and biochemical properties (labile C fractions, biomass C, oxidoreductases, and hydrolases) of the rhizosphere soil of Inula crithmoides and the extent of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization in its roots. There were no significant differences in the soluble C fractions (water-soluble C and water-soluble carbohydrates) or the microbial biomass C values of the rhizosphere soil of I. crithmoides among the different zones of the salt marsh. Dehydrogenase activity, hydrolases (urease, protease, phosphatase, and ββ-glucosidase) and the extent of AM colonization in I. crithmoides roots were greater in the higher salt marsh zones, corresponding to those of lower rhizosphere soil salinity. This study shows that soil salinity is inversely associated with some parameters related to soil microbial activity, such as dehydrogenase activity and some hydrolases, as well as the extent of colonization by AM fungi, which can improve plant performance. However, bioactive organic matter fractions that determine soil productivity are not related to soil salinity.  aPublisher supplied data 0awater-soluble C fractions 0aoxidoreductases 0ahydrolases 0aMediterranean salt marsh 0asemiarid areas1 adel Mar Alguacil, Maríía1 aTorres, Pilar1 aRoldáán, Antonio0 tWetlands.g2005 June, v. 25, no. 2 p.350-355dSociety of Wetlands Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166100001900184245014600203300001300349506007600362520140700438592002801845506003701873650002301910650002101933650000901954650001101963650001301974650003501987650001302022650001202035650002402047650003202071650001102103650001302114650000902127650002302136650001302159650003602172650002402208650001302232700002302245700002402268700002802292773012702320856004602447852000902493655001202502IND4480929120221207122935.0201002e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448092912DNAL7 a205466242pmid7 aPMC29034992pmcid7 a10.1186/1297-9686-42-222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sang Hong10aUsing the realized relationship matrix to disentangle confounding factors for the estimation of genetic variance components of complex traits  ap. 2451.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: In the analysis of complex traits, genetic effects can be confounded with non-genetic effects, especially when using full-sib families. Dominance and epistatic effects are typically confounded with additive genetic and non-genetic effects. This confounding may cause the estimated genetic variance components to be inaccurate and biased. METHODS: In this study, we constructed genetic covariance structures from whole-genome marker data, and thus used realized relationship matrices to estimate variance components in a heterogenous population of ~ 2200 mice for which four complex traits were investigated. These mice were genotyped for more than 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and the variances due to family, cage and genetic effects were estimated by models based on pedigree information only, aggregate SNP information, and model selection for specific SNP effects. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We show that the use of genome-wide SNP information can disentangle confounding factors to estimate genetic variances by separating genetic and non-genetic effects. The estimated variance components using realized relationship were more accurate and less biased, compared to those based on pedigree information only. Models that allow the selection of individual SNP in addition to fitting a relationship matrix are more efficient for traits with a significant dominance variance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenetic covariance 3agenetic variance 3amice 3amodels 3apedigree 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3avariance 2aAnimals 2aBias (Epidemiology) 2aGenetic Variationxgenetics 2aGenome 2aGenotype 2aMice 2aModels, Biological 2aPedigree 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aRegression Analysis 2aSiblings1 aGoddard, Michael E1 aVisscher, Peter M.,1 avan der Werf, Julius HJ0 tGenetics, selection, evolution.g2010 Dec., v. 42, no. 1 p.2451-2451dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl4350896x0999-193X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1297-9686-42-22  aDNAL 7aarticle03328naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005500188245006900243300001100312506007600323520171300399592002802112596007902140506003702219650001702256650001502273650001102288650001902299650001402318650002102332650001602353650001602369650001102385650001302396650002502409650001802434650001502452650001402467650000902481651001002490700001502500700001602515700001402531700001502545700001502560700001502575773010502590856008202695852000902777655001202786IND60634479720221207142400.0191231e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063447972DNAL7 a10.1186/s13007-019-0416-x2doi7 aPMC64297542pmcid7 a309492292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Kailou1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5054-167110aEvaluation of grain yield based on digital images of rice canopy  ap. 28.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Rice canopy changes are associated with changes in the red light (R), green light (G), and blue light (B) value parameters of digital images. To rapidly diagnose the responses of rice to nitrogen (N) fertilizer application and planting density, a simple model based on digital images was developed for predicting and evaluating rice yield. RESULTS: N application rate and planting density had significant effects on rice yield. Rice yield first increased and then decreased with increasing of N rates, while the rice yield always increased significantly with increasing planting density. The normalized redness intensity (NRI), normalized greenness intensity (NGI), and normalized blueness intensity (NBI) values of the rice canopy varied among stages; however, they were primarily affected by N fertilizer rates, while planting density had no significant effects. Furthermore, the significant relationships of grain yield with NRI and NBI at the late filling stage could be fitted by quadratic equations, but there was no significant relationship observed between grain yield and NGI across all stages. In addition, a field validation experiment showed that the predicted yield based on the fitted quadratic equations was consistent with the measured yield. CONCLUSION: The NRI, NGI, and NBI values of rice canopy were mainly affected by N fertilizer rates, while the planting density had no significant effect. The significant relationships between grain yield with NRI and NBI at the late filling stage could be fitted by quadratic equations. Therefore, the canopy NRI and NBI at the late filling stage as measured by digital photography could be used to predict grain yield in southern China.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0200101cThe National Key Research and Development Program of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOryza sativa 3ablue light 3acanopy 3adigital images 3aequations 3afertilizer rates 3agrain yield 3agreen light 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aplant density 3aprediction 3ared light 3arice 3aChina1 aLi, Yazhen1 aHan, Tianfu1 aYu, Xichu1 aYe, Huicai1 aHu, Huiwen1 aHu, Zhihua0 tPlant methods.g2019 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.28-28dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4337304x1746-48117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13007-019-0416-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011200155300001800267520172900285592002802014650002002042650002102062650002502083650001102108650002302119650001102142650002002153650001502173650001702188650001702205650001802222700001102240700001802251700001902269700002002288700002402308700001802332700001602350700002102366700001802387773014402405856007502549852000902624655001202633IND60795034920221120221200.0220929e20220928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079503492DNAL7 a10.1039/d2tb00672c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shiyao10aProtein precoating modulates biomolecular coronas and nanocapsule–immune cell interactions in human blood  ap. 7607-7621.  aThe biomolecular corona that forms on particles upon contact with blood plays a key role in the fate and utility of nanomedicines. Recent studies have shown that precoating nanoparticles with serum proteins can improve the biocompatibility and stealth properties of nanoparticles. However, it is not fully clear how precoating influences biomolecular corona formation and downstream biological responses. Herein, we systematically examine three precoating strategies by coating bovine serum albumin (single protein), fetal bovine serum (FBS, mixed proteins without immunoglobulins), or bovine serum (mixed proteins) on three nanoparticle systems, namely supramolecular template nanoparticles, metal–phenolic network (MPN)-coated template (core–shell) nanoparticles, and MPN nanocapsules (obtained after template removal). The effect of protein precoating on biomolecular corona compositions and particle–immune cell interactions in human blood was characterized. In the absence of a pre-coating, the MPN nanocapsules displayed lower leukocyte association, which correlated to the lower amount (by 2–3 fold) of adsorbed proteins and substantially fewer immunoglobulins (more than 100 times) in the biomolecular corona relative to the template and core–shell nanoparticles. Among the three coating strategies, FBS precoating demonstrated the most significant reduction in leukocyte association (up to 97% of all three nanoparticles). A correlation analysis highlights that immunoglobulins and apolipoproteins may regulate leukocyte recognition. This study demonstrates the impact of different precoating strategies on nanoparticle–immune cell association and the role of immunoglobulins in bio–nano interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapolipoproteins 3abiocompatibility 3abovine serum albumin 3acattle 3afetal bovine serum 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulins 3aleukocytes 3ananocapsules 3ananomedicine 3ananoparticles1 aJu, Yi1 aZhou, Jiajing1 aFaria, Matthew1 aAng, Ching-Seng1 aMitchell, Andrew J.1 aZhong, Qi-Zhi1 aZheng, Tian1 aKent, Stephen J.1 aCaruso, Frank0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2022 Sept. 28, v. 10, no. 37 p.7607-7621dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2tb00672c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03620naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245021400159520193200373592002802305650002602333650002402359650001402383650000902397650001402406650001102420650002202431650001902453650001202472650001302484650001502497650001502512650001302527650002102540650002302561650001002584650001902594650001302613650001602626650002102642650002502663650002002688650001402708650002002722650002502742650001802767650001602785700001402801700001402815700001502829773012102844856008002965852000903045655001203054IND60763395720221122154905.0220120e20211222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076339572DNAL7 a10.3390/biology110100112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qi 10aEffects of Melissa officinalis L. Essential Oil in Comparison with Anaesthetics on Gill Tissue Damage, Liver Metabolism and Immune Parameters in Sea Bass (Lateolabrax maculatus) during Simulated Live Transport  aIn the current study, Melissa officinalis L. essential oil (MOEO), a novel sedative and anaesthetic, was employed in transport water to obtain a lower stress effect and higher survival rate for live marine fish. The effect of MOEO and various types of anaesthetics, administered at a low temperature on gill morphology, liver function and immunological parameters of living sea bass (Lateolabrax maculatus) subjected to transport stress, was evaluated to optimize the anaesthetic and sedative concentrations during live sea bass transport. Light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy of sea bass, subjected to simulated live transport for 72 h, demonstrated that the changes in the morphological characteristics of gill tissue treated with 40 mg/L MOEO (A3 group) were minimal in comparison to those observed in untreated sea bass. The results of pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), hexokinase (HK), hepatic glycogen (Gly), superoxide dismutase (SOD), lipid peroxides (MDA) and Caspase-3 assays indicated that the glycolysis rate, energy consumption, lipid peroxidation and hepatocyte apoptosis were the lowest in the A3 group. The values of the two immune parameters, lysozyme (LZM) and fish immunoglobulin M (IgM), indicated the strongest immunity ability in the A3 group. After 12 h recovery, sea bass treated with 30 mg/L MS-222 (B group) displayed a 100% survival rate, sea bass treated with 20 mg/L (A2 group) and 40 mg/L (A3 group) MOEO displayed a 96% survival rate, sea bass treated with 20 mg/L eugenol (C group) had a 94% survival rate, and untreated sea bass (CK group) had a 50% survival rate. Therefore, the addition MOEO to the transport water had anaesthetic and sedative effects similar to MS-222 and eugenol. The results confirmed that the addition of MOEO to the transport water could reduce tissue damage, energy metabolism, and the oxidative stress response in sea bass during transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLateolabrax japonicus 3aMelissa officinalis 3aapoptosis 3abass 3acaspase-3 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3aessential oils 3aeugenol 3aglycogen 3aglycolysis 3ahexokinase 3aimmunity 3alight microscopy 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3aliver function 3alysozyme 3amarine fish 3aoxidative stress 3aphosphofructokinases 3apyruvate kinase 3asedatives 3astress response 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asurvival rate 3atemperature1 aMei, Jun 1 aCao, Jie 1 aXie, Jing 0 tBiology.g2021 Dec. 22, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110100113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245016300166520133600329592002801665650002101693650002601714650001101740650001701751650001101768650002801779651001001807651001001817651001301827653002901840653002001869653001901889653002501908653004701933700001501980700001901995700001402014700001102028700001502039700001802054700001702072773010102089856008602190852000902276655001202285IND60754678720221116175430.0211206e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075467872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1082212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Pan10aWater-Energy-Food system in typical cities of the world and China under zero-waste: Commonalities and asynchronous experiences support sustainable development  aCommonalities and asynchronous experiences of realizing zero-waste of water, energy, and food resources between the world and China have critical global importance to support sustainable development, especially for Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) urban agglomeration. In this study, a comprehensive assessment framework for the zero-waste city was proposed to evaluate zero-waste construction in the world (e.g., San Francisco, New York, and Tokyo) and China (e.g., Beijing, Shanghai, and GBA) from the perspective of water, energy, and food. The results showed that the zero-waste construction level of the GBA cities was weaker than that of the benchmark city and other world-class cities. The average score of the GBA cities was the lowest, 2.5% lower than the benchmark city and 11.8% lower than other world-class cities. Macao had apparent advantages in the social-economic and ecological-environment system, while the Pearl River Delta cities were considerably better than Macao and Hong Kong in the water and food systems. Future work could improve the level of zero-waste construction by learning from foreign zero-waste cities’ advanced experience, increasing efforts to promote the implementation of a circular economy, and building an all-around government sharing mechanism with public participation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular economy 3acitizen participation 3aenergy 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3asustainable development 3aChina 3aMacau 3aNew York 0aWater-energy-food system 0aZero-waste city 0aEntropy method 0aThe Greater Bay Area 0aCommonalities and asynchronous experiences1 aXie, Yulei1 aWang, Yongyang1 aLi, Bowen1 aLi, Bo1 aJia, Qunpo1 aYang, Zhifeng1 aCai, Yanpeng0 tEcological indicators.g2021 Dec., v. 132 p.108221-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1082213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245008800161300001600249520172600265592002801991650001202019650002202031650001702053650000902070650001202079650000902091650000702100650001202107650001202119650002002131650001302151650001702164650001202181650002102193653001002214653001002224653002202234653000802256653001702264700002402281700001702305700001402322773009502336856008302431852000902514655001202523IND60479747420221118071224.0160123e20031101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047974742DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.32.2003.4.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevaj, B.14aThe effect of ripening and storage on peach pectin and gel strength of related jams  ap. 329-340.  aPeaches were harvested in three stages of ripeness (threshold-mature - I, firm-ripe - II and ripe - III). Firm-ripe (II) peaches were stored for 9 days at 4 and 22 C. The amount of water-soluble, oxalate-soluble and alkali-soluble pectin were extracted and quantitatively determined as galacturonic acid, neutral sugars were determined as glucose. Jams were made with all peach samples as well as gels from extracted fractions. Gel strength of jams and gels was measured. Dry matter, sugar composition (amount of sucrose and reducing sugars) and pH value were determined and very little change was found during the ripening period and storage, too. Alkali-soluble fraction was more abounding than water-soluble fraction. The oxalate-soluble pectic fraction was found to be a minor fraction in all peach samples. The amount of total pectin and the amount of alkali-soluble pectin fraction dropped markedly after the 1st stage of ripening, after the 2 nd day of storage at 22 C and slightly after the 6th day of storage at 4 C. The level of alkali-soluble pectin in total pectin was inversely proportional to the level of water-soluble pectic fraction, and the level of oxalate-soluble pectic fraction in total pectin content was fairly constant during the ripening and storage. Gel strength of jams and gels correlated very well with changes of the amount of alkali-soluble pectic fraction. The extracted alkali-soluble pectic fraction was capable of forming an acidic gel. Extracted oxalate-soluble pectic fraction forms a gel in the presence of calcium and solid matter more than 77%. It seems that the amount of alkali-soluble pectic fraction in peaches is responsible in producing peach jams according to gel strength.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3agalacturonic acid 3agel strength 3agels 3aglucose 3ajams 3apH 3apeaches 3apectins 3areducing sugars 3aripening 3astorage time 3asucrose 3awater solubility 0apeach 0apeach 0apectic substances 0ajam 0agel strength1 aDragovic-Uzelac, V.1 aDancevic, A.1 aFrlan, J.0 tActa alimentaria.g2003 Nov. 1, v. 32, no. 4 p.329-340dAkadémiai Kiadóx0139-30067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAlim.32.2003.4.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03485naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113024002200151040001800173100001500191245010200206300001800308506007600326520173300402592002802135506003702163650001902200650001902219650001602238650001002254650001602264650001702280650001802297650002202315650001302337650001302350650001802363650001102381650002002392650002102412650002402433650001702457650002402474650002802498650002102526650002402547653003502571653002302606653001202629653002102641653001602662700001902678700002102697773008402718856008402802852000902886655001202895IND60088317220221207052308.0160901e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008831722DNAL7 a232764252pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2012.11.0472doi7 aPMC47413822pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ting10aPhotocatalytic reduction of nitrate using titanium dioxide for regeneration of ion exchange brine  ap. 1299-1307.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNitrate is often removed from groundwater by ion exchange (IX) before its use as drinking water. Accumulation of nitrate in IX brine reduces the efficiency of IX regeneration and the useful life of the regeneration brine. For the first time, we present a strategy to photocatalytically reduce nitrate in IX brine, thereby extending the use of the brine. Titanium dioxide (Evonik P90), acting as photocatalyst, reduced nitrate effectively in both synthetic brines and sulfate-removed IX brine when formic acid (FA) was used as the hole scavenger (i.e., electron donor) and the initial FA to nitrate molar ratio (IFNR) was 5.6. Increasing the NaCl level in the synthetic brine slowed the nitrate reduction rate without affecting by-product selectivity of ammonium and gaseous N species (e.g., N2, N2O). In a non-modified IX brine, nitrate removal was greatly inhibited owing to the presence of sulfate, which competed with nitrate for active surface sites on P90 and induced aggregation of P90 nanoparticles. After removing sulfate through barium sulfate precipitation, nitrate was effectively reduced; approximately 3.6 × 1024 photons were required to reduce each mole of nitrate to 83% N Gases and 17% NH4+. To make optimum use of FA and control the residual FA level in treated brine, the IFNR was varied. High IFNRs (e.g., 4, 5.6) were found to be more efficient for nitrate reduction but left higher residual FA in brine. IX column tests were performed to investigate the impact of residual FA for brine reuse. The residual FA in the brine did not significantly affect the nitrate removal capacity of IX resins, and formate contamination of treated water could be eliminated by rinsing with one bed volume of fresh brine.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abarium sulfate 3adrinking water 3aformic acid 3agases 3agroundwater 3aion exchange 3ananoparticles 3anitrate reduction 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3aresins 3asodium chloride 3atitanium dioxide 2aFormatesxchemistry 2aIon Exchange 2aNitratesxchemistry 2aPhotochemistryxmethods 2aSaltsxchemistry 2aTitaniumxchemistry 0aPhotocatalytic denitrification 0aIon exchange brine 0aNitrate 0aTitanium dioxide 0aFormic acid1 aDoudrick, Kyle1 aWesterhoff, Paul0 tWater research.g2013 Mar. 01, v. 47 p.1299-1307dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2012.11.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009000167300002000257520139000277592002801667650004401695650001401739650001101753650003701764650003001801650001101831650001101842650001801853650002601871650001501897650001901912650003401931650000901965650001801974650001301992650002102005650001302026653001802039653002402057653001402081653001502095653001402110700005102124700001202175700001602187700005402203700001602257773014602273856008502419852000902504655001202513IND60655788720221120031653.0190805e20190716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065578872DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b023192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Kefei10aTopology-Regulated Pesticide Retention on Plant Leaves through Concave Janus Carriers  ap. 13148-13156.  aRetention, a crucial process in pesticide application, is heavily affected by the extremely low surface energy and micro/nanostructure of plant leaves. The inadequate retention like bouncing, splashing, and drifting often give rise to severe soil and groundwater pollution. In this article, we present an unprecedented topology-regulation approach that significantly contributes to this issue. A series of pesticide-loaded “hat”-shaped Janus carriers (HJCs) are synthesized via emulsion interfacial polymerization and characterized by scanning electron microscope, thermogravimetric analyzer, energy-dispersive spectrometer, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Upon spraying on plant leaves, the pesticide-loaded HJCs can embed with the micropapillae and nanosplinters on leaves driven by the “hanger-hat” topology effect, consequently leading to the enhanced retention evaluated by the deposition and flush resistance experiments. Moreover, the release behavior of pesticide-loaded HJCs is found to match the Ritger-Peppas model and finally achieves sustained release. Additionally, the generality of the HJCs synthetic strategy is also studied and applicable to multiple pesticides. This study not only provides a new strategy for increasing pesticide retention on plant leaves but also opens a promising aspect for the applications of Janus carriers in agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aemulsions 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agroundwater contamination 3aleaves 3amodels 3ananomaterials 3apesticide application 3apesticides 3apolymerization 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asoil 3aspectrometers 3aspraying 3athermogravimetry 3atopology 0aJanus carrier 0aTopology regulation 0aRetention 0aPlant leaf 0aPesticide1 aHu, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0966-63621 aMa, Yue1 aWu, Tianyue1 aGao, Yuxia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7023-10721 aDu, Fengpei0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2019 July 16, v. 7, no. 15 p.13148-13156dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b023193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011000166300001600276520118200292592002801474650002101502650002501523650001201548650001601560650002801576650001701604650001401621650001901635650001401654650002201668650001101690650001501701651001001716700001801726700001801744773010101762856008101863852000901944655001201953IND60440320920221121003325.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044032092DNAL7 a10.1007/s11769-015-0768-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chunling10aVegetation development and water level changes in Shenjiadian peatland in Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China  ap. 451-461.  aThis paper documents a 7800-year proxy record from the Shenjiadian peatland on the Sanjiang Plain in Northeast China. High-resolution plant macrofossil and colorimetric humification methods were used to reconstruct the vegetation and hydrologic history from a 193 cm-long sedimentary profile. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) was applied to transform the raw plant macrofossil data into latent indices of peatland water level. The vegetation community transited from an Equisetum fluviatile community to a Carex lasiocarpa community at approximately 3800 cal yr BP and was followed by a Carex-shrub community at approximately 480 cal yr BP. Based on the plant macrofossil DCA axis 1 scores and humification values, we distinguished four hydrologic periods: a wet period from 7800 cal yr BP to 4500 cal yr BP, dry periods up to 1600 cal yr BP, drier periods until 300 cal yr BP, and the driest period from 300 cal yr BP until the present. Through a comparison with other climate records, we suggest that the East Asian summer monsoon (EAM) was the main driving force for vegetation and water level changes to the Shenjiadian peatland through its impacts on precipitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarex lasiocarpa 3aEquisetum fluviatile 3aclimate 3acolorimetry 3acorrespondence analysis 3ahumification 3ahydrology 3amonsoon season 3apeatlands 3aplant communities 3asummer 3avegetation 3aChina1 aZhao, Hongyan1 aWang, Guoping0 tChinese geographical science.g2015 Aug., v. 25, no. 4 p.451-461dScience Pressx1002-00637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-015-0768-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03431naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245017100186300001600357520120500373592002801578650001201606650001001618650002301628650003701651650001001688650001501698650002201713650001901735650003801754650001401792650001501806650001801821650001601839650005801855650002401913650001201937650001801949650006601967650002302033650003802056650002002094650004302114650004802157650003802205650004302243650002802286650005002314650008802364700002802452700002002480700002502500700002102525700002102546700002102567700002202588773011402610856004802724852000902772655001202781IND4474083520221120032058.0121003e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447408352DNAL7 a212794682pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-011-9168-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakamoto, Seiichi10aConstruction, Expression, and Characterization of a Single-Chain Variable Fragment Antibody Against 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid in the Hemolymph of Silkworm Larvae  ap. 715-728.  aA single-chain variable fragment antibody against herbicide, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D-scFv) has been successfully expressed in the hemolymph of silkworm larvae using a rapid Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) bacmid DNA system. Variable heavy- and light-chain domains were cloned directly from the cDNA of the hybridoma cell line 2C4 and assembled together with flexible peptide linker (Gly4Ser)3 between two domains. The yield of functional 2,4-D-scFv after purification was 640 μg per 30 ml of hemolymph, which is equivalent to 21.3 mg per liter of hemolymph. The characterization of 2,4-D-scFv using an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) revealed that it has wide cross-reactivities against 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (65.5%), 2,4-dichlorophenol (47.9%), and 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid (26.0%), making it possible to apply 2,4-D-scFv to icELISA for detecting/determining 2,4-D and its metabolites. Judging from its cost and time requirements and its ease of handling, this BmNPV bacmid DNA expression system is more useful for expressing functional scFv than bacterial systems, which frequently require costly and time-consuming refolding.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4,5-T 3a2,4-D 3a2,4-dichlorophenol 3aBombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus 3aacids 3aantibodies 3acomplementary DNA 3across reaction 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahemolymph 3ahybridomas 3ainsect larvae 3ametabolites 2a2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acidxanalysisximmunology. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBombyxxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxvirology. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aGene Expression 2aGenetic Vectorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHemolymphxchemistryxmetabolismxvirology. 2aHerbicidesxanalysisximmunology. 2aLarvaxgeneticsxmetabolismxvirology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleopolyhedrovirusesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSingle-Chain Antibodiesxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism.1 aPongkitwitoon, Benyakan1 aNakamura, Seiko1 aSasaki-Tabata, Kaori1 aTanizaki, Yusuke1 aMaenaka, Katsumi1 aTanaka, Hiroyuki1 aMorimoto, Satoshi0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2011 July, v. 164, no. 6 p.715-728dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-011-9168-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02004naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012100169300001600290520069500306592002801001650002201029650002501051650001301076650002801089650001001117650002001127650001301147650001201160650001001172650000701182650001901189653001301208653001301221653001801234653001901252653001801271653001401289700001601303700001601319700002401335773009501359856008301454852000901537655001201546IND60479747520221118071348.0160123e20031101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047974752DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.32.2003.4.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasper-Szél, Zs.12aA Comparative Analysis of Hungarian Robinia and Milkweed Honeys Based on Their Chemical and Physical Characteristics  ap. 395-403.  aSugar composition, pH, invertase and diastase activity and colour of 7 robinia (<i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i>) and 8 milkweed (<i>Asclepias syriaca</i>) honey samples were compared, all purchased from producers and wholesalers.

The application of the obtained betulin esters as a tackifier was tested in combination with a semicrystalline ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer in a standard hot-melt adhesive formulation. Three torrefied birch bark products with different glass transition temperatures (23, 45, and 66 °C) showed excellent compatibility with the EVA copolymer in a 1/1 (w/w) mixing ratio. A high Tg tackifier resin (66 °C) was prepared with a rotary tube furnace in a continuous production process at 240 °C. High product yields of about 25% (w/w) could be obtained after solvent extraction of the torrefied bark with acetone. The birch bark tackifying agents change from a stiff, brittle material below Tg to a low viscosity fluid at higher temperatures accompanied by a change of storage and loss modulus over several decades. The Tg of the adhesives could be exactly tailored by the choice of the birch bark tackifier. The resulting adhesives showed excellent lap shear strength on zinc-plated steel and on wood, shifting to values up to 10 MPa with increased Tg of the archaeoinspired adhesives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3aacetone 3aadhesives 3abark 3abetulin 3abrittleness 3aesters 3aethylene-vinyl acetate 3afurnaces 3aglass transition temperature 3aloss modulus 3amixing ratio 3ashear strength 3asolvents 3asteel 3atorrefaction 3awastes 3awood 0aRenewable resources 0aSustainability 0aResource efficiency 0aAdhesive resins1 aWinkeljann, Benjamin1 aLieleg, Oliver1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6874-74561 aZollfrank, Cordt1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2717-41610 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2019 July 03, v. 7, no. 15 p.13157-13166dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b023283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002000094040001800114100001700132245014200149300001600291520191900307592002802226653002302254653001502277653002702292653001302319653001502332653000802347653001402355653002002369653001802389653001702407653002202424700003402446700001602480700002302496700002502519773009802544856006802642852000902710655001202719IND60131219120221117160140.0151127e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013121912DNAL7 a10.1672/132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToet, Sylvia14aTHE effect of hydraulic retention time on the removal of pollutants from sewage treatment plant effluent in a surface-flow wetland system  ap. 375-391.  aWe evaluated the effect of four hydraulic retention times (HRT, 0.3, 0.8, 2.3, and 9.3 days) on pollutant removal in a surface-flow wetland system for polishing tertiary effluent from a sewage treatment plant (STP). The removal efficiency of pollutants at these HRTs was based on mass budgets of the water inputs and outputs in parallel ditches, which together with a presettling basin, made up the wetland system. Fecal coliform and N-removal efficiencies in the ditches were enhanced by increasing the HRT, with only little removal of fecal coliforms during spring-summer at a HRT of 0.3 days. A HRT of 4 days turned out to be required to meet the desired bathing water standard for fecal coliforms (10³ cfu 100 ml⁻⁻¹) and the future standard of ammonium (1 mg N l⁻⁻¹) all year. An annual N-removal efficiency of approximately 45%% can be accomplished in the ditches at this HRT, corresponding to an annual N mass loading rate of 150 g N m⁻⁻² yr⁻⁻¹. Annual P removal was not improved by increasing the HRT even up to 9.3 days, largely because of the still high P mass loading rate (14 g P m⁻⁻² yr⁻⁻¹) in combination with relatively low P input concentrations. Substantial P removal can probably only be achieved at HRTs longer than 15 days, which will not be feasible for the situation investigated because of the large land area that would be required to reach such long HRTs. The future P standard (1 mg P l⁻⁻¹) can therefore only be met by additional chemical P removal. In a densely populated country such as the Netherlands, adequate polishing of tertiary STP effluent in surface-flow wetlands with similar goals as for this wetland is restricted to small and medium-sized STPs. The simultaneous use of these treatment wetlands for other functions, such as nature conservation, recreation, and flood control, however, would permit the use of relatively larger land areas.  aPublisher supplied data 0atreatment wetlands 0awastewater 0ahydraulic loading rate 0anitrogen 0aphosphorus 0aCOD 0aturbidity 0afecal coliforms 0awater budgets 0amass budgets 0aremoval processes1 aVan Logtestijn, Richard S.

Stress imposed on the parents during reproduction could have transgenerational effects on their progeny. Seeds with different origins can vary significantly in their germination and early growth. Here, we investigated how water-deficit and heat stress on parental durum wheat plants affected seedling establishment of the subsequent generation. One stress-tolerant and one stress-sensitive Australian durum genotype were used. Seeds were collected from parents with or without exposure to stress during reproduction. Generally, stress on the previous generation negatively affected seed germination and seedling vigour, but to a lesser extent in the tolerant variety. Small RNA sequencing utilising the new durum genome assembly revealed significant differences in microRNA (miRNA) expression in the two genotypes. A bioinformatics approach was used to identify multiple miRNA targets which have critical molecular functions in stress adaptation and plant development and could therefore contribute to the phenotypic differences observed. Our data provide the first confirmation of the transgenerational effects of reproductive-stage stress on germination and seedling establishment in durum wheat. New insights gained on the epigenetic level indicate that durum miRNAs could be key factors in optimising seed vigour for breeding superior germplasm and/or varieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum 3abioinformatics 3acrop production 3adurum wheat 3aepigenetics 3agenome assembly 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3aheat stress 3amicroRNA 3aparents 3aphenotype 3aplant breeding 3aplant establishment 3aprogeny 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3avigor1 aAble, Amanda  J.1 aAble, Jason  A.0 tPlants.g2020 Feb. 04, v. 9, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants90201893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010200172300001400274520147300288592002801761650001301789650001601802650002501818650001601843650001001859650001401869650001301883650001201896650001301908650001801921650001301939650001101952650001201963650001901975650001601994650001302010650001802023650001002041650001202051650002302063650002502086653001402111653002102125653001502146653001202161700001902173700001602192700002102208700001802229700002202247773010702269856008602376852000902462655001202471IND50067141620221119075912.0190319e20130704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006714162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2013.04.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArena, Miriam E.10aBerberis buxifolia fruit growth and ripening: Evolution in carbohydrate and organic acid contents  ap. 52-58.  aEvolution in the contents of carbohydrates and organic acids of Berberis buxifolia fruits during the growth and ripening in different growing seasons (2004/05, 2005/06 and 2007/08), and their correlations with physicochemical variables are presented. Glucose and fructose contents increased during the fruiting period reaching maximum values between 98 and 126 days from full flower phase (DFFP). Insoluble and soluble dietary fiber contents attained maximum values between 56 and 70 DFFP, to then decrease toward the end of ripening, although soluble dietary fiber during 2005/06 presented a peak later. Citric and malic acid contents increased during the fruiting period being maximum between 56 and 70 DFFP, to then decrease toward the end of ripening, although citric acid content during 2007/08 stayed constant from 70 DFFP. Oxalic and tartaric acid contents were maximal between 42 and 70 DFFP; to then decrease toward the end of the fruiting period. According to the obtained results, B. buxifolia fruits can be considered as fruits rich in carbohydrates. Contents of carbohydrates and organic acids during the fruit growth and ripening varied with the specific compound or group considered, i.e., soluble sugars, fibers or organic acid type and might correlate with features of quality of fruit including weight, firmness and color, soluble solids and total titratable acidity, which are responsible for the astringency, texture, taste and color of the fruits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBerberis 3aastringency 3acarbohydrate content 3acitric acid 3acolor 3aevolution 3afirmness 3aflowers 3afructose 3afruit quality 3afruiting 3afruits 3aglucose 3agrowing season 3aoxalic acid 3aripening 3asoluble fiber 3ataste 3atexture 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 0aPatagonia 0aIndigenous flora 0aBarberries 0aQuality1 aZuleta, Angela1 aDyner, Luis1 aConstenla, Diana1 aCeci, Liliana1 aCurvetto, Néstor0 tScientia horticulturae.g2013 July 04, v. 158 p.52-58dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2013.04.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02251naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003200140245011300172300001800285520087100303592002801174650002101202650001501223650001401238650002301252650001601275650002001291650001701311650001801328650002001346650001601366650001301382650001401395650001101409650001701420650001301437650002101450650001501471650002001486700002201506700002501528700002101553773012401574856007401698852000901772655001201781IND60662751120221120143142.0190906e20140526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066275112DNAL7 a10.1039/c4gc00191e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamos-Fernandez, Enrique V.10aTitania-catalysed oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl lactate: effective yet selective free-radical oxidation  ap. 3358-3363.  aWe research here the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl lactate, as an alternative route to ethyl pyruvate. Testing various solid catalysts (Fe₂O₃, TiO₂, V₂O₅/MgO–Al₂O₃, ZrO₂, CeO₂ and ZnO), we find that simple and inexpensive TiO₂ efficiently catalyses this reaction under mild conditions. Furthermore, molecular oxygen was used as the terminal oxidant. Importantly, this reaction runs well also using inexpensive commercial solvent mixtures. Both the desired reaction and the by-products formation follow a free-radical mechanism. Remarkably, adding activated carbon, a solid radical scavenger, hardly affects the catalytic activity, but enhances the product selectivity. This is because this solid radical scavenger hampers the formation of undesired products in solution, without suppressing the oxidation at the catalyst surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3abyproducts 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aceric oxide 3adehydrogenation 3aferric oxide 3afree radicals 3agreen chemistry 3alactic acid 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apyruvic acid 3asolvents 3atitanium dioxide 3azinc oxide 3azirconium oxide1 aGeels, Norbert J.1 aShiju, N.

Decolorization of the dye Scarlet RR and a dye mixture was studied under in vitro conditions using Glandularia pulchella (Sweet) Tronc., Pseudomonas monteilii ANK and their consortium. Four reactors viz. soil, bacteria, plant and consortium were developed that were subjected for treatment of textile effluents and dye mixture. Under in vitro conditions G. pulchella and P. monteilii showed decolorization of the dye Scarlet RR (SRR) by 97 and 84%, within 72 and 96 h respectively, while their consortium showed 100% decolorization of the dye within 48 h. In case of dye mixture G. pulchella, P. monteilii and consortium-PG showed an ADMI removal of 78, 67 and 92% respectively within 96 h. During decolorization of SRR G. pulchella showed induction in the activities of enzymes lignin peroxidase and DCIP reductase while P. monteilii showed induction of laccase, DCIP reductase and tyrosinase, indicating their involvement in the dye metabolism. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Fourier Transform Infra Red Spectroscopy (FTIR) and High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC) confirmed the biotransformation of SRR and dye mixture into different metabolites. Soil, bacteria, plant and consortium reactors performed an ADMI removal of 42, 46, 62 and 93% in the first decolorization cycle while it showed an average ADMI removal of 21, 27, 59 and 93% in the next three (second, third and fourth) decolorization cycles respectively for the dye mixture within 24 h. Consortium reactor showed an average ADMI removal of 95% within 48 and 60 h for textile effluents A and B respectively for three decolorization cycles, while it showed an average TOC, COD and BOD removal of 74, 70 and 70%, 66, 72 and 67%, and 70, 70 and 66% for three decolorization cycles of the dye mixture (second, third and fourth decolorization cycles), effluent A and effluent B respectively. Degradation of the textile effluents and dye mixture into different metabolites by the consortium reactor was confirmed using HPLC and FTIR. Phytotoxicity studies revealed the non-toxic nature of the metabolites of degradation of dye mixture, effluents A and B by consortium reactor. The developed consortial reactor system performed efficient treatment of the dye mixture and textile effluents, and can be used for treating large amounts of textile effluents when implemented as a constructed wetland by proper engineering approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGlandularia 3aPseudomonas monteilii 3abacteria 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abioreactors 3abiotransformation 3achemical oxygen demand 3aconstructed wetlands 3adecolorization 3aeffluents 3aengineering 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alaccase 3alignin peroxidase 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aphytotoxicity 3aremediation 3asoil 3athin layer chromatography 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aColoring Agentsxmetabolism 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aPseudomonasxmetabolism 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aTextile Industry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolism 0aPhytoremediation 0aDecolorization 0aGlandularia pulchella (Sweet) Tronc. 0aPseudomonas monteilii ANK 0aTextile effluent 0aDye mixture1 aKhandare, Rahul V.1 aGovindwar, Sanjay P.0 tWater research.g2013 Mar. 01, v. 47 p.1035-1048dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2012.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007300170300001800243520126600261536010001527592002801627596010601655650001101761650001301772650001101785650001201796650001901808700002001827700002401847700001901871773013901890856008602029852000902115655001202124IND60595761020221118003438.0200515e20180618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059576102DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2018.14520712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuñoz, David,12aA technique for massive sky view factor calculations in large cities  ap. 4040-4058.  aIn many applications, such as urban physics simulations or the study of the solar impact effects at different scales, complex 3D city models are required to evaluate physical values. In this article, we propose an efficient system for quickly computing the Sky View Factor (SVF) for a massive number of points inside a large city. To do that, we embed the city into a regular grid, and for each cell we select a subset of the geometry consisting of a square area centred in the cell and including it. Then, we remove the selected geometry from the city model and we project the rest onto a panoramic image, called environment map. Later, when several SVF evaluations are required, we only need to determine the cell that each evaluation point belongs to, and compute the SVF with the cell’s geometry plus its corresponding environment map. To test our system, we perform several evaluations inside a cell’s area, and compare the results with an accurate ray-tracing-based SVF evaluation. Our results show the feasibility of the method and its advantages when used for a large set of computations. We show that our tool provides a way to handle the complexity of urban scale models, and specifically allows working with geometry details if they are required.  aThis work was supported by the Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad [TIN2014-52211-C2-2-R].  aPublisher supplied data  aTIN2014-52211-C2-2-RcMinisterio de Economía y Competitividaddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003329 3acities 3ageometry 3amodels 3aphysics 3aremote sensing1 aBeckers, Benoit1 aBesuievsky, Gonzalo1 aPatow, Gustavo0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2018 June 18, v. 39, no. 12 p.4040-4058dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2018.14520713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245008600164520122400250592002801474650001901502650001901521650001401540650000901554650002001563650002301583650001201606650001501618650002001633650001201653651001101665653001501676653001901691653002801710653002001738653001701758700001701775700002101792700002201813773013101835856007801966852000902044655001202053IND60519922820221117070050.0160511e20151217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051992282DNAL7 a10.1515/cass-2015-00242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrettle, Meagan10aDetermining Canadian water utility preparedness for the impacts of climate change  aGeneral warming and extreme weather events associated with climate change are expected to negatively impact water utilities. Water utilities will need to adapt to continue providing safe drinking water and wastewater services. In 2012, the Canadian Water and Wastewater Association (CWWA) conducted a survey of 53 water utility officials to understand the expert perceptions of climate change risks and preparedness of Canadian utilities for current and future impacts. Results indicated that there is low awareness among water utility officials (30%) of thepossible impacts of climate change on water utilities, and more than half have not conducted climate change vulnerability assessments (65%) and do not have operational plans to address climate change impacts (56%). Officials from smaller utilities, which are considered to be more vulnerable to impacts, were of those less aware of these risks and reported taking fewer preparedness activities. Efforts to prepare water utilities for climate change impacts in Canada would benefit from education of utility officials about possible climate change risks, encouraging assessments of vulnerabilities, and increased training with new adaptation tools and resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adrinking water 3aeducation 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asocial environment 3asurveys 3awastewater 3awater utilities 3aweather 3aCanada 0aAdaptation 0aclimate change 0adrinking and wastewater 0awater utilities 0apreparedness1 aBerry, Peter1 aPaterson, Jaclyn1 aYasvinski, Gordon0 tChange and Adaptation in Socio-Ecological Systems.g2015 Dec. 17, v. 2, no. 1dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23147x2300-36697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/cass-2015-00243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002100188245010600209300001100315506007600326520072000402592002801122596003101150596006701181596004101248506003701289650000801326650002001334650001301354650002201367650002001389700002501409700002201434700002001456700001701476700006001493710005401553773010101607856008201708852000901790655001201799IND60634480120221207122609.0220929e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063448012DNAL7 a309021002pmid7 aPMC64310442pmcid7 a10.1186/s13059-019-1662-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLun, Aaron T.

A key computational challenge when processing these data is to distinguish libraries for real cells from empty droplets. Here, we describe a new statistical method for calling cells from droplet-based data, based on detecting significant deviations from the expression profile of the ambient solution. Using simulations, we demonstrate that EmptyDrops has greater power than existing approaches while controlling the false discovery rate among detected cells. Our method also retains distinct cell types that would have been discarded by existing methods in several real data sets.  aPublisher supplied data  aA17197cCancer Research UK  aCore Funding to Wellcome Sanger InstitutecWellcome Trust (GB)  aENLIGHT-TENcH2020 Excellent Science0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3adata collection 3adroplets 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptomics1 aRiesenfeld, Samantha1 aAndrews, Tallulah1 aDao, The Phuong1 aGomes, Tomas1 aMarioni, John C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9092-08522 aparticipants in the 1st Human Cell Atlas Jamboree0 tGenome biology.g2019 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.63-63dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1662-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02231naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245005900203300001800262520110600280592002801386650001601414650003001430650002301460650002201483650001401505650001301519700002201532700006801554700006101622773013301683856008001816852000901896655001201905IND60765881220221117103539.0220204e20211221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076588122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.1c023542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6291-156910aHow Solvation Influences the SN2 versus E2 Competition  ap. 1805-1813.  aWe have quantum chemically investigated how solvation influences the competition between the SN2 and E2 pathways of the model F– + C₂H₅Cl reaction. The system is solvated in a stepwise manner by going from the gas phase, then via microsolvation of one to three explicit solvent molecules, then last to bulk solvation using relativistic density functional theory at (COSMO)-ZORA-OLYP/QZ4P. We explain how and why the mechanistic pathway of the system shifts from E2 in the gas phase to SN2 upon strong solvation of the Lewis base (i.e., nucleophile/protophile). The E2 pathway is preferred under weak solvation of the system by dichloromethane, whereas a switch in reactivity from E2 to SN2 is observed under strong solvation by water. Our activation strain and Kohn–Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal that solvation of the Lewis base has a significant impact on the strength of the Lewis base. We show how strong solvation furnishes a weaker Lewis base that is unable to overcome the high characteristic distortivity associated with the E2 pathway, and thus the SN2 pathway becomes viable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3adensity functional theory 3amethylene chloride 3aorganic chemistry 3asolvation 3asolvents1 aRoozee, Jasper C.1 aBickelhaupt, F.

Twenty-four healthy adults (male n = 12; body weight [BW], 65.8 ± 10.3 kg; female, n = 12; BW, 58.2 ± 10.0 kg) participated in this study. Participants ingested 7.5 g/kg of either ice slurry at -1 °C (ICE) or control fluid at 20 °C (CON) during recovery after cycling at 55% VO₂ₘₐₓ until the rectal temperature reached 38.5 °C or exhaustion in a hot environment (controlled at 38 °C, 40% relative humidity). Rectal (Tre) and skin (Tsk) temperature, ratings of thermal sensation (TS), thermal comfort (TC), heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and whole body sweat loss (WBSL) were measured 60 min after exercise. Ice slurry ingestion reduced Tre and TS and improved post-exercise hypotension only in females (p < 0.05). In comparison, males did not receive cooling effect from post- exercise cooling with ice slurry ingestion. WBSL tended to be lower in ICE than CON in males (ICE, 454.3 ± 172.3 g; CON, 539.7 ± 157.2 g; p = 0.065). In conclusion, sex differences were observed in the effects of post-exercise cooling with ice slurry ingestion.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody temperature 3abody weight 3acooling 3aexercise 3afemales 3aheart rate 3ahypotension 3aice 3aingestion 3amales 3arelative humidity 3asensation 3aslurries 3asweat 0aSex differences 0aIce slurry 0aPost-exercise cooling 0aThermoregulation 0aICE 0aCON 0aTre 0aTsk 0aΔTre 0aΔTre / min 0aHS 0aTS 0aTC 0aMAP 0aWBSL 0aUSG1 aKawamura, Takuji1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2110-87181 aHosokawa, Yuri1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9138-53611 aChang, Lili1 aSuzuki, Katsuhiko1 aMuraoka, Isao0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2021 July, v. 99 p.102979-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.1029793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02166naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245012200163300001400285520090100299592002801200650002601228650001401254650001201268650001401280650000901294650002601303650002001329650003301349650001901382653003001401653002601431653003301457653002201490653002001512700002701532700002101559773008901580856007801669852000901747655001201756IND60128220920221119005714.0151115e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012822092DNAL7 a10.3105/018.029.01052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahoo, Gunanidhi10aChemical Composition and Ultrastructure of Shells of Unfertilized Eggs of Olive Ridley Turtles, Lepidochelys olivacea  ap. 37-43.  aUnfertilized eggs of Lepidochelys olivacea were examined for elemental composition and structure of the eggshell and mineral contents of the yolk-albumen fraction. Calcium was the major inorganic component both in the eggshell and egg contents. Other elements were present in traces. Scanning electron microscopic study revealed that the eggshell had two layers: an outer calcareous matrix in its aragonite morph and a membrane layer with fibres. The calcareous layer was made up of loosely and irregularly arranged 10––40 µµm wide nodular shell units. The shell thickness was 125 to 150 µµm. The membrane fibres were less dense, less netted than their normal counterparts and of variable thickness. The composition and structure of unfertilized eggshell were more or less similar to those reported for their normal counterparts except for the arrangement of fibres in the membrane layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepidochelys olivacea 3aaragonite 3acalcium 3aegg shell 3aeggs 3aelemental composition 3amineral content 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aultrastructure 0aeggshell mineral contents 0ayolk-albumen fraction 0aScanning electron microscopy 0acalcareous matrix 0amembrane fibres1 aMohapatra, Birendra K.1 aDutta, Sushil K.0 tCurrent herpetology.g2010 June, v. 29, no. 1 p.37-43dUniBio Pressx1881-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3105%2F018.029.01053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008000167300001400247520162300261592002801884650001901912650001701931650002001948650002501968650001101993650001002004650001202014650001102026650000902037650002102046650001302067650001602080650001702096650001402113650001302127651001402140700001902154700002302173773011902196856008102315852000902396655001202405IND60119983320221118013417.0150117e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011998332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10806-014-9519-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD’Cruze, Neil14aThe Cayman Turtle Farm: Why We Can’t Have Our Green Turtle and Eat it Too  ap. 57-66.  aThe Cayman Turtle Farm (CTF) is the only facility in the world that commercially produces green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) for human consumption. The CTF has operated at a significant financial loss for much of its 45 years history and is maintained by substantial Cayman Island Government subsidies. These subsidies run into millions of Caymanian dollars and dwarf the funding allocated to The Caymanian Department of Environment to protect its unique biodiversity each year. We argue that it is time for the CTF to terminate its sea turtle ‘farming’ initiative. Supporters argue that the CTF helps to conserve green turtles by providing legal and sustainable turtle meat for local Caymanian consumption. Opponents maintain that farmed turtle meat cannot serve as an effective economically viable substitute, and that the facility potentially harms Caribbean green turtle populations by promoting turtle meat consumption, when other Caribbean nations increasingly prohibit this practice. The CTF’s records demonstrate that commercial production has come at the expense of tens of thousands of sea turtles. We question the ethics of sea turtle farming and argue that the CTF could better contribute to conservation if it transitioned into a rehabilitation, research and education facility (similar to the former sea turtle ranch Ferme Corail, now known as the Kélonia: Observatory of Marine Turtles). Recommended first steps include prohibiting the sale of sea turtle products to international tourists, engaging with stakeholders, and assessing the true scale of local consumer demand for green turtle meat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChelonia mydas 3abiodiversity 3aconsumer demand 3aeducational research 3aethics 3afarms 3afunding 3ahumans 3ameat 3ameat consumption 3aranching 3asea turtles 3astakeholders 3asubsidies 3atourists 3aCaribbean1 aAlcock, Rachel1 aDonnelly, Marydele0 tJournal of agricultural & environmental ethics.g2015 Feb., v. 28, no. 1 p.57-66dSpringer-Verlagx1187-78637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10806-014-9519-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03485naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010800167520213100275592002802406650001702434650002502451650001302476650001302489650001102502650001702513651001002530653002202540653002302562653002702585653004002612653004302652653004102695700001302736700002202749700001402771700001402785700001102799700001802810700001502828773010102843856008602944852000903030655001203039IND60754679320221116175315.0211206e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075467932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1082942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Wenbin10aConstructing and optimizing ecological network at county and town Scale: The case of Anji County, China  aRapid urbanization has led to increasingly fragmented urban habitat patches, and the biodiversity within these patches and in their surrounding areas is severely threatened. This ecological problem is spreading from cities to counties dominated by villages and towns, and is especially prevalent in economically developed areas. Constructing a reasonable ecological network is an effective way to balance the contradiction between regional development and ecological protection. Taking Anji County of the Zhejiang Province, China as an example, this study first identified ecological sources based on morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and connectivity analysis, and then extracted and constructed ecological networks by using a minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model and network analysis. Finally, the results were optimized by adding additional ecological sources and setting stepping stones. The priority of the corridor is determined by the gravity model, and the analysis of the ecological networks in this study drills down to the town scale. The results show that the initially constructed ecological network includes 10 ecological sources and 22 ecological corridors, of which six are important ecological corridors that need priority construction. However, the ecological networks were less distributed in the central and northern regions, so four supplementary ecological sources and two stepping stones were added to optimize the ecological network. The connectivity of the optimized ecological network improved, and the values of α (the closure), β (line-point rate) and γ (network connectivity) increased by 4.6%, 10.45% and 2.18%, respectively. In addition, there were obvious differences in the area and land use types of ecological networks among towns, so it is necessary to formulate targeted construction strategies. Through an in-depth analysis from county to town, this study makes the construction and management of ecological networks more operable for country administration, and provides reference for the balance of ecological protection and regional development at the county level.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aenvironmental impact 3ahabitats 3aland use 3amodels 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aHigh urbanization 0aEcological network 0aCounty and town scales 0aMinimum cumulative resistance model 0aMorphological spatial pattern analysis 0aSpatial principal component analysis1 aShi, Yan1 aSiaw, Martin John1 aYang, Fan1 aWu, Renwu1 aWu, Xu1 aZheng, Xueyan1 aBao, Zhiyi0 tEcological indicators.g2021 Dec., v. 132 p.108294-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1082943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03673naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245013000175300001800305520176300323592002802086650002202114650003702136650002502173650002102198650001502219650001302234650003002247650002602277650001002303650001602313650002102329650001702350650001602367650003002383650001602413650001102429650000902440650001802449650001202467650002702479650001902506650003102525650001302556650000902569650001902578700001902597700001502616700001502631700001702646700002002663700001302683700001602696700001402712700001802726700002002744700001802764700001802782700001402800773008602814856009002900852000902990655001202999IND60090505720221117160944.0141102e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009050572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhongyang10aLactoferrin-modified PEG-co-PCL nanoparticles for enhanced brain delivery of NAP peptide following intranasal administration  ap. 3870-3881.  aDevelopment of effective non-invasive drug delivery systems is of great importance to the treatment of Alzheimer's diseases and has made great progress in recent years. In this work, lactoferrin (Lf), a natural iron binding protein, whose receptor is highly expressed in both respiratory epithelial cells and neurons is here utilized to facilitate the nose-to-brain drug delivery of neuroprotection peptides. The Lf-conjugated PEG-PCL nanoparticle (Lf-NP) was constructed via a maleimide-thiol reaction with the Lf conjugation confirmed by CBQCA Protein Quantitation and XPS analysis. Other important parameters such as particle size distribution, zeta potential and in vitro release of fluorescent probes were also characterized. Compared with unmodified nanoparticles (NP), Lf-NP exhibited a significantly enhanced cellular accumulation in 16HBE14o-cells through both caveolae-/clathrin-mediated endocytosis and direct translocation. Following intranasal administration, Lf-NP facilitated the brain distribution of the coumarin-6 incorporated with the AUC₀–₈ₕ in rat cerebrum (with hippocampus removed), cerebellum, olfactory tract, olfactory bulb and hippocampus 1.36, 1.53, 1.70, 1.57 and 1.23 times higher than that of coumarin-6 carried by NP, respectively. Using a neuroprotective peptide – NAPVSIPQ (NAP) as the model drug, the neuroprotective and memory improvement effect of Lf-NP was observed even at lower dose than that of NP in a Morris water maze experiment, which was also confirmed by the evaluation of acetylcholinesterase, choline acetyltransferase activity and neuronal degeneration in the mice hippocampus. In conclusion, Lf-NP may serve as a promising nose-to-brain drug delivery carrier especially for peptides and proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aacetylcholinesterase 3abinding proteins 3acerebellum 3acerebrum 3acholine acetyltransferase 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aendocytosis 3aepithelial cells 3afluorescence 3ahippocampus 3aintranasal administration 3alactoferrin 3amemory 3amice 3ananoparticles 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3aolfactory bulb 3aparticle size distribution 3apeptides 3arats 3azeta potential1 aJiang, Mengyin1 aKang, Ting1 aMiao, Deyu1 aGu, Guangzhi1 aSong, Qingxiang1 aYao, Lei1 aHu, Quanyin1 aTu, Yifan1 aPang, Zhiqing1 aChen, Hongzhuan1 aJiang, Xinguo1 aGao, Xiaoling1 aChen, Jun0 tBiomaterials.g2013 May, v. 34, no. 15 p.3870-3881dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02149naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245010000170506002800270520120100298592002801499506003701527650001201564650000901576650001401585650001701599700002401616700001801640773009601658856008401754852000901838655001201847IND60753580820221207115453.0211005s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075358082DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202136010242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovokhatan, V.V.10aCombining ability of early-maturing varieties of soft spring wheat by grain weight from the ear  aResource is Open Access  aWith the participation of early-maturing varieties, a topcross scheme of crossings was performed (10×4); maternal varieties: Pamyati Azieva, Altayskaya 92, Obskaya 14, SURENTa-6, Adeline, SURENTa-3, Voronezhskaya 12, Tyumenskaya rannyaya, Tulun 15, Tyumenskaya 27; testers - Iren, Novosibirskaya 15, Latona, Tulunskaya 12.

There is in many countries a diverse market for animal welfare-friendly products which is potentially confusing and may lack transparency. We ask whether special quality labels that involve medium levels of animal welfare, as compared with labels promoting premium levels of animal welfare, have a role to play in promoting improvements in animal welfare. The Danish pork market is our reference case, but we also widen the context by comparing the markets for pork in three other European countries. Our findings suggest that in order to improve animal welfare through demand for welfare-friendly products it is important to maintain separate the market for products with strong animal welfare profiles from markets for products with medium levels of animal welfare where, often, animal welfare is bundled together with other food quality attributes. We conclude that such quality labels may indeed play an important role in promoting higher animal welfare standards provided that they offer real improvements in animal welfare as compared with standard products. They will be attractive to consumers with a positive, but not especially strong interest in animal welfare as an individual food attribute who would otherwise be inclined to purchase standard products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3aethics 3afood quality 3alivestock 3amarkets 3apork 3apurchasing 3aEurope1 aMørkbak, Morten Raun1 aDenver, Sigrid1 aSandøe, Peter1 aChristensen, Tove0 tJournal of agricultural & environmental ethics.g2015 Feb., v. 28, no. 1 p.67-84dSpringer-Verlagx1187-78637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10806-014-9521-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245007100159300001400230520135800244592002801602650001501630650001901645650001301664650002001677650001101697650002001708650001801728650002101746650001901767650002401786650001501810650001901825650001901844650002001863650001901883650001101902650002501913651001301938653002501951653002401976653002002000653002102020653001402041700001602055700001602071700001302087700001502100700001502115700001602130700001502146773010802161856007902269852000902348655001202357IND60519923120160819000000.0160511e20160305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051992312DNAL7 a10.1515/cerce-2015-00482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, A.10aWater Efficient Cropping Systems for Semi-Arid Regions in Pakistan  ap. 13-20.  aWater scarcity and land degradation are emerging threats to global food production. The dry land regions of world are affected by climate change to a greater extent and facing food insecurity. The current pattern of food production has been estimated to be inadequate to meet demands of growing population and required around 38% increase to meet world`s food demands by 2025. Food insecurity in erosion hit dry land regions of Pakistan also demands development of resource-efficient cropping systems to meet the food needs of population growing. The research studies involved different cropping patterns such as fallow-wheat, mungbean-wheat, sorghum-wheat, fallow-lentil, mungbean-lentil, sorghum-lentil, fallow-barley, mungbean-barley and sorghum-barley. The organic amendments involved farmyard manure, NPK, poultry manure, compost and inoculation by phosphorus solubilizing microbes. The effect of cropping systems and soil amendments were evaluated at field scale in terms of water use efficiency measured in terms of economic terms. The results of the studies revealed that double cropping (mungbean-lentil and mungbean-barley) was feasible option in the dryland regions of Pakistan if integrated with the use of poultry manure as alternate environmental-friendly strategy to cut down the use of mineral fertilizers and eliminate summer fallowing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3aclimate change 3acomposts 3adouble cropping 3afallow 3afood production 3afood security 3aland degradation 3amicroorganisms 3amineral fertilizers 3aphosphorus 3apoultry manure 3asemiarid zones 3asoil amendments 3asolubilization 3asummer 3awater use efficiency 3aPakistan 0aWater use efficiency 0aMineral fertilizers 0aSoil amendments 0aCropping systems 0aDry lands1 aAhmed, Z.I.1 aShehzad, M.1 aAziz, I.1 aKhan, K.S.1 aShoaib, M.1 aMehmood, T.1 aMubeen, K.0 tCercetări agronomice în Moldova.g2016 Mar. 5, v. 48, no. 4 p.13-20dDe Gruyter Openx2067-18657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/cerce-2015-00483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02530naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002000094040001800114100002000132245010600152300001600258520165200274592002801926653001701954653001401971653001501985653002502000653001702025700002302042773009802065856006802163852000902231655001202240IND60131219920221121170321.0151127e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013121992DNAL7 a10.1672/202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhiles, Matt R.10aMacroinvertebrate communities in central platte river wetlands: patterns across a hydrologic gradient  ap. 462-472.  aWetlands provide critical wildlife habitat in the central Platte River basin of Nebraska, USA, but little is known about their macroinvertebrate communities or how factors such as hydrology affect them. In 1997, we quantified macroinvertebrate abundance, biomass, and community structure and organic matter resources in four natural wetlands that represented a gradient from ephemeral to permanent flooding. All four wetlands had abundant macroinvertebrate communities when flooded, and we observed unique taxa at all sites. Mean annual macroinvertebrate abundance and biomass increased with hydroperiod length, but taxon richness and diversity were greatest in intermittent sites. Non-insect groups, mostly crustaceans, annelids, and mollusks, were important at all sites, and their taxonomic composition shifted across the hydrologic gradient. Insect communities were dominated by dipterans (mostly Chironomidae and Ceratopogonidae) and Coleopterans (mostly Hydrophilidae and Dytiscidae), and these also varied across the hydrologic gradient. Collector-gatherers, scrapers, and predators were the dominant functional groups in terms of biomass, and biomass was most evenly distributed among these groups in intermittent sites. Macroinvertebrate communities in these riparian wetlands vary across natural hydrologic gradients, and diversity peaks in intermittent sites. Patterns of abundance, biomass, and diversity, along with seasonal patterns, suggest that, at a landscape level, a diversity of wetland habitats with different hydrologic regimes will maximize abundance and diversity of freshwater macroinvertebrate communities in this region.  aPublisher supplied data 0aintermittent 0abackwater 0afloodplain 0aaquatic invertebrate 0aPlatte River1 aGoldowitz, Beth S.0 tWetlands.g2005 June, v. 25, no. 2 p.462-472dSociety of Wetlands Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245014100165500001900306500002000325520102900345592002801374650002401402650001001426650001701436650001201453650000901465650002001474650001601494650001701510650001101527650002301538650002201561650002601583650001501609650001001624650001101634650001601645700002401661700002201685700005801707700005801765700002001823700006001843773012601903856007302029852000902102655001202111IND60722268720221117160808.0201230e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072226872DNAL7 a10.1111/asj.134592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhongpradit, Anchalee10aEffect of pineapple stem starch feeding on rumen microbial fermentation, blood lipid profile, and growth performance of fattening cattle  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPineapple stem starch (PS) was evaluated for its suitability as a new starch source in concentrate for fattening cattle, based on the growth performance, blood profile, and rumen parameters of 36 steers in a 206‐day feeding study. PS was formulated as a 40% concentrate and fed with forage in comparison with ground corn (GC) and ground cassava (CA) formulated at the same level. PS feeding improved weight gain and feed conversion ratio without affecting feed intake. PS did not obviously influence blood lipid profiles throughout the experiment. Ruminal concentration of total short‐chain fatty acids (SCFA) increased with PS without affecting SCFA composition throughout the feeding study. Rumen amylolytic group, especially Ruminococcus bromii, was dominant in the rumen microbial community, and showed increased abundance by PS feeding throughout the experiment. These results clearly indicate the potential of PS as a useful starch source for fattening cattle in terms of rumen fermentation and growth performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRuminococcus bromii 3ablood 3ablood lipids 3acassava 3acorn 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afermentation 3aforage 3agrowth performance 3alipid composition 3amicrobial communities 3apineapples 3arumen 3astarch 3aweight gain1 aBoonsaen, Phoompong1 aHomwong, Nitipong1 aSuzuki, Yutaka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0768-25481 aKoike, Satoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8742-72471 aSawanon, Suriya1 aKobayashi, Yasuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2001-88840 tAnimal science journal =.g2020 Jan., v. 91, no. 1 p.e13459-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867063x1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asj.134593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006000152245010400212520191200316592002802228650001702256650001502273650002102288650001102309650001002320650001202330650001302342650001402355650002102369650001702390650002402407653001202431653002202443653002202465653002002487653001502507653002102522653002002543700002002563700002002583700005702603700001702660700002102677773010602698856008702804852000902891655001202900IND60735714620221118182809.0210904e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073571462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.1029822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGillis, D.

The purpose of this experiment was to explore whether different body surface areas (BSA) exposed to menthol influence these responses. It was hypothesized that the forcing function exerted by menthol will be proportionally related to BSA.Using a within-participant design, 13 participants underwent three BSA exposures (Small [S; finger]; Medium [M; arm]; Large [L; upper/lower body]) to 4.13% menthol, and one Placebo exposure. During each exposure participants rested supine in a tent (30 °C, 50%rh) for 30-min before their intervention and 30-min thereafter. Measures included thermal sensation, thermal comfort, irritation, skin blood flow (finger SkBF; laser Doppler flowmetry), rectal temperature (Tre), and skin temperature (chest, forearm, thigh, calf). The Area Under the Curve from minute 30 to 60 was calculated and analyzed using a one-way ANOVA or Friedman's test with post-hoc testing (0.05 alpha level).There was no significant difference in any measure of thermometry (p > 0.05), while SKBF was significantly lowered in L, M, and S vs. P respectively (p < 0.05). Participants in L felt cooler vs. P and S (p < 0.05). Losses in thermal comfort were noted in L and M vs. P and S (p < 0.05), along with increased irritation in L vs. S (p < 0.05).Despite similar skin temperatures, larger BSA's exposed to menthol caused cooler sensations, likely due to the activation of a larger pool of menthol-sensitive neurons. This occurred in the absence of thermal discomfort and without perceptions of irritation exceeding ‘weak’. Larger BSA's also exhibited greater alterations in Tre, likely driven by a reduction in SkBF, but despite this mean body temperature was regulated suggesting the thermoregulatory system can cope with the range of BSA exposures studied herein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarms (limbs) 3ablood flow 3abody temperature 3acalves 3achest 3amenthol 3aplacebos 3asensation 3askin temperature 3asurface area 3atopical application 0aMenthol 0aBody surface area 0aThermal sensation 0aThermal comfort 0aIrritation 0aThermoregulation 0aSkin blood flow1 aMoriarty, Jacob1 aDouglas, Nakiya1 aEly, Brett R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8062-44751 aSilva, Kevin1 aGallo, Joseph A.0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2021 July, v. 99 p.102982-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.1029823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03775naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245011900163300001600282520180200298592002802100650002602128650003002154650001802184650001102202650001802213650000802231650001702239650001602256650000902272650001902281650001102300650001402311650002302325650001302348650002202361650002802383650001902411650001302430650001302443650002102456650001002477650001402487650002002501650003002521650001602551651001002567653001802577653002602595653003002621653001802651653002602669653001502695700002102710700001802731700001902749700001602768700001902784700001702803700001802820700001802838773012802856856008402984852000903068655001203077IND60543633720221118052454.0190411e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054363372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2014.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Kai10aBioactivity of essential oil of Litsea cubeba from China and its main compounds against two stored product insects  ap. 459-466.  aDuring our screening program for agrochemicals from Chinese medicinal herbs and wild plants, the essential oil of Litsea cubeba fruits was found to possess strong contact toxicity against the cigarette beetle Lasioderma serricorne adults and the booklouse Liposcelis bostrychophila, with LD50 values of 27.33μg/adult and 71.56μg/cm2, respectively, and also showed strong fumigant toxicity against the two stored product insects with LC50 values of 22.97 and 0.73mg/L, respectively. The essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation was investigated by GC MS. The main components of the essential oil were identified to be E-citral (geranial) (27.49%), Z-citral (neral) (23.57%) and d-limonene (18.82%) followed by β-thujene (3.34%), β-pinene (2.85%), α-pinene (2.57%), 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (2.40%) and linalool (2.36%). Citral (Z/E-citral), d-limonene, β-pinene, α-pinene and linalool were separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography and preparative thin layer chromatography, and further identified by means of physicochemical and spectrometric analysis. Citral and linalool showed strong contact toxicity against L. serricorne and L. bostrychophila (LD50=11.76, 12.74μg/adult and 20.15, 99.97μg/cm2, respectively) and fumigant toxicity against L. serricorne and L. bostrychophila (16.54, 18.04mg/L air and 0.14, 0.71mg/L air, respectively). Otherwise, citral, d-limonene and linalool were strongly repellent against the cigarette beetle L. serricorne as the essential oil whereas β-pinene and α-pinene exhibited weaker repellency against the cigarette beetle compared with the positive control, DEET. Moreover, except α-pinene and linalool, the other three compounds as well as the essential oil exhibited comparable repellency against the booklouse relative to DEET.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLasioderma serricorne 3aLiposcelis bostrychophila 3aLitsea cubeba 3aadults 3aagrochemicals 3aair 3aalpha-pinene 3abeta-pinene 3adeet 3aessential oils 3afruits 3afumigants 3agel chromatography 3ageranial 3ahydrodistillation 3alethal concentration 50 3alethal dose 50 3alimonene 3alinalool 3amedicinal plants 3aneral 3ascreening 3astorage insects 3athin layer chromatography 3awild plants 3aChina 0aLitsea cubeba 0aLasioderma serricorne 0aLiposcelis bostrychophila 0aEssential oil 0aInsecticidal activity 0aRepellency1 aWang, Cheng Fang1 aYou, Chun Xue1 aGeng, Zhu Feng1 aSun, Rui Qi1 aGuo, Shan Shan1 aDu, Shu Shan1 aLiu, Zhi Long1 aDeng, Zhi Wei0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2014 Sept., v. 17, no. 3 p.459-466dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2014.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012900165520164000294592002801934650002501962650002101987650002302008650001902031650002202050650001302072650001102085651001002096653003202106653003002138653000802168653002502176700001502201700001202216700001802228700001302246773010102259856008602360852000902446655001202455IND60754679520221116175314.0211206e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075467952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1082962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Xu14aThe effects of land transfer marketization on the urban land use efficiency: An empirical study based on 285 cities in China  aThe market-oriented allocation reform of urban land resources has become an important component of economic system reform in China, while its objective impact on land use efficiency still remains uncertain and needs to be revealed somehow. Based on the panel data of 285 cities in China from 2003 to 2015, this study uses the DEA method to measure the urban land use efficiency firstly, and then the spatial Durbin model is adopted to examine the spatial effects of land transfer marketization on urban land use efficiency in China. The results show that land transfer marketization can significantly improve urban land use efficiency of the local region at 0.16% on the one hand, while on the other hand it has an inhibitory effect on urban land use efficiency of the spatial related regions at a relatively higher level of 0.17%. Besides, there exists club convergence of the urban land use efficiency of sample cities in China. As for other variables affecting the urban land use efficiency spatially, economic development level, industrial structure and population scale have a significantly promoting effect at the level of 0.1263, 0.1667 and 0.1735 respectively, while infrastructure level and opening degree may have an inhibitory effect because of their irreconcilable stages, though most of them failed the significance test. On the basis of these theoretical and empirical analyses, some policy recommendations such as adhering to the market-oriented land transfer policy, strengthening the communication and coordination mechanism between regions are provided to policymakers in order to make the most use of land resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic development 3aeconomic systems 3aempirical research 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3amodels 3aChina 0aLand transfer marketization 0aUrban land use efficiency 0aDEA 0aSpatial Durbin model1 aLu, Xinhai1 aLiu, Qi1 aZhang, Zheng,1 aQu, Lulu0 tEcological indicators.g2021 Dec., v. 132 p.108296-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1082963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245014100171300001600312500001500328520101600343592002801359650002201387650001701409650001601426650002001442650002601462650002101488650002401509650003901533650001601572650001101588650001601599650002301615650001001638650001201648650001501660650000701675650002301682650002001705650001801725650001801743653003501761653001801796653001801814653002501832653002001857700001501877700001601892700001301908700001901921700002301940773013501963856008702098852000902185655001202194IND60629733720221121064530.0190326e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062973372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.01.1622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yu-chuan10aHigh-level expression of a novel α-amylase from Thermomyces dupontii in Pichia pastoris and its application in maltose syrup production  ap. 683-692.  a2019-12-06  aA novel α-amylase gene (TdAmyA) with an open reading frame of 1431 bp, deducing 476 amino acids, was cloned from the thermophilic fungus Thermomyces dupontii L18. The recombinant α-amylase was successfully over-expressed in Pichia pastoris. The highest α-amylase activity of 38,314 U/mL was obtained with protein content of 28.7 mg/mL after 168 h high-cell density fermentation. Molecular mass of purified TdAmyA was 61.2 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 59.2 kDa by gel filtration. TdAmyA was a glycoprotein with 5.3% (w/w) of carbohydrate. TdAmyA exhibited maximal activity at 60 °C and pH 6.5, and was thermostable up to 55 °C within pH 4.5–10.0. It was more active towards linear starchy substrates than branched ones. The hydrolysis products were mainly comprised of maltose and maltotriose. TdAmyA produced the highest maltose content of 51.8% after 8 h hydrolysis. Thus, TdAmyA might be a candidate α-amylase for maltose syrup production.  aPublisher supplied data 3athermal stability 3afermentation 3amaltotriose 3aprotein content 3aKomagataella pastoris 3amolecular weight 3aopen reading frames 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aThermomyces 3asyrups 3aamino acids 3agel chromatography 3agenes 3amaltose 3ahydrolysis 3apH 3athermophilic fungi 3aenzyme activity 3aalpha-amylase 3aglycoproteins 0aHigh-cell density fermentation 0aAlpha-amylase 0aMaltose syrup 0aThermomyces dupontii 0aPichia pastoris1 aZhao, Ning1 aMa, Jun-wen1 aLiu, Jun1 aYan, Qiao-juan1 aJiang, Zheng-qiang0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 127 p.683-692dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.01.1623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03772naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245005500165520188700220592002802107650001602135650002202151650001002173650002002183650002602203650001702229650002802246651001102274653001902285653002902304653003102333653002102364653002602385700002002411700001602431700002302447700002102470700002102491700002102512700002602533700002102559700001902580700002102599700002202620700002302642700002302665700002202688700002102710700002202731700001702753700002002770700002102790700002502811700002102836700002702857700002202884700002102906773010302927856008303030852000903113655001203122IND60735714720221118183113.0211106e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073571472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2021.1031452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJouan, Julia10aSEGAE: An online serious game to learn agroecology  aThere is growing evidence that agroecology can reconcile the environmental, economic, and social pillars of agricultural sustainability. However, teaching and learning agroecology is challenging, especially since most agricultural graduate programs in Europe are not adapted to teach the diversity of its related practices.To improve agroecology learning, we built the online simulation game SEGAE. This article illustrates the game's relevance for learning agroecology.The game is based on a modeling framework that gamifies the implementation of agroecological practices in an integrated crop-livestock farm and assesses their impacts on sustainability. To do so, SEGAE is based on an output-oriented approach that represents impacts of practices on various indicators. These impacts are included in a matrix, which is associated with a dynamic graphical interface accessible to players. Two examples of game sessions were developed to illustrate the game's potential.In the first example, players can gain knowledge about agroecological practices by implementing practices that improve soil quality and assessing their impacts on sustainability. Results of this example place the farm's improved overall sustainability into perspective with its reduced food production potential. In the second example, players can improve their skills in transition management and acquire a systems approach by converting the farm to organic farming within five years. Results of this example prompt discussion of the steps needed to obtain organic certification and the coherence between crop and animal production needed to foster sustainability.SEGAE was designed to strengthen European training in agroecology, and active contributions from users would help to improve this tool, extend it to new farming systems and forge connections within the community of teachers working on agroecology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecology 3aanimal production 3afarms 3afood production 3aorganic certification 3asoil quality 3asustainable agriculture 3aEurope 0aSustainability 0aAgroecological practices 0aCrop-livestock integration 0aSystems approach 0aTransition management1 aCarof, Matthieu1 aBaccar, Rim1 aBareille, Nathalie1 aBastian, Suzanne1 aBrogna, Delphine1 aBurgio, Giovanni1 aCouvreur, Sébastien,1 aCupiał, Michał1 aDufrêne, Marc1 aDumont, Benjamin1 aGontier, Philippe1 aJacquot, Anne-Lise1 aKański, Jarosław1 aMagagnoli, Serena1 aMakulska, Joanna1 aPérès, Guénola1 aRidier, Aude1 aSalou, Thibault1 aSgolastra, Fabio1 aSzeląg-Sikora, Anna1 aTabor, Sylwester1 aTombarkiewicz, Barbara1 aWęglarz, Andrzej1 aGodinot, Olivier0 tAgricultural systems.g2021 June, v. 191 p.103145-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2021.1031453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100001700197245010100214300001800315506007600333520156400409592002801973506003702001650002502038650001802063650001002081650001802091650000902109650001502118650001302133650001302146650002202159650005202181650001802233700002302251700002202274700002602296700002602322700002202348773008602370856009002456852000902546655001202555IND60090505920221207053125.0141102e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009050592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.02.0162doi7 aPMC36256472pmcid7 a234530582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobsa, Serge13aAn electrospun scaffold integrating nucleic acid delivery for treatment of full-thickness wounds  ap. 3891-3901.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe developed a multi-functional construct capable of controlled delivery of bioactive substances that can improve wound repair by supporting the intrinsic ability of the skin to heal. We synthesized electrospun scaffolds—composed of a blend of the degradable polymers poly(l-lactide) (PLA) or polycaprolactone (PCL)—that produce highly efficient non-viral in vivo gene delivery to cells in the wound bed, provide a protective barrier during early wound healing, and support cell migration and growth. This multi-functional material was tested for its influence on wound healing: scaffolds were loaded with plasmids encoding keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and applied to full-thickness wounds in mice. Compared to scaffolds with control plasmids, animals receiving the KGF plasmid-loaded scaffold produced significant enhancements in wound healing, which was quantified by improvements in the rate of wound re-epithelialization, keratinocyte proliferation, and granulation response. Further, we quantified the expression level of endogenous and plasmid-derived KGF in wound samples: qRT-PCR on wound sections revealed a correlation between the levels of plasmid-derived protein expression and histological analysis of wound healing, revealing an inverse relationship between the expression level of exogenous KGF and the size of the unhealed epithelial layer in wounds. Our findings suggest that engineered nanofiber PLA/PCL scaffolds are capable of highly efficient controlled DNA delivery and are promising materials for treatment of cutaneous wounds.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioactive properties 3acell movement 3agenes 3akeratinocytes 3amice 3ananofibers 3aplasmids 3apolymers 3aprotein synthesis 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atissue repair1 aKristofik, Nina J.1 aSawyer, Andrew J.1 aBothwell, Alfred L.M.1 aKyriakides, Themis R.1 aSaltzman, W.

Experimental results have shown that pasture–herd interaction management could improve native grasslands and animal productivity.This paper analyzes the extent to which the sustainability of family-run livestock farms based on native grasslands could be enhanced by a systemic redesign informed by ecological intensification practices. The research questions address the initial state of farm sustainability, key bottlenecks to improving farm sustainability, and changes in sustainability criteria achieved over three years of farm redesign.The study was executed as part of a multi-level co-innovation project in Uruguay in which a team of scientist-practitioners and seven farm families participated in farm characterization, diagnosis, and redesign. The farm characterization took the form of indicators to describe the farms' management and bio-physical subsystems. Redesign plans were negotiated between the research team and the farmers. Frequent monitoring and evaluation cycles enabled finetuning across the years of implementation.Improvements were observed in the economic indicators gross margin (+55%), return to labor (+71%), and family income (+53%) and in the social indicator workload (−22%), and the environmental indicators bird diversity and ecosystem integrity index were maintained or increased slightly. These changes were explained by the uptake of coherent sets of ecological intensification practices causing changes in forage height (+30%), forage allowance (+69%), pregnancy (+22), weight of weaning calf per mating cow (+32%), and presence of tussocks (+65%). Ecological intensification principles resulted in synergistic positive effects between productivity–biodiversity tradeoffs and the scope for enhanced farm resilience and stability.Cow-calf family-run farms can be transformed to produce positive environmental and social effects and viable economic results. The implementation of projects in a co-innovation context may be taken as a guide to scaling up and scaling out the ecological intensification of livestock production on native grasslands, contributing to an extension system at the national level with the aim of improving cow-calf systems sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3acalves 3acows 3aecosystems 3afarms 3aforage 3ahousehold income 3apregnancy 3aprofits and margins 3asocial factors 3asocial sustainability 3aUruguay 0aPasture–herd interactions 0aNative grasslands 0aSystems thinking 0aMonitoring and evaluation 0aParticipatory approach 0aReflexivity1 aDogliotti, S.1 aAguerre, V.1 aAlbicette, M.M.1 aAlbin, A.1 aBlumetto, O.1 aCardozo, G.1 aLeoni, C.1 aQuintans, G.1 aScarlato, S.1 aTittonell, P.1 aRossing, W.A.H.0 tAgricultural systems.g2021 June, v. 191 p.103148-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2021.1031483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01506naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245005500159300001800214520043400232592002800666650001400694650001400708650001900722650002600741650001000767650001400777650001900791650001500810700001700825700001600842700001500858700001700873700001400890773014400904856007501048852000901123655001201132IND60795036020221120221029.0220929e20220928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079503602DNAL7 a10.1039/d2tb00938b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hongyue10aBiosafety evaluation of dual-responsive neutrobots  ap. 7556-7562.  aThe toxicity effects of paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded magnetic neutrophil-hybrid swimming microrobots (“neutrobots”) in vivo were assessed after intravenous administration to mice.

The taxonomic position of the novel strain was determined using a polyphasic approach. Strain BR-18T grew optimally at 25 °C, at pH 6.5–7.0 and in the absence of NaCl. In phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, the novel strain fell within a clade comprising members of the genus Mucilaginibacter and appeared most closely related to Mucilaginibacter lutimaris BR-3T (96.6 % sequence similarity) and Mucilaginibacter rigui WPCB133T (95.9 %). The novel strain showed lower levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with the type strains of other members of the genus Mucilaginibacter (93.4–95.5 %) and those of other species included in the phylogenetic analyses (<91.6 %). Strain BR-18T contained MK-7 as its predominant menaquinone, summed feature 3 (C16 : 1ω7c and/or iso-C15 : 0 2-OH) and iso-C15 : 0 as its major fatty acids, phosphatidylethanolamine and an unidentified aminophospholipid as its major polar lipids, and sphingolipids. The genomic DNA G+C content of the novel strain was 42.4 mol%. Based on the phylogenetic and phenotypic data, strain BR-18T represents a novel species of the genus Mucilaginibacter, for which the name Mucilaginibacter litoreus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is BR-18T ( = KCTC 23697T = CCUG 61484T).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abacteria 3acoasts 3afatty acids 3agenes 3amenaquinones 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asand 3asequence homology 3asodium chloride 3asphingolipids 3aSouth Korea1 aKang, So-Jung1 aPark, Sooyeon1 aOh, Tae-Kwang0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2012 Dec., v. 62, no.

A structure-based protein model at the residue level is adopted for the two proteins to include intramolecular conformational flexibility, while crowding macromolecules are represented as spherical particles. The interactions between crowders and protein residues can be either purely repulsive or a combination of short-range repulsion and intermediate-range attraction. Consistent with previous studies on rigid-body protein binding in the presence of spherical crowders, we find that the complex formation is stabilized by repulsive protein–crowder interactions and destabilized by sufficiently strong attractive protein–crowder interactions. Competition between stabilizing repulsive and destabilizing attractive interactions is quantitatively captured by a previous theoretical model developed for describing the change in the binding free energy of rigid proteins in a crowded environment. We find that protein flexibility has little effect on the thermodynamics of the pKID–KIX binding (with respect to bulk) for repulsive and weakly attractive protein–crowder interactions. For strong protein–crowder attractive interactions, the destabilizing effect due to crowding is attenuated by protein flexibility. Interestingly, the mechanism of coupled folding and binding observed in bulk remains unchanged under highly crowded conditions over a broad range of protein–crowder interaction strengths. Also, strong protein–crowder attractive interactions can significantly stabilize intermediate states involving partial contact between pKID and KIX domains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aproteins1 aBhattacharya, Apratim1 aMittal, Jeetain0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 Nov. 06, v. 118, no. 44 p.12621-12629dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp508046y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03449naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157100001600175245013400191300001600325520178300341592002802124650001002152650001602162650001302178650001302191650001002204650002202214650002402236650002402260650002002284650002402304650001902328650001402347650002702361650001202388650002402400650003902424650000902463650003102472650003502503650003102538650001902569650004702588650002202635700002002657700001602677700002402693773008902717856009202806852000902898655001202907IND4458798720221119095942.0141111e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445879872DNAL7 a214580512pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2011.01.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeste, Marc14aThe effects on boar sperm quality of dietary supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids differ among porcine breeds  ap. 184-196.  aThe present study was undertaken to shed light on the relationship between boar sperm quality and dietary supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which has been reported inconsistently in the literature. With this aim, such effects were evaluated and compared among three different porcine breeds: Duroc, Large-White, and Pietrain. Animals were randomly separated into two groups and fed either with a control diet or with a diet supplemented with omega-3. Sperm quality of these boar (ejaculate volume, sperm concentration, sperm viability, acrosome and mitochondrial sheath integrity, sperm motility, sperm morphology, and osmotic resistance of spermatozoa) was assessed every week for a 26-week period. Supplementing boar's diet with omega-3 did not affect ejaculate volume, sperm concentration, sperm motility, sperm viability, and acrosome and mitochondrial sheath integrity. In contrast, supplemented diet positively affected both sperm morphology in Large-White and Pietrain breeds and the osmotic resistance of Pietrain spermatozoa. No effects were seen for the same sperm parameters in Duroc breed. These breed-differences in boar fed with the supplemented diet could explain the contradictions in literature and might be related with differences in the composition of plasma membrane among breeds reported by other authors. Because no harmful effects were observed in the three evaluated breeds, but positive effects in Large-White and Pietrain boar, we can conclude that omega-3 fatty acids may be added to boar's diet at the levels used in this study to improve their sperm quality. More research is, however, needed to determine how these fatty acids differently affect the morphology and the osmotic resistance of the spermatozoa in these breeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDuroc 3aLarge White 3aPietrain 3aacrosome 3aboars 3abreed differences 3adietary supplements 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aplasma membrane 3asperm concentration 3asperm motility 3aviability 2aAcrosomexdrug effects 2aAnimals 2aDietary Supplements 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xpharmacology 2aMale 2aMitochondriaxdrug effects 2aOsmotic Pressurexdrug effects 2aSemen Analysisxveterinary 2aSperm Motility 2aSpermatozoaxdrug effectsxultrastructure. 2aSwinexphysiology1 aBarrera, Xavier1 aColl, David1 aBonet, S.q(Sergi),0 tTheriogenology.g2011 July 1, v. 76, no. 1 p.184-196dElsevier Inc.x0093-691X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2011.01.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02193naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245015200162300001600314520101700330592002801347650002801375650003301403650001201436650002001448650001401468651001001482700001801492700001901510700002001529700002401549700005201573773012601625856008301751852000901834655001201843IND60769312520221120103103.0220811e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076931252DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-021-01675-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yao10aTolypocladium reniformisporum sp. nov. and Tolypocladium cylindrosporum (Ophiocordycipitaceae, Hypocreales) co-occurring on Ophiocordyceps sinensis  ap. 199-214.  aTwo Tolypocladium species, Tolypocladium reniformisporum sp. nov., and T. cylindrosporum, were isolated from the sclerotium of a naturally occurring Ophiocordyceps sinensis specimen in the Baima Snow Mountains of Deqin County, Yunnan Province in southwestern China.

Phylogenetic analyses based on a 5-gene (SSU, LSU, TEF, RPB1, and RPB2) dataset and sequences of the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS) showed that T. reniformisporum was phylogenetically closely related to T. cylindrosporum and other similar species. Tolypocladium reniformisporum was morphologically distinguishable from other Tolypocladium species because of its slow-growing colonies, short phialides, and smaller reniform conidia. Growth tests showed that the isolated T. reniformisporum and T. cylindrosporum strains were psychrotrophic, with optimal growth temperatures of 18–22 ℃, and minimum growth temperatures below 5 ℃.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOphiocordyceps sinensis 3aTolypocladium cylindrosporum 3aconidia 3adata collection 3aphylogeny 3aChina1 aLiu, Yan-Fang1 aTang, De-Xiang1 aWang, Yuan-Bing1 aAdams, Alison E.

However, it is unclear which criteria determine their successful establishment and continuity. We assessed these criteria for 29 projects in the Netherlands and Switzerland using a vulnerability analysis framework. We analyzed biophysical and socio‐institutional criteria for project establishment by conducting interviews with project leaders. Projects were scored for their exposure to perturbations and their sensitivity and resilience after a perturbation, resulting in an overall vulnerability score per project. We found that the vulnerability of UA systems depends strongly on local circumstances. The main perturbations and causes of vulnerability originate from social‐institutional and human conditions, such as the institutional sphere, assistance of local authorities, and the determination of project leaders. Different sources of resilience were found, such as social protest, and project leaders’ adaptation to local circumstances. Biophysical factors were of less influence as the adaptive capacity of projects provides resilience against such perturbations. As perturbations are case‐specific, targeted policies would be desirable to support these promising initiatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aentrepreneurship 3ahumans 3aquality of life 3aurban agriculture 3aNetherlands 3aSwitzerland1 aVeen, Esther1 aRenting, Henk1 aWiskerke, Johannes S.

Plectostoma was previously classified as a subgenus of Opisthostoma because of the deviation from regular coiling in many species in both taxa. This paper is the first of a two-part revision of the genus Plectostoma, and includes all non-Borneo species. In the present paper, we examined 214 collection samples of 31 species, and obtained 62 references, 290 pictures, and 155 3D-models of 29 Plectostoma species and 51 COI sequences of 19 species. To work with such a variety of taxonomic data, and then to represent it in an integrated, scaleable and accessible manner, we adopted up-to-date cybertaxonomic tools. All the taxonomic information, such as references, classification, species descriptions, specimen images, genetic data, and distribution data, were tagged and linked with cyber tools and web servers (e.g. Lifedesks, Google Earth, and Barcoding of Life Database). We elevated Plectostoma from subgenus to genus level based on morphological, ecological and genetic evidence. We revised the existing 21 Plectostoma species and described 10 new species, namely, P. dindingensissp. n., P. mengaburensissp. n., P. whittenisp. n., P. kayianisp. n., P. davisonisp. n., P. relauensissp. n., P. kubuensissp. n., P. tohchinyawisp. n., P. tenggekensissp. n., and P. ikanensissp. n. All the synthesised, semantic-tagged, and linked taxonomic information is made freely and publicly available online.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGastropoda 3aInternet 3abarcoding 3adatabases 3alimestone 3anew species 3asnails 3aIndochina 3aIndonesia 3aMalaysia 0aSundaland 0akarst habitat 0ashell 0ae-taxonomy 0atropical 0asemantic tag 0ataxonomic impediment1 aVermeulen, Jaap Jan1 aMarzuki, Mohammad Effendi bin1 aSchilthuizen, Menno0 tZooKeys.g2014 Mar. 25, v. 393 p.1-107dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.393.67173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002400137245013500161300001600296520116200312592002801474650001601502650001901518650001301537650000901550650002501559650001101584650001001595650000901605650001501614650001501629650001201644650002901656650001401685650001501699650001801714651001201732651001201744653002201756653001601778653003201794700002201826700001601848700001801864700001701882700001701899700001601916700001901932700002001951700001801971773009601989856007102085852000902156655001202165IND60568816020221118113907.0170517s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056881602DNAL7 a10.1071/AN157672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXuan, K.

The high survival rate (95.0–96.5%), overall productivity and reproductive ability of the VN flock confirmed the adaptation potential of PH chickens to subtropical climates. A relatively good bodyweight (1412 ± 13.8 g) and slaughter yield (75.6 ± 0.02% eviscerated carcass and 28.2 ± 0.12% deboned thigh meat) in male VN birds at 12 weeks of age was obtained. Moreover, it was found that benefits such as the number of eggs (112 eggs/layer in 7 months) and egg mass (6.1 kg/layer) alongside considerably higher fertility (85.9 ± 2.9%) and hatchability (82.0 ± 3.2%) of VN layers could outweigh their reduced egg size. As a result, the study confirms that the adaptation and maintenance of populations in subtropical regions is a promising agro-ecological way to protect native Hungarian chicken breeds and improve their involvement in production.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3achicken breeds 3achickens 3aeggs 3aex situ conservation 3aflocks 3amales 3ameat 3amonitoring 3apartridges 3arearing 3areproductive performance 3aslaughter 3asubtropics 3asurvival rate 3aHungary 3aVietnam 0aanimal production 0asubtropical 0atropical poultry production1 aPhuong, T.

The multilayer, micelle-like structure of the GNPs consists of a gold core, an inner PNBA layer, and an outer PS layer. The UV-sensitive PNBA segment can be deprotected into a layer containing poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) when exposed to UV light at 365 nm, which enables the simple and precise tuning of GNP surface properties from hydrophobic to amphiphilic. The GNPs bearing ligands of different chemical compositions were successfully and selectively incorporated into the PS-b-P2VP block copolymer, and UV light showed a profound influence on the spatial distributions of GNPs. Prior to UV exposure, GNPs partition along the interfaces of PS and P2VP domains, while the UV-treated GNPs are incorporated into P2VP domains as a result of hydrogen bond interactions between PAA on the gold surface and P2VP domains. This provides an easy way of controlling the arrangement of nanoparticles in polymer matrices by tailoring the nanoparticle surface using UV light.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3acomposite polymers 3agold 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aligands 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3apolyacrylic acid 3apolystyrenes 3astyrene 3aultraviolet radiation1 aWang, Xinyu1 aLin, Ying1 aWatkins, James J.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 Nov. 06, v. 118, no. 44 p.12788-12795dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp508212f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245011200203300001600315500001400331506007600345520132800421592002801749596010401777506003701881650000801918650001201926650001601938650000901954650001401963650001801977650000901995650001902004650002202023650001302045650002702058650001902085650001002104650002602114653002202140653001902162700001502181700002302196700002102219700002202240700001902262773012402281856007702405961001302482852000902495655001202504IND60673494020221207115722.0191018e20180316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067349402DNAL7 a10.1093/jhered/esx0732doi7 aPMC71899732pmcid7 a289921082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWills, David M10aDefining the Role of the MADS-Box Gene, Zea Agamous-like1, a Target of Selection During Maize Domestication  ap. 333-338.  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenomic scans for genes that show the signature of past selection have been widely applied to a number of species and have identified a large number of selection candidate genes. In cultivated maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) selection scans have identified several hundred candidate domestication genes by comparing nucleotide diversity and differentiation between maize and its progenitor, teosinte (Z. mays ssp. parviglumis). One of these is a gene called zea agamous-like1 (zagl1), a MADS-box transcription factor, that is known for its function in the control of flowering time. To determine the trait(s) controlled by zagl1 that was (were) the target(s) of selection during maize domestication, we created a set of recombinant chromosome isogenic lines that differ for the maize versus teosinte alleles of zagl1 and which carry cross-overs between zagl1 and its neighbor genes. These lines were grown in a randomized trial and scored for flowering time and domestication related traits. The results indicated that the maize versus teosinte alleles of zagl1 affect flowering time as expected, as well as multiple traits related to ear size with the maize allele conferring larger ears with more kernels. Our results suggest that zagl1 may have been under selection during domestication to increase the size of the maize ear.  aPublisher supplied data  aIOS1025869aIOS0820619aIOS1238014cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000000010 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZea 3aalleles 3achromosomes 3acorn 3acorn ears 3adomestication 3aears 3aflowering time 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aisogenic lines 3aseeds 3atranscription factors 0akernel row number 0aselection scan1 aFang, Zhou1 aYork, Alessandra M1 aHolland, James B1 aDoebley, John F.,1 aOlsen, Kenneth0 tJournal of heredity.g2018 Mar. 16, v. 109, no. 3 p.333-338dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl46534x1465-73337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esx0733Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245012400156300001600280520159600296592002801892650001201920650001401932650001301946650001401959650001701973650000901990650001601999650001202015650001202027650001402039650001202053650002002065650002002085650001802105650002602123650001402149650001002163653002102173653001102194653001702205653001402222700001902236700001902255700002002274700002002294773009602314856007102410852000902481655001202490IND60568816120221118113945.0170517s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056881612DNAL7 a10.1071/AN157712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacNeil, M.

Data were previously unpublished breed means from purebred Afrikaner, Brahman, Charolais, Hereford and Simmental, top-crosses of Brahman, Charolais, Hereford, and Simmental sires on (1) Afrikaner dams producing F1 progenies and (2) Brahman × Afrikaner, Charolais × Afrikaner, Hereford × Afrikaner, and Simmental × Afrikaner F1 females producing both backcross and three-breed cross progenies. Hide yield (%), leather yield (dm2/kg), force 20% extension (Mpa), extension grain crack (%), extension break (%), force break (Mpa), slit tear force (N/mm), distension grain crack (%), and force grain crack (N/mm) were evaluated. Breed direct effects and individual heterosis, but not maternal effects, may be important for most of these traits. Direct effects due to the exotic breeds reduced hide yield but generally improved leather properties relative to the indigenous Afrikaner. For both hide and leather yields, individual heterosis effects arose primarily from indicus × taurus crosses with the Hereford × Brahman effect being most pronounced. Thus, there may be opportunities to improve leather yield and quality through crossbreeding relative to the straightbred Afrikaner.

We analyzed the C, N and P stoichiometry of new stems, leaves and soil of two coniferous species, Abies fanjingshanensis and Taxus chinensis var. mairei, and of the hardwood tree Davidia involucrata. The total-C, total-N, hydrolyzed-N and available-P contents of the forest soils were higher at higher altitudes, with median values for A. fanjingshanensis forest soil > T. chinensis var. mairei soil > D. involucrata soil. The C:N, C:P and N:P ratios of soil in A. fanjingshanensis stands were the largest, and significantly higher than those of soils in T. chinensis var. mairei and D. involucrata stands. The C content of stems and leaves of the coniferous tree species was higher than that of the hardwood tree species. The N:P ratio of stems and leaves ranged from 0.06 to 0.22. The total-C, total-P and total-N of soil explained 37.5%, 11.0% and 8.0%, respectively, of the variance in C, N and P content and stoichiometry of plant stems and leaves. The total-C content of soil was positively correlated with the C and P contents of plant leaves, the C:N ratio and the C content of plant stems. Except for the total-C content of the soil–vegetation system, in general, the stoichiometric characteristics of N and P of soils and plants in the study area were not significantly correlated. Correlations between C, N, and P nutrients and the stoichiometric characteristics of the soil–vegetation system of the different forest types and environments varied. In the reserve environment, the growth of T. chinensis var. mairei and D. involucrata was restricted by N limitation in the soil. Our findings could provide basic data for the management and protection of rare plants growing on Mount Fanjing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies 3aDavidia involucrata 3aTaxus wallichiana var. mairei 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aconservation areas 3aecology 3aforest soils 3ahardwood 3astoichiometry 3atrees 3avariance 3aChina 0aMount Fanjing 0aRare plant 0aEcological stoichiometric characteristics 0aSoil–vegetation1 aLuo, Wenmin1 aMu, Guiting1 aWu, Xianliang1 aSu, Shicheng1 aZhang, Zhenming0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2021 Dec., v. 32 p.e01893-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e018933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245008000158300001800238520130200256592002801558650000801586650003001594650001401624650001301638650001001651650001601661650001001677650001701687650001601704650002501720650000701745650002501752650001401777650001801791650002201809650002001831651001601851700002001867700001601887700002001903700001501923700002001938700001701958700001801975700001901993700001902012700001902031700001702050773017902067856007802246852000902324655001202333IND60118095620221119062507.0141126e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011809562DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.037283-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jina10aRuegeria conchae sp. nov., isolated from the ark clam Scapharca broughtonii  ap. 2851-2857.  aA slightly halophilic, Gram-negative, strictly aerobic, non-motile rod, designated TW15T, was isolated from an ark clam in South Korea. Growth occurred at 10–37 °C, with 1–5 % (w/v) NaCl and at pH 7.0–10.0. Optimal growth occurred at 25–30 °C, with 2 % (w/v) NaCl and at pH 8.0. Strain TW15T exhibited both oxidase and catalase activities. The major fatty acids of strain TW15T were summed feature 8 (consisting of C18 : 1ω7c and/or C18 : 1ω6c) and 11-methyl C18 : 1ω7c. The predominant isoprenoid quinone was ubiquinone-10 (Q-10). The polar lipids of strain TW15T comprised phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, an unidentified phospholipid, an unidentified aminolipid and five unidentified lipids. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain TW15T was most closely related to Ruegeria lacuscaerulensis DSM 11314T (98.0 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). DNA–DNA relatedness with closely related strains was <52±3 %. The DNA G+C content was 55.7 mol%. On the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic data, strain TW15T represents a novel species of the genus Ruegeria, for which the name Ruegeria conchae sp. nov. is proposed.

To meet ultra-low effluent P discharge limits, persistent nRP must be removed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of an advanced oxidation process (AOP) which couples TiO₂/UV photolysis with ultrafiltration to oxidize and remove nRP species. Initial tests utilized OP model compounds, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and aminoethylphosphonate (AEP), in a binary mixture to evaluate AOP treatment and to elucidate possible mechanisms of phosphorus removal. The results were consistent with a model of preferential ATP binding to the TiO₂ surface compared to AEP. On UV light exposure, AEP was removed from solution due to the photooxidation of ATP freeing up binding sites for AEP adsorption and subsequent oxidation. Orthophosphate released during AOP treatment was retained on the TiO₂ solids. The AOP was applied to three municipal wastewaters and one automotive industry effluent for P removal. In all cases, phosphorus removal was found to occur through filtration, surface complexation and UV oxidation. Total phosphorus removal efficiencies between 90 and 97% were observed for the municipal wastewater effluents and 44% removal was observed in the industrial effluent after treatment using AOP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadsorption 3aindustrial effluents 3aindustrial wastewater treatment 3amunicipal wastewater 3aorganic phosphorus 3aorthophosphates 3apersistent organic pollutants 3aphosphonates 3aphotolysis 3aphotooxidation 3atitanium dioxide 3aultrafiltration 0aNon-reactive phosphorus 0aPhosphorus removal 0aAdvanced oxidation process 0aUV/TiO2 0aAbbreviaions: AEP 0aAOP 0aATP 0aBM 0aDOC 0aICP-OES 0anRP 0aOP 0aRP 0aTOC 0aTP 0aUF 0aWWTP1 aPowell, Tony1 aChoi, Suyoung1 aSmith, D.

L.10aIsolating the Photovoltaic Junction: Atomic Layer Deposited TiO2–RuO2 Alloy Schottky Contacts for Silicon Photoanodes  ap. 23763-23773.  aWe synthesized nanoscale TiO₂–RuO₂ alloys by atomic layer deposition (ALD) that possess a high work function and are highly conductive. As such, they function as good Schottky contacts to extract photogenerated holes from n-type silicon while simultaneously interfacing with water oxidation catalysts. The ratio of TiO₂ to RuO₂ can be precisely controlled by the number of ALD cycles for each precursor. Increasing the composition above 16% Ru sets the electronic conductivity and the metal work function. No significant Ohmic loss for hole transport is measured as film thickness increases from 3 to 45 nm for alloy compositions ≥ 16% Ru. Silicon photoanodes with a 2 nm SiO₂ layer that are coated by these alloy Schottky contacts having compositions in the range of 13–46% Ru exhibit average photovoltages of 525 mV, with a maximum photovoltage of 570 mV achieved. Depositing TiO₂–RuO₂ alloys on nSi sets a high effective work function for the Schottky junction with the semiconductor substrate, thus generating a large photovoltage that is isolated from the properties of an overlying oxygen evolution catalyst or protection layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3acatalysts 3aoxidation 3aoxygen production 3asemiconductors 3asilica 3asilicon 3atitanium dioxide 0aatomic layer deposition 0aSchottky junctions 0aMIS junctions 0aphotoanodes 0aphotovoltage 0aTiO2 alloys1 aScheuermann, Andrew G.1 aSchmidt, Michael1 aHurley, Paul K.1 aMcIntyre, Paul C.1 aChidsey, Christopher E.

The experiment was a longitudinal experiment using twin-bearing Border Leicester × Merino ewes on farms managed in accordance to either regional WormBoss IPM programs (n = 3 farms) or typical (TYP) regional GIN control (n = 2 farms). Ewes on each farm were either GIN-suppressed (SUP; n = 120 ewes) or not (NSUP; n = 120 ewes) and were managed in two groups (n = 120/group) balanced for GIN control. Ewes lambed in September and at lamb marking, 120 lambs (Dorset sires) from each ewe GIN control group were enrolled in the experiment to investigate the effect of ewe GIN control on lamb performance up to weaning. Overall mean worm egg count (WEC) of ewes (P = 0.004) was lower with IPM (IPM 766 vs TYP 931 epg) and was achieved with fewer drenches (IPM 4.5 vs TYP 5.5/year). Despite lower WEC, GIN infection reduced liveweight (IPM –2.1 kg vs TYP –1.1 kg, P = 0.0006) and clean fleece weight (IPM –0.11 kg vs TYP –0.01 kg, P = 0.03) of ewes to a greater extent on IPM farms. The annual rate of apparent ewe mortality was 6.5% and this was unaffected by GIN infection. WEC of lambs at weaning was lower on IPM farms (IPM 159 epg vs TYP 322, P < 0.0001) but the difference in weaning weights of lambs reared by NSUP and SUP ewes was greater on IPM farms (IPM –1.1 kg vs TYP 0.2 kg, P < 0.0001). Overall, the production loss due to GIN infection in these sheep-meat production systems, on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales, was small and treatment frequency can be reduced by IPM programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBorder Leicester 3aMerino 3abody weight 3aeggs 3aewes 3afarms 3afleece 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3aintegrated pest management 3alambs 3amortality 3aproduction technology 3arain 3arearing 3asheep meat 3asires 3asummer 3aweaning 3aNew South Wales 0aanthelmintic resistance 0aHaemonchus contortus 0aliveweight 0ameat-breed lambs 0aproduction 0atwin-bearing ewes 0aworm egg counts1 aKahn, L.

It is an aerobic chemo-organotrophic, mesophilic and slightly halophilic organism, with complex ionic requirements. Phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S rRNA and gyrB gene sequences showed that strain R46T formed a separate branch within the family Rhodobacteraceae, bearing similarities below 94.7 and 80.3 %, respectively, to any other recognized species. It contained Q10 as the predominant isoprenoid quinone and C18 : 1ω7c/C18 : 1ω6c as the major cellular fatty acid. Phosphatidylglycerol was the only identified polar lipid, although other lipids were also detected. The DNA G+C content of the genomic DNA was 61.3 mol%. On the basis of extensive phenotypic and phylogenetic comparative analysis, it is concluded that the strain represents a novel genus and species, for which the name Actibacterium mucosum gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of the type species is Actibacterium mucosum R46T ( = CECT 7668T = KCTC 23349T).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRhodobacteraceae 3afatty acids 3agenes 3ahalophiles 3amicrobiology 3anew genus 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3aseawater 3aSpain1 aRuvira, María A.1 aGaray, Esperanza1 aMacián, M.

Given functions defining these random and deterministic components, the Fokker–Planck (FP) equation is often used to model these diffusive systems. Many methods exist for estimating the drift and diffusion profiles from one or more identifiable diffusive trajectories; however, when many identical entities diffuse simultaneously, it may not be possible to identify individual trajectories. Here we present a method capable of simultaneously providing nonparametric estimates for both drift and diffusion profiles from evolving density profiles, requiring only the validity of Langevin/FP dynamics. This algebraic FP manipulation provides a flexible and robust framework for estimating stationary drift and diffusion coefficient profiles, is not based on fluctuation theory or solved diffusion equations, and may facilitate predictions for many experimental systems. We illustrate this approach on experimental data obtained from a model lipid bilayer system exhibiting free diffusion and electric field induced drift. The wide range over which this approach provides accurate estimates for drift and diffusion profiles is demonstrated through simulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunications technology 3adiffusivity 3aelectric field 3aenergy 3aequations 3alipid bilayers 3amodels 3amomentum 3aphysical chemistry 3aprediction1 aHubbard, Joseph B.1 aHalter, Michael0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 Nov. 06, v. 118, no. 44 p.12743-12749dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp50843573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245015400164300001600318520133300334592002801667650001601695650002701711650002401738650001001762650002701772650001201799650001801811650002101829650001101850650001501861650001201876650003601888653002901924653001701953653002701970653003601997653002702033700001602060700005602076700001602132700001502148700005702163773011402220856008602334852000902420655001202429IND60639372220221120081332.0190606e20190805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063937222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.04.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Chao10aMechanistic understanding towards the effective lipid production of a microalgal mutant strain Scenedesmus sp.

In this study, the whole genome of a lipid-rich microalgal mutant strain Scenedesmus sp. Z-4 and a lipid-poor wild strain Scenedesmus sp. MC-1 were sequenced, and results revealed that the sequences of 1,256 genes were changed and 148 differential genes related to glucose and lipid metabolism were identified. Especially, gene differentiation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) in mutant strain Z-4 and wild strain MC-1, which played key roles in lipid synthesis, were evaluated. Furthermore, to investigate whether mutated ACCase and PEPC genes affect the lipid production, two genes from mutant strain Z-4 were transformed into the expression system of wild strain MC-1. Nine transformants with higher lipid content were successfully obtained, in which the optimal transformant with 28.6% more intracellular lipid than wild strain MC-1 was isolated by overexpression of mutated ACCase gene, demonstrating the important role of ACCase in lipid accumulation of microalgal cells. These results could provide a better understanding of the superior lipid production of mutant strain Scenedesmus sp. Z-4.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScenedesmus 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetic transformation 3aglucose 3alipid content 3alipid metabolism 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3amutants 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 0aMicroalgal mutant strain 0aWhole genome 0aAcetyl-CoA carboxylase 0apHosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 0aGenetic transformation1 aRen, Hongyu1 aXing, Defeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4777-03901 aXie, Guojun1 aRen, Nanqi1 aLiu, Bingfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6065-54450 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2019 Aug. 05, v. 375 p.115-120dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.04.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03830naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245012100213300001100334520255100345592002802896650001902924650001002943650001302953650001202966650001002978650002702988650001303015650001703028650001603045650001703061650001503078650002503093650001403118650001603132700002103148700002303169773013603192856008303328852000903411655001203420IND60777912620221118062822.0220702e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077791262DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-022-03182-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMegía-Palma, Rodrigo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1038-046810aLongitudinal effects of habitat quality, body condition, and parasites on colour patches of a multiornamented lizard  ap. 73.  aOntogeny is expected to be a determinant factor affecting production of colour patches in lizards, while immune challenges or sudden weight loss may impair the maintenance of pigment-based coloration within a breeding season. We translocated males of the lizard Psammodromus algirus between two sampling plots that differed in distance to a road, vegetation structure, and predator abundance. We analysed variation in spectral reflectance of their colour patches the same and the following year. The change in the reflectance of the lizard colour patches within the first breeding season was explained by the interaction between plot and treatment, but not body condition. The maintenance of the breeding coloration was impaired only in those males translocated close to the road, probably reflecting that it is a poor-quality habitat for P. algirus. The following year, lizards that produced a more elaborate coloration were those that increased their body condition and controlled some parasitic infections, although suffered an increase of others. This study shows that colour patch production is plastic in P. algirus. Lizards increasing parasites or losing weight reduced pigmentation, although habitat quality can cushion these negative effects on pigmentation. However, not all parasites constrain the investment in coloration. In fact, some increased in those lizards that allocated more pigments to colour patches. In conclusion, longitudinal studies following experimental manipulation can contribute to understand pigment allocation rules in lizards. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Pigments involved in colour patches of animals are limiting resources that can be reallocated off the skin to other functions. However, longitudinal evidence of this phenomenon is scarce in reptiles. We designed a manipulative mark-recapture experiment to investigate effects of habitat and parasitic infections on colour patch maintenance (within-year variation) and production (between-year variation) in male free-ranging lizards that were reciprocally translocated between two patches of habitat that differed in quality. During the first year, lizards translocated to the habitat with more predators and worse vegetation impoverished their coloration, while lizards translocated to the more favourable habitat maintained it despite all translocated lizards loose body condition. The next year we detected different effects on the coloration of three different parasites investigated, suggesting that coloration can reflect the virulence of the infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody condition 3acolor 3ahabitats 3alizards 3amales 3amark-recapture studies 3aontogeny 3apigmentation 3areflectance 3asociobiology 3avegetation 3avegetation structure 3avirulence 3aweight loss1 aMerino, Santiago1 aBarrientos, Rafael0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2022 June, v. 76, no. 6 p.73-73dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl6766x0340-54437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-022-03182-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245007300209520106200282592002801344650001401372650001101386650001201397650001101409650002401420650001601444653004101460653002401501653001801525653002201543700001701565700005601582700002101638700005901659773011201718856008701830852000901917655001201926IND60766363020221119105334.0220314e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076636302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1186142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanif, Sarmad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3222-937110aMulti-service battery energy storage system optimization and control  aBattery energy storage systems (BESS) have become a fundamental part of modern power systems due to their ability to provide multiple grid services. As renewable penetration increases, BESS procurement is also expected to increase and is envisioned to play a systematic and strategic role in power systems planning and operation. Therefore, in this paper we present a multiple grid service procurement and operation approach for BESS, including energy arbitrage, reserve/regulation services, power factor correction, and demand management. The proposed framework considers an optimal multi-temporal dimension and is designed to be operable for both planning and real-time operation. Moreover, the nonlinearity inherent to BESS services and the uncertainty associated with market forecast variables are addressed using techniques such as polyhedral norms and robust optimization approaches. The developed model is tested using a utility-scaled BESS, and the results show the effectiveness of the systematic BESS multi-service planning and operation approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aenergy 3amarkets 3amodels 3asystem optimization 3auncertainty 0aBattery energy storage system (BESS) 0aConvex optimization 0aMulti-service 0aReal-time control1 aAlam, M.J.E.1 aRoshan, Kini1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9347-27141 aBhatti, Bilal A.1 aBedoya, Juan C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9018-41190 tApplied energy.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 311 p.118614-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1186143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02152naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011300167300001300280500002000293500000900313520117700322592002801499650001201527650000901539650002201548700002301570773017601593856008401769852000901853655001201862IND60670228920221122032044.0220517e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067022892DNAL7 a10.2134/urbanag2015.01.15112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhatt, Vikram10aCultivating Montreal: A Brief History of Citizens and Institutions Integrating Urban Agriculture in the City  ap. 1-12.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aCan concerted citizen action, involvement of community groups and institutions, as well as formal authorities, play important enough roles in promoting urban agriculture?

Urban agriculture activities began in the early 1970s, but gained momentum after the 1973 oil crisis. The role of diverse players in transforming the city fabric ever since is discussed here by introducing and developing related projects in three parts: the first traces the history of community gardens; the second presents Montreal‐based pilot projects rooted in different neighborhoods that aimed to intertwine urban agriculture, design and citizens that the authors developed and implemented; the third discusses a recent (2012) citizens’ action that used a municipal bylaw to hold a public consultation on the state of urban agriculture and towards the formation of city's Comité de travail de la collectivité montréalaise en agriculture urbaine or Permanent Committee on Urban Agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3afabrics 3aoils 3aurban agriculture1 aFarah, Leila Marie0 tUrban agriculture & regional food systems.g2016 July, v. 1, no. 1 p.1-12dAmerican Society of Agronomy and Crop Science Society of AmericawJournal:27128x2575-12207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/urbanag2015.01.15113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03782naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001300167245010200180300001400282520172400296592002802020650002302048650001502071650001602086650001802102650002002120650001602140650001202156650002102168650002002189650002102209650002102230650003002251650002402281650001302305650001202318650001502330650001502345650001202360650002102372650006702393650005002460650002802510650002802538650002802566650002602594650002602620650002502646650002302671650004302694650003202737650002702769650001502796650004302811650002202854700001602876700001702892773011802909856008403027852000903111655001203120IND4470156120221118180021.0141111e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447015612DNAL7 a211346962pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2010.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRupa, P.10aProphylaxis of experimentally induced ovomucoid allergy in neonatal pigs using Lactococcus lactis  ap. 23-29.  aProbiotic Lactococcus lactis (LL) is immunomodulatory and may prevent allergy by biasing from type-2 to a type-1 immune response. We hypothesized that newborn pigs pre-treated orally with LL are protected against allergy to ovomucoid (Ovm). Pigs were assigned to two treatment groups. Piglets were pretreated orally on days of age 1–7, 10, 12, 14, 21, 28 and 35 with LL (n=30) or medium (control, n=32) and sensitized to Ovm by intraperitoneal injection together with cholera toxin on days 14, 21 and 35. Pigs were orally challenged with egg white (day 46) and assigned scores for allergic signs. Outcomes were measured as direct skin tests, serum antibody to Ovm [IgG (H+L); IgE; IgG₁ and IgG₂] and cytokine production by mitogen-stimulated blood mononuclear cells (BMC). Clinical signs and skin test positivity were less frequent in the LL group (p≤0.0001). Serum antibody associated with IgG (H and L), IgE, IgG₁ or IgG₂ was significantly increased on day 46 (post-sensitization) compared to day 14 (pre-sensitization) (p≤0.0001). The LL-treated pigs had more IgE and IgG₂-related antibody activity and lower IgG₁/IgG₂ and IgE/IgG₂ ratios indicating a type-1 bias in immune response (p≤0.05). Concentration of type-2 cytokines interleukin IL-4 and IL-10 were significantly lower in supernatants of stimulated BMC of LL-treated pigs (p≤0.0001). Interferon-γ, TGF-β and IL-13 were not detected in control or treated animals. Thus, oral treatment of neonatal pigs with LL significantly reduced subsequent frequency of allergy to Ovm associated with reduced type-2 immune response correlates hence supporting the “hygiene hypothesis” and potential use of LL as a neonatal immunoregulator.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactococcus lactis 3aantibodies 3ablood cells 3acholera toxin 3adisease control 3aegg albumen 3ahygiene 3ahypersensitivity 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aintraperitoneal injection 3aoral administration 3aovomucin 3apiglets 3aprobiotics 3askin tests 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aEgg Hypersensitivityxbloodximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aImmunoglobulin Exblood 2aImmunoglobulin Gxblood 2aInterferon-gammaxblood 2aInterleukin-10xblood 2aInterleukin-13xblood 2aInterleukin-4xblood 2aLactococcus lactis 2aOvomucinxadverse effectsximmunology. 2aProbioticsxtherapeutic use 2aSkin Testsxveterinary 2aSus scrofa 2aTransforming Growth Factor betaxblood 2aTreatment Outcome1 aSchmied, J.1 aWilkie, B.N.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2011 Mar. 15, v. 140, no. 1-2 p.23-29dElsevier B.V.x0165-24277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2010.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02207naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001800150245009700168300001600265520089700281592002801178650004401206650002501250650001701275650004401292650000901336650001401345650001801359650002101377650001601398651001101414700001801425700001901443700002401462700001601486700001901502700002301521700001901544700002001563773009501583856008601678852000901764655001201773IND4466831220221119095947.0141110e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446683122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2011.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, R.V.S.10aFractions composition study of the pyrolysis oil obtained from sewage sludge treatment plant  ap. 459-465.  aIn this work the parameters of Low Temperature Conversion – LTC were applied in a centrifuged sludge from a sewage treatment plant located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Before the conversion, the sludge was dried and analyzed by TGA to observe its behavior with increasing temperature. The chemical composition of the crude pyrolysis oil was analyzed by FTIR, ¹H NMR and GC–MS. The results showed that the oil is a mixture of hydrocarbons, oxygenated and nitrogenated compounds. Using a catalytic treatment it was possible to fractionate the oil where the predominant constituents were hydrocarbons showing that the cracking was effective. An important result was the difference between the calorific value of dry sludge (10MJkg⁻¹), the pyrolysis oil (36MJkg⁻¹) and one of the fractions separated by catalytic cracking (40MJkg⁻¹) when compared with commercial diesel (45MJkg⁻¹).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3achemical composition 3ahydrocarbons 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3apyrolysis 3asewage sludge 3asewage treatment 3atemperature 3aBrazil1 aRomeiro, G.A.1 aVeloso, M.C.C.1 aFigueiredo, M.K.-K.1 aPinto, P.A.1 aFerreira, A.F.1 aGonçalves, M.L.A.1 aTeixeira, A.M.1 aDamasceno, R.N.0 tBioresource technology.g2012 Jan., v. 103, no. 1 p.459-465dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2011.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02918naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005600092040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184072000900193100002200202245013200224300001800356500002400374500001500398520119800413650003001611650001701641650001801658650001801676650002501694650002701719650002601746650002501772650002501797650001101822650001101833650001301844653001301857653001801870700001901888700001901907700001801926700001801944700001601962773011901978852000902097856011002106856007702216930003302293945002502326946001302351655001202364IND4386291020221122212843.0061222e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438629102DNAL7 a10.1603/0046-225X(2006)35[1710:COGBIL]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aK001 0aL600 0aL0011 aVasanthakumar, A.10aCharacterization of Gut-Associated Bacteria in Larvae and Adults of the Southern Pine Beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmermann  ap. 1710-1717.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe report the first study of gut-associated bacteria of bark beetles using both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. These insects are major pests of pine trees but also contribute to important ecological functions such as nutrient cycling. We found members of the α- and γ-Proteobacteria and Firmicutes in larvae of the southern pine beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmermann. Sequences from three larval guts were grouped into one to three operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 3% difference among sequences. Communities in adult southern pine beetle guts consisted solely of members of the γ-Proteobacteria. These could be grouped into three to five OTUs at 3% difference between sequences. These gut communities have relatively low species richness, which may reflect the specialization needed to exploit a nutrient-poor food source, colonize a chemically complex habitat, and maintain consistent associations with mutualistic fungi. However, there is considerable variation in gut microbiota composition among individual insects, suggesting the need for additional studies on sources of variation and potential substitutability among species performing similar functions. 3aintestinal microorganisms 3abark beetles 3aribosomal DNA 3aendosymbionts 3aalpha-Proteobacteria 3aDendroctonus frontalis 3amolecular systematics 3anucleotide sequences 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3alarvae 3aimagos 3abacteria 0ataxonomy 0aadult insects1 aDelalibera, I.1 aHandelsman, J.1 aKlepzig, K.D.1 aSchloss, P.D.1 aRaffa, K.F.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2006 Dec., v. 35, no. 6 p.1710-1717dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X(2006)35%5B1710:COGBIL%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ee/index.htm3electronic resource  a20070103b20070202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/12/31  aOther US 7aarticle02162naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245012400165300001800289520107900307592002801386650002501414650002301439650001801462650001901480650002001499650001001519700001901529700001401548700001501562700002701577773013001604856008101734852000901815655001201824IND4461580320221119101416.0141112e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446158032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2011.01.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBogianchini, M.10aStability, antioxidant activity and phenolic composition of commercial and reverse osmosis obtained dealcoholised wines  ap. 1369-1375.  aThe purpose of this work is to evaluate the phenolic profile and the antioxidant activity of commercial dealcoholised wines and monitor the stability of their composition over time. This work also aims to test the influence of reverse osmosis (RO) process on phenolic compounds and on the antioxidant activity (AA) of dealcoholised wine. AA was measured by ORAC, DPPH and FRAP assays. Phenolic compounds were determined by LC-DAD. In the commercial dealcoholised wines, AA fell by between 33% and 54% and the concentration of phenolic compounds decreased significantly after 30 days of storage. However, RO process did not significantly affect any phenolic acids, regardless of their chemical structure (benzoic acids, cinnamic acids) and alcoholic degree. The AA and phenolic compounds of these products were monitored for seven months. No significant changes were observed. RO process therefore makes it possible to obtain a healthy, low-alcohol (<2% v/v) product with bioactive compounds that are stable in the product and are similar to those found in the original wine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3achemical structure 3acinnamic acid 3aphenolic acids 3areverse osmosis 3awines1 aCerezo, Ana B.1 aGomis, A.1 aLópez, F.1 aGarcía-Parrilla, M.C.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2011 July, v. 44, no. 6 p.1369-1375dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2011.01.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001200144245011500156300002000271500001500291520150400306592002801810650001701838650001501855650001201870650001601882650002101898650001501919650001301934650001401947650001101961650001101972650001101983653001901994653001702013653002902030653002302059653002702082653003402109700001402143700002102157700001902178773012702197856008002324852000902404655001202413IND60550889720221119220427.0161011e20160914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055088972DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b086342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yu10aDesign of Perovskite Oxides as Anion-Intercalation-Type Electrodes for Supercapacitors: Cation Leaching Effect  ap. 23774-23783.  a2019-12-06  aOxygen ions can be exploited as a charge carrier to effectively realize a new type of anion-intercalation supercapacitor. In this study, to get some useful guidelines for future materials development, we comparatively studied SrCoO₃₋δ (SC), Ba₀.₅Sr₀.₅Co₀.₈Fe₀.₂O₃₋δ (BSCF), and Co₃O₄ as electrodes in supercapacitors with aqueous alkaline electrolyte. The effect of interaction between the electrode materials with the alkaline solution was focused on the structure and specific surface area of the electrode material, and ultimately the electrochemical performance was emphasized. Both BSCF and SC were found to experience cation leaching in alkaline solution, resulting in an increase in the specific surface area of the material, but overleaching caused the damage of perovskite structure of BSCF. Barium leaching was more serious than strontium, and the cation leaching was component dependent. Although high initial capacitance was achieved for BSCF, it was not a good candidate as intercalation-type electrode for supercapacitor because of poor cycling stability from serious Ba²⁺ and Sr²⁺ leaching. Instead, SC was a favorable electrode candidate for practical use in supercapacitors due to its high capacity and proper cation leaching capacity, which brought beneficial effect on cycling stability. It is suggested that cation leaching effect should be seriously considered in the development of new perovskite materials as electrodes for supercapacitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3asurface area 3aelectrodes 3acations 3acapacitance 3aelectrochemistry 3aguidelines 3aleaching 3astrontium 3abarium 3aoxides 3aoxygen 0asupercapacitor 0aelectrolytes 0aanion-intercalation-type 0aperovskites oxides 0acation leaching effect 0aalkaline solution electrolyte1 aDinh, Jim1 aTadé, Moses O.,1 aShao, Zongping0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Sept. 14, v. 8, no. 36 p.23774-23783dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b086343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014300168300001600311520129300327592002801620650001201648650001201660650002401672650001701696650001101713650003101724650002001755650000901775650001501784650001301799650001301812650002101825653001301846653001201859653000901871653001201880653003301892653002701925700002101952700005901973700001502032700001702047700001602064700001802080700001802098700002302116700001902139700002002158700001802178773011402196856008602310852000902396655001202405IND60639372520221120070114.0190606e20190805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063937252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.04.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Chih-Yin14aThe association between plasma selenium and chronic kidney disease related to lead, cadmium and arsenic exposure in a Taiwanese population  ap. 224-232.  aThis study aimed to determine the interaction of red blood cell cadmium and lead, total urinary arsenic, and plasma selenium in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We recruited 220 CKD patients as well as 438 gender- and age-matched controls, and we defined CKD as <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for three or more consecutive months. Plasma selenium and red blood cell cadmium and lead concentrations were measured by ICP-MS. Urinary arsenic species were determined via HPLC-HG-AAS and were summed to determine the total urinary arsenic concentration. Plasma selenium was positively correlated to eGFR, and subjects with high plasma selenium levels (>243.90 μg/L) had a significantly lower odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.23, 0.13–0.42) for CKD compared to those with low plasma selenium levels (≤ 196.70 μg/L). High plasma selenium and low red blood cell cadmium or lead concentrations interacted to decrease the OR and 95% CI for CKD (0.12, 0.06–0.26; 0.09, 0.04–0.19). High plasma selenium and low red blood cell lead levels also interacted to increase the eGFR (20.70, 15.56–26.01 mL/min/1.73 m2). This study is the first to suggest that selenium modifies the eGFR and OR in CKD induced by environmental toxicants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3aconfidence interval 3aerythrocytes 3agender 3aglomerular filtration rate 3akidney diseases 3alead 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3aselenium 3atoxic substances 0aSelenium 0aCadmium 0aLead 0aArsenic 0aArsenic methylation capacity 0aChronic kidney disease1 aWong, Chung-Shun1 aChung, Chi-Jung1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9673-24301 aWu, Mei-Yi1 aHuang, Yali,1 aAo, Pui-Lam1 aLin, Yuh-Feng1 aLin, Yingjin,1 aShiue, Horng-Sheng1 aSu, Chien-Tien1 aChen, Hsi-Hsien1 aHsueh, Yu-Mei0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2019 Aug. 05, v. 375 p.224-232dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.04.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245008400163300001800247520168500265592002801950650003301978650000802011650002002019650001302039650001802052650001602070650001002086650001702096650001602113650003102129650002502160650002502185650003002210650001402240650001502254650001802269650002202287650001502309650001302324650001602337651001002353700001902363700001802382700002102400700001302421773017902434856007802613852000902691655001202700IND60118096120221119062433.0141126e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011809612DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.037721-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalhotra, Jaya10aAcinetobacter indicus sp. nov., isolated from a hexachlorocyclohexane dump site  ap. 2883-2890.  aThe taxonomic position of a Gram-negative, non-motile, oxidase negative and catalase positive strain, A648T, isolated from a hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) dump site located in Lucknow, India, was ascertained by using a polyphasic approach. A comparative analysis of a partial sequence of the rpoB gene and the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain A648T belonged to the genus Acinetobacter. DNA–DNA relatedness values between strain A648T and other closely related members (16S rRNA gene sequence similarity greater than 97 %), namely Acinetobacter radioresistens DSM 6976T, A. venetianus ATCC 31012T, A. baumannii LMG 1041T, A. parvus LMG 21765T A. junii LMG 998T and A. soli JCM 15062T, were found to be less than 8 %. The major cellular fatty acids of strain A648T were 18 : 1ω9c (19.6 %), summed feature 3 (15.9 %), 16 : 0 (10.6 %) and 12 : 0 (6.4 %). The DNA G+C content was 40.4 mol%. The polar lipid profile of strain A648T indicated the presence of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, followed by phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine. The predominant polyamine of strain A648T was 1,3-diaminopropane and moderate amounts of putrescine, spermidine and spermine were also detected. The respiratory quinone consisted of ubiquinone with nine isoprene units (Q-9). On the basis of DNA–DNA hybridization, phenotypic characteristics and chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic comparisons with other members of the genus Acinetobacter, strain A648T is found to be a novel species of the genus Acinetobacter, for which the name Acinetobacter indicus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is A648T ( = DSM 25388T = CCM 7832T).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter radioresistens 3aDNA 3aHCH (pesticide) 3acatalase 3achemotaxonomy 3afatty acids 3agenes 3amicrobiology 3anew species 3anucleic acid hybridization 3anucleotide sequences 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphylogeny 3aputrescine 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence homology 3aspermidine 3aspermine 3aubiquinones 3aIndia1 aAnand, Shailly1 aJindal, Swati1 aRajagopal, Raman1 aLal, Rup0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2012 Dec., v. 62, no.

Part II: Application to manure processing via pyrolysis  ap. 490-495.  aBACKGROUND: State‐of‐the‐art control systems that can guarantee the pyrolytic exposure temperature are needed in the production of designer biochars. These designer biochars will have tailored characteristics that can offer improvement of specific soil properties such as water‐holding capacity and cation exchange capacity. RESULTS: A novel stochastic state‐space temperature regulator was developed for the batch production of biochar that accurately matched the pyrolytic exposure temperature to a defined temperature input schedule. This system was evaluated by processing triplicate swine manure biochars at two temperatures, 350 and 700 °C. The results revealed a low coefficient of variation (CV) in their composition and near‐similar 13C nuclear magnetic resonance structure as well as thermal degradation patterns. When pyrolysing at 350 °C, the stochastic state‐space regulator generated a biochar with lower CV in ultimate (i.e. CHNS) compositional analysis than the original feedstock. CONCLUSION: This state‐space controller had the ability to pyrolyse a feedstock and generate a consistent biochar with similar structural properties and consistent compositional characteristics.

A case study, the rise of the pay-to-publish model and the pitfalls of Morchella systematics  ap. 7-38.  aReview  aThe genus Morchella has gone through turbulent taxonomic treatments. Although significant progress in Morchella systematics has been achieved in the past decade, several problems remain unresolved and taxonomy in the genus is still in flux. In late 2019, a paper published in the open-access journal Scientific Reports raised serious concerns about the taxonomic stability of the genus, but also about the future of academic publishing. The paper, entitled “High diversity of Morchella and a novel lineage of the esculenta clade from the north Qinling Mountains revealed by GCPSR-based study” by Phanpadith and colleagues, suffered from gross methodological errors, included false results and artifactual phylogenies, had misapplied citations throughout, and proposed a new species name invalidly. Although the paper was eventually retracted by Scientific Reports in 2021, the fact that such an overtly flawed and scientifically unsound paper was published in a high-ranked Q1 journal raises alarming questions about quality controls and safekeeping procedures in scholarly publishing. Using this paper as a case study, we provide a critical review on the pitfalls of Morchella systematics followed by a series of recommendations for the delimitation of species, description of taxa, and ultimately for a sustainable taxonomy in Morchella. Problems and loopholes in the academic publishing system are also identified and discussed, and additional quality controls in the pre- and post-publication stages are proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMorchella 3acase studies 3amodels 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3avandalism1 aAlvarado, Pablo1 aMoreau, Pierre-Arthur1 aAssyov, Boris1 aHalasů, Viktorie1 aStadler, Marc1 aRinaldi, Andrea1 aMarques, Guilhermina1 aZervakis, Georgios I.1 aBorovička, Jan1 aVan Vooren, Nicolas1 aGrebenc, Tine1 aRichard, Franck1 aTaşkin, Hatira1 aGube, Matthias1 aSammut, Carmel1 aAgnello, Carlo1 aBaroni, Timothy J.1 aCrous, Pedro1 aFryssouli, Vassiliki1 aGonou, Zacharoula1 aGuidori, Urbano1 aGulden, Gro1 aHansen, Karen1 aKristiansen, Roy1 aLaessøe, Thomas,1 aMateos, Javier1 aMiller, Andrew1 aMoreno Plaza, Gabriel,1 aPerić, Branislav,1 aPolemis, Elias1 aSalom, Joan Carles1 aSiquier, José Leonardo1 aSnabl, Martin1 aWeholt, Øyvind1 aBellanger, Jean-Michel0 tMycological progress.g2022 Jan., v. 21, no. 1 p.7-38dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000124x1617-416X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11557-021-01755-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003400152245012600186520130700312592002801619650001101647650001901658650001701677650001601694650001701710650001101727650002101738650001301759650002401772650001201796650000901808650001101817650001001828650001501838651001101853653001701864653002301881653001901904653002001923653001701943700002401960700002101984773009802005856008702103852000902190655001202199IND60766363320221119111309.0220314e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076636332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1186312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNascimento da Silva, Gabriela10aRenewable hydrogen production to deal with wind power surpluses and mitigate carbon dioxide emissions from oil refineries  aThe variability and unpredictability of renewable energy sources represents a challenge to integrate these sources into power systems at high penetration levels. This study evaluates the use of wind energy surplus to produce hydrogen for hydrotreating units in oil refineries, replacing the steam methane reform, and to provide oxygen for oxy-combustion carbon dioxide (CO₂) capture in Fluid Catalytic Cracking units. A case study in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, was applied with six scenarios: two reference scenarios of hydrogen production, steam reform with and without carbon capture; and the other four regarding the use of wind energy to produce hydrogen and oxygen via water electrolysis. Results showed that the technological proposal has the potential to mitigate up to 22.11% of the greenhouse gas emissions in the refinery, from both hydrogen production and Fluid Catalytic Cracking units, at abatement costs in the range of −41 to 868 US$/tCO₂. The lowest value depends on a severe reduction in electrolysis costs and the expected high penetration of renewable energies on electrical systems. Moreover, 26% of the total electricity surplus could be oriented to produce renewable hydrogen to supply the refinery demand, considering an electric system with 30% share of wind energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3aelectricity 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gases 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amethane 3aoils 3aoxygen 3asteam 3awind power 3aBrazil 0aPower-to-gas 0aRenewable hydrogen 0aOxy-combustion 0aEnergy planning 0aOil refining1 aRochedo, Pedro R.R.1 aSzklo, Alexandre0 tApplied energy.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 311 p.118631-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1186313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010100159300002000260520153300280592002801813650002401841650001101865650001701876650002201893650001101915650001301926650001101939650002301950700001901973700002401992700002502016700001602041773012302057856007502180852000902255655001202264IND60559371420170926000000.0161210e20141113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055937142DNAL7 a10.1021/jp504427a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPieffet, Gilles10aExploring the Local Elastic Properties of Bilayer Membranes Using Molecular Dynamics Simulations  ap. 12883-12891.  aMembrane mechanical elastic properties regulate a variety of cellular processes involving local membrane deformation, such as ion channel function and vesicle fusion. In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulations to estimate the local elastic properties of a membrane. For this, we calculated the energy needed to extract a DOPE lipid molecule, modified with a linker chain, from a POPC bilayer membrane using the umbrella sampling technique. Although the extraction energy entails several contributions related not only to elastic deformation but also to solvation, careful analysis of the potential of mean force (PMF) allowed us to dissect the elastic contribution. With this information, we calculated an effective linear spring constant of 44 ± 4 kJ·nm–²·mol–¹ for the DOPC membrane, in agreement with experimental estimates. The membrane deformation profile was determined independently during the stretching process in molecular detail, allowing us to fit this profile to a previously proposed continuum elastic model. Through this approach, we calculated an effective membrane spring constant of 42 kJ·nm–²·mol–¹, which is in good agreement with the PMF calculation. Furthermore, the solvation energy we derived from the data is shown to match the solvation energy estimated from critical micelle formation constants. This methodology can be used to determine how changes in lipid composition or the presence of membrane modifiers can affect the elastic properties of a membrane at a local level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelastic deformation 3aenergy 3aion channels 3alipid composition 3alipids 3amicelles 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics1 aBotero, Alonso1 aPeters, Günther

The role of misconceptions and knowledge gaps  aAlthough the UK consumes a substantial amount of shellfish, most is imported (e.g. prawns), while locally harvested molluscs and crustaceans (e.g. mussels, crab) tend to be exported. This study aimed to investigate whether a low rate of local shellfish consumption in the UK is due to misunderstandings or knowledge gaps about the potential health and environmental risks and benefits of consumption. Following the Mental Models Approach, the present paper reveals: 1) qualitative results from 26 stakeholder/public interviews which identified 10 key misunderstandings and knowledge gaps, including incorrect beliefs about health risks and a lack of knowledge about the relative environmental benefits compared to other foods (key misunderstandings included some parts of a crab are poisonous if eaten, and the majority of UK shellfish is farmed), and 2) quantitative results from a survey (n = 1,433) that explored the degree to which these misunderstandings and knowledge gaps may influence consumption intentions in the wider UK population. Survey results suggested the number of misunderstandings and knowledge gaps significantly predicted shellfish consumption intentions even after controlling for demographics, food related values, and past consumption behaviour. Path analyses revealed their impact on intentions was partially mediated via Theory of Planned Behaviour variables. Results could inform information campaigns supporting consumers to make more informed decisions regarding a group of foods that are potentially both healthy and relatively environmentally friendly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3acrabs 3ademographic statistics 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental assessment 3afoods 3ahealth effects assessments 3ainterviews 3amussels 3apath analysis 3aseafood consumption 3ashellfish 3ashrimp 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3aUnited Kingdom 0aShellfish 0aConsumers 0aKnowledge 0aPerceptions 0aMental models 0aTheory of planned behaviour1 aWhite, Mathew P.1 aGaze, William H.1 aRedshaw, Clare H.0 tAppetite.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 143 p.104352-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2019.1043523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245009900164300001800263520163900281592002801920650000801948650001701956650001301973650001801986650001602004650001002020650001602030650003102046650002502077650002502102650003002127650001402157650001502171650001802186650002202204650001602226651001002242700001902252700001902271700001302290773017902303856007802482852000902560655001202569IND60118096220221119062806.0141126e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011809622DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.034686-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaur, Jasvinder10aSphingomonas laterariae sp. nov., isolated from a hexachlorocyclohexane-contaminated dump site  ap. 2891-2896.  aA Gram-staining-negative, non-motile, cream-coloured and rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain LNB2T, was isolated from a hexachlorocyclohexane-contaminated dump site in the village of Ummari, in northern India.

In DNA–DNA hybridizations, the levels of DNA–DNA relatedness between the novel strain and S. haloaromaticamans A175T and S. histidinilytica UM2T were found to be low (8.6 % and 5.6 %, respectively). The genomic DNA G+C content of strain LNB2T was 61.0 mol%. The novel strain’s predominant fatty acids were summed feature 8 (C18 : 1ω7c and/or C18 : 1ω6c), C16 : 0, summed feature 3 (C16 : 1ω7c and/or C16 : 1ω6c), C14 : 0 2-OH, C17 : 1ω6c and 11-methyl C18 : 1ω7c. The major ubiquinone was Q-10, the predominant polyamine was homospermidine, and the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, sphingoglycolipid, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine. Based on the phylogenetic, biochemical and chemotaxonomic evidence and the results of the DNA–DNA hybridizations, strain LNB2T represents a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonas laterariae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is LNB2T ( = MTCC 10873T = CCM 7880T = DSM 25432T).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aSphingomonas 3abacteria 3achemotaxonomy 3afatty acids 3agenes 3anew species 3anucleic acid hybridization 3anucleotide sequences 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphylogeny 3apolyamines 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence homology 3aubiquinones 3aIndia1 aKaur, Jaspreet1 aNiharika, Neha1 aLal, Rup0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2012 Dec., v. 62, no.

These management strategies increase wood production potential and expand forest areas. However, knowledge of the impact of these practices on the diversity and resilience of soil fungal communities is scarce. This study investigated soil fungal community composition of young (21–40 years-old) Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) dominated stands located in Latvia and Estonia. The study includes data from 62 sampling sites and 2480 soil cores. Fungal internal transcribed spacer amplicons (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA region) of DNA extracted from forest floor and fine soil fractions were sequenced using the PacBio sequencing platform. 3176 quality filtered OTUs were detected, and 73.9% of these were identified as fungi. Fungal community composition was mainly differentiated based on soil pH and sampling site. Regarding former land use, relative abundance of the genus Solicoccozyma was higher in samples from former agricultural sites and some species from genera Cortinarius and Russula were identified as more indicative of particular former land use. Litter saprotrophic fungi and fungi of the genus Thelephora were significantly more highly represented in unmanaged sites than in sites where thinning was performed. In conclusion, differences among soil fungal communities are mainly influenced by soil pH and sampling site. Former land use and management have a significant effect on specific genera of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi.  aPublisher supplied data  a1.1.1.2/VIAA/2/18/298cEuropean Regional Development Fund  aEMP442cNorway-Baltic financial mechanism  aSilva NovacNovo Nordisk Fonden  aT160148cState Forest Management Centre project  aPSG136cEstonian Science Foundation Grant  aPRG1615cEstonian Science Foundation Grant 3aCortinarius 3aPicea abies 3aRussula 3aThelephora 3aafforestation 3acommunity structure 3aectomycorrhizae 3aforest litter 3aforests 3afungal communities 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aland use 3aresearch 3asaprotrophs 3asoil fungi 3asoil pH 3awood 3aEstonia 3aLatvia 3aNorway1 aTedersoo, Leho1 aAgan, Ahto1 aAdamson, Kalev1 aBitenieks, Kriss1 aGaitnieks, Talis1 aDrenkhan, Rein0 tEuropean journal of forest research.g2022 June, v. 141, no. 3 p.503-516dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870054x1612-46697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-022-01454-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002300180245005600203300002000259506007600279520142700355592002801782506003701810650002201847650001701869650001201886650001601898650001101914650002101925650001301946650001701959650002201976773012301998856007502121852000902196655001202205IND60559371520221207141555.0161210e20141113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055937152DNAL7 a10.1021/jp50598852doi7 aPMC42344372pmcid7 a253195862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaxton, Michael J.10aWanted: Scalable Tracers for Diffusion Measurements  ap. 12805-12817.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aScalable tracers are potentially a useful tool to examine diffusion mechanisms and to predict diffusion coefficients, particularly for hindered diffusion in complex, heterogeneous, or crowded systems. Scalable tracers are defined as a series of tracers varying in size but with the same shape, structure, surface chemistry, deformability, and diffusion mechanism. Both chemical homology and constant dynamics are required. In particular, branching must not vary with size, and there must be no transition between ordinary diffusion and reptation. Measurements using scalable tracers yield the mean diffusion coefficient as a function of size alone; measurements using nonscalable tracers yield the variation due to differences in the other properties. Candidate scalable tracers are discussed for two-dimensional (2D) diffusion in membranes and three-dimensional diffusion in aqueous solutions. Correlations to predict the mean diffusion coefficient of globular biomolecules from molecular mass are reviewed briefly. Specific suggestions for the 3D case include the use of synthetic dendrimers or random hyperbranched polymers instead of dextran and the use of core–shell quantum dots. Another useful tool would be a series of scalable tracers varying in deformability alone, prepared by varying the density of crosslinking in a polymer to make say “reinforced Ficoll” or “reinforced hyperbranched polyglycerol.”  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaqueous solutions 3acrosslinking 3adextran 3adiffusivity 3aficoll 3amolecular weight 3apolymers 3aquantum dots 3atracer techniques0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 Nov. 13, v. 118, no. 45 p.12805-12817dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp50598853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01529naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245011800162300001400280500001400294520036000308592002800668650001500696650001200711650001000723651001000733653001800743653004500761653001100806653003100817653001500848653001300863700002000876700001900896700001700915700001600932773009300948856008101041852000901122655001201131IND60699278320221121171405.0210117e20140402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069927832DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.396.67522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ming10aFirst description of the female of Sarcophaga (Sarcorohdendorfia) gracilior (Chen, 1975) (Diptera, Sarcophagidae)  ap. 43-53.  aNAL-light  aSarcophaga (Sarcorohdendorfia) gracilior (Chen, 1975) is documented from specimens collected in Hubei Province, China, using morphological characters and wing interference patterns (WIPs).

In this study, we have analyzed OPFRs (10 kinds: tris(chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCPP), tris(1,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate (TDCP), tris(phenyl) phosphate (TPhP), tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP), diphenylcresylphosphate (DCP), tris(methylphenyl) phosphate (TCP), tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBEP), 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDP), and tris(butyl) phosphate (TBP)) in both water and sludge samples collected from different phases of a WWTP upgrading. The results show that TCPP and TCEP were mainly present in the aqueous phase, whereas TEHP dominated in the solid phase. The overall OPFR reduction efficiencies were above 40% through whole treatment processes by all the phases. More OPFRs reduction efficiency in primary sedimentation tanks was higher mainly because of bigger tank volume. The anaerobic zone in all cases could decrease OPFRs by over 13%. The removal of OPFRs in the oxic zone highly varied under the influence of the aeration pipe, water temperature, and aeration amount. Compared with chlorinated OPFRs, aryl and alkyl OPFRs were easier to reduce and less affected by the upgrading. Because OPFRs have been widely used in plastic materials such as pipes, WWTP upgrading – which usually requires more aeration and addition of reagents and instruments and the aim of which is normally to reduce more COD, N and P -- has introduced more OPFRs into the water within the WWTP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aaeration 3aappearance (quality) 3abiphenyl 3aeffluents 3aflame retardants 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3aphosphates 3apipes 3aplastics 3asampling 3asludge 3atanks 3avolume 3awastewater treatment 3awater 3awater temperature 0aOrganophosphate flame retardant 0aWWTP upgrade 0aA/O 0aReversed A2/O 0aA2/O1 aLi, Shenghong1 aZhu, Fenfen1 aLi, Chenghui1 aXu, Yiping1 aQing, Dahan1 aWang, Jiawei0 tChemosphere.g2020 Oct., v. 256 p.126895-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1268953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03721naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001900190245012200209506007600331520183700407592002802244506003702272650002002309650001302329650001802342650001702360650001602377650001002393650001202403650003602415651001402451653001402465653002202479653002702501700001802528700002102546700001802567700001602585700001702601700002202618700002502640700001702665700002002682700002002702700002102722700001902743700001602762700001802778700002302796700002202819700002402841700002102865700002102886773009502907856008403002852000903086655001203095IND60653716920221207132121.0190726e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065371692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2019.1043712doi7 aPMC66824932pmcid7 a313232462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFries, Lisa R.10aMaternal feeding practices and children's food intake during an ad libitum buffet meal: Results from the GUSTO cohort  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aParents' feeding practices have been shown to be associated with children's food intake and weight status, but little is known about feeding practices in Asian countries. This study used behavioral observation to explore the feeding practices of 201 mothers of 4.5 year-old children in Singapore during an ad libitum buffet lunch. Feeding practices were coded from videos, focusing on behaviors used to prompt the child to eat more food (autonomy-supportive and coercive-controlling prompts to eat, suggesting items from buffet), those to reduce intake (restriction, questioning food choice), and those related to eating rate (hurrying or slowing child eating). Child outcome measures included energy consumed, variety of food items selected, and BMI. Maternal restriction and trying to slow child eating rate were associated with higher energy consumed by the child (r = 0.19 and 0.13, respectively; p < 0.05). Maternal autonomy-supportive prompts and restriction were associated with a greater variety of items selected by children (r = 0.19 and 0.15, respectively; p < 0.05). The frequency of maternal feeding practice use differed across ethnic groups, with Malay mothers using the most prompts to eat (p < 0.05), Chinese mothers most likely to question a child's food choice (p < 0.01), and Indian mothers the last likely to tell the child to eat faster (p < 0.001). There were no differences between ethnic groups for other feeding practices. No associations were found between feeding practices and child BMI. It is possible that feeding practices related to restriction and slowing child eating are adopted in response to children who consume larger portions, although longitudinal or intervention studies are needed to confirm the direction of this relationship and create local recommendations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody mass index 3achildren 3aenergy intake 3afood choices 3afood intake 3alunch 3amothers 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aSingapore 0aPreschool 0aFeeding practices 0aBehavioral observation1 aChan, Mei Jun1 aQuah, Phaik Ling1 aToh, Jia Ying1 aFogel, Anna1 aGoh, Ai Ting1 aAris, Izzuddin M.1 aBroekman, Birit F.P.1 aCai, Shirong1 aTint, Mya Thway1 aChong, Yap Seng1 aShek, Lynette P.1 aLee, Yung Seng1 aYap, Fabian1 aTan, Kok Hian1 aGluckman, Peter D.1 aGodfrey, Keith M.1 aSilva Zolezzi, Irma1 aForde, Ciaran G.1 aChong, Mary F.F.0 tAppetite.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 142 p.104371-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2019.1043713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012100168520148900289592002801778650001301806650001701819650001301836650001801849650002001867650001101887650001301898650002901911650001301940650001801953650001501971650001301986650001801999650001702017650001502034650001202049650001602061650001102077651001202088653001802100653001202118653000902130653002002139653001302159653000702172653000802179653000602187653000902193653000702202653000902209700002702218700001902245700002402264773009802288856008502386852000902471655001202480IND60755755420221120084336.0220412e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075575542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geodrs.2021.e004412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolf, Kari A.10aNitrous oxide and nitrate as indicators of subsoil removal of N in pig slurry applied to Luvisols in Western Denmark  aThis one-year study examined effects of autumn- vs. spring- application of pig slurry, and the effect of a nitrification inhibitor (DMPP) for autumn-applied slurry, on transport and transformations of nitrogen in the soil profile. Duplicate field plots had ceramic suction cells at 50, 100, and 150 cm depths to calculate leaching for each treatment using NO₃⁻ concentrations and percolation simulated using a water transport model. Furthermore, soil moisture, soil texture and bulk density at 50, 100 and 150 cm depth, and water table level, were recorded. During campaigns, subsurface N₂O concentrations at 20, 50, 100, and 150 cm depths, and N₂O fluxes to the atmosphere, were monitored for indicators of denitrification activity. Autumn-applied pig slurry showed evidence for NO₃⁻ removal between 50 and 100 cm depth, and N₂O concentration profiles indicated high denitrification activity around 50 cm depth. Autumn-applied slurry showed higher N₂O emissions and lower crop yields compared to spring application, indicating losses occurred during winter. DMPP did not reduce average NO₃⁻ leaching, nor affect N₂O emissions, but treatment effects were confounded by heterogeneity in compaction, clay content, and water table depth at plot level. The study showed that accounting for transport and transformations of N in the subsoil can contribute to understanding the environmental controls of N leaching, as well as direct and indirect N₂O emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLuvisols 3abulk density 3aceramics 3aclay fraction 3adenitrification 3amodels 3anitrates 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3apig manure 3aslurries 3asoil profiles 3asoil texture 3asoil water 3asubsoil 3awater table 3awinter 3aDenmark 0aNitrous oxide 0aNitrate 0aDMPP 0aDenitrification 0aLuvisols 0aAM 0aAMN 0aC 0aDMPP 0aSM 0aWFPS1 aBørgesen, Christen D.1 aPlauborg, Finn1 aPetersen, Søren O.0 tGeoderma regional.g2022 Mar., v. 28 p.e00441-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23258x2352-00947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geodrs.2021.e004413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03641naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245012900163300001800292500001500310520188200325592002802207650004502235650003002280650001702310650001802327650002402345650002502369650003802394650001602432650003002448650001402478650001102492650002502503650001902528650001802547650002202565650001102587650001102598651001102609653003302620700002102653700002202674700002102696700001902717700002402736700002002760700002402780700001702804773017902821856007803000852000903078655001203087IND60118096520221119062808.0141126e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011809652DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.038612-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartini, Marta10a‘Candidatus Phytoplasma convolvuli’, a new phytoplasma taxon associated with bindweed yellows in four European countries  ap. 2910-2915.  a2019-12-04  aPlants of Convolvulus arvensis exhibiting symptoms of undersized leaves, shoot proliferation and yellowing, collectively defined as bindweed yellows, were sampled in different regions of Europe and assessed for phytoplasma infection by PCR amplification using phytoplasma universal rRNA operon primer pairs. Positive results were obtained for all diseased plants. RFLP analysis of amplicons comprising the16S rRNA gene alone or the16S rRNA gene and 16-23S intergenic spacer region indicated that the detected phytoplasmas were distinguishable from all other previously described rRNA gene sequences. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences derived from seven selected phytoplasma strains (BY-S57/11, BY-S62/11, BY-I1015, BY-I1016, BY-BH1, BY-BH2 and BY-G) showed that they were nearly identical (99.9–100 % gene sequence similarity) but shared less than 97.5 % similarity with comparable sequences of other phytoplasmas. Thus, BY phytoplasmas represent a new taxon whose closest relatives are stolbur phytoplasma strains and ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma fragariae’ with which they share 97.2 % and 97.1 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences confirmed that bindweed yellows phytoplasma strains collectively represent a distinct lineage within the phytoplasma clade and share a common ancestor with previously published or proposed ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma’ taxa within a major branch including aster yellows and stolbur phytoplasmas. On the basis of unique 16S rRNA gene sequences and biological properties that include a single host plant species and a geographical distribution limited to parts of Europe, the bindweed yellows (BY) phytoplasmas represent a coherent but discrete taxon, ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma convolvuli’, with strain BY-S57/11 (GenBank accession no. JN833705) as the reference strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3ageographical distribution 3amicrobiology 3aribosomal RNA 3aStolbur phytoplasma 3aConvolvulus arvensis 3aCandidatus Phytoplasma convolvuli 3ahost plants 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aphylogeny 3aoperon 3anucleotide sequences 3aintergenic DNA 3aaster yellows 3asequence homology 3aleaves 3ashoots 3aEurope 0aBindweed yellows phytoplasma1 aMarcone, Carmine1 aMitrović, Jelena1 aMaixner, Michael1 aDelić, Duška1 aMyrta, A.q(Arben),1 aErmacora, Paolo1 aBertaccini, Assunta1 aDuduk, Bojan0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2012 Dec., v. 62, no.

The obtained MLS was characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM, TEM, VSM. The results showed that MLS had a good magnetic behavior in an applied magnetic field and its saturation magnetization intensity was up to 43.98 emu/g. Moreover, MLS exhibited excellent adsorption properties for Cr(Ⅵ) (57.14 mg/g) and Rhodamine B (22.47 mg/g). Simultaneously, the adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm experiments indicated that the data was agreed well with the pseudo-second-order and Langmuir model, respectively. After five regeneration cycles, the desorption efficiencies of Cr(Ⅵ) and Rhodamine B could reach more than 70% and 85%, respectively. Hence, the magnetic lignosulfonate is a promising material as a highly adsorptive and recyclable adsorbent for removing metal ions and cationic pollutants in wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3achromium 3adesorption 3alignosulfonates 3amagnetic fields 3ametal ions 3apollutants 3arhodamines 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aLignosulfonate 0aFe3O4 0aCr(Ⅵ) 0aRhodamine B 0aAdsorption1 aGu, Fei1 aChang, Jianmin0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2019 Aug. 05, v. 375 p.174-181dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.04.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04572naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245012800153300001800281520307400299592002803373650001003401650002303411650001203434650002203446650001603468650001603484650002803500650001403528650001303542650000903555650001803564650001803582650002703600650001603627650002103643650002303664650001403687650002303701650000903724650001803733650002903751650001003780653001703790653002303807700001803830700001603848773009803864856007103962852000904033655001204042IND60568817220221118113925.0170517s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056881722DNAL7 a10.1071/AN151422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ti-Ying10aEffects of nanoparticle chromium on chromium absorbability, growth performance, blood parameters and carcass traits of pigs  ap. 1193-1200.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary supplementation of nanoparticle trivalent chromium on chromium absorbability, growth performance, blood parameters and carcass characteristics of pigs. In Trial 1, five growing pigs (Landrace × Yorkshire × Duroc) (initial average weight was 31.3 ± 2.0 kg) were used in a 5 × 5 Latin square design as the Control group (without supplement of chromium), the chromium chloride group (CrCl3), the chromium picolinate group (CrPic), the nanoparticle chromium chloride group (NanoCrCl3), and the nanoparticle chromium picolinate group (NanoCrPic). The pigs were adapted for 7 days, followed by a 5-day test period and a collection period. The chromium was added at a 200 μg/kg level to the diet using different chromium sources for evaluating the chromium absorbability. The results of Trial 1 indicated that there were no differences in feed components digestibility among the groups, but the absorbability of chromium in the NanoCrPic (27.5%) group was the highest, whereas that in the CrCl3 group was the lowest (4.91%). Moreover, the chromium source, nanoparticle size and interaction effects were observed between these two factors (P < 0.001). In Trial 2, 60 Landrace × Yorkshire × Duroc growing pigs (average bodyweight was 76.7 ± 4.5 kg) were randomly allotted to five dietary treatment groups as used in Trial 1, each group with four pens (three pigs/pen). The study was conducted for 60 days. Their growth performance, carcass and meat traits were also evaluated. Trial 2 results indicated that feed intake in the chromium-added groups was greater (P < 0.007) than that in the Control group. The average daily bodyweight gain in the chromium-added groups was greater than that in the Control group (P = 0.046). The serum non-esterified fatty acids level was lower (P < 0.0001) in the NanoCr groups. Serum chromium concentration was increased by dietary chromium supplementation, and the chromium source, nanoparticle size and their interaction effects (P < 0.001) were observed. The average back fat thickness in the CrPic and NanoCrPic groups was lower (P < 0.05) than that of the Control group. Meat chromium content was elevated by dietary chromium supplementation, particularly in the CrPic and NanoCrPic groups (P < 0.05). The chromium source, nanoparticle size and interaction effects between these two factors were observed in serum non-esterified fatty acids and chromium content. The muscle chromium content also affected by chromium source and displayed interaction of source and nanoparticle size. In conclusion, chromium supplementation could increase feed intake and average daily gain, serum and longissimus muscle chromium content, as well as reduce back fat thickness of pigs. In addition, nanoparticle organic trivalent chromium could increase chromium absorbability and decrease serum non-esterified fatty acids concentrations. Organic form was better than inorganic form in chromium absorbability, serum and longissimus muscle chromium content and average back fat thickness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDuroc 3aaverage daily gain 3abackfat 3ablood composition 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acarcass characteristics 3achlorides 3achromium 3adiet 3adigestibility 3afat thickness 3afatty acid composition 3afeed intake 3afree fatty acids 3agrowth performance 3alandraces 3alongissimus muscle 3ameat 3ananoparticles 3anutritional intervention 3aswine 0agrowing pigs 0atrivalent chromium1 aFu, Chao-Ming1 aLien, Tu-Fa0 tAnimal production science.g2017, v. 57, no. 6 p.1193-1200dCSIRO Publishingx1836-09397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN151423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002700153245015500180300001600335520150300351592002801854650001801882650001701900650001401917650001301931650001001944650001201954650002501966651002101991653002202012653002502034653003102059653002502090653002802115700001802143700001702161700001702178700001802195773010702213856008702320852000902407655001202416IND50068297020221121173642.0160902e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006829702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, T.-W.q(Tae-Woo),10aVariability in operation-based NOx emission factors with different test routes, and its effects on the real-driving emissions of light diesel vehicles  ap. 377-385.  aThe objective of this study is to quantify the differences in NOx emissions between standard and non-standard driving and vehicle operating conditions, and to estimate by how much NOx emissions exceed the legislative emission limits under typical Korean road traffic conditions. Twelve Euro 3–5 light-duty diesel vehicles (LDDVs) manufactured in Korea were driven on a chassis dynamometer over the standard New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and a representative Korean on-road driving cycle (KDC). NOx emissions, average speeds and accelerations were calculated for each 1-km trip segment, so called averaging windows. The results suggest that the NOx emissions of the tested vehicles are more susceptible to variations in the driving cycles than to those in the operating conditions. Even under comparable operating conditions, the NOx control capabilities of vehicles differ from each other, i.e., NOx control is weaker for the KDC than for the NEDC. The NOx emissions over the KDC for given vehicle operating conditions exceed those over the NEDC by more than a factor of 8. Consequently, on-road NOx emission factors are estimated here to exceed the Euro 5 emission limit by up to a factor of 8, 4 and 3 for typical Korean urban, rural, and motorway road traffic conditions, respectively. Our findings support the development of technical regulations for supplementary real-world emission tests for emission certification and the corresponding research actions taken by automotive industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3acertification 3adynamometers 3aemissions 3aindustry 3aroads 3atraffic 3avehicles (equipment) 3aKorean Peninsula 0aOn-road emissions 0aNitrogen oxide (NOx) 0aLight-duty diesel vehicles 0aOperating conditions 0aRoad traffic conditions1 aPark, Junhong1 aKwon, Sangil1 aLee, Jongtae1 aKim, Jeongsoo0 tScience of the total environment.g2013 Sept. 01, v. 461-462 p.377-385dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245017300168520151300341592002801854650001501882650001601897650001101913650001101924650001601935650001401951650001501965653003001980653002602010653001802036653002902054653004602083700001302129700001402142700001802156700001302174773011202187856008702299852000902386655001202395IND60766363720221119111327.0220314e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076636372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1186452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Mingyu10aProjection method for blockchain-enabled non-iterative decentralized management in integrated natural gas-electric systems and its application in digital twin modelling  aIntegrating natural gas and electricity systems increases system flexibility for the accommodation of the large penetration level of renewable energy and thus achieves decarbonization in the energy system. This paper aims at providing non-iterative and scalable decentralized energy management for multi-integrated natural gas-electricity systems with uncertain wind power. An operation space projection transformation method is proposed to reformulate the electricity and natural gas system operation problems for constructing equivalent feasible operation space with the optimality information contained. Accordingly, the proposed decentralized management is privacy-preserving, low-complex, and globally optimal. Moreover, the mathematical proof of the optimality of the reformulated problem is provided. In addition to privacy protection, trust issues are taken into account. Blockchain is applied to safeguard the proposed decentralized management against potential malicious behaviours. We introduce how the proposed decentralized management is embedded in the consensus process of the blockchain. The potential of the projection transformation method in the digital twin application is analyzed. Numerical results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed decentralized energy management method. The synergistic effect and robustness of the proposed operation model are embodied, while the computational accuracy and performance of the non-iterative solution technique are validated.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablockchain 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3amodels 3anatural gas 3asynergism 3awind power 0aIntegrated energy systems 0aCoordinated operation 0aDigital twins 0aDecentralized management 0aOperation space projection transformation1 aGan, Wei1 aZhou, Yue1 aWen, Jianfeng1 aYao, Wei0 tApplied energy.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 311 p.118645-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1186453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03774naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002800137245012700165300001800292520186200310592002802172650001202200650002302212650000902235650001602244650001002260650002802270650003002298650002402328650002002352650002402372650002702396650001402423650001202437650001602449650002102465650001702486650001202503650001802515650001402533650001302547650001002560650001602570650001302586650002502599650001102624650002102635653002502656653003002681653001602711653001302727653002402740700002402764700002102788700002402809700002402833700001902857700002102876700002502897773009802922856007103020852000903091655001203100IND60568817320221118113920.0170517s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056881732DNAL7 a10.1071/AN151492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarvalho, Isabela P.

Forty-five young bulls, with average bodyweight of 441 ± 30 kg, were allotted into 10 paddocks, with five treatments, each consisting of two paddocks. The bulls were randomly assigned into one of the following five treatments, which consisted of four lipid sources: palm oil (PO), linseed oil, rumen protected fat (soybean-based oil), whole soybean, and a control (without additional fat). Trial duration was 120 days, which included 30 days of adaptation. Supplements were offered daily at 10 g/kg bodyweight per day. Dietary supplements for providing additional fat were formulated to consist of 10% ether extract. Lipid sources did not significantly affect the average daily gain (P = 0.797) or dressing percentage (P = 0.663). Supplementation with PO increased the concentrations of lauric acid (P = 0.036) and myristic acid (P < 0.001) in the muscle and subcutaneous fat. Animals supplemented with linseed oil had significantly higher concentrations of conjugated linolenic acid in the meat (P = 0.036) and fat (P = 0.049) than did control animals. In the present study, the use of various lipid sources in dietary supplements of grazing cattle during finishing period did not affect carcass traits or physical attributes of beef. This absence of statistical significance may be related to the minimum number of repeat paddocks (2) per treatment. Thus, differences that can have a practical significance were not evidenced by statistical analysis. The inclusion of PO and protected fatty acids derived from soybean oil (rumen-protected fat) is not recommended as a method to improve the lipid profile of meat and subcutaneous fat of Nellore cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNellore 3aaverage daily gain 3abeef 3abody weight 3abulls 3acarcass characteristics 3aconjugated linolenic acid 3adietary supplements 3adodecanoic acid 3adressing percentage 3afatty acid composition 3afinishing 3agrazing 3alinseed oil 3ameat composition 3ameat quality 3amuscles 3amyristic acid 3apalm oils 3apastures 3arumen 3asoybean oil 3asoybeans 3astatistical analysis 3asteers 3asubcutaneous fat 0aBrachiaria brizantha 0aconjugated linolenic acid 0alinseed oil 0apalm oil 0arumen-protected fat1 aFiorentini, Giovani1 aLage, Josiane F.1 aMessana, Juliana D.1 aCanesin, Roberta C.1 aRossi, Luis G.1 aReis, Ricardo A.1 aBerchielli, Telma T.0 tAnimal production science.g2017, v. 57, no. 6 p.1170-1178dCSIRO Publishingx1836-09397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN151493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245018600166300001600352520125600368592002801624650002501652650001001677650001101687650001401698650001101712650001501723650001601738650001401754650001701768650000901785650002201794650001601816650003301832650003501865700001901900700002001919773011501939852000902054856008202063655001202145IND4386330020221122212805.0190314e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438633002DNAL7 a10.1007/s10086-006-0808-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHosoo, Yoshihiro14aThe supply of matrix containing glucomannans to the innermost surface of S2 layers is associated with changes in turgor pressure of differentiating tracheids in Cryptomeria japonica  ap. 471-476.  aWe investigated the relationship between turgor pressure and diurnal differences in secondary wall formation of differentiating tracheids. Saplings of Cryptomeria japonica were grown in a growth chamber with 12-h light:12-h dark cycles, and the tangential strain on the inner bark surface was measured as an indicator of the volumetric changes of differentiating cells. The innermost surface of developing secondary walls was then observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy at 1-h intervals after both light and dark periods. Dramatic changes in the aspects of the innermost surface of developing secondary walls occurred 3h after the light was switched on and 4h after the light was switched off. The amorphous material containing glucomannans became evident when the differentiating cells became fully turgid during the dark period. Conversely, cellulose microfibrils became clearly visible when the cell volume was low during the light period. These results suggest that the diurnal periodicity in the supply of hemicellulose-containing matrix to developing secondary walls is associated with the changes in turgor pressure of differentiating tracheids that result from the change in light conditions during the photoperiodic cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptomeria japonica 3atrees 3aturgor 3atracheids 3avolume 3acell walls 3awood fibers 3acellulose 3aglucomannans 3abark 3adiurnal variation 3aperiodicity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3afluorescent antibody technique1 aImai, Takanori1 aYoshida, Masato0 tJournal of wood science.g2006 Dec., v. 52, no. 6 p.471-476dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-006-0808-13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03367naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100003100190245018500221506007600406520167700482592002802159506003702187650002202224650001602246650001702262650001602279650002002295650001902315650001602334650003102350650002202381650001502403650001402418650001802432650002502450650001702475650002202492650001002514651001202524653001402536653002102550653001802571653001602589653002102605700002302626773009502649856008402744852000902828655001202837IND60653717120221207121731.0190719e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065371712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2019.1043702doi7 aPMC67395972pmcid7 a313108352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWertheim-Heck, Sigrid C.O.12aA cross-disciplinary mixed-method approach to understand how food retail environment transformations influence food choice and intake among the urban poor: Experiences from Vietnam  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNutrition insecurity among urban poor in modernizing Asian metropolises is a critical issue. It is well recognized that in urban Asia the poor are food insecure. Across Asia the food retail environment is transforming rapidly, in which supermarkets increasingly replace traditional food vending, like markets and street vendors that the urban poor depend upon. The question is, how these transformations impact the diets of the urban poor? What drives their food choice? What are their daily shopping practices and how does that affect their dietary intake? To investigate this, we developed a cross-disciplinary nutrition and social practices study with a sequential quantitative-qualitative mixed-method design. Building on empirical evidence from Hanoi, Vietnam, the study links (i) food choice and measured dietary intake, with (ii) food retail environment, through (iii) food shopping practices and preferences of 400 women of reproductive age within the context of (iv) their transformative urban lifestyles. Methods included are a retail census with GPS coordinates to map the food retail environment, a household survey, a 24-h diet recall, multi-generation household interviews and shopping trips. We demonstrate that integrated sociological and nutritional perspectives are productive in rapidly generating evidence to comprehend the complex trade-offs between food safety and nutrition in everyday food consumption practices. We describe and reflect on our theoretical mix of dietary intake and social practices research, and our holistic mixed method approach which besides combining quantitative and qualitative methods, also voices the urban poor first hand.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acollective action 3adiet recall 3afood choices 3afood intake 3afood purchasing 3afood retailing 3afood safety 3aglobal positioning systems 3ahousehold surveys 3ainterviews 3alifestyle 3amodernization 3aqualitative analysis 3asupermarkets 3atraditional foods 3awomen 3aVietnam 0aNutrition 0aSocial practices 0aMixed methods 0aConsumption 0aFood environment1 aRaneri, Jessica E.0 tAppetite.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 142 p.104370-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2019.1043703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005400151245013300205520139800338592002801736650000901764650001101773650001401784650001501798650001301813650002501826650001601851653002101867653002201888653002201910653002101932653002001953700001601973700001601989700001402005700001502019773010302034856008602137852000902223655001202232IND60745847620221121213837.0210904e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074584762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2021.1060712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAldrin, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2718-852810aCaveats with estimating natural mortality rates in stock assessment models using age aggregated catch data and abundance indices  aWe consider the challenge in estimating the natural mortality, M, in a standard statistical fish stock assessment model based on time series of catch- and abundance-at-age data. Though anecdotal evidence and empirical experience lend support to the fact that this parameter may be difficult to estimate, the current literature lacks a theoretical justification. We first discuss the estimatability of a time-invariant M theoretically and present necessary conditions for a constant M to be identifiable. We then investigate the practical usefulness of this by estimating M from simulated data based on models fitted to 19 fish stocks. Using the same data sets, we next explore several model formulations of time varying M, with a pre-specified mean value. Cross validation is used to assess the prediction performance of the candidate models. Our results show that a time-invariant M can be estimated with reasonable precision for a few stocks with long time series and typically high values of the true M. For most stocks, however, the estimation uncertainty of M is very large. For time-varying M, we find that accounting for variability across age and time using a simple model significantly improves the performance compared to a time-invariant M. No significant improvement is obtained by using complex models, such as, those with time dependencies in variability around mean values of M.  aPublisher supplied data 3afish 3amodels 3amortality 3aprediction 3aresearch 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty 0aStock assessment 0aNatural mortality 0aState-space model 0aCross-validation 0aIdentifiability1 aAanes, F.L.1 aTvete, I.F.1 aAanes, S.1 aSubbey, S.0 tFisheries research.g2021 Nov., v. 243 p.106071-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2021.1060713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245011200208300001300320520167700333592002802010650001502038650001802053650002602071650002402097650002002121650000902141650002002150650001002170650001002180650002602190653001002216653001302226653001202239653001502251653001802266700001902284700001702303700005602320773010502376856008502481852000902566655001202575IND60639373120221120162319.0190624e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063937312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2019.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilkes, E.J.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8410-589414aThe application of faecal egg count results and statistical inference for clinical decision making in foals  ap. 7-12.  aThis study investigated the impact of variability in Parascaris spp. and strongyle faecal egg counts (FEC) from foals on treatment decision-making and detection of a patent infection. A single faecal sample was collected once daily for three days from 53 foals and a FEC was performed on three separate portions of each sample (total of nine egg counts per foal). Differences in the decision to administer an anthelmintic using the results of a single count (C1), the mean of three (X¯1–3) or nine counts (X¯1–9) and the upper 5% confidence limit of the gamma confidence interval (CI) of the estimate of the distribution mean (μ) from three (UCL1–3) and nine counts (UCL1–9) were determined for a range of egg count thresholds. The UCL1–9 was used as the best estimate of μ, hypothesis testing for treatment and the comparison of treatment decision-making using C1, X¯1–3, X¯1–9 and UCL1–3. The results of this study demonstrated that a point estimate (C1 or X¯1–3) was of limited value for estimating the distribution mean of egg counts in faeces and there was overall poor agreement in treatment decision-making for individual foals using C1 compared with UCL1–9. Of the foals with C1 of zero eggs per gram, 54% and 47% had Parascaris and strongyle eggs in subsequent counts, respectively. The egg density in faeces is inhomogeneous, resulting in considerable variability in egg count results for an individual foal: between faecal piles, different portions of a faecal pile and days. The use of the negative binomial distribution CI for μ takes this variability into account and is recommended for use when interpreting FEC data from horses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParascaris 3aanthelmintics 3abinomial distribution 3aconfidence interval 3adecision making 3aeggs 3afecal egg count 3afeces 3afoals 3astatistical inference 0aHorse 0aMcMaster 0aAscarid 0aParascaris 0aCyathostomins1 aWoodgate, R.G.1 aRaidal, S.L.1 aHughes, K.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8405-62680 tVeterinary parasitology.g2019 June, v. 270 p.7-12dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2019.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245014000209300001600349520085400365592002801219596005701247596005701304596006001361650001301421650002901434650001001463650001301473650001601486700005901502700005901561700005901620700005701679700005901736773012601795856008301921852000902004655001202013IND60769313920221120092314.0220811e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076931392DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-021-01757-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEberhardt, Ursula1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1221-707410aRevisiting Hebeloma (Hymenogastraceae, Agaricales) in Japan: four species recombined into other genera but three new species discovered  ap. 447-472.  aHere, we present the results of studies of Japanese Hebeloma collections.

We present a multicomponent reactive transport model CW2D (i.e., Constructed Wetlands 2D), as an extension of the HYDRUS-2D variably saturated water flow and solute transport software package. CW2D was developed to model the biochemical transformation and degradation processes in subsurface-flow CWs. Such wetlands involve a complex mixture of water, substrate, plants, litter, and a variety of microorganisms to provide optimal conditions for improving water quality. The water flow regime in subsurface-flow CWs can be highly dynamic and requires the use of a transient variably saturated flow model. The biochemical components defined in CW2D include dissolved oxygen (DO), three fractions of OM (readily and slowly biodegradable, and inert), four N compounds (ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, and dinitrogen), inorganic P, and heterotrophic and autotrophic microorganisms. Organic N and organic P were modeled as part of the OM. The biochemical degradation and transformation processes were based on Monod-type rate expressions. All process rates and diffusion coefficients were assumed to be temperature dependent. Heterotrophic bacteria were assumed to be responsible for hydrolysis, mineralization of OM (aerobic growth), and denitrification (anoxic growth). Autotrophic bacteria were assumed to be responsible for nitrification, which was modeled as a two-step process. Lysis was considered to be the sum of all decay and sink processes. We demonstrate the performance of the model for one- and two-stage subsurface vertical flow CWs. Model simulations of water flow, tracer transport, and selected biochemical compounds are compared with experimental observations. Limitations of the model are discussed, and needs for model improvements are summarized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerobiosis 3aammonium 3aautotrophic bacteria 3abiodegradability 3acomputer software 3aconstructed wetlands 3adenitrification 3adiffusivity 3adissolved oxygen 3ahydrolysis 3ainorganic phosphorus 3amineralization 3amodel validation 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3apathogens 3apollutants 3arunoff 3asaturated flow 3asimulation models 3asolutes 3asubsurface flow 3atemperature 3atrace elements 3avadose zone 3awastewater 3awater quality1 aŠimůnek, Jirka0 tVadose zone journal.g2005 Nov., v. 4, no. 4 p.924-938dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2004.01663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012500167520131300292592002801605650001001633650001001643650002201653650002701675650002501702650001301727651001001740651002101750653001801771653002901789653002201818653002401840700001401864700001601878700001601894700001401910700005101924700001601975700001501991700001402006700001702020773010302037856008602140852000902226655001202235IND60745847720221121152800.0210904e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074584772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2021.1060752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Binwei10aGenetic pattern fluctuations in wild swimming crab populations, under the influence of continuous mass stock enhancement  aThe swimming crab is an important commercial fishery species in China, Korea and Japan. Overfishing and destruction of habitats in coastal waters mean that the natural resources cannot meet the swimming crab’s increased demands for food, caused by large-scale stock enhancement in Liaoning, China over the last eight years. The genetic response of the local wild populations to such a large-scale release has not been investigated. Here, we monitored the temporal variations in genetic diversity and structure in Panjin and Yingkou using eighteen microsatellite markers across six years. A high level of genetic diversity was maintained in these populations, but significant deviation from HWE was observed (P < 0.05). The Fᵢₛ was positive. Genetic diversity indices were not stable and fluctuations were particularly apparent in the temporal Panjin population. The genetic differentiation was low but such fluctuations or differences exhibited in the genetic architecture may reflect the interactions between the crab life cycle and intensive anthropogenic manipulations. Our results strongly inferred that large-scale stock enhancement of the swimming crab altered the genetic status of the local population structure. Several suggestions have been proposed to achieve successful stock enhancement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3acrabs 3agenetic variation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation structure 3aresearch 3aChina 3aKorean Peninsula 0aSwimming crab 0aPortunus trituberculatus 0aStock enhancement 0aGenetic diversities1 aZhang, Xi1 aWang, Ziwei1 aLi, Weiyuan1 aZhang, Qi1 aLiu, Qi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4730-47361 aLiu, Wenlei1 aZhang, Lei1 aLiu, Ying1 aWang, Chenqi0 tFisheries research.g2021 Nov., v. 243 p.106075-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2021.1060753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245009900163300001600262500001500278520129000293592002801583596006201611650001001673650001301683650001501696650001601711650001001727650001001737650001701747650002301764650001401787650001701801651001001818651001301828653001501841653001001856653002501866700002501891700002001916700002801936700002201964700002101986700002102007700001702028700002202045700005902067700002002126710002802146773012402174856007702298852000902375655001202384IND60673495220221117190613.0191018e20180316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067349522DNAL7 a10.1093/jhered/esx0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalenti, Andrea10aGenomic Analysis Suggests KITLG is Responsible for a Roan Pattern in two Pakistani Goat Breeds  ap. 315-319.  agolden set  aThe roan coat color pattern is described as the presence of white hairs intermixed with pigmented hairs. This kind of pigmentation pattern has been observed in many domestic species, including the goat. The molecular mechanisms and inheritance that underlie this pattern are known for some species and the KITLG gene has been shown associated with this phenotype. To date, no research effort has been carried out to find the gene(s) that control(s) roan coat color pattern in goats. In the present study, after genotyping with the GoatSNP50 BeadChip, 35 goats that showed a roan pattern and that belonged to two Pakistan breeds (Group A) were analyzed and then compared to 740 goats of 39 Italian and Pakistan goat breeds that did not have the same coat color pattern (Group B). Runs of homozygosity-based and XP-EHH analyses were used to identify unique genomic regions potentially associated with the roan pattern. A total of 3 regions on chromosomes 5, 6, and 12 were considered unique among the group A versus group B comparisons. The A region > 1.7 Mb on chromosome 5 was the most divergent between the two groups. This region contains six genes, including the KITLG gene. Our findings support the hypothesis that the KITLG gene may be associated with the roan phenotype in goats.  aPublisher supplied data  cIowa State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009227 3acolor 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3agoat breeds 3agoats 3ahairs 3ahomozygosity 3aindigenous species 3aphenotype 3apigmentation 3aItaly 3aPakistan 0aCoat color 0aKITLG 0aselection signatures1 aBertolini, Francesca1 aWilliams, Jamie1 aMoaeen-ud-Din, Muhammad1 aFrattini, Stefano1 aCoizet, Beatrice1 aPagnacco, Giulio1 aReecy, James1 aRothschild, Max F1 aCrepaldi, Paola1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6526-21621 aHrbek, Tomáš,2 aItalian Goat Consortium0 tJournal of heredity.g2018 Mar. 16, v. 109, no. 3 p.315-319dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl46534x1465-73337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esx0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245010500208300001600313520184900329592002802178596004102206596006002247650001502307650001902322650001402341650001202355650001102367650001202378650001402390650002102404650001702425650001202442650001302454650001602467651001002483700002202493700002902515773014202544856008302686852000902769655001202778IND60777913620221118062455.0220523e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077791362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10342-022-01444-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmeztegui, Aitor1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2006-155910aUncertainty of biomass stocks in Spanish forests: a comprehensive comparison of allometric equations  ap. 395-407.  aBiomass and carbon content are essential indicators for monitoring forest ecosystems and their role in climate action, but their estimation is not straightforward. A typical approach to solve these limitations has been the estimation of tree or stand biomass based on forest inventory data, using either allometric equations or biomass expansion factors. Many allometric equations exist, but very few studies have assessed how the calculation methods used may impact outcomes and how this impact depends on genera, functional group, climate or forest structural attributes. In this study we evaluate the differences in biomass estimates yielded by the most widely used biomass equations in Spain. We first quantify the discrepancies at tree level and among the main forest tree species. We observed that the divergences in carbon estimations between different equations increased with tree size, especially in the case of hardwoods and for diameters beyond the range used to calibrate the equations. At the plot level, we found considerable differences between the biomass values predicted using different methods (above 25% in one out of three plots), which constitutes a warning against the uncritical choice of equations to determine biomass or carbon values. The spatial representation of the differences revealed geographical patterns related to the dominance of fast-growing species such as Eucalyptus or Pinus pinaster, with a minor effect of forest structure, and almost no effect of climate. Finally, we observed that differences were mostly due to the data source rather than the modelling approach or equation used. Based on our results, BEF equations seem a valid and unbiased option to provide nation-level estimations of carbon balance, although local equations should preferably be used if they are available for the target area.  aPublisher supplied data  aLIFE16 CCM/ES/000065cLIFE programme  aPID2019-111781RB-I00cAgencia Estatal de Investigación 3aEucalyptus 3aPinus pinaster 3aallometry 3abiomass 3acarbon 3aclimate 3aequations 3aforest inventory 3aforest trees 3aforests 3aresearch 3auncertainty 3aSpain1 aRodrigues, Marcos1 aGranda Aguilar, Víctor,0 tEuropean journal of forest research.g2022 June, v. 141, no. 3 p.395-407dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870054x1612-46697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-022-01444-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245017600169520152900345592002801874650000801902650002201910650002401932650001301956650001401969650001001983650003401993650003002027650002102057650002302078650001602101650002902117653001202146653000802158653002802166653001902194653003402213653000802247653000702255653000802262653000802270653000702278700001702285700001702302700002402319700001902343700001702362700002202379773009102401856008502492852000902577655001202586IND60755755820221122065156.0211123e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075575582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plgene.2021.1003442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aC.K.V., Santhi10aGenome-wide exploration of auxin response factors (ARFs) and their expression dynamics in response to abiotic stresses and growth regulators in coconut (Cocos nucifera L.)  aAuxin response factors (ARFs) are a class of transcription factors with the ability to bind specifically to the promoter region of auxin-responsive genes in plants and thereby modulate various aspects of biological processes and responses to diverse environmental conditions. Identification and characterization of ARF gene families have been undertaken in various plant species; however, no such data, delineating ARFs in coconut, is available. Through genome-wide analysis, we have identified 20 CnARF (Cocos nucifera ARF) genes in the genome of a dwarf cultivar, Chowghat Green Dwarf. Evolutionary analysis of CnARFs, along with ARFs from oil palm and date palm, showed that palm ARFs could be classified into three major clades. Multiple sequence alignment and analysis of conserved motifs revealed that majority of the CnARFs harbored all the three principal domains (i.e. N-terminus DNA binding domain, an ARF sub-domain and an AUX/IAA sub-domain), which are characteristic of all plant ARFs. Quantitative real-time PCR-based expression analysis of ARFs of mature zygotic embryos, exposed to osmotic and temperature stresses and growth regulators, suggest a complex and stress-specific transcriptional response of coconut embryo-derived ARFs. Collectively, these findings offer valuable information and the first molecular insights into the CnARFs, laying the foundation for further functional characterization in developmental and reproductive pathways and their inclusion in breeding for stress tolerance in coconut.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aElaeis guineensis 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3acoconuts 3acultivars 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apromoter regions 3asequence alignment 3atemperature 3atranscription (genetics) 0aCoconut 0aARF 0aGene expression pattern 0aAbiotic stress 0aProtein–protein interaction 0aARF 0aTF 0aCGD 0aIAA 0aMR1 aM.K., Rajesh1 aS.V., Ramesh1 aK.S., Muralikrishna1 aK.P., Gangaraj1 aPayal, Gupta1 aPrasanta K., Dash0 tPlant gene.g2021 Dec., v. 28 p.100344-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23305x2352-40737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plgene.2021.1003443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01652naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002000185245012700205300001800332506007600350520039500426592002800821506003700849650001900886650001400905650001000919650001700929650002200946700002200968700002100990700002201011700001801033700001901051773010901070856007801179852000901257655001201266IND60171788820221207132944.0150602e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017178882DNAL7 a10.1105/tpc.113.1150552doi7 aPMC38095332pmcid7 a240386502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMouhu, Katriina14aThe Fragaria vesca Homolog of SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 Represses Flowering and Promotes Vegetative Growth  ap. 3296-3310.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis work reveals that the woodland strawberry ortholog of the floral activator SOC1 (Fv SOC1) is the general regulator of the photoperiodic development in this perennial short-day plant.

We used differential display to identify genes based on their site of translation. Identification was made based on the fractionation of RNA from soybean leaves into total RNA, free polyribosomal RNA, and membrane-bound (MB) polyribosomal RNA. Sequences were identified representing RNAs uniquely translated on free or MB polyribosomes. The compartmentalization was confirmed on RNA blots. Differential display of free and MB polyribosomal RNA from genetic mutants or physiological studies has 2 potential advantages. First, the sensitivity of the method is increased. Second, localization of mRNAs to the free or MB compartments may identify genes that are controlled at the level of translation or that switch compartments in response to a treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3aleaves 3amessenger RNA 3amutants 3apolyribosomes 3asoybeans 3atranslation (genetics)1 aRay, Jeffery D.0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2001 Sept., v. 19, no. 3 p.269-269dSpringer-Verlagx0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02772899  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245005600163300002000219520173300239592002801972650002202000650001002022650001602032650001402048650001102062650001202073650000702085650002302092700002302115700002402138773012302162856007502285852000902360655001202369IND60559372220170927000000.0161210e20141113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055937222DNAL7 a10.1021/jp507971v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Russo, Natali
V.10aUnderlying Thermodynamics of pH-Dependent Allostery  ap. 12818-12826.  aUnderstanding the effects of coupling protein protonation and conformational states is critical to the development of drugs targeting pH sensors and to the rational engineering of pH switches. In this work, we address this issue by performing a comprehensive study of the pH-regulated switch from the closed to the open conformation in nitrophorin 4 (NP4) that determines its pH-dependent activity. Our calculations show that D30 is the only amino acid that has two significantly different pKₐs in the open and closed conformations, confirming its critical role in regulating pH-dependent behavior. In addition, we describe the free-energy landscape of the conformational change as a function of pH, obtaining accurate estimations of free-energy barriers and equilibrium constants using different methods. The underlying thermodynamic model of the switch workings suggests the possibility of tuning the observed pKₐ only through the conformational equilibria, keeping the same conformation-specific pKₐs, as evidenced by the proposed K125L mutant. Moreover, coupling between the protonation and conformational equilibria results in efficient regulation and pH-sensing around physiological pH values only for some combinations of protonation and conformational equilibrium constants, placing constraints on their possible values and leaving a narrow space for protein molecular evolution. The calculations and analysis presented here are of general applicability and provide a guide as to how more complex systems can be studied, offering insight into how pH-regulated allostery works of great value for designing drugs that target pH sensors and for rational engineering of pH switches beyond the common histidine trigger.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3adrugs 3aengineering 3ahistidine 3amodels 3amutants 3apH 3aphysical chemistry1 aMartí, Marcelo A.1 aRoitberg, Adrian E.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 Nov. 13, v. 118, no. 45 p.12818-12826dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp507971v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245014900159300001600308500001400324520205500338592002802393650001002421650001102431650001402442650001402456651001202470653002302482653002202505653001202527653001502539700002302554700002202577773010902599856007302708852000902781655001202790IND60726965520221121073441.0210209e20150401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072696552DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pev0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetrik, Mike T.10aOn-farm comparison of keel fracture prevalence and other welfare indicators in conventional cage and floor-housed laying hens in Ontario, Canada  ap. 579-585.  aNAL-light  aThe objective of this study was to compare the flock-level prevalence of healed keel bone fractures and to benchmark other indicators of well-being in laying hens housed in conventional cages and single-tier floor housing systems at several points during the production period. Commercial farms in Ontario, Canada, that housed hens in cages (n = 9) or floor barns (n = 8) were included. Flocks were beak-trimmed brown hens of various strains. Each flock was visited at 20, 35, 50, and 65 wk of age. At each visit, 50 hens were weighed, palpated for healed keel fractures, and feather scored over 4 areas of the body. Data were collected from the farm records on cumulative mortality. Keel fracture prevalence was higher in floor-housed flocks compared to cage-housed flocks (48.3 ± 0.04% vs. 24.8 ± 0.03%;P < 0.001). The majority of keel fractures occurred by 50 wk. Cumulative mortality tended to be higher in floor-housed flocks compared to cage-housed flocks (2.13 ± 0.42% vs. 1.29 ± 0.19%;P = 0.078). Mean BW was lower (1,827 ± 28.8 g vs. 1,888 ± 26.8 g;P = 0.02) yet more uniform (CV of BW 9.43 ± 0.40% vs. 10.10 ± 0.32%;P < 0.001) in floor-housed flocks compared to cage-housed flocks. Feather condition was not affected by housing system type (P = 0.618), although it declined with age (P < 0.001). Individual hen factors assessed using Pearson partial correlations indicated that hens with fractures were heavier at 65 wk in both housing types (P < 0.05) and that heavier hens housed on the floor had better feather scores (P < 0.001) from 35 wk onward. Floor-housed hens with fractures had lower feather scores at 35 wk (P < 0.05) but not at 50 or 65 wk. Housing hens in single-tier floor systems increased the flock-level prevalence of keel fractures and resulted in a lower, yet more uniform, BW compared to hens in conventional cages under commercial conditions in Ontario. Benchmarking welfare indicators from alternative housing systems for laying hens is important to ensure that progress is made in improving their well-being.  aPublisher supplied data 3acages 3aflocks 3akeel bone 3amortality 3aOntario 0akeel bone fracture 0afeather condition 0awelfare 0alaying hen1 aGuerin, Michele T.1 aWidowski, Tina M.0 tPoultry science.g2015 Apr. 01, v. 94, no. 4 p.579-585dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pev0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01999naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001800162245006700180300001600247500001900263500000900282520102500291592002801316650001301344650001001357650000901367650001901376650001201395700001801407700002001425773012201445856009701567852000901664655001201673IND60663319820221120072316.0191122e196911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066331982DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1969.00021962006100060004x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorman, J.

Silicon photovoltaic cells are used as light detectors and their spectral response tailorded with Wratten filters to provide quantum response. A sharp near-infrared cutoff is obtained by subtracting the signal of a cell sensing only the infrared from the signal of the cell sensing both the visible and infrared wavelengths. This pair of cells is then placed under heat absorbing glass to further reduce their differences. The differenced current signals from the cells are fed directly into an operational amplifier designed for current amplification. A fair cosine rtsponse is obtained by using a flat piece of diffusing plastic as the uppermost part of the sensor. Calculations and measurements are made to estimate errors resulting from imperfections in spectral tailoring and cosine correction  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3aglass 3aheat 3aphotosynthesis 3asilicon1 aTanner, C.

Here, we integrate haplotype-specific linkage maps in autotetraploid potato and explore the possibilities for mapping in other polyploid species. High-density linkage mapping in autopolyploid species has become possible in recent years given the increasing number of molecular markers now available through modern genotyping platforms. Such maps along with larger experimental populations are needed before we can obtain sufficient accuracy to make marker-trait association studies useful in practice. Here, we describe a method to create genetic linkage maps for an autotetraploid species with large numbers of markers and apply it to an F1 population of tetraploid potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) of 235 individuals genotyped using a 20K SNP array. SNP intensity values were converted to allele dosages after which we calculated pairwise maximum likelihood estimates of recombination frequencies between all marker segregation types under the assumption of random bivalent pairing. These estimates were used in the clustering of markers into linkage groups and their subsequent ordering into 96 homologue maps. The homologue maps were integrated per chromosome, resulting in a total map length of 1061 cM from 6910 markers covering all 12 potato chromosomes. We examined the questions of marker phasing and binning and propose optimal strategies for both. We also investigated the effect of quadrivalent formation and preferential pairing on recombination frequency estimation and marker phasing, which is of great relevance not only for potato but also for genetic studies in other tetraploid species for which the meiotic pairing behaviour is less well understood.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aalleles 3aautopolyploidy 3achromosome mapping 3achromosome pairing 3achromosomes 3agenetic markers 3agenotyping 3alinkage groups 3ameiosis 3apotatoes 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atetraploidy1 aVoorrips, Roeland E.1 aKranenburg, Twan1 aJansen, Johannes1 aVisser, Richard G.

Finally, both withdrawal and bending load capacity of T-shaped specimens were investigated by experimental and numerical methods. The results showed that the testing methods used to determine the coefficient, distributions and strengths of the glued mortise-and-tenon joint were all effective enough to determine the mechanical properties of the wood mortise-and-tenon joint, and the finite element model of joint can be applied to analyze the semi-rigid mortise-and-tenon joint with consistency beyond 85%. These methods and finite element models will contribute to the analysis of wood products and wood constructions.  aPublisher supplied data  aPAPDcA Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD) 3afinite element analysis 3afriction 3ajoints (wood) 3amathematical models 3amechanical properties 3awood1 aGuan, Huiyuan0 tJournal of wood science.g2019 Dec., v. 65, no. 1 p.14-14dSpringer SingaporewJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s10086-019-1794-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01627naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245015000159300001600309520067400325592002800999650000801027650001101035650001701046650001501063650001801078650001801096773013701114856007701251852000901328655001201337IND60521256120221123033959.0160529e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052125612DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1965-08032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorriss, E.10aWechselbeziehungen zwischen 32P-markierten Ribonucleinsäuren und suspendierten GewebekulturzellenbIII.

Versene in concentrations above 5 x 10⁻³ M leads to an increase in the amount of cell bound ³²P-RNA.The cell bound RNA is to a large extend resistent to the action of RNase only so long as versene is present. When versene is washed from the cells, RNase acts on ³²P-RNA as it does in the control cell culture. In the absence of cells, versene does not interfere with the action of RNase. Protamine seems to favour the penetration of RNA into cells, whereas Mg²⨁ and Ca²⨁ show little influence on the interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aamnion 3acell culture 3aphosphorus 3aradionuclides 3aribonucleases0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung B.g2014 June 2, v. 20, no. 8 p.752-759dVerlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschungx1865-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1965-08033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04113naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001800162245007800180300001600258500001900274500000900293520286700302592002803169650001903197650001503216650001303231650002103244650002703265650001103292650001703303650001303320650001403333650002403347650001203371650001103383650001003394651000903404700002003413700001803433773012203451856009703573852000903670655001203679IND60663320020221120134246.0191122e197907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066332002DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1979.00021962007100040016x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorge, J.

A field study was conducted on a Clarion loam (Typic Hapludoll) site in central Iowa to evaluate the long-term K requirements of smooth bromegrass grown under high N fertility and intensive harvest management. Forage yield and percent K was observed over 4- and 3-year periods, respectively. Changes in soil exchangeable K and pH at 0 to 7.5- 7.5- to 15-, and 15- to 30-cm soil depths were monitored during 1970–75 and 1970–73, respectively. Ammonium nitrate (33.5-0-0) was applied at rates of 0, 125, and 500 kg N/ha in 1970, and 0, 250, and 500 kg N/ha during 1971–74 (N₀, N₁, and N₂ treatments, respectively). Applications were made as single levels in 1970. Rates were split in subsequent years, with half applied in early spring and the rest after the second harvest. Potassium treatments consisted of a check and 125 kg K/ha applied each year in early spring as Cl- and S- containing sources (KC1 vs. K₂SO₄ and K₂SO₄ • MgSO₄). Nitrogen fertilization produced more of a linear than quadratic increase in bromegrass yield. Yields were not increased by K fertilization even when soil exchangeable K approached “minimal” levels. No yield differences among K sources were observed, suggesting that yields were not enhanced by either Mg or S contained in the K sources. Nitrogen fertilization reduced forage percent K concentrations. Potassium fertilization without N had no effect, whereas, NK fertilization increased forage percent K. Differences in forage percent K among K sources occurred only in 1972 with higher concentrations observed for KC1 compared with K₂SO₄ and K₂SO₄ • MgSO₄. Fertilization with N reduced soil exchangeable K. Decreases were most evident for the 0- to 7.5-cm soil layer, but were significant to a depth of 15 cm. Potassium fertilization without N increased K in the 0- to 7.5-cm soil layer. Soil K decreased 47% when no K was applied, suggesting that a severely N deficient bromegrass sward, if harvested, requires some applied K to maintain soil K concentrations. When both N and K were applied, soil K decreased to 137 kg/ha in the 0- to 7.5-cm soil layer. These trends observed over time suggest that bromegrass obtains most of its K from surface soil layers. Fertilization at N₁ and N₂ levels reduced pH in the 0- to 7.5-cm soil layer from 6.3 to 6.0 and 6.2 to 5.3, respectively. Most of the pH change developed during the 1st year as evidenced by linear regression coefficients of —0.0017, —0.0020, and —0.0025 pH units/kg N/ha applied in 1971, 1972, and 1973, respectively. Fertilization with K produced little change in surface soil pH. No effect of N and K fertilization on soil pH was observed below the 7.5-cm depth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBromus inermis 3aHapludolls 3aagronomy 3aammonium nitrate 3aexchangeable potassium 3aforage 3aforage yield 3anitrogen 3apotassium 3aregression analysis 3asoil pH 3aspring 3asward 3aIowa1 aPinheiro, M.

Data were collected from 203 Australian wine consumers through an online survey. The study compares the results of this study with Easingwood et al. [2011. The drivers of wine regionality. Journal of Wine Research , 22 (1), 19–33.] study on experts’ opinion of regionality drivers. This paper will expand knowledge on how consumer involvement levels impact decisions relating to purchasing regional wine. This study is of value to academics and wine practitioners alike. It contributes to the wine literature by providing a new perspective on consumers’ perception and draws attention to the risk of drawing conclusions about wine consumption based on experts’ opinions as being reflective of the average consumers’ purchase decision-making.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aexperts 3apurchasing 3arisk 3asurveys 3awines 3aAustralia 0aExpert –consumer comparison 0aregionality 0aspecialisation 0aheritage 0adistinctive taste 0aquality1 aBandyopadhyay, Argho1 aLockshin, Larry0 tJournal of wine research.g2017 July 3, v. 28, no. 3 p.194-215dRoutledgex1469-96727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09571264.2017.13602613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245011500200300002000315520153200335592002801867650001501895650001501910650001601925650002301941650001601964650002001980650002502000650002602025650001502051650001402066650001102080650002602091650001002117650002602127650001302153650001502166653001802181653003302199653002302232653002802255653002302283700001802306700005402324700005602378773014202434856007802576852000902654655001202663IND60705896120221120094947.0200807e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070589612DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c078932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Gyeo-Re1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3584-443310aPaper/Soluble Polymer Hybrid-Based Lateral Flow Biosensing Platform for High-Performance Point-of-Care Testing  ap. 34564-34575.  aAs a global shift continues to occur in high burden diseases toward developing countries, the importance of medical diagnostics based on point-of-care testing (POCT) is rapidly increasing. However, most diagnostic tests that meet clinical standards rely on high-end analyzers in central hospitals. Here, we report the development of a simple, low-cost, mass-producible, highly sensitive/quantitative, automated, and robust paper/soluble polymer hybrid-based lateral flow biosensing platform, paired with a smartphone-based reader, for high-performance POCT. The testing architecture incorporates a polymeric barrier that programs/automates sequential reactions via a polymer dissolving mechanism. The smartphone-based reader with simple opto-mechanical parts offers a stable framework for accurate quantification. Analytical performance of this platform was evaluated by testing human cardiac troponin I (cTnI), a preferred biomarker for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, in serum/plasma samples. Coupled with catalytic/colorimetric gold-ion amplification, this platform produced results within 20 min with a detection limit of 0.92 pg mL–¹ and a coefficient of variation <10%, which is equivalent to the performance of a high-sensitivity standard analyzer, and operated within acceptable levels stipulated by clinical guidelines. Moreover, cTnI clinical sample tests indicate a high correlation (r = 0.981) with the contemporary analyzers, demonstrating the clinical utility of this platform in high-performance POCT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acatalytic activity 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3adeveloping countries 3adiagnostic techniques 3aguidelines 3ahospitals 3ahumans 3amyocardial infarction 3apaper 3apoint-of-care testing 3apolymers 3atroponin I 0apoint-of-care 0apaper/soluble polymer hybrid 0alateral flow assay 0asmartphone-based reader 0acardiac troponin I1 aKoo, Hee Joon1 aKi, Hangil1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3786-87111 aKim, Min-Gon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3525-00480 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 July 15, v. 12, no. 31 p.34564-34575dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c078933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245012200171300001400293520109200307592002801399650002001427650001401447650001301461650001101474650001001485650001401495650001201509650001301521651001301534653002501547653002001572653003001592653002901622653002001651653002601671653001301697700002601710773011101736856008301847852000901930655001201939IND60568964220221122043521.0170522e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056896422DNAL7 a10.1654/1525-2647-84.1.552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuzzall, Patrick M.10aHelminths of the Eastern Gray Treefrog, Hyla versicolor (Hylidae), from a Pond in Southwestern Lower Michigan, U.S.A.  ap. 55-59.  aA total of 35 adult Eastern gray treefrogs, Hyla versicolor LeConte, 1825, was collected in May 2015 from 1 pond in the Kellogg Biological Station Lux Arbor Reserve in the lower Peninsula of southwestern Michigan, U.S.A., and examined for helminths. Three helminth species (1 Monogenea, Polystoma nearcticum; 1 Digenea, Clinostomum sp.; and 1 Nematoda, Cosmocercoides variabilis) were found in adult treefrogs. Polystoma nearcticum is reported for the first time in Michigan and had the highest prevalence (54%), with a mean intensity of 2.4. Cosmocercoides variabilis had the highest mean intensity (52.6) and the second highest prevalence (40%). Clinostomum sp. infected only 1 frog. Twenty-nine tadpoles of gray treefrogs were collected in June 2015 from the same pond that adults were collected from and examined for helminths. One branchial form of P. nearcticum was found on the gill of 1 tadpole. The nematode Gyrinicola batrachiensis infected 55% of the tadpoles with a mean intensity of 2.8.

These issues were investigated for two phloem-limited begomoviruses, Abutilon mosaic virus (AbMV) and Tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV) in Nicotiana benthamiana plants doubly infected by either the potyvirus Cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus (CABMV) or the tombusvirus Artichoke mottled crinkle virus (AMCV). Both RNA viruses induced an increase of the amount of AbMV, led to its occasional egress from the phloem and induced symptom aggravation, while the amount and tissue tropism of TYLCSV were almost unaffected. In transgenic plants expressing the silencing suppressors of CABMV (HC-Pro) or AMCV (P19), AbMV was supported to a much lesser extent than in the mixed infections, with the effect of CABMV HC-Pro being superior to that of AMCV P19. Neither of the silencing suppressors influenced TYLCSV accumulation. These results demonstrate that begomoviruses differentially respond to the invasion of other viruses and to silencing suppression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbutilon mosaic virus 3aArtichoke mottled crinkle virus 3aCowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aRNA 3aTomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus 3agenome 3amixed infection 3aphloem 3atissue tropism 3atransgenic plants 3aviruses1 aWege, Christina1 aKober, Sigrid1 aKocher, Conny1 aAccotto, Gian Paolo1 aNoris, Emanuela0 tVirus research.g2011 Nov., v. 161, no. 2 p.170-180dElsevier B.V.x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2011.07.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03502naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002600188245012900214300001800343506007600361520186600437592002802303506003702331650001902368650001302387650001502400650001602415650001202431650001902443650001502462650000802477650001002485650003502495650001602530700002502546700002602571700002002597700001902617700003302636700002302669700002302692700001602715700001502731700002602746773012202772856008102894852000902975655001202984IND60556100320221207132240.0161031e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055610032DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-016-2756-52doi7 aPMC50693472pmcid7 a274801572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAuinger, Hans-Jürgen10aModel training across multiple breeding cycles significantly improves genomic prediction accuracy in rye (Secale cereale L.)  ap. 2043-2053.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aKEY MESSAGE: Genomic prediction accuracy can be significantly increased by model calibration across multiple breeding cycles as long as selection cycles are connected by common ancestors. In hybrid rye breeding, application of genome-based prediction is expected to increase selection gain because of long selection cycles in population improvement and development of hybrid components. Essentially two prediction scenarios arise: (1) prediction of the genetic value of lines from the same breeding cycle in which model training is performed and (2) prediction of lines from subsequent cycles. It is the latter from which a reduction in cycle length and consequently the strongest impact on selection gain is expected. We empirically investigated genome-based prediction of grain yield, plant height and thousand kernel weight within and across four selection cycles of a hybrid rye breeding program. Prediction performance was assessed using genomic and pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP and PBLUP). A total of 1040 S₂ lines were genotyped with 16 k SNPs and each year testcrosses of 260 S₂ lines were phenotyped in seven or eight locations. The performance gap between GBLUP and PBLUP increased significantly for all traits when model calibration was performed on aggregated data from several cycles. Prediction accuracies obtained from cross-validation were in the order of 0.70 for all traits when data from all cycles (N CS = 832) were used for model training and exceeded within-cycle accuracies in all cases. As long as selection cycles are connected by a sufficient number of common ancestors and prediction accuracy has not reached a plateau when increasing sample size, aggregating data from several preceding cycles is recommended for predicting genetic values in subsequent cycles despite decreasing relatedness over time.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSecale cereale 3aancestry 3agenotyping 3agrain yield 3ahybrids 3aplant breeding 3aprediction 3arye 3aseeds 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atestcrosses1 aSchönleben, Manfred1 aLehermeier, Christina1 aSchmidt, Malthe1 aKorzun, Viktor1 aGeiger, H.

Our emphasis is on breast cancer, but this pathway is central to the behavior of many cancers. An understanding of how IR/IGF-1R signaling contributes to the function of the normal mammary gland provides a foundation for understanding its aberrations in breast cancer. Specifically, dysregulation of the expression and function of ligands (insulin, IGF-1 and IGF-2), receptors and their downstream signaling effectors drive breast cancer initiation and progression, often in a subtype-dependent manner. Efforts to target this pathway for the treatment of cancer have been hindered by several factors including a lack of biomarkers to select patients that could respond to targeted therapy and adverse effects on normal metabolism. To this end, we discuss ongoing efforts aimed at overcoming such obstacles.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abreast neoplasms 3ainsulin 3ainsulin receptors 3ainsulin-like growth factor I receptor 3aligands 3amammary glands 3ametabolism 3atherapeutics 0aInsulin-like growth factor (IGF) 0aInsulin receptor 0aIGF-1R 0aBreast cancer 0aSignal transduction 0aTherapy1 aShaw, Leslie M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1946-29800 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2021 May 01, v. 527 p.111213-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2021.1112133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01745naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001300143245011600156300001600272520083900288592002801127650001101155650002001166650001501186650001201201650001801213773015001231856007701381852000901458655001201467IND60521256320221123023112.0160529e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052125632DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1965-08052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, H.10aZur biologischen Wirksamkeit elastischer KernstößebI.

At higher proton energies the inactivation cross section is not strongly dependent on energy but with decreasing proton energy it decreases rapidly, reaches a sharp minimum at 1.2 keV and increases again at still smaller energies. By comparing the experimentally determined inactivation cross sections with the cross sections for energy loss in elastic nuclear collisions and in ionizations, respectively, elastic collisions were demonstrated to destroy, in fact, the enzymatic activity of ribonuclease. The energy required for an inactivation by nuclear collision is only one fourth of the energy necessary for an inactivation by ionization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3aionization 3aprotons 3aribonucleases0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 20, no. 8 p.764-772dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1965-08053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245007700208300001600285520167200301592002801973596004002001596004002041596004002081596004002121650001902161650002302180650002302203650002002226650002202246650001102268650001502279650001902294700001702313700002102330773013502351856008202486852000902568655001202577IND60632635320221118023532.0190512e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063263532DNAL7 a10.1007/s10113-018-1424-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolzhauer, Sascha1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1654-743310aModelling dynamic effects of multi-scale institutions on land use change  ap. 733-746.  aFormal institutions impact on the dynamics of land use change through their objectives, actions and decision-making processes in response to socio-economic or environmental changes such as climate change. The effects and interplay of these actions are not fully understood, and hence, institutional processes are rarely integrated in modelling analyses of land use change. The complex effects of institutional interactions within land systems can be better understood through modelling approaches that address the heterogeneity of the institutional actors involved and how their decisions affect temporal and spatial dynamics. In this paper, we present an agent-based model of autonomous land managers interacting with institutional agents at two spatial scales. We explore different parameters of institutional intervention (subsidy rate, triggers for action, delay in monitoring, scale-based precedence) under socio-economic drivers and analyse key metrics such as the maximum over- and undersupply of ecosystem services, connectivity of land uses, and degree of change in land use patterns. Levels of subsidy and action triggers have the greatest impact on the magnitude of land use change and the maximum oversupply of ecosystem services. In terms of achieving institutional objectives, subsidy rate is the most important single parameter in the model. Furthermore, we find non-linearity with variations in parameters that have important implications for current land use change modelling and requirements for empirical studies of land use planning institutions. Finally, the effects of high-end climate change may require entirely novel institutional behaviours.  aPublisher supplied data  a603416cSeventh Framework Programme  a603416cSeventh Framework Programme  a603542cSeventh Framework Programme  a603542cSeventh Framework Programme 3aclimate change 3aecosystem services 3aempirical research 3aland use change 3aland use planning 3amodels 3amonitoring 3asocioeconomics1 aBrown, Calum1 aRounsevell, Mark0 tRegional environmental change.g2019 Mar., v. 19, no. 3 p.733-746dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000303x1436-37987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-018-1424-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014900165300001800314500001500332520172000347592002802067650002902095650001302124650001202137650002202149650001902171650001202190650002002202650001802222650002302240650001302263650002202276650001702298650002002315653002002335700001902355773012202374856008102496852000902577655001202586IND60556100420221121173532.0161031e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055610042DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-016-2761-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPreedy, K.

Modern genotyping techniques are producing increasingly high numbers of genetic markers that can be scored in experimental populations of plants and animals. Ordering these markers to form a reliable linkage map is computationally challenging. There is a wide literature on this topic, but most has focussed on populations derived from diploid, homozygous parents. The challenge of ordering markers in an autotetraploid population has received little attention, and there is currently no method that runs sufficiently rapidly to investigate the effects of omitting problematic markers on map order in larger datasets. Here, we have explored the use of multidimensional scaling (MDS) to order markers from a cross between autotetraploid parents, using simulated data with 74–152 markers on a linkage group and also experimental data from a potato population. We compared different functions of the recombination fraction and LOD score to form the MDS stress function and found that an LOD² weighting generally performed well, including when missing values and genotyping errors are present. We conclude that an initial analysis using unconstrained MDS gives a rapid method to detect and remove problematic markers, and that a subsequent analysis using either constrained MDS or principal curve analysis gives reliable marker orders. The latter approach is also particularly rapid, taking less than 10 s on a set of 258 markers compared to 6 days for the JoinMap software. This MDS approach could also be applied to experimental populations of diploid species.  aPublisher supplied data 3amultidimensional scaling 3adiploidy 3aanimals 3agenotyping errors 3alinkage groups 3aparents 3adata collection 3arapid methods 3achromosome mapping 3apotatoes 3acomputer software 3ahomozygosity 3agenetic markers 0aplants (botany)1 aHackett, C.

Plexiform lesions also develop in broiler lungs, but lesion incidences are not strongly correlated with sustained pulmonary hypertension as reflected by right to total ventricular weight (RVTV) ratios. The present study was conducted to assess plexiform lesion incidences in broiler lines that have been divergently selected for susceptibility or resistance to pulmonary hypertension. Broilers from susceptible (SUS) and resistant (RES) lines were reared together and only clinically healthy (nonascitic, noncyanotic) individuals were evaluated to minimize potential line differences in cardiopulmonary hemodynamics. The objective was to determine if an innate genetic predisposition for plexogenic arteriopathy would be exposed in SUS broilers when compared with RES broilers in the absence of extreme differences in cardiopulmonary hemodynamics. Broilers up to 12 wk age from the SUS and RES lines had essentially equivalent BW, indices of cardiopulmonary function (left ventricle + septum weight, total ventricle weight, and RVTV ratios), and lung volumes within a sex. Average RVTV ratios for broilers from both lines were indicative of normal pulmonary arterial pressures at all ages sampled. Nevertheless, plexiform lesions were detected in SUS and RES broiler lungs immediately posthatch and thereafter at all ages sampled. Lesion incidences were consistently low and did not differ between the lines within any of the sampling ages. This evidence demonstrates that plexiform lesions develop extremely rapidly in broiler chicks, apparently without the prerequisite for vascular stress caused by severe, prolonged pulmonary arterial hypertension. No innate genetic predisposition for complex vascular lesion development appeared to exist in the SUS line when compared with the RES line.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenetic predisposition to disease 3ahemodynamics 3ahumans 3ahypertension 3alungs 3apulmonary artery 0abroilers 0aplexiform lesions 0apulmonary hypertension1 aMason, J.G.1 aAnthony, N.B.1 aCross, D.0 tPoultry science.g2015 Apr. 01, v. 94, no. 4 p.628-638dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pev0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03394naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100002200185245014800207300001800355520175300373592002802126650002202154650002202176650002302198650001602221650001402237650002302251650002102274650001002295650002002305650001402325650003002339650002702369650001002396650001402406650003502420650001402455650001402469650001702483651001102500700002302511700002302534700001802557700002202575700001902597700001802616773014002634856008102774852000902855655001202864IND60556100520221121173638.0161031e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055610052DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-016-2765-42doi7 a10.1007/s00122-016-2765-42chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiebert, Colin W.10aGenetics and mapping of seedling resistance to Ug99 stem rust in winter wheat cultivar Triumph 64 and differentiation of SrTmp, SrCad, and Sr42  ap. 2171-2177.  aKEY MESSAGE : Resistance to Ug99 stem rust in Triumph 64 was conferred by SrTmp on chromosome arm 6DS and was mapped to the same position as SrCad and Sr42 , however, the three genes show functional differences. Stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt), is an important disease of wheat that can be controlled by effective stem rust resistance (Sr) genes. The emergence of virulent Pgt races in Africa, namely Ug99 and its variants, has stimulated the search for new Sr genes and genetic characterization of known sources of resistance. Triumph 64 is a winter wheat cultivar that carries gene SrTmp, which confers resistance to Ug99. The goals of this study were to genetically map SrTmp and examine its relationship with other Sr genes occupying a similar chromosome location. A doubled haploid (DH) population from the cross LMPG-6S/Triumph 64 was inoculated with Ug99 at the seedling stage. A single gene conditioning resistance to Ug99 segregated in the population. Genetic mapping with SSR markers placed SrTmp on chromosome arm 6DS in a region similar to SrCad and Sr42. SNP markers developed for SrCad were used to further map SrTmp and were also added to a genetic map of Sr42 using a DH population (LMPG-6S/Norin 40). Three SNP markers that co-segregated with SrTmp also co-segregated with SrCad and Sr42. The SNP markers showed no difference in the map locations of SrTmp, SrCad, and Sr42. Multi-race testing with DH lines from the Triumph 64 and Norin 40 populations and a recombinant inbred-line population from the cross LMPG-6S/AC Cadillac showed that SrTmp, SrCad, and Sr42 confer different spectra of resistance. Markers closely linked to SrTmp are suitable for marker-assisted breeding and germplasm development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPuccinia graminis 3aTriticum aestivum 3achromosome mapping 3achromosomes 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3adoubled haploids 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agermplasm 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3araces 3aseedlings 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astem rust 3avirulence 3awinter wheat 3aAfrica1 aKassa, Mulualem T.1 aMcCartney, Curt A.1 aYou, Frank M.1 aRouse, Matthew N.1 aFobert, Pierre1 aFetch, Tom G.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2016 Nov., v. 129, no. 11 p.2171-2177dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl40712x0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-016-2765-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01478naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121110004000139245011700179300001400296500002000310520051200330592002800842650001300870650001700883650001900900650001400919650001200933650002000945773012900965856007301094852000901167655001201176IND60786657920221121222329.0220805e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078665792DNAL7 a10.1002/awwa.16482doi  aAGLbengcAGL2 aAWWA Disinfection Committeeeauthor10aEmerging Trends in Disinfection: Lessons From AWWA’s Disinfection Survey [Erratum: March 2021, v.113(2); p.96]  ap. 20-28.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEvery 10 years, AWWA releases a survey of disinfection practices in the water sector; taken together, these surveys frame the evolution of potable water disinfection.

Naturally inclined stems or branches in 23 Japanese angiosperms, including 3 tree sizes at adult trees, 7 arbor, 7 subarbor, and 9 shrub species, were used. The presence of a gelatinous (G-) layer, basic density, vessel frequency, and lignin content were examined on the upper and lower sides of each sample. Almost all the species showed a decrease in vessel frequency and lignin content on the upper side, which are typical characteristics of reaction wood in angiosperms. A G-layer was formed in four arbor, one subarbor, and two shrub species. The ratio of the upper and lower sides in vessel frequency and lignin content gradually decreased with an increase in tree size. Based on the results of the principal component and cluster analyses, shrub species were classified into the different groups: from arbor and subarbor groups. These results indicate that the magnitude of alteration in the characteristics due to reaction wood formation of arbor and subarbor might differ from that of shrub, although the characteristics changed by reaction wood formation might be the same in the three tree sizes at adult trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngiospermae 3abranches 3acluster analysis 3alignin 3amature plants 3areaction wood 3ashrubs 3atrees1 aIshiguri, Futoshi1 aToyoizumi, Tatsuya1 aTakashima, Yuya1 aAizawa, Mineaki1 aYokota, Shinso0 tJournal of wood science.g2017 June, v. 63, no. 3 p.307-312dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-017-1623-63Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03557naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245013100205300001800336506007600354520182000430592002802250506003702278650002302315650002902338650001602367650001302383650002002396650001102416650001502427650001502442650000902457650001402466650001502480650002202495650001602517700002402533700002302557700001902580700001702599700002102616700001602637700002302653700002602676700002002702700001702722700001602739700002402755773012202779856008102901852000902982655001202991IND60556100620221207132253.0161031e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055610062DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-016-2762-72doi7 aPMC50693252pmcid7 a275223582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Honghai10aHigh-density marker profiling confirms ancestral genomes of Avena species and identifies D-genome chromosomes of hexaploid oat  ap. 2133-2149.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aKEY MESSAGE : Genome analysis of 27 oat species identifies ancestral groups, delineates the D genome, and identifies ancestral origin of 21 mapped chromosomes in hexaploid oat. We investigated genomic relationships among 27 species of the genus Avena using high-density genetic markers revealed by genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). Two methods of GBS analysis were used: one based on tag-level haplotypes that were previously mapped in cultivated hexaploid oat (A. sativa), and one intended to sample and enumerate tag-level haplotypes originating from all species under investigation. Qualitatively, both methods gave similar predictions regarding the clustering of species and shared ancestral genomes. Furthermore, results were consistent with previous phylogenies of the genus obtained with conventional approaches, supporting the robustness of whole genome GBS analysis. Evidence is presented to justify the final and definitive classification of the tetraploids A. insularis, A. maroccana (=A. magna), and A. murphyi as containing D-plus-C genomes, and not A-plus-C genomes, as is most often specified in past literature. Through electronic painting of the 21 chromosome representations in the hexaploid oat consensus map, we show how the relative frequency of matches between mapped hexaploid-derived haplotypes and AC (DC)-genome tetraploids vs. A- and C-genome diploids can accurately reveal the genome origin of all hexaploid chromosomes, including the approximate positions of inter-genome translocations. Evidence is provided that supports the continued classification of a diverged B genome in AB tetraploids, and it is confirmed that no extant A-genome diploids, including A. canariensis, are similar enough to the D genome of tetraploid and hexaploid oat to warrant consideration as a D-genome diploid.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achromosome mapping 3achromosome translocation 3achromosomes 3adiploidy 3agenetic markers 3agenome 3ahaplotypes 3ahexaploidy 3aoats 3aphylogeny 3aprediction 3asequence analysis 3atetraploidy1 aBekele, Wubishet A.1 aWight, Charlene P.1 aPeng, Yuanying1 aLangdon, Tim1 aLatta, Robert G.1 aFu, Yong-Bi1 aDiederichsen, Axel1 aHowarth, Catherine J.1 aJellen, Eric N.1 aBoyle, Brian1 aWei, Yuming1 aTinker, Nicholas A.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2016 Nov., v. 129, no. 11 p.2133-2149dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-016-2762-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03111naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001700136245012900153300001600282500001500298520189400313592002802207650001502235650001102250650001502261650001402276650001902290650002002309650002002329650001102349650001402360650001102374650001102385650001402396650002402410653001602434700001702450700002002467700001402487700001402501773010202515856003902617852000902656655001202665IND4475410820221116171412.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447541082DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.12302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Rein, H.10aFixed‐station monitoring of a harbour wall community: the utility of low‐cost photomosaics and scuba on hard‐substrata  ap. 690-703.  a2019-12-06  aIn marine temperate waters, the diverse epibenthic communities of hard substrata require robust, efficient, high‐resolution methods to better understand community dynamics and biological processes, such as growth, recruitment and mortality that drive changes within communities. The epibenthic community of a harbour wall was monitored from fixed stations over three seasons in 2009 to evaluate the utility of a high‐resolution photomosaic method. The community was described by visually estimating cover and abundance of taxa within the photomosaics. In addition, areas occupied by the solitary cup coral Caryophyllia smithii, the encrusting sponge Hymeniacidon perleve, and the red macroalga Plocamium cartilagineum were digitized and their seasonal growth, recruitment and mortality estimated over the study period. Significant changes occurred to the community in every season. The fewest number of taxa and the lowest total taxa cover was observed in the winter. In the spring, there was significant growth of red macroalgae, brown macroalgae, and ascidian taxa. In the summer there was significant growth of green macroalgae and turf taxa, while red macroalgae experienced photoinhibition, and ascidians significantly declined in abundance. The photomosaics enabled the extraction of data at a high taxonomic resolution, reduced the effects of water‐column turbidity, and through digitization, enabled estimation of the seasonal growth, recruitment, and mortality of C. smithii, H. perleve and P. cartilagineum. However, the spring and summer canopies of macroalgae and turf obscured the detection of many understory taxa, and thus, limited the accuracy of understorey assessments. Provided the limitations of photomosaics are recognized, the method demonstrated in this study has many potential benefits of advantage for fixed‐station monitoring studies in temperate waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3amacroalgae 3awinter 3amonitoring 3aturbidity 3alawns and turf 3aphotoinhibition 3aseasonal growth 3aspring 3aPlocamium 3acorals 3asummer 3amortality 3aharbors (waterways) 0arecruitment1 aBrown, C.

After Ag₂S@WS₂ was modified onto the ITO substrate surface, 5fC recognition reagent of Au@4-amino3hydrazino5mercapto-1,2,4-triazol (Au@AHMT) was further modified through electrostatic adsorption. Afterwards, based on the specific chemical reaction between –NH₂ and –CHO, 5fC can be selectively recognized and captured. Subsequently, the nanoenzyme of FeVO₄ was recognized based on the specific reaction between the phosphate group of 5fC nucleotide and Fe³⁺. Under the catalysis of FeVO₄, the 4-chloro-1-naphthol in the detection solution can be oxidized to generate a precipitate, which will be retained on the electrode surface to inhibit the PEC signal. The developed method presented a widely dynamic range from 0.1 to 400 nM. The detection limit was 0.062 nM (3σ). This method also showed good detection selectivity, reproducibility and stability. The applicability was verified by investigating 5fC content change in genomic DNA of rice tissues after incubated with heavy metals. Moreover, the inhibited influence of hydrochar towards heavy metals was also assessed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadsorption 3abiosensors 3acatalytic activity 3adetection limit 3aelectrodes 3ahydrochars 3aphosphates 3arice 0aAg2S@WS2 0aPhotoelectrochemistry 0aEpigenetic modification 0aFeVO4 artificial mimic enzyme 0aEcotoxicological effects1 aYin, Huanshun1 aZhou, Yunlei1 aWang, Jun1 aAi, Shiyun0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 July 15, v. 414 p.125293-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1252933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01711naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245006000163300001600223520082000239592002801059650001801087650002701105650002001132700002701152700001801179773015001197856007701347852000901424655001201433IND60521256820221123023129.0160529e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052125682DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1965-08102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchötz, Franz,10aZur Struktur der Mesosomen bei Lactobacillus corynoides  ap. 790-794.  aUltrathin sections of L. corynoides, a recently described heterofermentative species, show very large mesosoms (plasmalemmosoms) which are very often located at the areas at which new crosswalls originate. The interior of the mesosom, which is surrounded by the plasmalemma (cytoplasmic membrane) contains tubulous structures partly distributed irregularly, but partly arranged in parallel to form packets which show regular patterns when cross-sectioned. The tubuli originate by finger-like intrusions of the plasmalemma; they are 150 A thick and contain an inner duct of a diameter of about 30 A. The three layers of the plasmalemma can be recognized on crosssections of the tubuli. The outer, dark layer forms the outer ring of the tubuli, and the somewhat lighter inner layer forms the corresponding inner ring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus 3aanatomy and morphology 3aplasma membrane1 aAbo-Elnaga, Ibrahim G.1 aKandler, Otto0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 20, no. 8 p.790-794dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1965-08103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04183naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245014700171300001600318520237300334592002802707650003102735650001702766650001502783650003102798650002502829650001602854650001502870650002202885650001402907650001402921650001202935650001002947650001502957650002002972650002302992650001303015650001203028650001503040650001103055650001303066650000903079650000903088650001103097650001403108650000903122650001703131650002003148650001603168651001003184653001003194653002503204653001503229653002103244653003103265700005603296773009503352856008903447852000903536655001203545IND60541727220221123002824.0190401e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054172722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2014.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaguas, E.V.10aVulnerability of olive orchards under the current CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) regulations on soil erosion: a study case in Southern Spain  ap. 683-694.  aTo measure the erosive processes taking place under conditions close to those experienced by farmers and land managers; analyses on spatial units adapted to the size of the farm must be carried out; in a non-isolated way in the case of conventional plots. The objective of this study was to describe and understand the current state – in terms of high soil losses and degradation risk – of a commercial olive farm following the CAP agro-environmental requirements as well as the interaction between soil management decisions and rainfall variability. In this work, rainfall and runoff soil loss for 6.4 hydrological years (2005–2011) were monitored in the outlet of an olive orchard microcatchment of 6.7ha. The equipment used was a flume with an ultrasonic sensor to measure flow height, a rainfall gauge and a sediment sampler. Management systems and olive yields were described for the study period. Different management operations (no-tillage, conventional tillage, no herbicides with tillage and mulch) were applied in the field as a result of the farmer adapting to yearly conditions and to recommendations on good agricultural practice.Our results indicate that the interaction between the factors of annual climatological features and management determined the hydrology, soil loss and olive yield. On the annual scale, cumulative rainfall and rainfall erosivity varied between 600 and 1000mm and 600 and 1500MJMmha−1h−1, respectively. The average annual runoff coefficient was equal to 15±10%, while total sediment loss ranged from <1tha−1year−1 to >20tha−1year−1. Olive yield ranged between 5000kgha−1year−1 and 10,000kgha−1year−1. Above average annual rainfall values were associated with both high yields and soil losses >10tha−1year−1.For the study period, frequent events with a low return period resulted in soil losses >10tha−1, despite the use of different soil management techniques and the compliance of CAP agro environmental regulations. The high risk of soil degradation evaluated might mean that the criterion based on slopes >10% is not suitable for the application of agro-environmental requirements of CAP. On the other hand, further research on conservation technologies such as a more efficient use of cover crops, mulches and plant barriers, controlled traffic farming and/or changes in land use is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCommon Agricultural Policy 3acase studies 3acompliance 3acontrolled traffic systems 3aconventional tillage 3acover crops 3acrop yield 3aenvironmental law 3aequipment 3afarm size 3afarmers 3afarms 3aherbicides 3aland use change 3amanagement systems 3amanagers 3amulches 3ano-tillage 3aolives 3aorchards 3arain 3arisk 3arunoff 3asediments 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3astubble tillage 3aultrasonics 3aSpain 0aOlive 0aRainfall variability 0aManagement 0aCross-compliance 0aCommon Agricultural Policy1 aGómez, J.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3457-84200 tLand use policy.g2015 Jan., v. 42 p.683-694dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2014.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245009000163300002000253520109400273592002801367650001101395650002201406650001101428650001801439650001601457650000901473650002201482653003001504653002501534653001501559653003001574653002401604653003501628700001501663700001701678700001801695700001801713700005801731773014201789856007801931852000902009655001202018IND60705896620221121200054.0200807e20200713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070589662DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c080062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Shuiping10aCsPbI₂Br Perovskite Solar Cells Based on Carbon Black-Containing Counter Electrodes  ap. 34882-34889.  aCsPbI₂Br perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on carbon electrodes (CEs) are considered to be low-cost and thermally stable devices. Nevertheless, the insufficient contact and energy level mismatch between the CsPbI₂Br layer and CE hinder the further enhancement of the cell efficiency. Herein, a carbon black (CB) interlayer was introduced between the perovskite layer and CE. The hole extraction was facilitated due to the larger contact area and suitable energy band alignment in the CsPbI₂Br/CB interface. Further investigation indicated the diffusion of CB nanoparticles from the CE or CB layer to the CsPbI₂Br film after a certain period of time. We disclosed the formation of a CB-CsPbI₂Br bulk heterojunction structure due to the carbon diffusion, which resulted in an efficiency enhancement. As a result, a record efficiency of 13.13% is achieved for carbon-based inorganic PSCs. This work also reveals that the diffusion of CB nanoparticles in CB-containing PSCs is universal and inevitable, although this kind of diffusion results in the enhancement of cell efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon electrodes 3aenergy 3ananoparticles 3asolar cells 3asoot 3athermal stability 0acarbon black nanoparticle 0ainorganic perovskite 0ainterlayer 0adiffusion of carbon black 0along-term stability 0abulk heterojunction solar cell1 aLi, Haiyan1 aChen, Zongqi1 aShou, Chunhui1 aHuang, Mianji1 aYang, Songwang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6304-59410 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 July 13, v. 12, no. 31 p.34882-34889dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c080063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02054naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245013200161300001600293520090800309592002801217650002001245650001301265650000901278650002401287650002601311650001101337650001701348650002601365650001301391650002701404650001401431650001101445773015001456856007701606852000901683655001201692IND60521256920221117160549.0160529e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052125692DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1965-08112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiers, Lothar10aElektronenmikroskopische Untersuchungen über die Eizellbildung und Eizellreifung des Lebermooses Sphaerocarpus donnellii Aust.  ap. 795-801.  aThe formation and maturation of the egg of the liverwort, Sphaerocarpus donnellii, was investigated by light, phase contrast and particularly by electron microscopy.

All stages of this formation and maturation were examined under the electron microscope after fixation in KMnO₄ or OsO₄. — In the maturing egg there always occur the endoplasmic reticulum, well recognisable plastids with a poorly developed lamellar system, numerous mitochondria and dictyosomes, a rising number of lipid droplets, unknown small bodies limited by a unit membrane, and numerous ribosomes. During maturation the nucleus considerably enlarges and forms evaginations into the cytoplasm. Starch is increasingly deposited in the plastids.

Forty-one compounds were identified, representing 96.3% of the total oil. The major constituents of essential oil were oxygenated monoterpenoids (87.1%), linalool (29.1%), 1,8-cineole (18.4%), α-terpineol (10.8%), geraniol (7.3%) and linalyl acetate (7.4%). The essential oil was assessed for its antimicrobial activity using a disc diffusion assay and resulted in moderate to potent antibacterial and antifungal activities targeting mainly Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. The oil moderately reduced the diphenylpicrylhydrazyl radical (IC₅₀ = 4.2 μL/mL or 4.1 mg/mL). In vitro cytotoxicity evaluation against HT29 (human colonic adenocarcinoma cells) showed that the essential oil exhibited a moderate antitumor effect with IC₅₀ of 110 ± 4 μg/mL.

In previous study, we reported synthesis and the biological preliminary results of γ-lactam based HDAC inhibitors. Based on the previous results, smaller γ-lactam core HDAC inhibitors are more active than the corresponding series of larger δ-lactam based analogues and the hydrophobic and bulky cap groups are required for better potency which decreased microsomal stability. Thus, γ-lactam analogues with methoxy, trifluoromethyl groups of ortho-, meta-, para-positions of cap group were prepared and evaluated their biological potency. Among them, trifluoromethyl analogues, which have larger lipophilicity, showed better HDAC inhibitory activity than other analogues. In overall, lipophilicity leads to increase hydrophobic interaction between surface of HDAC active site and HDAC inhibitor, improves HDAC inhibitory activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3ahistone deacetylase 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3apost-translational modification1 aChoi, Eunhyun1 aCho, Misun1 aLee, Boah1 aOh, Soo Jin1 aPark, Song-Kyu1 aLee, Kiho1 aKim, Hwan Mook1 aHan, Gyoonhee0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2012 June 15, v. 22, no. 12 p.4189-4192dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.04.0453Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006600150245011100216300001600327520165500343592002801998650001602026650002702042650001302069651001302082653002402095653001902119653002902138653003002167700002402197773010802221856008502329852000902414655001202423IND60688431820221117223624.0201209e20200730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068843182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2020.03.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyamushosho, Robert T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3449-931610aArchaeological implications of ethnographically grounded functional study of pottery from Nyanga, Zimbabwe  ap. 150-164.  aThe value of typological analyses of pottery in global archaeology is widely acknowledged. However, pottery typologies in southern Africa are frequently criticised for one-dimensionally revealing more about decorations on pots and not their function and meaning to people that made and used them. This motivated an experiment to combine functional and stylistic variables of pottery from modern-day Nyanga district, in north-eastern Zimbabwe to develop alternative ways of approaching archaeological pottery. With the alertness that the present and the past are different, even in contexts of strong cultural continuity, we applied the results of the experiment to a collection of archaeological pottery from Nyanga tradition (CE 1300–1900) sites. For the recent past, the study indicated that vessel shapes strongly correlated with names and functions of pottery across the mundane, ritual and symbolic worlds. Comparisons with the archaeological picture identified a similarity of shapes between the past and the present. This stimulated reflections on a wide array of quotidian roles and functions that pottery fulfilled for Nyanga populations in the deep past. The conclusion to the paper is that functional classifications, particularly when combined with style, are a strong alternative to dominant classification schemes which enlighten more on people and not the vessels. However, the robustness of such an approach must be firmed up with the application of approaches from the material, chemical, and molecular approaches to develop a holistic view of pottery and its role in everyday practice at individual, community and societal levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3aculture and humanities 3atopology 3aZimbabwe 0aFunctional typology 0aNyanga pottery 0aExperimental archaeology 0aAfrican centred knowledge1 aChirikure, Shadreck0 tQuaternary international.g2020 July 30, v. 555 p.150-164dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.03.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04059naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245011000201500002000311520229600331592002802627596004402655596003702699650003902736650002302775650001102798650002502809650001202834650002102846650002602867650001502893650003102908650001302939650001502952650001902967650001102986650004002997650002303037650002503060650002903085650001503114650002203129650001303151650001503164651001203179700001903191700002003210700002303230700006203253773010703315856007403422852000903496655001203505IND60761461020221120105733.0211229e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076146102DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.38492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKominoski, John S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0978-332610aUnderstanding drivers of aquatic ecosystem metabolism in freshwater subtropical ridge and slough wetlands  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHow climate and habitat drive variation in aquatic metabolism in wetlands remains uncertain. To quantify differences in seasonal aquatic metabolism among wetlands, we estimated aquatic ecosystem metabolism (gross primary productivity, GPP; ecosystem respiration, ER; net aquatic productivity, NAP) in subtropical ridge and slough wetlands of the Florida Everglades from more than 2 yr of continuously measured water column dissolved oxygen, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), water temperature, and water depth. Gross primary productivity and ER were modeled from light, temperature, and water depth using non‐linear minimization and maximum likelihood. Reaeration rates were estimated from wind speed. Dissolved oxygen was below saturation at all sites during both wet and dry seasons. Water depth interacted with vegetation to influence PAR, water temperature, and spatiotemporal patterns in aquatic metabolism. Gross primary productivity and ER were highest at the slough with lowest submerged aquatic vegetation (low‐SAV slough), intermediate in the sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense) ridge site, and lowest at the slough with highest submerged aquatic vegetation (high‐SAV slough). Ecosystem respiration was strongly positively correlated with GPP at the sawgrass ridge and low‐SAV slough sites. Gross primary productivity increased with water temperature and PAR across all habitat types, whereas ER decreased (more respiration) with water temperature and PAR. Net aquatic productivity was negatively correlated with water temperature and positively correlated with PAR, suggesting that ER was more sensitive than GPP to water temperature. Aquatic metabolism was largely net heterotrophic in all wetlands, and high‐SAV appeared to buffer seasonal variation in PAR and water temperatures that drive NAP in subtropical wetlands. Our results suggest that aquatic ecosystem metabolism in wetlands with seasonal hydrology is sensitive to changes in water depth and vegetation density that influence temperature and light. Expanding our understanding of how metabolic processes and carbon cycling in wetland ecosystems vary across gradients in hydrology, vegetation, and organic matter could enhance our understanding and protection of conditions that maximize carbon storage.  aPublisher supplied data  cSouth Florida Water Management District  cFlorida International University 3aCladium mariscus subsp. jamaicense 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3adissolved oxygen 3aecosystem respiration 3afreshwater 3agross primary productivity 3ahabitats 3ametabolism 3aorganic matter 3aoxygen 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aseasonal variation 3astatistical analysis 3asubmerged aquatic plants 3avegetation 3awater temperature 3awetlands 3awind speed 3aFlorida1 aPachón, Julio1 aBrock, James T.1 aMcVoy, Christopher1 aMalone, Sparkle L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9034-10760 tEcosphere.g2021 Dec., v. 12, no. 12 p.e03849-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.38493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01781naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245007500162300001600237520086400253592002801117650002201145650002601167650001101193650001101204650001301215650001301228650001501241773013701256856007701393852000901470655001201479IND60521257020221117173647.0160529e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052125702DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1965-08122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenke, Wilhelm10aVersuche zur Aufklärung der molekularen Struktur der Thylakoidmembran  ap. 802-805.  aThylakoids from chloroplasts of Antirrhinum majus and of the blue-green alga Oscillatoria chalybea form folds during the drying on support films.

In these preparations the thylakoid membrane seems to consist of a monolayer of particles. These are insoluble in organic solvents. The center to center distance of the particles approximately agrees with the roentgenographically determined center to center distance of the protein particles in the thylakoid membrane. It was not possible to demonstrate lipids in the thylakoid membrane.

The chiral concave shape and absolute structure of the concave molecules were revealed by X-ray analysis. The concave molecule exhibited intense chiroptical properties with a large anisotropy, which was derived from molecular orbitals delocalized to the side chains. In the co-crystal with pristine C₆₀, four of the enantiopure concave molecules perfectly wrapped the surface of C₆₀. MALDI-TOF mass, NMR, and circular dichromism spectra also supported the concave/convex interaction between the concave molecule and fullerene. These results suggest that the phosphorus-containing molecule with a concave shape plays an important role as a chiral host molecule for C₆₀.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aenantiomers 3afullerene 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphorus1 aSaito, Tsuyoshi1 aNabeshima, Tatsuya0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Oct. 08, v. 136, no. 40 p.14299-14306dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja507913u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002400112245010000136300001400236520157600250592002801826650001001854650003101864650001301895650001701908650001101925650000901936650001401945650001101959653003201970653001602002653001702018700002102035700001702056700001202073700002102085700002302106773011402129852000902243655001202252IND60717025920221122121833.0201107e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071702592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarmā, Umākānta,10aEvaluation of promising cytoplasmic male-sterile line of rice for agronomical and floral traits  ap. 85-87.  aNine CMS lines of rice were evaluated for their morphological and floral traits. six agronomical traits with standard check CMS line IR-58025A. Five CMS lines viz., IR-6888A, HPMS-10A, HPMS-11A, HP-5001A and HP-5004A were of early in duration (75 to 89 days to 50% flowering) and other three lines were of medium duration (90–100 days). HP-5001A was the earliest in days to 50% flowering (75 days); while IR-70362A was late (101 days). The lines viz., IR-70362, IR-70372, HPMS-5A and HPMS-92 recorded, significantly more days to 50% flowering over IR-58025A (check). The maximum plant height was observed in HPMS-9A (105.0 cm) followed by HP-5001A (91.0 cm) and HP-5004A (88.00 cm). The shortest plant height was observed in IR-70362 (65.7 cm). The maximum productive tillers plant⁻¹, observed in HP-5004 (12.0), was significantly superior to the check. The panicle length ranged from 20.0 (HPMS-5A) to 30.0 (HP-5001A) cm. Panicle exertion is an important feature in CMS lines for getting proper seed production. The panicle exertion ranged from 74.60 (IR-70362A) to 90.00 (HP-5001A) percent. The spikelets per panicle were highest in HP-5001A (192.0).

Cyclic dipeptides, a group of compounds, contain several important biological functions. In this paper, we proposed a novel method for L-asparaginase expression and purification from Echerichia coli and determined the effect of cyclic dipeptides on the enzymatic activity of recombinant L-asparaginase. The gene ansB encoding L-asparaginase was amplified from the genome of E. coli BL21 (DE3) by polymerase chain reaction and sub-cloned into pET-15b vector to construct expressing plasmid pET-15b-ansB. The expression of recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography using a nickel resin followed by anion exchange chromatography. The purity and quality of the recombinant L-asparaginase were optimised. The results indicated that km for the recombinant L-asparaginase was 3.02 × 10⁻⁴ mol/L. Both cyclo-(Pro-Tyr) and cyclo-(Pro-Phe) could inhibit the activity of recombinant L-asparaginase at the level of 10⁻⁵ mol/L.  aPublisher supplied data  aBS2010SW007cOutstanding Young Scientist Award from Shangdong Province 3aEscherichia coli 3aaffinity chromatography 3aanion exchange chromatography 3aantineoplastic agents 3aasparaginase 3adipeptides 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3anickel 3anitrogen metabolism 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arecombinant proteins 0aL-asparaginase 0aEcherichia coli 0aexpression 0apurification 0acyclic dipeptides1 aLi, Dan1 aLi, Yan0 tNatural product research.g2017 Sept. 17, v. 31, no. 18 p.2099-2106dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000126x1478-64277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2016.12773503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01092naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245004100162300001600203520016900219592002800388650002300416650002300439650002100462650002200483650001400505700001700519700001800536773015000554856007700704852000900781655001200790IND60521257520221117173648.0160529e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052125752DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1965-09052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurohit, D.

Based on Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) observations from June 1 to 16, 2011, RFI over Europe was identified and analyzed using the modified principal component analysis algorithm in this paper. The X band AMSR-E measurements in England and Italy are mostly affected by the stable, persistent, active microwave transmitters on the surface, while the RFI source of other European countries is the interference of the reflected geostationary TV satellite downlink signals to the measurements of spaceborne microwave radiometers. The locations and intensities of the RFI induced by the geostationary TV and communication satellites changed with time within the observed period. The observations of spaceborne microwave radiometers in ascending portions of orbits are usually interfered with over European land, while no RFI was detected in descending passes. The RFI locations and intensities from the reflection of downlink radiation are highly dependent upon the relative geometry between the geostationary satellite and the measuring passive sensor. Only these fields of view of a spaceborne instrument whose scan azimuths are close to the azimuth relative to the geostationary satellite are likely to be affected by RFI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aheat emissions 3amicrowave radiometers 3aorbits 3aprincipal component analysis 3asatellites 3aEngland 3aItaly1 aZhang, Sibo0 tFrontiers of earth science.g2016 Mar., v. 10, no. 1 p.135-144dHigher Education Pressx2095-01957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-015-0487-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245017900169520114000348592002801488650000801516650001101524650001401535650003401549650002001583650001601603650002001619650001001639650000901649650002201658650002101680650002901701653001201730653001201742653001301754653002101767700002101788700001701809700002001826700001701846773009401863856008201957852000902039655001202048IND60725300720221122033330.0210223e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072530072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2020.1063652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReshetnikov, V.V.10aData of correlation analysis between the density of H3K4me3 in promoters of genes and gene expression: Data from RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses of the murine prefrontal cortex  aH3K4me3 is typically found in the promoter region of genes and is a mark associated with an open chromatin state and active gene transcription. Nonetheless, the role of H3K4me3 in the regulation of transcription is still debated. To improve the understanding of the connection between H3K4me3 density in promoters and gene expression, we assessed the correlation between these two parameters. We utilized genome-wide high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data and H3K4me3-based chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), carried out on the same samples of the prefrontal cortex from 10 male C57Bl6 mice with different stress experience [Social defeat stress in adult mice causes alterations in gene expression, alternative splicing, and the epigenetic landscape of H3K4me3 in the prefrontal cortex: an impact of early-life stress, 1]. In addition, we assessed the correlation between H3K4me3 density and gene expression in datasets of cell-specific genes. Altogether, the results are useful for the elucidation of H3K4me3 involvement in the regulation of transcription in the murine prefrontal cortex.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aadults 3achromatin 3achromatin immunoprecipitation 3adata collection 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3amales 3amice 3aprefrontal cortex 3apromoter regions 3atranscription (genetics) 0aH3K4me3 0aRNA-seq 0aChIP-seq 0aCell specificity1 aKisaretova, P.E.1 aErshov, N.I.1 aMerkulova, T.I.1 aBondar, N.P.0 tData in Brief.g2020 Dec., v. 33 p.106365-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.1063653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245011100176300001600287520159800303592002801901650001401929650002201943650001201965650001101977650002301988650002402011650001002035650001502045650001202060650001302072650001802085650001602103650002102119650002002140650002202160650001002182653001402192653002102206653002402227653002302251653001702274700002402291700002202315773013202337856008402469852000902553655001202562IND60606230720221119174359.0190318e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060623072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2015.10.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez-Gonzalez, V.10aRole of fish farm fouling in recolonisation of nearby soft-bottom habitats affected by coastal aquaculture  ap. 210-215.  aOrganic loading from fish farming constitutes a significant disturbance to marine sediment, normally reducing species abundance and richness and creating disturbed patches in soft-bottom communities. In contrast, floating fish farms harbour a high abundance of invertebrates associated with fouling communities, particularly amphipods. Changes in macrofaunal recolonisation induced by fish farms were researched using amphipod assemblages as a useful representative group. The objectives of this experiment were: (1) to test the effect of fish farms on amphipod colonisation processes in defaunated sediments and (2) to define the influence of surrounding natural and artificial habitats as sources of initial colonisers. Experimental design included 36 plastic trays placed on the sea bottom (25–28m depth) in fish-farming and control areas and retrieved one month after placement date. Significant differences were found in amphipod assemblage composition in control versus farm sites. While the recolonisation process in control areas depended on the species present in the sediments adjacent to the experimental trays, in fish-farming areas the recolonisation was strongly dependent on the input of amphipods from fouling communities. It is the first time that a spillover effect from fouling communities on floating habitats into the benthos is detected in the coastal areas. If the organic enrichment of aquaculture sediments is moderate, the ecological services of benthic habitats may be balanced, at least partly, by biomass exported from fouling communities on the same fish farms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3abenthic organisms 3abiomass 3acoasts 3aecosystem services 3aexperimental design 3afauna 3afish farms 3afouling 3ahabitats 3ainvertebrates 3amariculture 3amarine sediments 3apopulation size 3aspecies abundance 3atrays 0aAmphipods 0aField experiment 0aDefaunated sediment 0aExperimental trays 0aMacrobenthos1 aMartinez-Garcia, E.1 aSanchez-Jerez, P.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2016 Jan., v. 474 p.210-215dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2015.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245018200176300001800358520161000376592002801986650002102014650001902035650001602054650002202070650002202092650002102114650001602135650002202151650001702173653001802190653002802208653002102236653003302257653002202290653002302312700004202335700001902377700002202396700002302418700002102441773012102462856008502583852000902668655001202677IND60536069020221116165850.0190215e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053606902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2015.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamariah, Neelagandan10aCrystallographic and solution studies of NAD+- and NADH-bound alkylhydroperoxide reductase subunit F (AhpF) from Escherichia coli provide insight into sequential enzymatic steps  ap. 1139-1152.  aRedox homeostasis is significant for the survival of pro- and eukaryotic cells and is crucial for defense against reactive oxygen species like superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. In Escherichia coli, the reduction of peroxides occurs via the redox active disulfide center of the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase C subunit (AhpC), whose reduced state becomes restored by AhpF. The 57kDa EcAhpF contains an N-terminal domain (NTD), which catalyzes the electron transfer from NADH via an FAD of the C-terminal domain into EcAhpC. The NTD is connected to the C-terminal domain via a linker. Here, the first crystal structure of E. coli AhpF bound with NADH and NAD+ has been determined at 2.5Å and 2.4Å resolution, respectively. The NADH-bound form of EcAhpF reveals that the NADH-binding domain is required to alter its conformation to bring a bound NADH to the re-face of the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin, and thereby render the NADH-domain dithiol center accessible to the NTD disulfide center for electron transfer. The NAD+-bound form of EcAhpF shows conformational differences for the nicotinamide end moieties and its interacting residue M467, which is proposed to represent an intermediate product-release conformation. In addition, the structural alterations in EcAhpF due to NADH- and NAD+-binding in solution are shown by small angle X-ray scattering studies. The EcAhpF is revealed to adopt many intermediate conformations in solution to facilitate the electron transfer from the substrate NADH to the C-terminal domain, and subsequently to the NTD of EcAhpF for the final step of AhpC reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aX-radiation 3acrystal structure 3aelectron transfer 3aeukaryotic cells 3ahomeostasis 3ahydrogen peroxide 3anicotinamide 0aBioenergetics 0aReactive oxygen species 0aOxidative stress 0aAlkylhydroperoxide reductase 0aRedox homeostasis 0aStructural biology1 aManimekalai, Malathy Sony Subramanian1 aNartey, Wilson1 aEisenhaber, Frank1 aEisenhaber, Birgit1 aGruber, Gerhard,0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2015 Oct., v. 1847, no. 10 p.1139-1152dElsevier B.V.wJournal:1927x0005-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2015.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008900169500002200258520116100280592002801441650002701469650002701496650002501523650002501548650001301573650002501586650001601611650002201627650004201649650004301691650000901734650001401743650001601757650001901773650001401792650001101806653002401817653001801841653001901859653003001878700001701908700002401925700002101949700002301970773009701993856008202090852000902172655001202181IND60567065120221117050353.0170731s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056706512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.04.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakehara, Masaya10aPeptidoglycan accelerates granulopoiesis through a TLR2- and MyD88-dependent pathway  aPre-press version  aGranulopoiesis is accelerated during Gram-negative bacterial infection through activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). In this study, we tested whether activation of TLR2 promotes granulopoiesis by using the well-known TLR2 agonist, peptidoglycan (PGN). Neutrophils in bone marrow and spleen, and plasma granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) were increased in mice that had received intraperitoneal PGN administration. Incorporation of BrdU into bone marrow neutrophils increased, demonstrating that PGN accelerated granulopoiesis. Treatment of bone marrow cells (BMCs) with PGN increased neutrophils in vitro and promoted the secretion of G-CSF from Ly-6G−Ly-6C+ monocytes. The accelerated granulopoiesis caused by PGN was not seen in TLR2-deficient and MyD88-deficient BMCs. Additionally, PGN induced G-CSF production in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These findings demonstrate that PGN promotes the secretion of G-CSF from monocytes and endothelial cells, leading to the acceleration of granulopoiesis. Our results illustrate that bacterial recognition by TLR2 facilitates granulopoiesis during Gram-positive bacterial infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aToll-like receptor 2 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aagonists 3abacterial infections 3abone marrow 3abone marrow cells 3agranulocyte colony-stimulating factor 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3amice 3amonocytes 3aneutrophils 3apeptidoglycans 3asecretion 3aspleen 0aToll-like receptors 0aPeptidoglycan 0aGranulopoiesis 0aColony-stimulating factor1 aSeike, Soshi1 aTakagishi, Teruhisa1 aKobayashi, Keiko1 aNagahama, Masahiro0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.04.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014000163300001400303520154700317592002801864650002001892650001101912650001101923650001101934650001901945650001401964650001601978650005001994650001502044650001902059650001702078650001102095650002402106650002102130651001002151700001602161700001502177700001502192700001702207773010602224856008102330852000902411655001202420IND60477627820221118043625.0151231e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047762782DNAL7 a10.1007/s11707-015-0510-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Weichun10aAir temperature field distribution estimations over a Chinese mega-city using MODIS land surface temperature data: the case of Shanghai  ap. 38-48.  aThe capability of obtaining spatially distributed air temperature data from remote sensing measurements is an improvement for many environmental applications focused on urban heat island, carbon emissions, climate change, etc. This paper is based on the MODIS/Terra and Aqua data utilized to study the effect of the urban atmospheric heat island in Shanghai, China. The correlation between retrieved MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and air temperature measured at local weather stations was initially studied at different temporal and spatial scales. Secondly, the air temperature data with spatial resolutions of 250 m and 1 km were estimated from MODIS LST data and in-situ measured air temperature. The results showed that there is a slightly higher correlation between air temperature and MODIS LST at a 250m resolution in spring and autumn on an annual scale than observed at a 1 km resolution. Although the distribution pattern of the air temperature thermal field varies in different seasons, the urban heat island (UHI) in Shanghai is characterized by a distribution pattern of multiple centers, with the central urban area as the primary center and the built-up regions in each district as the subcenters. This study demonstrates the potential not only for estimating the distribution of the air temperature thermal field from MODIS LST with 250 m resolution in spring and autumn in Shanghai, but also for providing scientific and effective methods for monitoring and studying UHI effect in a Chinese mega-city such as Shanghai.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aautumn 3acarbon 3acities 3aclimate change 3aemissions 3aheat island 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonitoring 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 3aspring 3asurface temperature 3aweather stations 3aChina1 aZhou, Liguo1 aZhang, Hao1 aZhang, Yan1 aDai, Xiaoyan0 tFrontiers of earth science.g2016 Mar., v. 10, no. 1 p.38-48dHigher Education Pressx2095-01957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-015-0510-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008600165520201200251592002802263650001902291650002002310650002302330650001202353653002302365653001702388653002702405653003302432653002102465700002102486700001602507700001702523700001402540773009402554856008202648852000902730655001202739IND60725300820221122043058.0210223e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072530082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2020.1063662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhirfan, Luna10aDataset for assessing the scope and nature of global stream daylighting practices  aThis paper presents five publicly available datasets (I through V) of which two are interactive and visual tools (a Tableau Dashboard and an Interactive Map). These five datasets were extracted from 115 literature sources on the daylighting of streams that were published between 1992 and 2018. Dataset I consist of 19 variables that combine two types of data extracted from these sources: ten manifest variables (indisputable, obvious, factual) and nine variables extracted from the sources’ latent content (indirect, hence, based on careful reading of the sources’ contents). Manifest variables include, among others, authors’ names and affiliations, authorship location, and publication year. Latent variables include primarily the literature sources’ underlying themes and their sub-themes (sub-categories), the daylighting case studies/projects discussed, and the geographic coverage or scope addressed in the literature sources. Datasets II identifies 16 literature sources that delve into the climate change adaptation and/or mitigation theme and reveal how it was tackled vis-à-vis the other themes/sub-themes. Dataset III identifies and provides detailed information on the 145 different stream daylighting case studies/projects mentioned in the literature's sources, such as each project's location, daylighted length, completion date, cost, and type of treatment. Dataset IV is a Tableau Dashboard that offers interactive analytical querying in the form of relational analyses and data visualization while Dataset V is an Interactive Map created in Google My Map that maps the 145 stream daylighting case studies/projects mentioned in the literature sources over and provides a synopsis on each based on the literature's contents. The combination of these five datasets and their diversity in type and presentation yields a comprehensive, global, and unique repository of information on the daylighting of urban streams for all types of audiences (academic, professional, and laypeople).  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3adata visualization 3astreams 0aStream daylighting 0aDeculverting 0aNature-based solutions 0aSystematic literature review 0aContent analysis1 aMohtat, Niloofar1 aPeck, Megan1 aChan, Andrew1 aMa, Lucas0 tData in Brief.g2020 Dec., v. 33 p.106366-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.1063663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02260naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013000174300001800304520088700322592002801209650002701237650002201264650001101286650000901297650002401306650001801330650002401348650001601372650001201388650000701400700002701407700002601434700002001460700001801480700001801498700002401516700002101540700002001561700001901581700002401600773008501624856008401709852000901793655001201802IND60553989020221119181538.0161023e20150618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055398902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2015.04.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFleckenstein, Tilly14aThe Chaperone Activity of the Developmental Small Heat Shock Protein Sip1 Is Regulated by pH-Dependent Conformational Changes  ap. 1067-1078.  aSmall heat shock proteins (sHsps) are ubiquitous molecular chaperones that prevent the aggregation of unfolding proteins during proteotoxic stress. In Caenorhabditis elegans, Sip1 is the only sHsp exclusively expressed in oocytes and embryos. Here, we demonstrate that Sip1 is essential for heat shock survival of reproducing adults and embryos. X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy revealed that Sip1 exists in a range of well-defined globular assemblies consisting of two half-spheres, each made of dimeric “spokes.” Strikingly, the oligomeric distribution of Sip1 as well as its chaperone activity depend on pH, with a trend toward smaller species and higher activity at acidic conditions such as present in nematode eggs. The analysis of the interactome shows that Sip1 has a specific substrate spectrum including proteins that are essential for embryo development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadults 3aeggs 3aelectron microscopy 3aembryogenesis 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat stress 3aoocytes 3apH1 aKastenmüller, Andreas1 aStein, Martin Lorenz1 aPeters, Carsten1 aDaake, Marina1 aKrause, Maike1 aWeinfurtner, Daniel1 aHaslbeck, Martin1 aWeinkauf, Sevil1 aGroll, Michael1 aBüchner, Johannes,0 tMolecular cell.g2015 June 18, v. 58 p.1067-1078dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2015.04.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245012700161300001600288520149900304592002801803650002701831650001701858650001101875650001001886650001201896650001101908650002501919650001401944650001401958650001301972700001501985700001602000700001502016700001802031700001602049700002202065700001802087700001902105700001902124773013202143856008302275852000902358655001202367IND60549011220221122155233.0160906e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054901122DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-03-16-0056-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Wenwu10aSequencing of the Litchi Downy Blight Pathogen Reveals It Is a Phytophthora Species With Downy Mildew-Like Characteristics  ap. 573-583.  aOn the basis of its downy mildew–like morphology, the litchi downy blight pathogen was previously named Peronophythora litchii. Recently, however, it was proposed to transfer this pathogen to Phytophthora clade 4. To better characterize this unusual oomycete species and important fruit pathogen, we obtained the genome sequence of Phytophthora litchii and compared it to those from other oomycete species. P. litchii has a small genome with tightly spaced genes. On the basis of a multilocus phylogenetic analysis, the placement of P. litchii in the genus Phytophthora is strongly supported. Effector proteins predicted included 245 RxLR, 30 necrosis-and-ethylene-inducing protein-like, and 14 crinkler proteins. The typical motifs, phylogenies, and activities of these effectors were typical for a Phytophthora species. However, like the genome features of the analyzed downy mildews, P. litchii exhibited a streamlined genome with a relatively small number of genes in both core and species-specific protein families. The low GC content and slight codon preferences of P. litchii sequences were similar to those of the analyzed downy mildews and a subset of Phytophthora species. Taken together, these observations suggest that P. litchii is a Phytophthora pathogen that is in the process of acquiring downy mildew–like genomic and morphological features. Thus P. litchii may provide a novel model for investigating morphological development and genomic adaptation in oomycete pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPeronophythora litchii 3aPhytophthora 3ablight 3agenes 3amildews 3amodels 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3aproteins1 aWang, Yang1 aShen, Danyu1 aLi, Delong1 aPu, Tianhuizi1 aJiang, Zide1 aZhang, Zhengguang1 aZheng, Xiaobo1 aTyler, Brett M1 aWang, Yuanchao0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2016 July, v. 29, no. 7 p.573-583dMolecular Plant-Microbe Interactionsx0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FMPMI-03-16-0056-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03397naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002600181245010400207506007600311520177800387592002802165506003702193650001502230650000902245650001702254650001402271650001202285650000902297650002602306650001402332650001902346650001902365650001902384650001202403650001002415700002702425700002502452700001602477700002702493700001802520700002802538700002402566700002602590700002202616700002402638773012202662856007402784852000902858655001202867IND60650329320221207120823.0190709e20180815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065032932DNAL7 a10.3390/nu100810922doi7 aPMC61158432pmcid7 a301117222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorison, Brittany  J.10aImpact of a Modified Version of Baby-Led Weaning on Dietary Variety and Food Preferences in Infants  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this study was to determine whether food variety and perceived food preferences differ in infants following baby-led instead of traditional spoon-feeding approaches to introducing solids. A total of 206 women (41.3% primiparous) were recruited in late pregnancy from a single maternity hospital (response rate 23.4%) and randomized to Control (n = 101) or BLISS (n = 105) groups. All participants received government-funded Well Child care. BLISS participants also received support to exclusively breastfeed to 6 months and three educational sessions on BLISS (Baby-Led Weaning, modified to reduce the risk of iron deficiency, growth faltering, and choking) at 5.5, 7, and 9 months. Food variety was calculated from three-day weighed diet records at 7, 12, and 24 months. Questionnaires assessed infant preference for different tastes and textures at 12 months, and for &lsquo;vegetables&rsquo;, &lsquo;fruit&rsquo;, &lsquo;meat and fish&rsquo;, or &lsquo;desserts&rsquo; at 24 months. At 24 months, 50.5% of participants provided diet record data, and 78.2% provided food preference data. BLISS participants had greater variety in &lsquo;core&rsquo; (difference in counts over three days, 95% CI: 1.3, 0.4 to 2.2), &lsquo;non-core&rsquo; (0.6, 0.2 to 0.9), and &lsquo;meat and other protein&rsquo; (1.3, 0.8 to 1.9) foods at 7 months, and in &lsquo;fruit and vegetable&rsquo; foods at 24 months (2, 0.4 to 3.6). The only differences in perceived food preferences observed were very small (i.e., <5% difference in score, at 12 months only). Infants following the modified Baby-Led Weaning were exposed to more varied and textured foods from an early age, but only an increased variety in &lsquo;fruit and vegetable&rsquo; intake was apparent by two years of age.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achild care 3adiet 3afood choices 3ahospitals 3ainfants 3airon 3anutrient deficiencies 3apregnancy 3aquestionnaires 3arisk reduction 3atextured foods 3aweaning 3awomen1 aHeath, Anne-Louise  M.1 aHaszard, Jillian  J.1 aHein, Karen1 aFleming, Elizabeth A.,1 aDaniels, Lisa1 aErickson, Elizabeth  W.1 aFangupo, Louise  J.1 aWheeler, Benjamin  J.1 aTaylor, Barry  J.1 aTaylor, Rachael  W.0 tNutrients.g2018 Aug. 15, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu100810923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245008000209300001100289506007600300520124000376592002801616506003701644650002301681650001101704650001701715650001001732650001601742650001701758650002101775650002001796650001901816650000901835650002001844650001901864700001501883700001801898773007201916856008101988852000902069655001202078IND60555479920221207062647.0161030e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055547992DNAL7 a10.1186/s12284-015-0065-22doi7 aPMC45895422pmcid7 a264240042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurchie, Erik H.10aPhotoprotection as a Trait for Rice Yield Improvement: Status and Prospects  ap. 31.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSolar radiation is essential for photosynthesis and global crop productivity but it is also variable in space and time, frequently being limiting or in excess of plant requirements depending on season, environment and microclimate. Photoprotective mechanisms at the chloroplast level help to avoid oxidative stress and photoinhibition, which is a light-induced reduction in photosynthetic quantum efficiency often caused by damage to photosystem II. There is convincing evidence that photoinhibition has a large impact on biomass production in crops and this may be especially high in rice, which is typically exposed to high tropical light levels. Thus far there has been little attention to photoinhibition as a target for improvement of crop yield. However, we now have sufficient evidence to examine avenues for alleviation of this particular stress and the physiological and genetic basis for improvement in rice and other crops. Here we examine this evidence and identify new areas for attention. In particular we discuss how photoprotective mechanisms must be optimised at both the molecular and the canopy level in order to coordinate with efficient photosynthetic regulation and realise an increased biomass and yield in rice.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomass production 3acanopy 3achloroplasts 3acrops 3agrain yield 3amicroclimate 3aoxidative stress 3aphotoinhibition 3aphotostability 3arice 3asolar radiation 3aspace and time1 aAli, Asgar1 aHerman, Tiara0 tRice.g2015 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.31-31dSpringer USx1939-84257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12284-015-0065-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100003100149245017500180300001600355520185800371592002802229650001702257650002502274650001402299650001402313650001102327650001802338650001802356650001102374650000902385650001802394650003102412650001102443650002202454650001602476650001402492700002102506700002002527700002002547700002302567700001802590700001902608773009902627856008502726852000902811655001202820IND4469658920221121234539.0141111e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446965892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2012.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelščak-Cvitanović, Ana10aInnovative formulations of chocolates enriched with plant polyphenols from Rubus idaeus L. leaves and characterization of their physical, bioactive and sensory properties  ap. 820-830.  aIn the present study, bioactive content, physical and sensory properties of milk, semisweet and dark chocolates enriched with concentrated (1% and 3%) and freeze dried (1%) red raspberry leaf (Rubus idaeus L.) extract were studied. The addition of 3% concentrated extract reduced the particle size distribution parameter d(0.5) (20.15–16.63μm in milk, 12.55–8.22μm in semisweet and 13.95–12.05μm in dark chocolates), but provided harder chocolates with higher viscosity and rough, coarse product surface, resulting in an unattractive and sensorily unacceptable product. The addition of freeze dried extract increased the particle size of chocolates (d(0.5)=20.15–22.82μm and d(0.9)=53.90–65.47μm in milk, d(0.5)=13.95–14.29μm and d(0.9)=39.51–83.32μm in dark chocolates), but did not cause any significant difference in the chocolate surface, and was scored the best in terms of visual, textural and flavor attributes. The addition of 1% of concentrated or 1% of freeze dried extract did not alter the total phenol content (TPC) (Folin–Ciocalteu method) of enriched chocolate compared to plain samples, while the addition of 3% concentrated extract enhanced the TPC in all chocolates. Proanthocyanidins content was increased only by the addition of 3% of concentrated extract, while the content of flavan-3-ols exhibited an increase after enrichment, but only when determined with vanillin index assay, due to high variability and structural diversity of flavan-3-ols in the substrate, method of non-selectivity or interferences. The displayed results indicate that the used concentrations of raspberry leaf extract are not effective enough for enhancing the bioactive profile of chocolates and that for achieving the optimal physical, bioactive and sensory properties, a freeze dried concentrate of raspberry leaf should be used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRubus idaeus 3abioactive properties 3achocolate 3aflavanols 3aflavor 3afreeze drying 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3amilk 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3aphenol 3aproanthocyanidins 3araspberries 3aviscosity1 aKomes, Draženka1 aBenković, Maja1 aKarlović, Sven1 aHečimović, Ivana1 aJežek, Damir1 aBauman, Ingrid0 tFood research international.g2012 Oct., v. 48, no. 2 p.820-830dElsevier Ltdx0963-99697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2012.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001200153245011400165300001600279520149000295592002801785650002001813650001201833650002601845650001701871650002601888650002301914650002501937650002301962650001501985650002102000650001302021650002302034650001102057650001302068650002002081650003002101650001602131651001002147653002502157653002502182653002502207653002502232653001902257653001602276700001302292700001602305700001602321773010802337856008802445852000902533655001202542IND60538086120221121120820.0190319e20140924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053808612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2014.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYou, L.10aModeling regional ecosystem development under uncertainty – A case study for New Binhai District of Tianjin  ap. 127-142.  aIn this study, an interval-fuzzy regional ecosystem management (IF-REM) model is developed based on an interval fuzzy linear programming (IFLP) technique. The IF-REM model can handle uncertainties expressed as fuzzy sets and discrete intervals; it also incorporates ecosystem service valuation directly into the optimization process, such that an effective linkage between economic values and ecosystem services can be provided. The IF-REM model is applied to a real case of planning regional ecosystem development in New Binhai District of Tianjin, where the natural ecosystem has suffered the severe degradation induced by large-scale land reclamation projects along the coastal line. Results of land use patterns, industrial pollution-mitigation schemes, and cost-benefit analysis can be obtained. The results suggest that large scale reclamation projects can bring a series of negative effects to the coastal ecosystem, such as endangering animals and plants, changing intrinsic gas regulation, as well as altering natural nutrient cycling; moreover, the current cost for land reclamation is too low to reflect the ecosystem losses and unable to curb excessive reclamation projects, which implies that ecosystem service valuation is of great significance. These findings can facilitate the local decision makers in not only considering regional ecosystem integrity but also gaining insights into the tradeoff between socio-economic development and eco-environmental sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aanimals 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acase studies 3acost benefit analysis 3aeconomic valuation 3aecosystem management 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aland restoration 3aland use 3alinear programming 3amodels 3aplanning 3aplants (botany) 3asocioeconomic development 3auncertainty 3aChina 0aEcosystem management 0aReclamation projects 0aOptimization process 0aRegional development 0aSustainability 0aUncertainty1 aLi, Y.P.1 aHuang, G.H.1 aZhang, J.L.0 tEcological modelling.g2014 Sept. 24, v. 288 p.127-142dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2014.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01508naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013100167300001600298520044700314592002800761650001600789650001300805650002600818650001600844700001900860700002000879700001900899700001900918700002000937773013400957856008201091852000901173655001201182IND60779053220221119095047.0220603e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077905322DNAL7 a10.1134/S00036838220300852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuvarina, A.

We assessed the relationship between soil structure induced by tillage and soil microbial activity at the level of soil aggregates. To this aim, organic C (OC), microbial biomass C (MBC) and soil respiration were measured in water-stable aggregates (WSA) of different sizes from a subtropical rice soil under two tillage systems: conventional tillage (CT) and a combination of ridge with no-tillage (RNT). Soil (0–20cm) was fractionated into six different aggregate sizes (>4.76, 4.76–2.0, 2.0–1.0, 1.0–0.25, 0.25–0.053, and <0.053mm in diameter). Soil OC, MBC, respiration rate, and metabolic quotient were heterogeneously distributed among soil aggregates while the patterns of aggregate-size distribution were similar among properties, regardless of tillage system. The content of OC within WSA followed the sequence: medium-aggregates (1.0–0.25mm and 1.0–2.0mm)>macro-aggregates (4.76–2.0mm)>micro-aggregates (0.25–0.053mm)>large aggregates (>4.76mm)>silt+clay fractions (<0.053mm). The highest levels of MBC were associated with the 1.0–2.0mm aggregate size class. Significant differences in respiration rates were also observed among different sizes of WSA, and the highest respiration rate was associated with 1.0–2.0mm aggregates. The Cₘᵢc/Cₒᵣg was greatest for the large-macroaggregates regardless of tillage regimes. This ratio decreased with aggregate size to 1.0–0.25mm. Soil metabolic quotient (qCO₂) ranged from 3.6 to 17.7mg CO₂ g⁻¹ MBC h⁻¹. The distribution pattern of soil microbial biomass and activity was governed by aggregate size, whereas the tillage effect was not significant at the aggregate scale. Tillage regimes that contribute to greater aggregation, such as RNT, also improved soil microbial activity. Soil OC, MBC and respiration rate were at their highest levels for 1.0–2.0mm aggregates, suggesting a higher biological activity at this aggregate size for the present ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aconventional tillage 3acropping systems 3aecosystems 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3ano-tillage 3arespiratory rate 3arice soils 3asoil aggregates 3asoil respiration 3asoil structure1 aWright, A.L.1 aWang, J.1 aLi, Z.0 tCatena.g2011 Nov., v. 87, no. 2 p.276-280dElsevier B.V.x0341-81627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2011.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04274naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245009000175300001600265520247000281592002802751650002402779650003002803650001002833650001302843650002902856650002602885650002302911650001702934650001302951650002502964650001502989650002003004650001503024650001803039650001603057650001703073650002003090650001503110650001303125651000903138653002503147653001003172653001103182653000903193653001703202653002103219653000903240653001103249653001203260653001003272700002003282700006203302700002003364700002003384773012303404856008803527961001203615852000903627655001203636IND60538086220221121120748.0190319e20140924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053808622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2014.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMittanck, Cody M.10aExploring succession within aspen communities using a habitat-based modeling approach  ap. 203-212.  aQuaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) forest communities play a crucial ecological role across western North America. However, there is increasing evidence that these communities have diverging ecological roles across aspen's expansive range. Previous studies show evidence for both “seral” and “stable” aspen functional types. This leads us to believe that the pathway of these systems may not always lead to a climax conifer sere, but in many cases results in a stable community dominated by aspen. This study is an attempt to use a static model, based on large-scale environmental variables, to account for successional dynamics within aspen–conifer systems and predict distributions of aspen functional types across large landscapes. Environmental factors influencing aspen–conifer succession have been observed in past research but not fully explored. Our study methodologies and application of model results were specifically designed to aid land managers in identifying extent and function of aspen forest communities in order to plan restoration projects. Four study sites were chosen within Utah in order to capture the widest geographic variance. Photointerpretation of National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) color infrared imagery was used to classify dominant forest cover at approximately 250 plots within each site. At each plot, variables were calculated and derived from DAYMET data, digital elevation models, and soil surveys and assessed for precision and ability to model forest type distributions. A generalized linear model was used to assess habitat overlap between aspen and conifer in order to explore successional dynamics and predict areas where stable aspen communities are likely to occur. Model results indicate an interaction between topographic position and moisture influence the probability of conifer encroachment but do not preclude conifers entirely. The highest probability for stable aspen communities occurs between 60 and 90cm of total annual precipitation on topographic positions receiving greater than 4500Wh/m2/d of solar radiation. Prediction-conditioned fallout-rates were used to partition the continuous model output into a “hard” classification. These results were applied in an overlay analysis with Southwest Regional Gap landcover data, indicating 19% of aspen forests across Utah are potentially stable functional types, whereas the remaining 81% are vulnerable to conifer encroachment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus tremuloides 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acolor 3aconifers 3adigital elevation models 3aenvironmental factors 3aforest communities 3aforest types 3ahabitats 3aimage interpretation 3aland cover 3aland management 3alandscapes 3alinear models 3aprobability 3asoil surveys 3asolar radiation 3atopography 3avariance 3aUtah 0aConifer encroachment 0aSeral 0aStable 0aPure 0aGIS modeling 0aFunctional types 0aNAIP 0aDAYMET 0aSWReGAP 0aUFRWG1 aRogers, Paul C.1 aRamsey, R.

In this context, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can produce an excellent platform for toxicant removal from water environments. In the current investigation, eight MOFs (ZIF-67-NO3, ZIF-67-Cl, ZIF-67-SO4, ZIF-67-OAC, ZIF-8-Octahedron, ZIF-8-Leaf, ZIF-8-Cuboid, and ZIF-8-Cube) with different chemical and textural compositions were synthesized, and furthermore, the adsorption of Tetracycline (TC) by them was evaluated. Also, the key experimental conditions were modeled using response surface methodology (RSM). Among the prepared MOFs, the highest tendency for TC removal was nominated to ZIF-67- Acetate (ZIF-67-OAC). By model optimization approach, the optimum system conditions as contact time, adsorbent dosage, pH and adsorbed antibiotic concentration were reported as 26.8 min, 0.63 g/L, 5.9, and 74.6 mg/L, respectively. The proposed equilibrium model showed that the TC accumulated on ZIF-67-OAC surface is reversible in multilayer with the highest monolayer capacity of 446.9 mg/g. Furthermore, based on separation factor (KL), TC adsorption is more favorable at a higher amount of MOFs added. Moreover, according to the fitted kinetic model, the process was controlled by chemisorption. ZIF-67-OAC shows excellent structural stability during mechanical agitation in an aqueous environment, and the TC removal capacities of regenerated adsorbent did not change considerably at the end of cycle 4 compared to the first cycle. Considering the findings among the examined MOFs, the ZIF-67-OAC can be approached as a promising adsorbent for the removal of antibiotics from aqueous environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aagitation 3aantibiotics 3aaqueous solutions 3acoordination polymers 3akinetics 3amathematical models 3apH 3apollution 3aresponse surface methodology 0aMetal-organic framework 0aAdsorption 0aZeolitic imidazolate frameworks 0aTetracycline 0aAqueous solutions 0aMathematical modeling1 aZarei, Ahmad1 aJaafari, Jalil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0186-77791 aShams, Mahmoud1 aMousavi Khaneghah, Amin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5769-00040 tChemosphere.g2019 Feb., v. 217 p.250-260dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.10.1663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245011200156300001600268520151600284592002801800650002501828650001701853650001601870650001901886650002101905650002101926650001801947650002101965650002601986650001502012650000902027650001102036650001102047650001402058650001802072650002202090653001002112653002502122653002502147653001602172653001802188653002102206700002202227773012402249856007802373852000902451655001202460IND60130402820221119224206.0151127e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013040282DNAL7 a10.2983/035.031.03322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinto, U.10aImpacts of Water Quality on the Harvest of School Prawn (Metapenaeus macleayi) in a Peri-Urban River System  ap. 847-853.  aThe school prawn (Metapenaeus macleayi) is important among commercial prawn trawler operators, but its harvest is affected in a complex way by a number of interacting water quality, and other variables. In this study, using the Hawkesbury—Nepean River system as a case study, we use Pearson correlation and hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis (HACA) to assess the influence of the selected water quality (n = 7), quantity (n = 1), and weather (n = 2) parameters on the prawn harvest. Using data records (n = 104) collected over a 9-y period, we found water temperature (r = 0.63, P < 0.01), dissolved oxygen (r = -0.59, P < 0.01), and rainfall (r = 0.26, P < 0.01) to be significantly correlated variables with prawn harvest. The HACA produced 3 distinct clusters of variables nutrient availability for prawns (the total nitrogen, the total phosphorus, reactive silicate, turbidity, and suspended solids), the physical river environment (temperature, rainfall, and river flow), and the biochemical river environment (dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a). The study revealed that 2 key variables, viz., temperature and rainfall, representing the physical river environment are statistically significant in affecting prawn harvest in the study area. Therefore, from fishing industry point of view, the future river management need to focus on strategies that will improve the physical river environment, particularly to cope with the impacts of future peri-urban development and climate change scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMetapenaeus macleayi 3acase studies 3achlorophyll 3aclimate change 3acluster analysis 3adissolved oxygen 3afish industry 3anitrogen content 3anutrient availability 3aphosphorus 3arain 3arivers 3ashrimp 3aturbidity 3awater quality 3awater temperature 0aprawn 0aMetapenaeus macleayi 0acorrelation analysis 0atemperature 0achlorophyll a 0aHawkesbury River1 aMaheshwari, B.

However, explanations of this phenomenon have not been compelling because developing and developed countries with rich resources coexist. To provide insights into this curse, we calculated the total amount of three different categories of resources for 31 Chinese provinces, and analyzed the relationship between the abundance of these resources and the provincial economic level. The results showed large variations in per capita abundance of resources for a given level of per capita income, suggesting that abundance alone could not explain economic development. The total and net resource abundance per unit area were significantly positively related to per capita income, but the relationship was not significant for these variables based on the per capita abundance. However, we found that the per capita income was significantly correlated with nine economic and social factors: per capita foreign trade, domestic trade, investment, and finances; the transportation infrastructure; and the proportions of employment, college graduates, non-governmental employment, and urbanization. This suggests that the abundance of natural resources is not the primary factor responsible for differences in economic development among the regions and that there is no overall resource curse in China. Instead, implementing appropriate economic policy and maintaining social stability appear to be the primary drivers of social and economic development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarea 3adeveloped countries 3adomestic trade 3aeconomic policy 3aemployment 3afinance 3ainfrastructure 3ainternational trade 3anatural resources 3aper-capita income 3asocial factors 3asocioeconomic development 3atransportation 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aNatural resources 0aSocioeconomic development 0aPolitical system 0aEconomic policy 0aPoverty1 aMa, Zihao1 aGuo, Jiahong1 aCao, Shixiong0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 286 p.124975-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1249753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005200148245014500200300001600345500001900361520162100380592002802001596003602029650001402065650001102079650001402090650001602104650001802120650000702138650001402145650003002159650001402189650001602203650001302219650000902232651001002241651001502251700002002266700001802286700001402304700002002318700001302338700001802351700002002369700001702389700001702406773013502423856008202558852000902640655001202649IND60687052020221119202406.0200324e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068705202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-019-01355-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9167-848X10aLitorilituus lipolyticus sp. nov., isolated from intertidal sand of the Yellow Sea in China, and emended description of Colwellia asteriadis  ap. 449-458.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA Gram-stain negative, rod-shaped, aerobic, oxidase-positive and catalase-weakly positive bacterial strain with polar or subpolar flagellum, designated RZ04ᵀ, was isolated from an intertidal sand sample collected from a coastal area of the Yellow Sea, China. The organism was observed to grow optimally at 25 °C and pH 6.5–7.0 with 2% (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain RZ04ᵀ was closely related to Colwellia asteriadis (similarity 96.9%) and Litorilituus sediminis (similarity 96.8%), and 94.4–96.4% sequence similarities to other type strains of species of the genera belonged to the family Colwelliaceae. The dominant fatty acids of strain RZ04ᵀ were determined to be C₁₇:₁ω8c, C₁₅:₁ω8c, C₁₆:₀ and summed feature 3 (C₁₆:₁ω6c and/or C₁₆:₁ω7c), and the predominant isoprenoid quinone was determined to be quinone 8 (Q-8). Phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, an unidentified aminophospholipid and four unidentified lipids were determined to be the major constituents of the polar lipids. The genome of strain RZ04ᵀ is 4.14 Mbp with a G + C content of 37.4 mol%. A total of 3631 genes are predicted, with 3531 protein-coding genes, 75 RNA genes and 25 pseudogenes. Based on phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic analysis, strain RZ04ᵀ is considered to represent a novel species in the genus Litorilituus, for which the name Litorilituus lipolyticus is proposed. The type strain is RZ04ᵀ (= MCCC 1K03616ᵀ = KCTC 62835ᵀ). An emended description of Colwellia asteriadis is also provided.  aPublisher supplied data  a81801982cYoung Scientists Fund 3aColwellia 3acoasts 3aflagellum 3aisoprenoids 3alittoral zone 3apH 3aphenotype 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphylogeny 3apseudogenes 3aquinones 3asand 3aChina 3aYellow Sea1 aZhang, Yan-Jiao1 aXue, Qing-Jie1 aWang, Hui1 aYang, Yuan-Yuan1 aDu, Feng1 aZhao, Long-Yu1 aZhang, Hong-Hua1 aLi, Yun-Qing1 aLi, Xiu-Zhen0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2020 Apr., v. 113, no. 4 p.449-458dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl28287x0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-019-01355-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03377naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245010500173520203400278592002802312650001802340650002202358650001002380650001102390650001002401650002202411650001402433650002502447650002602472650001702498651001102515651002802526653001702554653002302571653002202594653003002616653002302646700002402669700002002693700002302713773010302736856008302839852000902922655001202931IND60696064820221119032337.0201025e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069606482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2020.1028422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Linden, Aart12aA review of European models to assess the sustainability performance of livestock production systems  aA large variety of models has been developed to explore the multidimensional, and sometimes conflicting, sustainability consequences of innovations and policies for European livestock farms. Implementation of innovations and policies generally results in both synergies and trade-offs between the environmental, economic, and social dimension of sustainability, and among sustainability themes within these dimensions. An overview of the specific sustainability themes addressed by livestock models is lacking, which hinders the further development of models to evaluate a wide array of sustainability dimensions and themes. The aim of this review, therefore, is to provide an overview of European livestock models that can be used to explore synergies and trade-offs among sustainability themes. This systematic literature review yielded 215 European livestock models at the animal level, herd or flock level and farm level. Models were mainly developed in Western Europe, and may have, therefore, a reduced accuracy when applied to other regions than Western Europe. Most models cannot assess a wide array of synergies and trade-offs among sustainability dimensions and themes, as only 33% covered all three sustainability dimensions. Models addressed four sustainability themes on average. Social themes are often lacking in models and additional efforts are needed to develop more integrative models by adapting and extending existing models, especially for monogastric animals. Adaptation and extension of existing models is facilitated by improving the availability of livestock models, increasing the percentage of livestock models published open source, collaborating on the development of joint and generic models and by improving descriptions of the programming languages and programs used and the stakeholders involved. This model review can be used to identify which models or combinations of models are best suited to explore the sustainability consequences of innovations and policies for livestock farms in Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3acomputer software 3afarms 3aflocks 3aherds 3aissues and policy 3alivestock 3alivestock production 3aproduction technology 3astakeholders 3aEurope 3aWestern European region 0aAvailability 0aBio-economic model 0aImpact assessment 0aSustainability indicators 0aLinear programming1 ade Olde, Evelien M.1 aMostert, Pim F.1 ade Boer, Imke J.M.0 tAgricultural systems.g2020 June, v. 182 p.102842-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2020.1028423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009800175300001400273520119400287592002801481650001801509650002801527650000901555650001401564650002001578650001201598650001301610650001101623650002801634650001301662650001201675650002101687650001201708650002501720650001101745650001101756650001101767653003801778653002401816653002201840653001301862653002601875700002401901700002901925700002401954700002001978773012301998856008502121852000902206655001202215IND60689898320221119235737.0200424e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068989832DNAL7 a10.1080/1040841X.2018.15436492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFilannino, Pasquale10aFructose-rich niches traced the evolution of lactic acid bacteria toward fructophilic species  ap. 65-81.  aFructophilic lactic acid bacteria (FLAB) are found in fructose-rich habitats associated with flowers, fruits, fermented foods, and the gastrointestinal tract of several insects having a fructose-based diet. FLAB are heterofermentative lactobacilli that prefer fructose instead of glucose as carbon source, although additional electron acceptor substrates (e.g. oxygen) remarkably enhance their growth on glucose. As a newly discovered bacterial group, FLAB are gaining increasing interest. In this review, the ecological context in which these bacteria exist and evolve was resumed. The wide frequency of isolation of FLAB from fructose feeding insects has been deepened to reveal their ecological significance. Genomic, metabolic data, reductive evolution, and niche specialization of the main FLAB species have been discussed. Findings to date acquired are consistent with a metabolic model in which FLAB display a reliance on environmental niches and the degree of host specificity. In light of FLAB proximity to lactic acid bacteria generally considered to be safe, and due to their peculiar metabolic traits, FLAB may be successfully exploited in food and pharmaceutical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3adiet 3aevolution 3afermented foods 3aflowers 3afructose 3afruits 3agastrointestinal system 3agenomics 3aglucose 3ahost specificity 3ainsects 3alactic acid bacteria 3amodels 3aniches 3aoxygen 0aFructophilic lactic acid bacteria 0areductive evolution 0aniches specialism 0ahoneybee 0afunctional attributes1 aDi Cagno, Raffaella1 aTlais, Ali Zein Alabiden1 aCantatore, Vincenzo1 aGobbetti, Marco0 tCritical reviews in microbiology.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 45, no. 1 p.65-81dTaylor & FranciswJournal:14619x1549-78287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1040841X.2018.15436493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100007100146245008400217300001800301520127400319536030701593592002801900596012201928650002202050650002802072650001102100650001602111650001302127650002202140650001502162650001402177653001802191653002502209653002002234653001902254653001302273700002202286700001902308700006602327773011402393856008102507852000902588655001202597IND60754912320221120032019.0211027e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075491232DNAL7 a10.1177/0958305X219898832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosman, Nur Syakirah Rabiha1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5075-328710aNanobiotechnology: Nature-inspired silver nanoparticles towards green synthesis  ap. 1183-1206.  aThe emergence of technology to produce nanoparticles (1 nm – 100 nm in size) has drawn significant researchers’ interests. Nanoparticles can boost the antimicrobial, catalytic, optical, and electrical conductivity properties, which cannot be achieved by their corresponding bulk. Among other noble metal nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have attained a special emphasis in the industry due to their superior physical, chemical, and biological properties, closely linked to their shapes, sizes, and morphologies. Proper knowledge of these NPs is essential to maximise the potential of biosynthesised AgNPs in various applications while mitigating risks to humans and the environment. This paper aims to critically review the global consumption of AgNPs and compare the AgNPs synthesis between conventional methods (physical and chemical) and current trend method (biological). Related work, advantages, and drawbacks are also highlighted. Pertinently, this review extensively discusses the current application of AgNPs in various fields. Lastly, the challenges and prospects of biosynthesised AgNPs, including application safety, oxidation, and stability, commercialisation, and sustainability of resources towards a green environment, were discussed.  aFunding The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors thank the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, and Universiti Malaysia Terengganu for the funding and generous support (FRGS/1/2016/WAB09/UMT/02/2).  aPublisher supplied data  aUMT/RMIC/FRGS/59451cResearch Management Institute, Universiti Malaysia Terengganu and Ministry of Education Malaysia 3acommercialization 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3aindustry 3ananobiotechnology 3ananosilver 3aoxidation 0ananoparticles 0asilver nanoparticles 0agreen synthesis 0asustainability 0atoxicity1 aHarun, Noor Aniza1 aIdris, Izwandy1 aWan Ismail, Wan Iryani1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8069-22780 tEnergy & environment.g2021 Nov., v. 32, no. 7 p.1183-1206dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26865x2048-40707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0958305X219898833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02244naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245010400204300001800308500001900326520099900345592002801344650002301372650002301395650001801418650002201436650001001458650001301468650001101481650000901492650002501501650001601526650001201542650000901554650001001563700001801573773016401591856008201755852000901837655001201846IND60710486520221119015005.0200910e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071048652DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-020-02858-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, A.

This study made statistical analysis for the influences of the environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, and air pollution, which may aid in spreading this virus very fast. The study also investigated statistically the impact of people customs such as smoking, drinking wine, and eating pig meat on the number of deaths among infected people. The study depicted reasons for spreading it in some places much more than others over the world. A statistical software SPSS was adopted to find a correlation among the different variables affecting the virus spread. The results exhibited a significant relationship between the suggested conditions and the virus spread. The study introduced two regression equations for expecting infected people and deaths based on the examined conditions for any region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aOrthocoronavirinae 3aair pollution 3acomputer software 3adeath 3ahumidity 3apeople 3apork 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3aviruses 3awind 3awines1 aGhanem, A.

Further research is needed to confirm that lung lesions detected by TUS can be associated with negative outcomes in cattle with BP that subsequently were treated. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the effects on relapse rate and average daily gain (ADG) of lung lesions detected by TUS at first BP diagnosis in feedlot cattle. ANIMALS: Prospective cohort of mixed beef‐breed steers (n = 93; 243 ± 36 kg) and heifers (n = 51; 227 ± 42 kg) with BP at 4 feedlots. METHODS: Thoracic ultrasonography was performed by the same clinician and 16‐second TUS videos were evaluated offline for maximal depth and area of lung consolidation, maximum number of comet tails, and maximal depth of pleural fluid. Individual ADG was calculated between 1 and 120 days after arrival. Effects of lesions on relapse rate and ADG were investigated using mixed regression models. RESULTS: Maximal depth of lung consolidation was associated with a higher risk of relapse (odds ratio [OR], 1.337/cm; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.042‐1.714) and lower ADG (− 34 g/cm; −64 to −4). Maximal area of lung consolidation also was associated with a higher relapse risk (OR, 1.052/cm²; 1.009‐1.097) but not with ADG. Comet tails and pleural fluid were not associated with risk of relapse or ADG. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Quantifying maximal depth and area of lung consolidation by TUS at first BP diagnosis can provide useful prognostic information in feedlot cattle.  aPublisher supplied data  a10004657cUniversity of Calgary, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaverage daily gain 3abronchopneumonia 3aconfidence interval 3adeath 3afeedlots 3agrowth performance 3aheifers 3alungs 3aodds ratio 3aregression analysis 3arelapse 3arisk 3asteers 3aultrasonography1 aTison, Nicolas1 aBooker, Calvin W.1 aBuczinski, Sébastien,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8460-48850 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2019 May, v. 33, no. 3 p.1540-1546dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.154833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006000149245007600209300001400285506007600299520105500375592002801430506003701458650001501495650003101510650002201541650001401563650001301577650001301590650001201603653000801615653001201623653001301635653001501648653002401663700002401687700002201711700006101733700006101794700002001855700005701875700005801932700002401990773008702014856008402101990002302185852000902208655001202217IND60731342820221207071247.0220606e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073134282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2021.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelshan, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5736-990710aDiscovery of candidate HIV-1 latency biomarkers using an OMICs approach  ap. 86-95.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInfection with HIV-1 remains uncurable due to reservoirs of latently infected cells. Any potential cure for HIV will require a mechanism to identify and target these cells in vivo. We created a panel of Jurkat cell lines latently infected with the HIV DuoFlo virus to identify candidate biomarkers of latency. SWATH mass spectrometry was used to compare the membrane proteomes of one of the cell lines to parental Jurkat cells. Several candidate proteins with significantly altered expression were identified. The differential expression of several candidates was validated in multiple latently infected cell lines. Three factors (LAG-3, CD147,CD231) were altered across numerous cell lines, but the expression of most candidate biomarkers was variable. These results confirm that phenotypic differences in latently infected cells exists and identify additional novel biomarkers. The variable expression of biomarkers across different cell clones suggests universal antigen-based detection of latently infected cells may require a multiplex approach.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomarkers 3agene expression regulation 3amass spectrometry 3aphenotype 3aproteome 3avirology 3aviruses 0aHIV 0aLatency 0aSWATH-MS 0aProteomics 0aBiomarker discovery1 aHolbrook, Alexander1 aGeorge, Joseph W.1 aDurant, Hannah E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3937-62941 aCallahan, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1625-51261 aJaquet, Spencer1 aWest, John T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4594-68551 aSiedlik, Jacob1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5341-23731 aCiborowski, Paweł,0 tVirology.g2021 June, v. 558 p.86-95dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2021.03.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01701naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245004600169300001600215520068200231592002800913650001400941650001000955650001400965650001300979650001900992650001301011650000901024650000901033650001501042650001601057650001801073650001601091700001701107700001801124773010701142856005701249852000901306655001201315IND4468795720221122151611.0120727e200101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446879572DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2001.tb15596.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShih, F.F.10aDevelopment of Low OilâUptake Donuts  ap. 141-144.  aReduced oil donuts are one goal of the do nut industry.

Replacement of wheat flour with longâgrain or waxy rice flour resulted in lower DC and MC, and higher FN and OU. Replacement with gelatinized rice flour or acetylated rice starch resulted in generally higher DC, MC and FN and lower OU.

While there is a general consensus that in order to minimize the level of photodamage the excitation power has to be kept as low as possible, it has yet to be determined if shorter pulses have greater benefit than longer pulses. Here we evaluate the rate of death in Drosophila melanogaster as the integral parameter related to photodamage resulting from femtosecond near infrared (NIR) laser irradiation under conditions comparable to those used in two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) microscopy. We found that the lethality (resulting from photodamage) as a function of laser energy fluence fits a 3-region dose–response curve. The lethality was accompanied with development of necrosis and apoptosis in irradiated tissues. Quantitative analysis showed that the damage has a mostly linear character on energy fluence per pulse, and for a given TPEF signal, shorter (37fs) pulse duration results in lower lethality than longer (100fs) pulse duration. These results have important implications for the use of femtosecond NIR laser pulses in microscopy as well as in vivo medical imaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aapoptosis 3acell culture 3adose response 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3airradiation 3amicroscopy 3amortality 3anecrosis 3aphotobiology 3aphotochemistry 3aquantitative analysis1 aArkhipov, Sergey N.1 aWinkler, Nelson1 aZuraski, Kristen1 aLozovoy, Vadim V.1 aDantus, Marcos0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2012 Oct. 3, v. 115 p.42-50dElsevier B.V.x1011-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2012.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011300167300001800280500001900298520156300317592002801880650001101908650001201919650001101931650001401942650001101956650002001967650002501987650001502012773016402027856008202191852000902273655001202282IND60710486620221119014556.0200910e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071048662DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-020-02741-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChabokpour, J.10aStudy of pollution transport through the rivers using aggregated dead zone and hybrid cells in series models  ap. 4313-4330.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis paper aims at studying the data-based mechanistic pollution transport models of the aggregated dead zone (ADZ) and hybrid cells in series (HCIS) models. For a better understanding of them, it was tried to connect their parameters to the physical parameters of the classical advection–dispersion (ADE) model. A series of experiments were conducted using the laboratory model of the gravel bed river, and the sodium chloride solution was chosen as a conservative tracer. A new analytical solution of HCIS model, including triple dispersion cells, was developed. Also, the theoretical temporal moment equations were derived and attempted to develop explicit relationships for both ADZ and HCIS parameters based on hydraulically and geometrically variables. Detailed descriptions of the Pe number and the skewness coefficients (CSK) were presented, and the theoretical limit of CSK was extracted. It was concluded that the range of (0.93–1.24) for CSK is acceptable, which confirms the finding of previous investigators. A sensitivity analysis was operated to find the importance of different variables in estimating model parameters. Finally, the theoretical breakthrough curves of ADZ and HCIS models were drawn and confirmed with experimental BTCs. Statistical goodness of fit parameters of RMSE, DC, and MAE was calculated as triple sets of (0.0158, 0.99, 21.58 ppm), (0.0188, 0.97, 27.16 ppm), and (0.105, 0.83, 78.84 ppm) for ADZ, HCIS, and ADE models, respectively, which showed the superiority of data-based models to the classical ADE model.  aPublisher supplied data 3agravel 3ahybrids 3amodels 3apollution 3arivers 3asodium chloride 3astatistical analysis 3atechnology0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2020 Oct., v. 17, no. 10 p.4313-4330dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2208x1735-14727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-020-02741-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245012400176300001600300520135400316592002801670650002301698650001201721650001301733650001401746650001301760650002101773650001101794650001101805650002801816650001501844650001501859650000901874650000901883650001401892650001901906650002601925650001101951650000701962650001501969650001401984650003301998650000902031650002002040650002302060650001402083650002702097650001602124650000902140651001302149653001002162653001002172653002602182653002002208653001402228653001302242700002102255700005802276773009102334856009002425852000902515655001202524IND60621647320221117162728.0181214e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062164732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.10.1732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaleem, Muhammad10aSeasonal variations, risk assessment and multivariate analysis of trace metals in the freshwater reservoirs of Pakistan  ap. 715-724.  aWater samples were collected from three freshwater reservoirs of Pakistan during three seasons (pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon). The collected samples were examined for the concentrations of selected trace metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr and Zn) and physicochemical parameters (pH, T, EC, TDS, DO, Cl−). Among the metals, Co, Pb and Sr revealed relatively higher concentrations while Cd, Mn and Zn exhibited fairly lower contents. Most of the metals (except Co) revealed considerably higher contributions in the pre-monsoon period. The average levels of Cr, Co, Cd, Pb and Ni exceeded the national/international guideline limits. Pollution assessment highlighted significant pollution; mainly by Cd, Cr, Ni and Pb. Evaluation of health risk indicated that Cr, Cd, Co, Pb and Ni were associated with high risks (HQing > 1), especially for the children. Principal component analysis showed anthropogenic contributions of Cd, Cr, Co, Pb and Ni, while significant spatial variability was shown by cluster analysis. The highest metal pollution was found at sites near to the entrances of the reservoirs and/or near to the urbanized areas. This study revealed that priority pollutants of concern were Cr, Cd, Co, Pb and Ni; therefore, immediate remedial measures should be implemented for sustaining the healthy aquatic ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acadmium 3achildren 3achlorides 3achromium 3acluster analysis 3acobalt 3acopper 3aelectrical conductivity 3afreshwater 3aguidelines 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amonsoon season 3amultivariate analysis 3anickel 3apH 3apollutants 3apollution 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aseasonal variation 3astrontium 3atotal dissolved solids 3aurban areas 3azinc 3aPakistan 0aMetal 0aWater 0aMultivariate analysis 0aRisk assessment 0aPollution 0aPakistan1 aIqbāl, Jāvīd,1 aShah, Munir H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4445-42930 tChemosphere.g2019 Feb., v. 216 p.715-724dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.10.1733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02178naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245005300174300001600227520089500243592002801138650001401166650002601180650003201206650001301238650002001251650001601271650001501287650002001302650001301322650001901335650001801354653001201372653001501384653001401399700003001413700002601443700002601469700003001495773012501525856008501650852000901735655001201744IND60689898520221119235603.0200424e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068989852DNAL7 a10.1080/1040841X.2018.15490192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamoureux, Claudie10aAnaerobes in cystic fibrosis patients’ airways  ap. 103-117.  aAnaerobes are known to constitute an important part of the airway microbiota in both healthy subjects and cystic fibrosis (CF) patients.

However, disassembly of the VLPs on the solid–liquid interface during chromatography process could be a serious problem. In this study, isothermal titration calorimetric (ITC) measurements, together with chromatography experiments, were performed on the adsorption and disassembling of multi-subunits hepatitis B virus surface antigen virus-like particles (HB-VLPs). Two gigaporous ion-exchange chromatography (IEC) media, DEAE-AP-280nm and DEAE-POROS, were used. The application of gigaporous media with high ligand density led to significantly increased irreversible disassembling of HB-VLPs and consequently low antigen activity recovery during IEC process. To elucidate the thermodynamic mechanism of the effect of ligand density on the adsorption and conformational change of VLPs, a thermodynamic model was proposed. With this model, one can obtain the intrinsic molar enthalpy changes related to the binding of VLPs and the accompanying conformational change on the liquid–solid interface during its adsorption. This model assumes that, when intact HB-VLPs interact with the IEC media, the total adsorbed proteins contain two states, the intact formation and the disassembled formation; accordingly, the apparent adsorption enthalpy, ΔappH, which can be directly measured from ITC experiments, presents the sum of three terms: (1) the intrinsic molar enthalpy change associated to the binding of intact HB-VLPs (ΔbindHintact), (2) the intrinsic molar enthalpy change associated to the binding of HB-VLPs disassembled formation (ΔbindHdis), and (3) the enthalpy change accompanying the disassembling of HB-VLPs (ΔconfHdis). The intrinsic binding of intact HB-VLPs and the disassembled HB-VLPs to both kinds of gigaporous media (each of which has three different ligand densities), were all observed to be entropically driven as indicated by positive values of ΔbindHintact and ΔbindHdis; while the nagative ΔconfHdis values suggested a spontenous enthalpy-driven process for the forming of HB-VLPs disassembled formation at all conditions studied. As ligand density increases, ΔconfHdis became more negative, which was in agreement with the findings from chromatography experiments, that higher ligand density leads to more serious disassembling of HB-VLPs. Results from thermodynamic studies provided us insight understanding on the mechanism of adsorption and conformational change of VLPs, as well as the effect of ligand densities on the structural stability of VLPs during IEC process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanion exchange chromatography 3acalorimetry 3aenthalpy 3ahepatitis B antigens 3aligands 3aliquid-solid interface 3aproteins 3athermodynamic models 3atitration 3avaccines 3avirus-like particles 0aIsothermal titration calorimetry 0aHepatitis B virus surface antigen 0aVirus-like particles 0aGigaporous media 0aIon exchange chromatography 0aConformational change1 aZhang, Songping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5793-52861 aZhang, Yan1 aYang, Yanli1 aMa, Guanghui1 aSu, Zhiguo0 tJournal of chromatography.g2015, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2015.02.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245011000178300001600288520173700304592002802041650002402069650001002093650002302103650002502126650001002151650002002161650000902181650002702190650001202217650002602229650001002255650001502265650001702280650002402297650001702321650001602338651001302354653001802367653000902385653002002394653002702414653002002441700002502461700002102486700002402507773010902531856008202640852000902722655001202731IND60621862520221120151632.0181121e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062186252DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826507028002052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKongkachuichai, Ratchanee10aEffects of Various Iron Fortificants on Sensory Acceptability and Shelf-Life Stability of Instant Noodles  ap. 165-172.  aIron-deficiency anemia is the most common nutritional problem in Thailand and many developing countries. One of the most sustainable and cost-effective strategies for combating iron deficiency is fortification of staple foods with iron. In this study, the feasibility of fortifying instant noodles with different forms of iron fortificants (ferrous sulfate [FS], ferric sodium ethylenediamine- tetraacetic acid [NaFeEDTA], and encapsulated H- reduced elemental iron [EEI] was evaluated, and the fortified noodles were compared with unfortified noodles for changes in physical, chemical, and sensory qualities. Wheat flour used to make instant noodles was fortified to produce a concentration of 5 mg of iron per 50-g serving of instant noodles (one-third of the Thai recommended dietary intake). Analytical data showed that the iron contents were close to 5 mg per serving of noodles fortified with FS, NaFeEDTA, or EEI (5.27 ± 0.10, 4.27 ± 0.07, and 5.26 ± 0.47 mg, respectively). The color quality (measured by L*, lightness, and b*, yellowness) of the raw dough sheet and of uncooked and cooked instant noodles fortified with FS was lower than that of the unfortified, but color quality was not changed by the addition of NaFeEDTA. The overall sensory acceptability scores of unfortified and fortified noodles were about 6 (“like slightly”). No metallic odor was observed. During 3 months of storage at room temperature, the iron fortificants did not affect the peroxide level, color, or sensory qualities of the product. Iron fortification of wheat flour used to make instant noodles is feasible. NaFeEDTA is the preferred fortificant because of its nonsignificant effect on the color and sensory quality of the products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acolor 3acost effectiveness 3adeveloping countries 3adough 3aferrous sulfate 3airon 3airon deficiency anemia 3anoodles 3anutrient deficiencies 3aodors 3ashelf life 3astaple foods 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3awheat flour 3aThailand 0aFortification 0airon 0airon deficiency 0airon-deficiency anemia 0ainstant noodles1 aKounhawej, Arunwadee1 aChavasit, Visith1 aRin Čharœ̄nsiri,0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 28, no. 2 p.165-172dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1564826507028002053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245014100167520134000308592002801648650003201676650001501708650002601723650001501749650001301764650002301777650001201800650001901812650001101831650001001842650001501852650002501867650002701892650002401919650001601943650001401959650002501973650001801998650001802016650002202034650001702056650001202073650001702085651001002102653001802112653003002130653001902160700002102179773012302200856008302323852000902406655001202415IND60705690320221119063715.0201024e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070569032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2020.1017232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrem Anand, K.10aBiofilm formation and pathogenicity of marine-derived Acinetobacter sp.

The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed 99% similarity with Acinetobacter calcoaceticus JO1 and the Antibiotic Susceptibility Test (AST) showed; resistant to ampicillin, bacitracin, and trimethoprim; intermediate resistant to methicillin, and sensitive to streptomycin.

The biofilm formation on Paratelphusa hydrodromous (freshwater crab) showed strong adhesion of bacteria to the crab shell and produced lesions, eventually causing mortality to crabs - indicating shell disease. On contrary to the pathogenicity, the Acinetobacter sp. VITRSA1 was able to degrade toluene and use it as a sole carbon source, which can be useful in recycling industries. This study demonstrates the biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance property of newly isolated Acinetobacter sp., from the mangrove ecosystem and its ability to cause mortality among crabs along with its bioremediation potentials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter calcoaceticus 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacitracin 3abacteria 3abacterial adhesion 3abiofilm 3abioremediation 3acarbon 3acrabs 3afreshwater 3aliquid-air interface 3aliquid-solid interface 3amangrove ecosystems 3amethicillin 3amortality 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogenicity 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3astreptomycin 3atoluene 3atrimethoprim 3aIndia 0aAcinetobacter 0aParatelphusa hydrodromous 0aBiodegradation1 aSuthindhiran, K.0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2020 Sept., v. 28 p.101723-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2020.1017233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245010700162300001600269520148500285592002801770650001501798650001401813650002301827650001801850650001401868650002401882650001301906700001701919700002901936700001601965700002501981773012702006856004502133852000902178655001202187IND50065292920221122125327.0130419e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006529292DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2012000822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNohra, Bassam10aSynthesis of five and six‐membered cyclic glycerilic carbonates bearing exocyclic urethane functions  ap. 111-122.  aFive (5CGC) and six (6CGC) membered cyclic glycerilic carbonates having exocyclic urethane functions, as potential monomers for polyurethanes and polycarbonates, were prepared by two different routes: “two‐steps” and the “one‐pot” synthesis. For the “two‐steps” route, based on the consecutive aminolysis and transesterification reactions, a catalyst screening has been performed. Phosphazene showed the best catalytic activity and provided 5CGC and 6CGC in appreciable amounts whereas the other catalysts favored 5CGC formation. An increase in molar ratio of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) increased the yield and the conversion. In the “one‐pot” synthesis, where aminolysis and transesterification were simultaneous, a competition between products formation was demonstrated. In addition to the formation of mono‐hydroxyurethanes and glycerilic cyclic carbonates (5CGC and 6CGC), the fast aminolysis of 6CGC and the slower aminolysis of 5CGC was responsible for a partial di‐hydroxyurethanes production. The controlled and combined effects of catalyst and DMC excess acting as solvent and reagent allowed to selectively controlling the aminolysis and the transesterification reactions. The same reaction conditions were used for the synthesis of bicyclic carbonates. These new molecules enriched with urethane functions, provided novel and more environmentally friendly synthons for the synthesis of polyurethanes without the use of phosgene or isocyanate.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbonates 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3apolyurethanes 3ascreening 3atransesterification 3aurethane1 aCandy, Laure1 aBlanco, Jean‐François1 aRaoul, Yann1 aMouloungui, Zephirin0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2013 Jan., v. 115, no. 1 p.111-122dWILEY‐VCH Verlagx1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.201200082  aDNAL 7aarticle01959naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100002300168245013600191300001600327500000900343500001500352520096900367592002801336650001101364650003701375653001101412700001801423773012101441852000901562856009801571655001201669991568303100742620221119183208.0191122e197007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7090776732DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1970.0011183X001000040001x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheridan, Kevin P.10aColorimetric Measurements of Purple Flower Color in Alfalfa as Affected by Variety, Soil pH, Soil Fertility, Light, and Seed Source  ap. 323-326.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aMeasurements of the color of purple flowers from 10 varieties of alfalfa were made on two types of instruments.

Alfalfa plants of the same variety grown under several field, greenhouse, and growth chamber conditions varied significantly in intensity of purple flower color. Flowers from field grown plants were lighter in color than plants produced in the greenhouse and growth chamber. Differences in flower color associated with soil pH, soil fertility, and seed lot were minor. When produced and measured under standardized conditions, purple flowers from different inflorescences on the same plant did not vary significantly nor did flowers produced on the same plant at different time periods. Either reflectance readings or colorimetric measurements were useful in characterizing varieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotany 3aPlant Science and Plant Products 0aplants1 aMcKee, Guy W.0 tCrop science.g1970 July, v. 10, no. 4 p.323-326dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1970.0011183X001000040001x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02252naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245013000167300001600297500001900313520095400332592002801286650003101314650002301345650001901368650001801387650002001405650003701425650001901462650001301481653000901494653001001503653000801513653000901521653001501530653000801545653000901553700001901562700002101581773008901602856008301691990002301774852000901797655001201806IND60697508620221121194422.0200605e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069750862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2016.08.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugden, Scott10aHIV-1 tat protein recruits CIS to the cytoplasmic tail of CD127 to induce receptor ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation  ap. 192-200.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHIV-1 Tat protein down regulates expression of the IL-7 receptor alpha-chain (CD127) from the surface of CD8 T cells resulting in impaired T cell proliferation and cytolytic capacity. We have previously shown that soluble Tat protein is taken up by CD8 T cells and interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of CD127 to induce receptor degradation. The N-terminal domain of Tat interacts with CD127 while the basic domain directs CD127 to the proteasome. We have also shown that upon IL-7 binding to its receptor, CD127 is phosphorylated resulting in CIS-mediated proteasomal degradation. Here, we show that Tat mimics this process by recruiting CIS to CD127 in the absence of IL-7 and receptor phosphorylation, leading to CD127 ubiquitination and degradation. Tat therefore acts as an adapter to induce cellular responses under conditions where they may not otherwise occur. Thusly, Tat reduces IL-7 signaling and impairs CD8 T cell survival and function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3ainterleukin-7 3aphosphorylation 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aubiquitination 3avirology 0aAIDS 0aHIV-1 0aTat 0aIL-7 0aCD8 T cell 0aCIS 0aSOCS1 aGhazawi, Feras1 aMacPherson, Paul0 tVirology.g2016 Nov., v. 498 p.192-200dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2016.08.0243Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03389naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002600142245009500168300001600263520186400279592002802143650001502171650002002186650001702206650001402223650002302237650001602260650001102276650002302287650002102310650002002331650003002351650002202381650001102403650002002414650001102434650001502445650002402460653002202484653002102506653003202527653002602559653002002585700001502605700001602620700001602636773013302652856007702785852000902862655001202871IND60480957820221119114827.0200226e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048095782DNAL7 a10.3920/WMJ2012.15212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Arias, C.A.10aMycotoxin bioaccessibility/absorption assessment using in vitro digestion models: a review  ap. 167-184.  aIn the evaluation of the oral bioavailability of a mycotoxin, the first step is the determination of its bioaccessibility, i.e. the percentage of mycotoxin released from the food matrix during digestion in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that could be absorbed through the intestinal epithelium. Different in vitro digestion models have been recently used for determination of bioaccessibility, thereby avoiding the use of more complex cell culture techniques or the use of animals in expensive in vivo experiments. In vitro methods offer an appealing alternative to human and animal studies. They usually are rapid, simple and reasonably low in cost, and can be used to perform simplified experiments under uniform and well-controlled conditions, providing insights not achievable in whole animal studies. The available in vitro methods for GI simulation differ in the design of the system, the composition of the physiological juices assayed, as well as in the use or not of intestinal microbiota. There are models that only simulate the upper part of the GI tract (mouth-stomach-small intestine), whereas other methods include the large intestine, so that the model chosen could have some influence on the bioaccessibility data obtained. Bioaccessibility depends on the food matrix, as well as on the contamination level and the way the food/feed is contaminated (spiked or naturally). This review focuses on the currently available data regarding in vitro digestion models for the study of the bioaccessibility or absorption of mycotoxins, detailing the characteristics of each digestion step and the importance of the physiological juices employed during digestion. The effect that different factors play on mycotoxin release from the food matrix in the GI tract is also considered, and existing data on bioaccessibility of the main mycotoxins are given.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abioavailability 3acell culture 3adigestion 3afeed contamination 3afood matrix 3ahumans 3ain vitro digestion 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestinal mucosa 3ajuices 3alarge intestine 3amodels 3amycotoxins 3asystems engineering 0amasked mycotoxins 0abioaccessibility 0agastrointestinal simulation 0aintestinal absorption 0ain vitro models1 aMarín, S.1 aSanchis, V.1 aRamos, A.J.0 tWorld mycotoxin journal.g2013 May 1, v. 6, no. 2 p.167-184dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl4395724x1875-07967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/WMJ2012.15213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002200156245010300178300001400281520156000295592002801855650002401883650001801907650001401925650001101939650002501950650001101975650001601986650001102002650001402013650002402027650001702051650001202068650001802080650000902098650002302107653001802130653001202148653001502160653002402175653002602199700002502225700002102250700001802271700002202289700002202311700001702333700001502350700002002365773009102385856009102476852000902567655001202576IND60637934120221122122012.0200804e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063793412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChouhan, Gurpreet12aA self-healing hydrogel eye drop for the sustained delivery of decorin to prevent corneal scarring  ap. 41-50.  aScarring/Opacity on the surface of the eye and vascularisation following infectious diseases, inflammation and corneal trauma are often a leading cause of blindness. The ‘gold standard’ treatment to prevent corneal scarring is the application of amniotic membrane (AM) to the ocular surface in the acute stage of injury. Although clinically effective, the use of the AM is associated with biological variability and unpredictable responses. Potential health risks including disease transmission, significant ethical issues surrounding the tissue donation process and stringent regulations/storage conditions, preclude widespread use. Consequently, there is a demand for the development of a new, synthetic alternative, that is stable at room temperature, capable of protecting the wound and has the capacity to deliver anti-scarring and anti-inflammatory mediators. Here we have developed a micro-structured fluid gel eye drop, to deliver a potent anti-scarring molecule, decorin. We have compared the release of decorin from the formulated dressing to a typical gel film, demonstrating enhanced release for the fluid gel eye-drops. Therefore, we have investigated the effect of the fluid gel system in 2D human corneal fibroblast culture models, as well as shown the retention of the gellan fluid gel in an in vivo rat model. At the same time the efficacy of the fluid gel eye drop was studied in an organ culture model, whereby the fluid gel containing decorin, significantly (P < 0.05) increased re-epithelialisation within 4 days of treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanimal models 3ablindness 3acornea 3adisease transmission 3aethics 3afibroblasts 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3ainfectious diseases 3ainflammation 3aopacity 3aorgan culture 3arisk 3astorage conditions 0aAnti-scarring 0aDecorin 0aFluid gels 0aControlled delivery 0aRegenerative medicine1 aMoakes, Richard J.A.1 aEsmaeili, Maryam1 aHill, Lisa J.1 adeCogan, Felicity1 aHardwicke, Joseph1 aRauz, Saaeha1 aLogan, Ann1 aGrover, Liam M.0 tBiomaterials.g2019 July, v. 210 p.41-50dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02422naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006000149245010600209300001400315520109000329592002801419650001801447650001601465650001501481650002001496650001401516650002201530650002301552650002801575653001801603653001501621653003201636653003201668700002601700700005101726700001701777773013701794856008401931852000902015655001202024IND60583250120221122034319.0190411e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058325012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2017.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilding, Matthew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3921-777113aAn improved and general streamlined phylogenetic protocol applied to the fatty acid desaturase family  ap. 50-57.  aNumerous tools to generate phylogenetic estimates are available, but there is no single protocol that will produce an accurate phylogenetic tree for any dataset. Here, we investigated some of those tools, paying particular attention to different alignment algorithms, in order to produce a phylogeny for the integral membrane fatty acid desaturase (FAD) family. Herein, we report a novel streamlined protocol which utilises peptide pattern recognition (PPR). This protocol can theoretically be applied universally to generate accurate multiple sequence alignments and improve downstream phylogenetic analyses. Applied to the desaturases, the protocol generated the first detailed phylogenetic estimates for the family since 2003, which suggested they may have evolved from three functionally distinct desaturases and further, that desaturases evolved first in cyanobacteria. In addition to the phylogenetic outputs, we mapped PPR sequence motifs onto an X-ray protein structure to provide insights into biochemical function and demonstrate the complementarity of PPR and phylogenetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aX-radiation 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3aphylogeny 3aprotein structure 3asequence alignment 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 0aPhylogenetics 0aDesaturase 0aPeptide pattern recognition 0aMultiple sequence alignment1 aNachtschatt, Matthias1 aRob DJ,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4161-82721 aScott, Colin0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2017 Oct., v. 115 p.50-57dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2017.07.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03536naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002600189245008800215300001400303506007600317520209000393592002802483506003702511650002102548650001802569650001402587650002002601650001802621650000902639650001402648650001302662650001602675650002302691650001602714650001802730700001702748700001802765700002202783700002202805700002202827773012602849856008202975852000903057655001203066IND60089467220221207093530.0141102e20111014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008946722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.09.0172doi7 aPMC31958722pmcid7 a219396382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Christopher G.10aIncreased susceptibility to Candida infection following cecal ligation and puncture  ap. 37-43.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSecondary infection following septic insult represents a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Sepsis induced immunosuppression is a major factor in the host’s susceptibility to nosocomial infections and Candida albicans accounts for a growing number of these. Given the importance of improving our understanding of the immune response to sepsis and the increasing rates of C. albicans infections, we sought to develop a murine model of double injury consisting of primary peritonitis, i.e., cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), followed by a secondary challenge of C. albicans. As observed in previous work, after primary injury the immune profile of the host changes over time. Therefore, while keeping the mortality rates from the respective individual injuries low, we altered the timing of the secondary injury between two post-CLP time points, day two and day four. Mice subjected to C. albicans infection following CLP have significantly different survival rates dependent upon timing of secondary injury. Animals challenged with C. albicans at two days post CLP had 91% mortality whereas animals challenged at four days had 47% mortality. This improvement in survival at four days was associated with restoration of innate cell populations and as evidenced by stimulated splenocytes, increases in certain inflammatory cytokines. In addition, we show that susceptibility to C. albicans infection following CLP is dependent upon the depth of immunosuppression. Although at four days post-CLP there is a partial reconstitution of the immune system, these animals remain more susceptible to infection compared to their single injury (C. albicans alone) counterparts. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that immunosuppression following initial septic insult changes over time. This novel, two hit model of CLP followed by Candida provides additional insight into the immune compromised state created by primary peritonitis, and thereby opens up another avenue of investigation into the causes and possible cures of an emerging clinical problem.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCandida albicans 3aanimal models 3acytokines 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3amice 3amorbidity 3apatients 3aperitonitis 3asepsis (infection) 3asplenocytes 3asurvival rate1 aChang, Kathy1 aOsborne, Dale1 aWalton, Andrew H.1 aDunne, W.

We found that the alloys/metals, the chemical properties of the surrogate fluid, and residence time all had major impacts on metal solubility. The large variability of bioaccessibility indicates the relevancy of assessing alloys as toxicologically distinct relative to individual metals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalloys 3abioavailability 3abreathing 3ain vitro studies 3apowders 3asolubility 0aStainless steel 0aIn vitro 0aResidence time 0aAlloy dissolution 0aBioavailable 0aBiological monitoring 0aDust exposure 0aOccupational hazard 0aBio-elution1 aAnderson, Kim A.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2014 Feb., v. 185 p.52-58dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2013.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002200190245009900212300001400311506007600325520103800401592002801439506003701467650002001504650001101524650001401535653002801549653001301577653002101590653002001611653002001631653001601651700002101667773012201688856008401810852000901894655001201903IND60583250220221207072848.0190411e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058325022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2017.07.0172doi7 aPMC56801652pmcid7 a287800222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlanzi, Ayed R.A.10aInferring rooted species trees from unrooted gene trees using approximate Bayesian computation  ap. 13-24.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMethods for inferring species trees from gene trees motivated by incomplete lineage sorting typically use either rooted gene trees to infer a rooted species tree, or use unrooted gene trees to infer an unrooted species tree, which is then typically rooted using one or more outgroups. Theoretically, however, it has been known since 2011 that it is possible to consistently infer the root of the species tree directly from unrooted gene trees without assuming an outgroup. Here, we use approximate Bayesian computation to infer the root of the species tree from unrooted gene trees assuming the multispecies coalescent model. It is hoped that this approach will be useful in cases where an appropriate outgroup is difficult to find and gene trees do not follow a molecular clock. We use approximate Bayesian computation to infer the root of the species tree from unrooted gene trees. This approach could also be useful when there is prior information that makes a small number of root locations plausible in an unrooted species tree.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBayesian theory 3amodels 3aphylogeny 0aMultispecies coalescent 0aOutgroup 0aMidpoint rooting 0aMolecular clock 0aIdentifiability 0aSufficiency1 aDegnan, James H.0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2017 Nov., v. 116 p.13-24dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2017.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03743naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245025900213300001600472500001900488520182200507592002802329596011502357596011502472650001702587650000802604650001802612650001802630650001502648650001602663650001202679650001502691650001502706650001402721650001302735650002502748650000702773650001402780650001402794650002302808650001202831650001602843700002302859700002702882700002602909700002402935700002802959773013502987856008203122852000903204655001203213IND60687052620221117160945.0200324e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068705262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-019-01357-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPankratov, Timofey A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6636-644910aLichenibacterium ramalinae gen. nov, sp. nov., Lichenibacterium minor sp. nov., the first endophytic, beta-carotene producing bacterial representatives from lichen thalli and the proposal of the new family Lichenibacteriaceae within the order Rhizobiales  ap. 477-489.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study of lichens in the subarctic zone of the northern hemisphere has resulted in the detection of new representatives of the order Rhizobiales. The16S rRNA gene sequence phylogeny placed the strains as a separate branch inside the Rhizobiales clade. Strain RmlP001ᵀ exhibits 91.85% similarity to Roseiarcus fermentans strain Pf56ᵀ and 91.76% to Beijerinckia doebereinerae strain LMG 2819ᵀ, whilst strain RmlP026ᵀ is closely related to B. doebereinerae strain LMG 2819ᵀ (91.85%) and Microvirga pakistanensis strain NCCP-1258ᵀ (91.39%). A whole-genome phylogeny of the strains confirmed their taxonomic positions. The cells of both strains were observed to be Gram-negative, motile rods that multiplied by binary fission. The cells were found to contain poly-β-hydroxybutyrate and polyphosphate, to grow at pH 3.5–8.0 and 10–30 °C, and could not fix atmospheric nitrogen. Their major cellular fatty acid identified was C₁₈:₁ω7c (68–71%) and their DNA G + C contents determined to be 70.5–70.8%. Beta-carotene was identified as their major carotenoid pigment; Q-10 was the only ubiquinone detected. Strains RmlP001ᵀ and RmlP026ᵀ are distinguishable from related species by the presence of β-carotene, the absence of C1 metabolism and the ability to grow in the presence of 3.5% NaCl. Based on their phylogenetic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic features, we propose a novel genus Lichenibacterium and two novel species, Lichenibacterium ramalinae (the type species of the genus) and Lichenibacterium minor, to accommodate these bacteria within the family Lichenibacteriaceae fam. nov. of the order Rhizobiales. The L. ramalinae type strain is RmlP001ᵀ (= KCTC 72076ᵀ = VKM B-3263ᵀ) and the L. minor type strain is RmlP026ᵀ (= KCTC 72077ᵀ = VKM B-3277ᵀ).  aPublisher supplied data  a16-04-00966acРоссийский Фонд Фундаментальных Исследований (РФФИ)  a19-04-00297acРоссийский Фонд Фундаментальных Исследований (РФФИ) 3aBeijerinckia 3aDNA 3abeta-carotene 3achemotaxonomy 3aendophytes 3afatty acids 3alichens 3ametabolism 3anew family 3anew genus 3anitrogen 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3asubarctic climates 3athallus 3aubiquinones1 aGrouzdev, Denis S.1 aPatutina, Ekaterina O.1 aKolganova, Tatiana V.1 aSuzina, Nataliya E.1 aBerestovskaya, Julia J.0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2020 Apr., v. 113, no. 4 p.477-489dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl28287x0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-019-01357-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245014200156300001800298520167200316592002801988650003102016650003302047650001502080650001102095650001902106650002102125650001802146650001102164650002202175650001502197650002602212650002102238700001602259700002302275700002202298700001502320773011002335856007502445852000902520655001202529IND60529569420221119104932.0160717e20130205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052956942DNAL7 a10.1021/ac30313062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Meiyao10aQuantifying the Cluster of Differentiation 4 Receptor Density on Human T Lymphocytes Using Multiple Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectrometry  ap. 1773-1777.  aCluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) is an important glycoprotein containing four extracellular domains, a transmembrane portion and a short intracellular tail. It locates on the surface of various types of immune cells and performs a critical role in multiple cellular functions such as signal amplification and activation of T cells. It is well-known as a clinical cell surface protein marker for study of HIV progression and for defining the T helper cell population in immunological applications. Moreover, CD4 protein has been used as a biological calibrator for quantification of other surface and intracellular proteins. However, flow cytometry, the conventional method of quantification of the CD4 density on the T cell surface depends on antibodies and has suffered from variables such as antibody clones, the fluorophore and conjugation chemistries, the fixation conditions, and the flow cytometric quantification methods used. In this study, we report the development of a highly reproducible nano liquid chromatography–multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry-based quantitative method to quantify the CD4 receptor density in units of copy number per cell on human CD4+ T cells. The method utilizes stable isotope-labeled full-length standard CD4 as an internal standard to measure endogenous CD4 directly, without the use of antibodies. The development of the mass spectrometry-based approach of CD4 protein quantification is important as a complementary strategy to validate the analysis from the cytometry-based conventional method. It also provides new support for quantitative understanding and advanced characterization of CD4 on CD4+ T cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aantibodies 3aclones 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescent dyes 3aglycoproteins 3ahumans 3amass spectrometry 3amonitoring 3aquantitative analysis 3asurface proteins1 aHe, Hua-Jun1 aTurko, Illarion V.1 aPhinney, Karen W.1 aWang, Lili0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2013 Feb. 05, v. 85, no. 3 p.1773-1777dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac30313063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010200169300001600271520132900287592002801616650002201644650001101666650002901677650001501706650001001721650001801731650001601749650001601765650001801781650002201799650001901821650001701840650002101857650001001878650001201888650001401900651001501914653002201929653001501951653002201966653002301988653002102011653000802032700001902040700002202059700002902081773011702110856008402227852000902311655001202320IND60123355420221119051551.0150325e20150403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012335542DNAL7 a10.1080/15324982.2014.9442432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaust, Sibylle10aSoil Properties Under Manured Tamarindus indica in the Littoral Plain of South-Western Madagascar  ap. 167-179.  aThe current study investigated how the presence of tamarinds and manure affect (1) soil chemical properties; (2) C and N mineralization; (3) microbial biomass indices (C, N, and fungal ergosterol); (4) microbial residues, that is, amino sugars; and (5) the germination of sorghum seeds in soils of the littoral zone in southwestern Madagascar. Soil pH was lower under than outside the tamarind canopy, whereas SOC, total N content, and the cation exchange capacity were roughly three times higher than in the uncovered situation. Under the tamarind canopy, basal respiration was increased nearly threefold, whereas net N mineralization remained unaffected. However, net N mineralization was increased by 74% in the manure treatment, especially under the tamarind canopy. Tamarind did not inhibit the germination of sorghum seeds. Contents of microbial biomass C and N, and especially fungal ergosterol, were also higher under the tamarind canopy. Muramic acid, galactosamine, and glucosamine were increased threefold under the tamarind canopy. The mean fungal C to bacterial C ratio was 0.67 and remained unaffected by any treatment. The presence of manure increased the contribution of microbial residue C to SOC from 28% to 41% and of microbial biomass N to total N from 3.5% to 5.6%, especially under the tamarind canopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTamarindus indica 3acanopy 3acation exchange capacity 3aergosterol 3afungi 3agalactosamine 3agermination 3aglucosamine 3alittoral zone 3amicrobial biomass 3amineralization 3amuramic acid 3anitrogen content 3aseeds 3asoil pH 3atamarinds 3aMadagascar 0abasal respiration 0aergosterol 0amicrobial biomass 0amicrobial residues 0aN mineralization 0aSOC1 aHanisch, Susan1 aBuerkert, Andreas1 aJoergensen, Rainer Georg0 tArid land research and management.g2015 Apr. 3, v. 29, no. 2 p.167-179dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-49907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15324982.2014.9442433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01844naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245016100178300001600339500001400355520065400369592002801023650001901051650001501070650001301085650001201098650001601110651001701126653002101143653001201164653001401176653002301190653001301213700001701226700002801243773009601271856008201367852000901449655001201458IND60717650320221119005721.0210117e20201106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071765032DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.988.496272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenao-Sepúlveda, Carolina10aFour new Neotropical species of Eudicrana Loew (Diptera, Mycetophilidae, Sciophilinae) from the Colombian high Andean ecosystems, with comments on the genus  ap. 129-150.  aNAL-light  aFour new species of the sciophiline genus Eudicrana Loew are described for the Eastern and Central Andes of Colombia–Eudicrana silvaandina sp. nov., E. chingaza sp. nov., E. maculata sp. nov. and E. merizaldei.

Five Pinus contorta aquaporins encoding PiconPIP2;1, PiconPIP2;2, PiconPIP2;3, PiconPIP1;2, and PiconTIP1;1 were cloned and detailed structural analyses were conducted to provide essential information that can explain their biological and molecular function. All five PiconAQPs contained hydrophilic aromatic/arginine selective filters to facilitate the transport of water. Transcript abundance patterns of PiconAQPs varied significantly across the P. contorta families under varying soil moisture conditions. The transcript abundance of five PiconPIPs remained unchanged under control and water-stress conditions in two families that originated from the sites with lower precipitation levels. These two families also displayed a different adaptive strategy of photosynthesis to cope with drought stress, which was manifested by reduced sensitivity in photosynthesis (maintaining the same rate) while exhibiting a reduction in stomatal conductance. In general, root:shoot ratios were not affected by drought stress, but some variation was observed between families. The results showed variability in drought coping mechanisms, including the expression of aquaporin genes and plant biomass allocation among eight families of Pinus contorta.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPinus contorta 3aaquaporins 3aarginine 3acoping strategies 3adrought 3afilters 3agenes 3ahydrophilicity 3aopen pollination 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysiological response 3aphytomass 3aroot shoot ratio 3asoil water 3asource-sink relationships 3astomatal conductance 3awater stress1 aThomas, Barb  R.1 aDe la Mata, Raul 1 aRandall, Morgan  J.1 aZhang, Wenqing 1 aZwiazek, Janusz  J.0 tPlants.g2019 Jan. 06, v. 8, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants80100133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02007naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245008200164300001800246500001500264520061500279592002800894650001200922650002200934650002300956650001100979650001200990650001701002650002201019650001901041650002301060650003601083650002901119653002401148700002201172700002801194700002001222700001901242700001401261700002001275700002401295700001801319773010601337856008501443852000901528655001201537IND60578941720221122075530.0170815e20150807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057894172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.5b018062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Ming10aIcacinlactone H and Icacintrichantholide from the Tuber of Icacina trichantha  ap. 3834-3837.  a2019-12-06  aThe 17-norpimarane diterpene is a small group of natural products.

With an increasing number of viruses resistant to the anti-NA drug oseltamivir, functionally active recombinant NA is needed for screening novel anti-NA compounds. In this study, the secretable NA (sNA) head domain of influenza A/Vietnam/DT-036/05 (H5N1) virus was expressed successfully in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293T) cells and shown to be enzymatically active. The inclusion of a plasmid encoding nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus with the sNA plasmid in the cotransfection demonstrated an increase in H5N1 sNA expression by 7.4 fold. Subsequently, the sNA/NS1 cotransfection protocol in serum-free 293-F suspension cell culture was optimized to develop a rapid transient gene expression (TGE) system for expression of large amounts of H5N1 sNA. Under optimized conditions, NS1 enhanced H5N1 sNA expression by 4.2 fold. The resulting H5N1 sNA displayed comparable molecular weight, glycosylation, Kₘ for MUNANA, and Kᵢ for oseltamivir carboxylate to those of H5N1 NA on the virus surface. Taken together, the NS1-enhancing sNA expression strategy presented in this study could be used for rapid high-level expression of enzymatically active H5N1 sNA in suspension mammalian cells. This strategy may be applied for expression of sNA of other strains of influenza virus as well as the other recombinant proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthomyxoviridae 3acell suspension culture 3adrugs 3agene expression 3aglycosylation 3ahumans 3ainfluenza 3akidneys 3amolecular weight 3aoseltamivir 3aplasmids 3arecombinant proteins 3ascreening 3asialidase 3aviral nonstructural proteins 3aviruses1 aYongkiettrakul, Suganya1 aKramyu, Jarin1 aPannengpetch, Supitcha1 aWanasen, Nanchaya0 tJournal of virological methods.g2011 Dec., v. 178, no. 1-2 p.44-51dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02256naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002100191245011300212300001600325506007600341520114700417592002801564506003701592650002501629650001001654650001101664650002401675700001801699700002501717773008301742856008401825852000901909655001201918IND60553987420221207095801.0161023e20150604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055398742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2015.04.0012doi7 aPMC53154972pmcid7 a259368002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstarás, Conchi10aSMADs and YAP Compete to Control Elongation of β-Catenin:LEF-1-Recruited RNAPII during hESC Differentiation  ap. 780-793.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Wnt3a/β-catenin and Activin/SMAD2,3 signaling pathways synergize to induce endodermal differentiation of human embryonic stem cells; however, the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Using ChIP-seq and GRO-seq analyses, we show here that Wnt3a-induced β-catenin:LEF-1 enhancers recruit cohesin to direct enhancer-promoter looping and activate mesendodermal (ME) lineage genes. Moreover, we find that LEF-1 and other hESC enhancers recruit RNAPII complexes (eRNAPII) that are highly phosphorylated at Ser5, but not Ser7. Wnt3a signaling further increases Ser5P-RNAPII at LEF-1 sites and ME gene promoters, indicating that elongation remains limiting. However, subsequent Activin/SMAD2,3 signaling selectively increases transcription elongation, P-TEFb occupancy, and Ser7P-RNAPII levels at these genes. Finally, we show that the Hippo regulator, YAP, functions with TEAD to regulate binding of the NELF negative elongation factor and block SMAD2,3 induction of ME genes. Thus, the Wnt3a/β-catenin and Activin/SMAD2,3 pathways act in concert to counteract YAP repression and upregulate ME genes during early hESC differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aembryonic stem cells 3agenes 3ahumans 3asignal transduction1 aBenner, Chris1 aJones, Katherine A.,0 tMolecular cell.g2015 June 04, v. 58 p.780-793dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2015.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02144naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011300165300001600278500001900294520108300313592002801396650002801424650001101452650001101463650001601474650002601490650001301516650002301529650001101552650001101563773014201574856008101716852000901797655001201806IND60666677820221122085953.0190917e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066667782DNAL7 a10.3103/S00963925190201232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYaskin, V.

Autumn-born animals were compared at three stages of their life cycle: in autumn (1–3 months old), during the winter decrease of brain weight (5–7 months old), and after the spring “growth spurt” (9–11 months old). The winter sample exhibited significantly smaller (p < 0.05) section areas of ​​both the dentate gyrus and the CA3 field of the hippocampus. All studied divisions of the hippocampal complex—molecular and granule layers of the dentate gyrus, pyramidal cell layers, and fibers of the CA3 field of the hippocampus—exhibited a similar winter decrease (9.4–13.3%). In spring, hippocampal complex showed regrowth. In overwintered voles, the size of hippocampal divisions in summer surpassed that in the winter sample by 5.4–27.3%. The results indicate a considerable morphological plasticity of the main hippocampal structures in response to seasonal factors in nonwinter-sleeping rodents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClethrionomys glareolus 3aRussia 3aautumn 3ahippocampus 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aregrowth 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer0 tMoscow University biological sciences bulletin.g2019 Apr., v. 74, no. 2 p.103-107dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl6481x0096-39257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3103/S00963925190201233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01308naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245009400166300001800260520028400278592002800562650001200590650003600602650001400638650001400652650002100666650002300687650001300710650001200723700001800735700001700753773010600770856008500876852000900961655001200970IND60578941820221122075555.0170815e20150807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057894182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.5b018112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Dong-Su10aSynthesis of Pyrroles through Rhodium(III)-Catalyzed Reactions of Allylamines and Alkenes  ap. 3842-3845.  aPyrrole derivatives are generated in reactions of allylamines with alkenes that are promoted by a Rh(III) catalyst in the presence of AgOAc.

A simple, rapid, robust, and reliable test, suitable for use in the field or at the patient's bedside, is urgently needed. In this study, the performance of a newly developed portable impedance biosensor was evaluated by comparison with real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) and virus culture for detection of AIV in tracheal and cloacal swab samples collected from experimentally H5N2 AIV infected chickens. The impedance biosensor system was based on a combination of magnetic nanobeads, which were coated with AIV subtype-specific antibody for capture (separation and concentration) of a target virus, and a microfluidic chip with an interdigitated array microelectrode for transfer and detection of target virus, and impedance measurement of the bio-nanobeads and AI virus complexes in a buffer solution. A comparison of results obtained from 59 swab samples using virus culture, impedance biosensor and rRT-PCR methods showed that the impedance biosensor technique was comparable in sensitivity and specificity to rRT-PCR.

Under high fat diet (HFD) condition, the senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mice demonstrated worsen Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD) related pathology compared to low fat diet fed SAMP8 mice. Objective: To explore whether chia seed supplementation might improve cognitive impairment under aging and metabolic stress via high fat diet (HFD) fed SAMP8 mice as a model. Design: SAMP8 mice and senescence-accelerated mouse-resistant 1 (SAMR1) were randomized into 4 groups, i.e., SAMR1 low fat diet group (SAMR1-LFD), SAMP8-HFD and SAMP8-HFD group supplemented with 10% chia seed (SAMP8-HFD+Chia). At the end of the intervention, cognitive function was measured via Morris water maze (MWM) test. Hippocampus and parietal cortex were dissected for further analysis to measure key markers involved AD pathology including A&beta;, tau and neuro-inflammation. Results: During navigation trials of MWM test, mice in SAMP8-LFD group demonstrated impaired learning ability compared to SAMR1-LFD group, and chia seed had no effect on learning and memory ability for HFD fed SAMP8 mice. As for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD) related pathology, chia seed not only increased &alpha;-secretase such as ADAM10 and insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), but also increased &beta;-secretase including beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) and cathepsin B, with an overall effects of elevation in the hippocampal A&beta;<inf>42</inf> level; chia seed slightly reduced p-Tauser404 in the hippocampus; while an elevation in neuro-inflammation with the activation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Ib&alpha;-1 were observed post chia seed supplementation. Conclusions: Chia seed supplementation did not improve cognitive impairment via MWM in HFD fed SAMP8 mice. This might be associated with that chia seed increased key enzymes involved both in non-amyloidogenic and amyloidogenic pathways, and neuro-inflammation. Future studies are necessary to confirm our present study.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3aanimal models 3acathepsin B 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3acortex 3ahigh fat diet 3ahippocampus 3ainsulin 3alow fat diet 3amemory 3ametabolic syndrome 3amice 3arisk factors1 aLv, Menglian1 aChang, Jie1 aXu, Jiaying1 aQin, Liqiang1 aWan, Zhongxiao0 tNutrients.g2018 Aug. 14, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu100810843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03493naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245014300159300001800302520181200320592002802132650001602160650001802176650001002194650000902204650002602213650003302239650001802272650001202290650002302302650002202325650002502347650004302372650001502415650000902430650003002439653002002469653001702489653002502506653001402531653001802545653001502563700001802578700001802596700001802614700001702632700002802649700001702677700002302694773013502717856007802852852000902930655001202939IND60677654420221116232859.0191202s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067765442DNAL7 a10.1139/apnm-2019-01442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Hui10aβ-Cell compensation concomitant with adaptive endoplasmic reticulum stress and β-cell neogenesis in a diet-induced type 2 diabetes model  ap. 1355-1366.  aInsulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells adapt to obesity-related insulin resistance via increases in insulin secretion and β-cell mass. Failed β-cell compensation predicts the onset of type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the mechanisms of β-cell compensation are not fully understood. Our previous study reported changes in β-cell mass during the progression of T2D in the Nile rat (NR; Arvicanthis niloticus) fed standard chow. In the present study, we measured other β-cell adaptive responses, including glucose metabolism and β-cell insulin secretion in NRs at different ages, thus characterizing NR at 2 months as a model of β-cell compensation followed by decompensation at 6 months. We observed increased proinsulin secretion in the transition from compensation to decompensation, which is indicative of impaired insulin processing. Subsequently, we compared adaptive unfolded protein response in β-cells and demonstrated a positive role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones in insulin secretion. In addition, the incidence of insulin-positive neogenic but not proliferative cells increased during the compensation phase, suggesting nonproliferative β-cell growth as a mechanism of β-cell mass adaptation. In contrast, decreased neogenesis and β-cell dedifferentiation were observed in β-cell dysfunction. Furthermore, the progression of T2D and pathophysiological changes of β-cells were prevented by increasing fibre content of the diet. Novelty Our study characterized a novel model for β-cell compensation with adaptive responses in cell function and mass. The temporal association of adaptive ER chaperones with blood insulin and glucose suggests upregulated chaperone capacity as an adaptive mechanism. β-Cell neogenesis but not proliferation contributes to β-cell mass adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArvicanthis 3aanimal models 3ablood 3adiet 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3afiber content 3aglucose 3ainsulin resistance 3ainsulin secretion 3aislets of Langerhans 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aproinsulin 3arats 3aunfolded protein response 0atype 2 diabetes 0aanimal model 0aβ-cell compensation 0aER stress 0aproliferation 0aneogenesis1 aYang, Kaiyuan1 aWang, Rennian1 aHan, Woo Hyun1 aKuny, Sharee1 aZelmanovitz, Paula Horn1 aSauvé, Yves1 aChan, Catherine B.0 tApplied physiology, nutrition and metabolism.g2019, v. 44, no. 12 p.1355-1366dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2019-01443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010600172300001600278520097700294592002801271650001301299650001101312650001701323650001001340650001801350650001801368653001301386653002701399653002001426653001101446653003101457653006101488653005901549653006701608653001401675653003301689653001601722653004801738700002101786700002101807700002301828700003001851700002101881773010801902856008602010852000902096655001202105IND60540815720221120151343.0190318e20141104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054081572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.06.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTirino, Pasquale10aSynthesis of chitosan–PEO hydrogels via mesylation and regioselective Cu(I)-catalyzed cycloaddition  ap. 736-745.  aIn this work, a well-defined hydrogel was developed by coupling chitosan with PEO through “click chemistry”. Azide functionalities were introduced onto chitosan, through mesylation of C-6 hydroxyl groups, and reacted with a di-alkyne PEO by a regioselective Cu(I)-catalyzed cycloaddition.This synthetic approach allowed us to obtain a hydrogel with a controlled crosslinking degree. In fact, the extent of coupling is strictly dependent on the amount of azido groups on chitosan, which in turn can be easily modulated.The obtained hydrogel, with a crosslinking degree of around 90%, showed interesting swelling properties. With respect to chitosan hydrogels reported in literature, a considerably higher equilibrium uptake was reached (940%).The possibility to control the crosslinking degree of hydrogel and its capability to rapidly absorb high amounts of water make this material suitable for several applications, such as controlled drug release and wound healing.  aPublisher supplied data 3achitosan 3acopper 3acrosslinking 3adrugs 3ahydrocolloids 3atissue repair 0aChitosan 0aWell-defined hydrogels 0aClick chemistry 0aSodium 0aazide (PubChem CID: 33557) 0aN-ethyl-N-propan-2-ylpropan-2-amine (PubChem CID: 81531) 0aPropyl-2-ynyl carbonochloridate (PubChem CID: 3356829) 0a(4-Chlorophenyl)methanesulfonyl chloride (PubChem CID: 227304) 0aHydrazine 0aHydrate (PubChem CID: 24654) 0aBromocopper 0aTriphenylphosphane (PubChem CID: 11251615).1 aLaurino, Rosaria1 aMaglio, Giovanni1 aMalinconico, Mario1 ad’Ayala, Giovanna Gomez1 aLaurienzo, Paola0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2014 Nov. 04, v. 112 p.736-745dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.06.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245007700172500001900249520226500268592002802533650002002561650001702581650002202598650001102620650001902631650001902650650001402669650001202683650001802695650001502713650001202728650001002740700001802750700001702768700002602785700002402811773012602835856008302961852000903044655001203053IND60715239820221119222810.0201026e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071523982DNAL7 a10.3390/environments71000912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Silva, Shamali 10aMeasuring Soil Metal Bioavailability in Roadside Soils of Different Ages  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFinding a reliable method to predict soil metal bioavailability in aged soil continues to be one of the most important problems in contaminated soil chemistry. To investigate the bioavailability of metals aged in soils, we used roadside soils that had accumulated metals from vehicle emissions over a range of years. We collected topsoil (0–10 cm) samples representing new-, medium- and old-aged roadside soils and control site soil. These soils were studied to compare the ability of the diffusive gradients in thin films technique (DGT), soil water extraction, CaCl₂ extraction, total metal concentrations and optimised linear models to predict metal bioavailability in wheat plants. The response time for the release of metals and the effect on metal bioavailability in field aged soils was also studied. The DGT, and extractable metals such as CaCl₂ extractable and soil solution metals in soil, were not well correlated with metal concentrations in wheat shoots. In comparison, the strongest relationships with concentrations in wheat shoots were found for Ni and Zn total metal concentrations in soil (e.g., Ni r = 0.750, p = 0.005 and Zn r = 0.833, p = 0.001); the correlations were still low, suggesting that total metal concentrations were also not a robust measure of bioavailability. Optimised linear models incorporating soil physiochemical properties and metal extracts together with road age as measure of exposure time, demonstrated a very strong relationship for Mn R² = 0.936; Ni R² = 0.936 and Zn R² = 0.931. While all the models developed were dependent on total soil metal concentrations, models developed for Mn and Zn clearly demonstrated the effect of road age on metal bioavailability. Therefore, the optimised linear models developed have the potential for robustly predicting bioavailable metal concentrations in field soils where the metals have aged in situ. The intrinsic rate of release of metals increased for Mn (R² = 0.617, p = 0.002) and decreased for Cd (R² = 0.456, p = 0.096), Cu (R² = 0.560, p = 0.083) and Zn (R² =0.578, p = 0.072). Nickel did not show any relationship between dissociation time (Tc) and road age. Roadside soil pH was likely to be the key parameter controlling metal aging in roadside soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3adissociation 3aexposure duration 3anickel 3apolluted soils 3aroadside soils 3aroadsides 3asoil pH 3asoil solution 3asoil water 3atopsoil 3awheat1 aHuynh, Trang 1 aBall, A.

In the austral summer of 2006, sea floor sediment was recovered beneath the extinct Larsen B ice shelf and in a region off the Northern Antarctic Peninsula (NAP), which has been free of ice shelves for more than 1000yr. To assess changes in the chemical composition of the sediment after ice shelf collapses, chlorophylls and pheophytins were measured in sediment cores at six stations. This is the first time that chlorophyll pigments have been analysed in sediment samples from regions under recently collapsed ice shelves. Five years after the ice shelf collapse, Chla and Chlc concentrations were similar in the interfacial sediment (upper 1cm) of NAP and EAP regions. However, in EAP Chla and Chlc concentrations decreased more rapidly with depth in the sediment column and were negligible below 2cm depth. The high Chla to Pheoa ratios indicated that sedimentary pigments found in EAP had undergone limited degradation suggesting that they were locally produced rather than laterally advected. Complementary information from excess ²¹⁰Pb activity and diatom valve distributions provided further evidence that the pigment fluxes to the seabed in EAP took place only after the ice shelf collapse.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3achemical composition 3asummer 3aice 3achlorophyll 3aBacillariophyceae 3apigments 3aAntarctic region 0aBacillariophycidae1 aIsla, E.1 aGrémare, A.1 aGutt, J.1 aVétion, G.1 aDeMaster, D.J.0 tJournal of sea research.g2011 Jan., v. 65, no. 1 p.94-102dElsevier B.V.x1385-11017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2010.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245006200179300001800241520185300259592002802112650001502140650002802155650001302183650002202196650001602218650001502234650001102249700002102260700002402281700006602305773012102371856008402492852000902576655001202585IND60752070520220217000000.0210929e20210908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075207052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.1c006492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBongiardina, Nicholas J.10aSubstituted Thiols in Dynamic Thiol–Thioester Reactions  ap. 8341-8351.  aThe thiol–thioester reaction has emerged as a promising method for developing covalent adaptable networks (CANs) due to its ability to exchange rapidly under low temperature conditions in a number of solvents, orthogonality among other functional groups, and tunability. Here, the effects of thiol substitution (i.e., primary vs secondary) were assessed with respect to their reactivity in two dynamic thioester reactions: the thiol–thioester exchange and the reversible thiol–anhydride addition. Model NMR experiments were conducted using small-molecule compounds to observe how polymers of similar components would behave in thiol–thioester exchange. It was determined that the Kₑq was near unity for mixtures of primary thiols and secondary thioesters, and vice versa, in both a polar solvent, DMSO-d₆, and at most slightly favors primary thioesters in a relatively nonpolar solvent, CDCl₃. Dielectric spectroscopy and stress relaxation experiments were used to determine the relaxation times and activation energies of the two thioester-containing networks: Thiol-ene networks, which undergo thioester exchange, displayed activation energies of 73 and 71 kJ/mol from dielectric measurements and 36 and 53 kJ/mol from stress relaxation for the primary and secondary thiols, respectively. Thiol–anhydride-ene networks, which undergo both thioester exchange and reversible thiol–anhydride addition, displayed activation energies of 94 and 114 kJ/mol from dielectric and 111 and 139 kJ/mol from stress relaxation for primary and secondary thiols, respectively. In both types of networks, the secondary thioester-based networks demonstrated slower dynamics as compared to the same primary network by at least one order of magnitude. In the anhydride network, the secondary thiol also biased the dynamics toward reversible addition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanhydrides 3adielectric spectroscopy 3asolvents 3astress relaxation 3atemperature 3athioesters 3athiols1 aLong, Katelyn F.1 aPodgórski, Maciej,1 aBowman, Christopher N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8458-77230 tMacromolecules.g2021 Sept. 08, v. 54, no. 18 p.8341-8351dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c006493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011200170300001400282520120100296592002801497650001501525650001501540650001701555650003101572650002401603650001101627650001301638650001101651650002001662653000701682653000901689653000901698653000901707653001001716653000801726653000801734653004201742653001501784653001301799653002901812653002401841700001701865700002101882700006201903773013301965856008602098852000902184655001202193IND60552860620221119201745.0161021e20150905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055286062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2014.12.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhno, Masashi10aInterfacial tension in adsorption of lysozyme onto a lipid monolayer formed at a water/chloroform interface  ap. 85-90.  aUsing a quasi-elastic laser scattering (QELS) method, we determined the changes in the interfacial tension of a lipid monolayer membrane, composed of either 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine sodium salt (DOPS) or 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), at the water/chloroform interface upon the addition of lysozyme. The measurements were performed in the presence of electrolytes of different concentrations and using lipids that vary the net charge of the monolayer membrane. As a result, the interfacial tension was observed to decrease in three stages. In the case of DOPS, there was a lag time wherein the interfacial tension did not change, which lasted from several tens of seconds to several hundreds, following electrostatic interaction between lysozyme and the lipid monolayer membrane. On the other hand, the DOPC monolayer membrane decreased its interfacial tension without such a lag time after lysozyme addition. The lag time was attributed to the strong electrostatic interaction between the lysozyme and the DOPS monolayer membrane, which delayed the hydrophobic interaction that causes a change in the overall structure and conformation of lysozyme and lipids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achloroform 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrophobic bonding 3alipids 3alysozyme 3asodium 3asurface tension 0aLB 0aQELS 0aDOPS 0aDOPC 0aHEPES 0aFFT 0aCAC 0aQuasi-elastic laser scattering method 0aAdsorption 0aLysozyme 0aLipid monolayer membrane 0aOil/water interface1 aToyota, Taro1 aNomoto, Tomonori1 aFujinami, Masanori1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5607-35700 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2015 Sept. 05, v. 480 p.85-90dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2014.12.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01715naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245011000128300001600238500001900254520082100273592002801094650001101122650001601133650001301149650001601162653002901178700001501207700001801222700001701240773014701257852000901404655001201413IND60716695420221120210114.0201107e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071669542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGosai, R.K.10aComparative assessment of different methods for surgical management of interdigital hyperplasia in cattle  ap. 136-138.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCattle suffering from interdigital hyperplasia were subjected to conventional surgical excision (n=12, group I), cryotherapy followed by conventional surgical excision (n=12, group II), or thermocautery followed by conventional surgical excision group III (n=12).

In this study, 10 biotypes of A. auriculata were sampled from Yangzhou City, China, where the paddy fields were seriously infested with A. auriculata, and their resistance levels to acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitor bensulfuron-methyl were determined. The whole-plant response assays showed that nine A. auriculata biotypes were highly resistant (from 16.4- to 183.1-fold) to bensulfuron-methyl in comparison with a susceptible YZ-S biotype, and only one YZ-6 biotype was susceptible. ALS gene sequencing revealed that three ALS gene copies existed in A. auriculata, and four different amino acid substitutions (Pro197-Leu, -Ala, -Ser, and -His) at site 197 in the AaALS1 or 2 genes were found in eight resistant biotypes. In addition, no amino acid mutations in three ALS genes were found in the YZ-3 biotype. These results suggested that target-site mutations or non-target-site resistance mechanisms were involved in tested resistant A. auriculata biotypes. Finally, a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker was identified to rapidly detect the Pro197 mutations in A. auriculata.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmmannia 3aacetolactate synthase 3aamino acids 3abensulfuron-methyl 3abiotypes 3abroadleaf weeds 3agenes 3apaddies 3aChina1 aWan, Peng 1 aLi, Yang 1 aDuan, Zhiwen 1 aPeng, Cheng 1 aYuan, Shuzhong 1 aDeng, Wei 0 tPlants.g2022 July 25, v. 11, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111519263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02214naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100003900112245010100151300001400252506002800266520109000294592002801384506003701412650001101449650001201460650002801472650001601500650001301516650001101529650001501540650001801555651001701573653001701590653002601607653002201633653001101655700003401666773011901700852000901819655001201828IND60774902820221207144828.0141114e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077490282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSupelano, Nerly Deyanira Montañez10aPrototipo de hueso humano y propiedades mecánicas de un biomaterial a partir de ramas de guadua  ap. 39-46.  aResource is Open Access  aThe main objective of this paper is to describe the development of a prototype of human bone (cortical rib), tacuaras from bamboo; plant genus representative of Andean forests of Latin American and Asian countries, and the evaluation of the mechanical properties of this material for the development of a biomaterial.

The current study aimed to profile the expression of bone morphogenetic protein receptor, (BMPR1B) in 53 IVF patients exhibiting different degrees of primordial follicle depletion. The granulosa cell receptor density was measured in 403 follicles via flow cytometry. A decline in BMPR1B density occurred at the time of dominant follicle selection and during the terminal stage of folliculogenesis in the 23–30 y good ovarian reserve patients. The 40+ y poor ovarian reserve patients experienced a reversal of this pattern. The results demonstrate an association between age-induced depletion of the ovarian reserve and BMPR1B receptor density at the two critical time points of dominant follicle selection and pre-ovulatory follicle maturation. Dysregulation of BMP receptor signalling may inhibit the normal steroidogenic differentiation required for maturation in older patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal ovaries 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3aflow cytometry 3afollicular development 3ahuman fertility 3ain vitro fertilization 3apatients 0aReceptors 0aHuman granulosa cells 0aOvary 0aBone morphogenetic protein receptor 1B1 aKnight, Phil G.1 aYovich, John L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9583-36831 aStanger, James D.1 aLiang, Yi,1 aArfuso, Frank1 aDharmarajan, Arun1 aAlmahbobi, Ghanim0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2016 Apr. 15, v. 425 p.84-93dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2016.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245006300204300001600267520097300283592002801256650001501284650001101299650001901310650001901329650002201348650001601370650001301386650002101399650001601420653003101436653002701467653002901494653003401523700001501557773019501572856008301767852000901850655001201859IND60561496020221119211046.0190416e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056149602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eaef.2017.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Yuanping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5189-686910aTowards discrete time model for greenhouse climate control  ap. 157-170.  aThis paper presents a discrete-time greenhouse climate model to meet the requirement of model-based greenhouse climate discrete control. In this model, three state variables including the indoor temperature, humidity and CO2 concentration and several control actions are considered. To save several states, algebraic fitting technique and time sequence functions are used to estimate some variables such as the temperatures of cover, canopy and floor. To improve simulation performance of the discrete-time model, polynomial is employed to approximate some unmodeled dynamics, and least square technique and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm are used to identify the parameters of relevant terms in the model. The model is validated by a complete greenhouse climate model and a Venlo type commercial greenhouse, and the results indicate that the proposed model demonstrates good simulation performance, and is suitable to be used to greenhouse climate control design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acanopy 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate models 3agreenhouse effect 3agreenhouses 3ahumidity 3amodel validation 3atemperature 0aGreenhouse climate control 0aDiscrete-time modeling 0aPolynomial approximation 0aLevenberg-Marquardt algorithm1 aXu, Lihong0 tEngineering in agriculture, environment and food.g2017 Apr., v. 10, no. 2 p.157-170dElsevier B.V.aAsian Agricultural and Biological Engineering AssociationwJournal:21476x1881-83667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eaef.2017.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010000171300001100271520114500282592002801427650002301455650002801478650000901506650001501515650001001530650002501540650001201565650001901577650000901596650000901605650002501614650002001639651001001659700002601669773013101695856008101826852000901907655001201916IND60477626920221118043700.0160304e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047762692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-015-5065-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwathandran, Sruthi10aFood productivity trend analysis of Raichur district for the management of agricultural drought  ap. 63.  aDrought is an extreme climatic situation where there is a water shortage arising due to sub-normal rainfall, erratic distribution of precipitation, increased water supply demand, etc. India faced several years of drought in last six decades. As Indian agriculture is largely dependent on the monsoon, a slight change affects production as well as crop yield drastically. Statistical analysis is important for mapping the drought prone areas. Raichur district of the northern interior state of Karnataka is a drought-prone region where the economy is mainly based on agriculture. So, the uneven distribution of rainfall as well as the delay in the arrival of the southwest monsoon adversely affects the growth stage of crops which result in a decline in crop production. The effect of drought on the agriculture for the past decade has been analyzed using crop productivity data. When the production rate of Raichur district was studied for the years 1998 to 2009, it was seen that major crops like rice and jowar faced a decline in its production during the years 2002 and 2003, whereas bajra, maize, etc. mostly decreased in the year 2004.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPennisetum glaucum 3aagricultural management 3acorn 3acrop yield 3acrops 3adevelopmental stages 3adrought 3amonsoon season 3arain 3arice 3astatistical analysis 3awater shortages 3aIndia1 aAslam, M.

In addition, rechargeable Zn–MnO₂ batteries have great potential due to their low-cost resources as well as high energy density. However, dendritic growth of the zinc anode hinders the exertion of cycling stability and rate capacity in an aqueous Zn–MnO₂ battery system. Here we use an electrochemical deposition method to in situ form a three-dimensional (3D) zinc anode on carbon fibers (CFs). This 3D Zn@CFs framework has lower charge transfer resistance with larger electroactive areas. Batteries based on the 3D zinc framework anode and α-MnO₂ nanowire cathode present enhanced rate capacity and long cycling stability, which is promising for utilization in other zinc anode based aqueous batteries as an effective way to solve dendrite formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acarbon fibers 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3amanganese dioxide 3ananowires 3azinc1 aShi, Ji-Lei1 aWang, Tai-Shan1 aYin, Ya-Xia1 aWang, Chun-Ru1 aGuo, Yu-Guo0 tRSC advances.g2018 May 24, v. 8, no. 34 p.19157-19163dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra03226b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02198naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245006900173300001800242520099700260592002801257650002001285650001901305650001901324650001601343650002001359650001601379650001601395650001701411650000901428650001701437700001901454700001701473700001701490700001701507700001901524700003001543700002501573773008501598856008401683852000901767655001201776IND60553988020221119181746.0161023e20150618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055398802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2015.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHisatsune, Chihiro10aERp44 Exerts Redox-Dependent Control of Blood Pressure at the ER  ap. 1015-1027.  aBlood pressure maintenance is vital for systemic homeostasis, and angiotensin II is a critical regulator. The upstream mechanisms that regulate angiotensin II are not completely understood. Here, we show that angiotensin II is regulated by ERp44, a factor involved in disulfide bond formation in the ER. In mice, genetic loss of ERp44 destabilizes angiotensin II and causes hypotension. We show that ERp44 forms a mixed disulfide bond with ERAP1, an aminopeptidase that cleaves angiotensin II. ERp44 controls the release of ERAP1 in a redox-dependent manner to control blood pressure. Additionally, we found that systemic inflammation triggers ERAP1 retention in the ER to inhibit hypotension. These findings suggest that the ER redox state calibrates serum angiotensin II levels via regulation of the ERp44-ERAP1 complex. Our results reveal a link between ER function and normotension and implicate the ER redox state as a potential risk factor in the development of cardiovascular disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaminopeptidases 3aangiotensin II 3ablood pressure 3ablood serum 3adisulfide bonds 3ahomeostasis 3ahypotension 3ainflammation 3amice 3arisk factors1 aEbisui, Etsuko1 aUsui, Masaya1 aOgawa, Naoko1 aSuzuki, Akio1 aMataga, Nobuko1 aTakahashi-Iwanaga, Hiromi1 aMikoshiba, Katsuhiko0 tMolecular cell.g2015 June 18, v. 58 p.1015-1027dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2015.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245009800167300001800265520179300283592002802076650001302104650001302117650002802130650002902158650001902187651001802206653002402224653001702248653001402265653001502279653001202294700001802306773013502324856007802459852000902537655001202546IND60677654720221116232355.0191202s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067765472DNAL7 a10.1139/apnm-2019-02612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKillian, Lauren A.10aIrritable bowel syndrome is underdiagnosed and ineffectively managed among endurance athletes  ap. 1329-1338.  aLower gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common among endurance athletes and can impair performance. Symptom characteristics are similar to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). No previous research has examined IBS diagnosis (medically or by diagnostic criteria) within this population. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of IBS among endurance athletes and examine their GI symptom management strategies. A previously validated, online questionnaire assessed IBS diagnosis, the meeting of IBS diagnostic criteria (Rome III or Manning), general GI symptoms, and symptom mitigation strategies of endurance athletes. The questionnaire was distributed to United States athletes completing a marathon, ultra-marathon, half-distance triathlon, or full-distance triathlon. Medically diagnosed IBS was reported by 2.8% of endurance athletes. The total prevalence of IBS (n = 430) was 9.8% (medical diagnosis and Rome III). Athletes with IBS experienced more frequent symptoms during exercise as well as at rest; however, only 47.6% had consulted a medical professional. Over 56% of athletes experienced at least 1 symptom sometimes, often, or always during training and competition and 18.6% had symptoms that sometimes or often interrupted/prevented training. Almost half (45.8%) of athletes and 80.0% of athletes with IBS reported trying nutritional modifications to help ease symptoms while 20.6% and 52.4% used over-the-counter medications, respectively. Novelty Most endurance athletes who suffer from IBS are undiagnosed, while even more experience GI symptoms but do not fit diagnostic criteria. Despite using various symptom management methods, endurance athletes are still experiencing symptoms and could potentially benefit from current IBS-mitigating strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aathletes 3aexercise 3agastrointestinal system 3airritable bowel syndrome 3aquestionnaires 3aUnited States 0aathlete performance 0aepidemiology 0anutrition 0aphysiology 0arunning1 aLee, Soo-Yeun0 tApplied physiology, nutrition and metabolism.g2019, v. 44, no. 12 p.1329-1338dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2019-02613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02122naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245010100164300001600265520092700281592002801208650002001236650002001256650001401276650001601290650002401306650002101330653001401351653001101365653000901376700001601385700002201401700002101423700001901444700001401463700002001477773013701497856008101634852000901715655001201724IND60219801820221120230641.0151127e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6021980182DNAL7 a10.1638/2014-0158R1.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorton, Terry M.10aPharmacokinetics of tramadol and o-desmethyltramadol in loggerhead sea turtles (caretta caretta)  ap. 262-265.  aThe objective of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of two orally administered doses of tramadol (5 and 10 mg/kg) and its major metabolite (O-desmethyltramadol) (M1) in loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta).

API values that exceed the limit of 100 units indicate an unhealthy status for the exposed environment. This study investigates the risk of occurrences of API values greater than 100 units for eight urban areas in Peninsular Malaysia for the period of January 2004 to December 2014. An extreme value model, known as the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD), has been fitted to the API values found. Based on the fitted model, return period for describing the occurrences of API exceeding 100 in the different cities has been computed as the indicator of risk. The results obtained indicated that most of the urban areas considered have a very small risk of occurrence of the unhealthy events, except for Kuala Lumpur, Malacca, and Klang. However, among these three cities, it is found that Klang has the highest risk. Based on all the results obtained, the air quality standard in urban areas of Peninsular Malaysia falls within healthy limits to human beings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acarbon monoxide 3acities 3ahumans 3amodels 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3aparticulates 3arisk 3asulfur dioxide 3aurban areas 3aMalaysia1 aRazali, Ahmad Mahir1 aIbrahim, Kamarulzaman1 aLatif, Mohd Talib0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2016 Jan., v. 188, no. 1 p.65-65dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-5070-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007400167300001400241500001900255520129900274592002801573650001001601650001601611650001201627650002701639650001801666700001901684700002101703700002001724773014001744856008101884852000901965655001201974IND60666678320221122113853.0190917e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066667832DNAL7 a10.3103/S00963925190200442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalinina, A. P.10aAntiparkinsonian Action of the Prolyl Endopeptidase Inhibitor in Mice  ap. 69-74.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aProlyl endopeptidase is involved in neurodegeneration, proliferation, neuroinflammation, and neuron differentiation. It has been observed that severity of the neurodegenerative process correlates with an increasing level of prolyl endopeptidase in the brain. According to recent research, prolyl endopeptidase might interact with prion-like proteins, which are believed to play the key role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Consequently, prolyl endopeptidase inhibitors might be a promising group of chemicals to study in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Parkinson’s disease. The aim of this research was to determine the effects of benzyloxycarbonyl-methionyl-2(S)-cyanopyrrolidine, a new inhibitor of prolyl endopeptidase, using haloperidol catalepsy test in SHK outbred mice and Parkinson-like syndrome induced by a single systemic injection of neurotoxic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-tetrahydropiridine at a dose of 30 mg/kg in C57Bl/6 inbred mice. As a result, the compound reduces the severity of the main extrapyramidal symptoms: rigidity and motor deficits. However, anticataleptic activity was not found. According to our results, the prolyl endopeptidase inhibitor does not affect the dopaminergic neurons directly but provides possible neuroprotection to the neurons.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3ahaloperidol 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3aneurotoxicity1 aKapitsa, I.

Their local availability is tightly controlled by several regulators, including deiodinases (Ds). Here we used morpholino technology to explore the roles of Ds during eye development in zebrafish. Transcriptome analysis at 3 days post fertilization (dpf) revealed a pronounced effect of knockdown of both T4-activating Ds (D1D2MO) or knockdown of T3-inactivating D3 (D3bMO) on phototransduction and retinoid recycling. This was accompanied by morphological defects (studied from 1 to 7 dpf) including reduced eye size, disturbed retinal lamination and strong reduction in rods and all four cone types. Defects were more prominent and persistent in D3-deficient fish. Finally, D3-deficient zebrafish larvae had disrupted visual function at 4 dpf and were less sensitive to a light stimulus at 5 dpf. These data demonstrate the importance of TH-activating and -inactivating Ds for correct zebrafish eye development, and point to D3b as a central player.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aeyes 3afish 3agene expression 3alarvae 3aphototransduction 3athyroid hormones 3atranscriptomics 0aThyroid hormone 0aDeiodinase 0aMorpholino knockdown 0aZebrafish 0aDevelopment 0aRetina 0aD 0aD1D2MO 0aD3bMO 0adpf 0ahpf 0aKD 0aMO 0aOKR 0aRES 0aSCMO 0aWIK1 aVergauwen, Lucia1 aBagci, Enise1 aVan houcke, Jolien1 aHeijlen, Marjolein1 aKulemeka, Bernard1 aHyde, David R.1 aKnapen, Dries1 aDarras, Veerle M.0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 424 p.81-93dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2016.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03793naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001800191245013700209300001600346520216200362592002802524650002402552650001302576650003102589650001002620650001602630650002002646650001702666650001802683650002402701650001002725650000902735650001902744650002002763650002002783650002302803650001102826650001802837650003202855700001602887700002402903700001602927700002302943700002102966700001902987773012903006856008403135990002303219852000903242655001203251IND60090024420221120142527.0141110e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009002442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbamcr.2011.01.0122doi7 aPMC30463052pmcid7 a212556172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Hongkuan10aHeterotrimeric Gαᵢ proteins are regulated by lipopolysaccharide and are anti-inflammatory in endotoxemia and polymicrobial sepsis  ap. 466-472.  aPrevious studies have implicated a role of heterotrimeric Gαᵢ proteins in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses. We hypothesized that Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling regulates Gαᵢ proteins, which are anti-inflammatory in endotoxemia and polymicrobial sepsis. RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS and the Gαᵢ–GTP protein complex was immunoprecipitated with a Gαᵢ protein activation assay. In subsequent in vivo studies, the Gαᵢ protein inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTx) or Gᵢ protein agonist mastoparan (MP-7) were administrated prior to endotoxemia. LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and mortality were determined. To examine the role of Gαᵢ₂ in sepsis, Gαᵢ₂ (−/−) and wildtype (WT) mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and monitored every 24 h for 120 h. Other mice were sacrificed 24 h after CLP. Peritoneal fluid, blood, and tissue samples were collected. Plasma pro-inflammatory cytokine production, bacterial load in peritoneal fluid, blood and lung tissue, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lung and liver and different immune cell populations in spleen were studied. We found that Gαᵢ proteins are rapidly activated by LPS followed by rapid inactivation. These studies provide the first direct evidence that Gαᵢ proteins are modulated by TLR signaling. In following studies, PTx augmented LPS-induced plasma TNFα, IL-6, whereas MP-7 suppressed LPS-induced TNFα and decreased LPS-induced mortality. In sepsis studies, the survival rate post-CLP was significantly decreased in the Gαᵢ₂ (−/−) mice compared to WT mice. CLP-induced plasma TNFα, IL-6, bacterial load in peritoneal fluid, blood and lung tissue and lung and liver MPO activity were significantly increased in Gαᵢ₂ (−/−) compared to WT mice. Gαᵢ₂ (−/−) mice also exhibited increased Th1 and Th2 responses compared to WT mice. Taken together, Gαᵢ proteins are activated by LPS and negatively regulate endotoxemia and sepsis. Understanding the role of Gαᵢ₂ protein in regulation of the inflammatory response in sepsis may provide novel targets for treatment of sepsis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptors 3aagonists 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3ablood 3aendotoxemia 3ain vivo studies 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliver 3amice 3amicrobial load 3amyeloperoxidase 3apertussis toxin 3asepsis (infection) 3aspleen 3asurvival rate 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aLi, Pengfei1 aZingarelli, Basilia1 aBorg, Keith1 aHalushka, Perry V.1 aBirnbaumer, Lutz1 aCook, James A.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.

In this study, the effects of organic polymers with different charge density on the removal mechanisms of TCN in coking wastewater are investigated by polyferric sulfate (PFS) with a cationic organic polymer (PFS-C) or a non-ionic polymer (PFS-N). The coagulation experiments results show that residual concentrations of TCN (Fe(CN)3−6) after PFS-C flocculation (TCN < 0.2 mg/L) are much lower than that after PFS-N precipitation. This can be attributed to the different TCN removal mechanisms of the individual organic polymers. To investigate the roles of organic polymers, physical and structural characteristics of the flocs are analyzed by FT-IR, XPS, TEM and XRD. Owing to the presence of N+ in PFS-C, Fe(CN)3−6 and negative flocs (Fe(CN)3−6 adsorbed on ferric hydroxides) can be removed via charge neutralization and electrostatic patch flocculation by the cationic organic polymer. However, non-ionic N in PFS-N barely reacts with cyanides through sweeping or bridging, which indicates that the non-ionic polymer has little influence on TCN removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acoagulation 3acyanides 3aflocculation 3ahydroxides 3airon 3aneutralization 3apolymers 3asulfates 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awastewater 0acationic polymer 0atotal cyanide removal 0acoking wastewater 0acoagulation1 aZhao, He1 aCao, Hongbin1 aZhang, Yi1 aChen, Yongsheng0 tJournal of Environmental Sciences.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 26 p.231-239dElsevier B.V.aThe Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciencesx1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(13)60512-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245019400164300001600358520144500374592002801819650001901847650001501866650000901881650001401890650001801904650001001922650001601932650001801948650001401966650001801980650001601998651001902014700002102033700002402054700001902078700002002097700002102117700002502138700002702163700001602190700001902206700002802225700002002253700002402273773008902297856004802386852000902434655001202443IND4469211820221119164258.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446921182DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-011-0831-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeppesen, Erik10aZooplankton as indicators in lakes: a scientific-based plea for including zooplankton in the ecological quality assessment of lakes according to the European Water Framework Directive (WFD)  ap. 279-297.  aWith the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), the member states have to classify the ecological status of surface waters following standardised procedures. It was a matter of some surprise to lake ecologists that zooplankton were not included as a biological quality element (BQE) despite their being considered to be an important and integrated component of the pelagic food web. To the best of our knowledge, the decision of omitting zooplankton is not wise, and it has resulted in the withdrawal of zooplankton from many so-far-solid monitoring programmes. Using examples from particularly Danish, Estonian, and the UK lakes, we show that zooplankton (sampled from the water and the sediment) have a strong indicator value, which cannot be covered by sampling fish and phytoplankton without a very comprehensive and costly effort. When selecting the right metrics, zooplankton are cost-efficient indicators of the trophic state and ecological quality of lakes. Moreover, they are important indicators of the success/failure of measures taken to bring the lakes to at least good ecological status. Therefore, we strongly recommend the EU to include zooplankton as a central BQE in the WFD assessments, and undertake similar regional calibration exercises to obtain relevant and robust metrics also for zooplankton as is being done at present in the cases of fish, phytoplankton, macrophytes and benthic invertebrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aecologists 3afish 3afood webs 3ainvertebrates 3alakes 3amacrophytes 3aphytoplankton 3asediments 3asurface water 3azooplankton 3aUnited Kingdom1 aNÃµges, Peeter1 aDavidson, Thomas A.1 aHaberman, Juta1 aNÃµges, Tiina1 aBlank, KÃ¤tlin1 aLauridsen, Torben L.1 aSÃ¸ndergaard, Martin1 aSayer, Carl1 aLaugaste, Reet1 aJohansson, Liselotte S.1 aBjerring, Rikke1 aAmsinck, Susanne L.0 tHydrobiologia.g2011 Nov., v. 676, no. 1 p.279-297dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-011-0831-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010500168300001800273520124900291592002801540650002301568650002001591650001201611650001101623650002701634650001101661650001001672650001201682650001701694650001501711650001301726650002201739650001401761650001201775650001501787650001101802650001701813651001301830700001401843773013201857856008201989852000902071655001202080IND60549083720221119211034.0160906e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054908372DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-03-13-0226-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBienapfl, J.

From spring 2010 to 2012, P. japonica ‘Mountain Fire’ plants growing in Maryland nurseries were observed with a high incidence of stem canker, shoot dieback, and blight symptoms. Necrosis was evident on shoot tips and often advanced into lateral shoots, as well as to the crowns, leading to plant death. Phomopsis amygdali, known as a destructive pathogen of peach and almond, was consistently isolated from symptomatic plants. P. amygdali also caused similar symptoms on Mountain Fire test plants following inoculations. P. amygdali was consistently recovered and its identity was confirmed with both morphological and molecular tools, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. In addition, nursery sampling in 2012 revealed that P. amygdali could also be isolated from asymptomatic plants. In all instances, infected plants were shipped from a West Coast nursery, indicating that this pathogen was inadvertently introduced to new locations. P. amygdali may be emerging as an important pathogen in nurseries because this is the first known association of this pathogen with an ornamental plant species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiaporthe amygdali 3aPieris japonica 3aalmonds 3ablight 3abroadleaved evergreens 3acoasts 3adeath 3adieback 3afire testing 3alandscapes 3anecrosis 3aornamental plants 3apathogens 3apeaches 3ashoot tips 3aspring 3astem cankers 3aMaryland1 aBalci, Y.0 tPlant disease.g2013 Nov., v. 97, no. 11 p.1403-1407dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-03-13-0226-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02153naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100001800168245007700186300001600263500000900279500001500288520119100303592002801494650001101522650003701533653001101570700002201581700002001603773012101623852000901744856009801753655001201851991622104500742620221118004154.0191122e196909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7090608892DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1969.0011183X000900050039x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWillis, W.

It is noticeable that many professional chefs working in high-end restaurants have adopted elBulli’s innovation (ideas, practices, cooking style); however, this innovation trend is not so clear among amateur cooks, whose recipes could give us a more accurate idea of people’s food preferences. In this paper, we aim to check whether or not amateur cooks in online recipe communities are also adopting elBulli’s innovation, and if so, at what rate. In particular, we focused on the use of ingredients and cooking techniques. Our methodology is based on machine learning and statistical analysis: firstly, we developed several classifiers that learned the characteristics of creativity in elBulli’s cuisine; secondly, we applied the classifiers to two sets of recipes from Allrecipes and Epicurious, respectively; and lastly, we ran hypothesis tests and compared the results in order to reach an agreement on the rate of adoption of elBulli’s innovation on both platforms with statistical significance. Our key findings are that the recipes on these communities are comparable to the most creative recipes of elBulli in the time spans studied (for which self-presentation may play an important role) but the rate of adoption over time is very slow (we conjecture that it can be due to the lack of rush for innovation on these communities where competitivity is not a real need). We finally propose an extension of the study with the inclusion of demographic data that might be more influential than time on the rate of innovation adoption.  aPublisher supplied data 3acuisine 3agastronomy 3ainnovation adoption 3astatistical analysis 0aelBulli 0aAllrecipes 0aEpicurious 0aSelf-presentation 0aMachine learning1 aSuárez, Juan Luis,0 tInternational journal of gastronomy and food science.g2020 Dec., v. 22 p.100243-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21450x1878-450X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgfs.2020.1002433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011700171300001400288520180000302592002802102650001102130650001302141650002602154650002002180650001402200650001902214650001702233650003202250650002402282650001702306651001002323651000902333653001102342653001002353653001302363653003502376653000902411653002402420700002202444700003002466773010702496856008202603852000902685655001202694IND60621861720221118183056.0181121e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062186172DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826507028001092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgnie-Teta, Ismael10aRisk Factors for Moderate to Severe Anemia among Children in Benin and Mali: Insights from a Multilevel Analysis  ap. 76-89.  aAnemia currently affects 2 billion people throughout the world. Although the immediate causes of anemia among children are known (including malnutrition and infections), the importance of contextual determinants and their relationships with individual effects have rarely been explored. To identify anemia risk factors at the individual, household, and community levels among Beninese and Malian children, using simple and multilevel regression methods. An analysis was undertaken of nationally representative data collected in 2001 in Benin (n = 2,284) and Mali (n = 2,826) by the Demographic and Health Surveys. Sixteen potential risk factors for anemia were considered at the individual, household, and community levels. Comparative analyses were carried out using simple and multilevel logistic regression models. Simple and multilevel logistic regression analyses yielded broadly similar results. Risk factors for moderate to severe anemia included incomplete immunization, stunted growth, recent infection, absence of bednet, low household living standard, rural residency (Mali), low maternal education, and low community development index (Benin). In addition, multilevel analysis indicated a clustering level of anemia in communities (intraclass correlation) of 14% and 19% in Benin and Mali, respectively. Risk factors for child anemia appeared at all three levels (individual, household and community). Community-level clustering seemed to be low. Therefore, interventions to address anemia need not be village- or region-specific. Identifying a successful and replicable program is now a priority in child survival endeavors. It is likely that such a program would include a focus on improving immunization coverage, increased bednet usage, and reduced protein–energy malnutrition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanemia 3achildren 3acommunity development 3adata collection 3aeducation 3ahealth surveys 3aimmunization 3aprotein energy malnutrition 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3aBenin 3aMali 0aAnemia 0aBenin 0achildren 0ademographic and health surveys 0aMali 0amultilevel analysis1 aReceveur, Olivier1 aKuate Defo, Barthélémy,0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 28, no. 1 p.76-89dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1564826507028001093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100003000142245013600172300001600308520136400324592002801688650001201716650002501728650002501753650001501778650001401793650001101807650001001818650001801828650001001846650001501856653002001871653002001891653001401911653001101925653001301936700002801949700002201977700003201999700002802031773012402059856007802183852000902261655001202270IND60130401720221119224258.0151127e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013040172DNAL7 a10.2983/035.031.03212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReynoso-Granados, Teodoro10aSettlement and Early Nursery of Juvenile Anadara grandis (Pelecypoda: Arcidae) Under Different Conditions at the Hatchery and Ponds  ap. 769-775.  aFifteen-day pediveliger larvae of Anadara grandis (shell length, 230 ± 20 µm (mean ± SD, n = 20) were cultivated up to the juvenile stage by testing 2 densities: 71 larvae/cm² and 283 larvae/cm² for 37 days. During this time, we registered morphological changes of the larvae from pediveliger up to the juvenile stage, as well as absolute growth, and growth and survival rates. The growth rate was 53.5 µm/day at a density of 71 larvae/cm², with a survival of 60%; at a density of 283 larvae/cm², the growth rate was 33.6 µm/day, with a survival of 40%. Subsequently, the juveniles obtained were nursed for 57 days in 2 types of experimental units: Nestier trays suspended in a pond and cylindrical upwelling containers with increasing water flow in the laboratory. In each experimental unit we cultured 66,666 juveniles with a shell length of 1.57 ± 0.05 mm (n = 20). In the Nestier trays, growth was 4–6 µm/day, with a survival of 15%. In the upwelling-type units, growth was 5–6 µm/day, with a survival of 93%. ANOVA revealed significant differences (P < 0.05) in juvenile growth between the Nestier trays and the upwelling-type containers. Low juvenile survival in Nestier trays is attributed to clogging with wind-blown slime.

Ewes carrying singletons (n = 6) or twins (n = 7) were selected. Hematocrit, progesterone (P₄) and estradiol-17β (E₂) concentrations were analyzed. Blood flow of the umbilical artery (UBF) was assessed through Doppler ultrasonography. Ewes carrying twins had a decreased (p = 0.03) hematocrit. There was a tendency (p = 0.08) for ewes carrying twins to have increased P4 from day 20 to 40. From day 50 to 70, P₄ tended to be increased (p = 0.07) and E₂ was increased (p = 0.01) in ewes carrying twins. From day 90 to 120, ewes carrying twins had greater (p ≤ 0.04) P₄. Ewes carrying twins had increased (p < 0.01) P₄ and tended to have (p = 0.06) increased E₂. From day 60 until 110, placentomes from twins were larger (p ≤ 0.05). On day 50, UBF was greater (p = 0.04; 27.38 vs. 20.95 ± 1.99 ml/min) in twins. It has been suggested that physiological adaptations during early pregnancy can significantly impact fetal development in multiple offspring carrying ewes. Our findings suggest that increased umbilical artery blood flow early in gestation, associated with increased maternal concentrations of P₄ and E₂, and decreased hematocrit (related to plasma volume) could contribute to those adaptations.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood flow 3ablood plasma 3aconceptus 3aewes 3afetal development 3afetus 3ahematocrit 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3aprogesterone 3asteroid hormones 3atwins 3aultrasonography 3aumbilical arteries 0aSheep 0atwins 0aplacenta 0aumbilical hemodynamics 0ablood flow1 aPerry, George A.1 aVonnahme, Kimberly Ann0 tReproductive Biology.g2020 June, v. 20, no. 2 p.132-139dElsevier B.V.aSociety for Biology of Reproduction & the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences in OlsztynwJournal:23206x1642-431X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.repbio.2020.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03266naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002500113040001800138100002000156245009100176300001600267520139800283592002801681650001701709650001901726650002501745650001801770650002201788650002201810650001001832650001801842650001801860650002401878650000901902650002701911650001101938650004101949650003701990650001202027650003702039650003002076650003402106650001102140650005802151650003002209650004802239650003702287650003302324650000902357650001602366650005302382653001302435653001002448653001602458700002002474773011102494856003802605852000902643655001202652IND50062710420221118202300.0130323s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006271042DNAL7 a230213222pmid7 a10.1071/RD121342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcFee, Renee M.10aVascular contributions to early ovarian development: potential roles of VEGFA isoforms  ap. 333-342.  aVascularisation is an essential component of ovarian morphogenesis; however, little is known regarding factors regulating the establishment of vasculature in the ovary. Angiogenesis involving extensive endothelial cell migration is a critical component of vessel formation in the embryonic testis but vasculogenic mechanisms appear to play a prominent role in ovarian vascularisation. Vasculature has a strong influence on the formation of ovarian structures, and the early developmental processes of ovigerous cord formation, primordial follicle assembly and follicle activation are all initiated in regions of the ovary that are in close association with the highly vascular medulla. The principal angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), has an important role in both endothelial cell differentiation and vascular pattern development. Expression of VEGFA has been localised to ovigerous cords and follicles in developing ovaries and an increased expression of pro-angiogenic Vegfa isoform mRNA in relation to anti-angiogenic isoform mRNA occurs at the same time-point as the peak of primordial follicle assembly in perinatal rats. Elucidation of specific genes that affect vascular development within the ovary may be critical for determining not only the normal mechanisms of ovarian morphogenesis, but also for understanding certain ovarian reproductive disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3aanimal ovaries 3acell differentiation 3acell movement 3aearly development 3aendothelial cells 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3amorphogenesis 3aovarian development 3arats 3areproductive disorders 3atestes 3avascular endothelial growth factor A 2aAlternative Splicingxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aCell Differentiationxphysiology 2aCell Movementxphysiology 2aEndothelial Cellsxphysiology 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxphysiology 2aMorphogenesisxphysiology 2aNeovascularization, Physiologicxphysiology 2aOvaryxblood supplyxembryology. 2aProtein Isoformsxmetabolism 2aRats 2aSex Factors 2aVascular Endothelial Growth Factor Axmetabolism 0afollicle 0aovary 0avasculature1 aCupp, Andrea S.0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2013, v. 25, no. 2 p.333-342dCSIRO Publishingx1031-36137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RD12134  aDNAL 7aarticle01721naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245012900160300001400289520056100303592002800864650002300892650001100915650001900926650002200945650001600967650002300983653002201006653003501028653002101063653002201084653002301106700001601129773012501145856008001270852000901350655001201359IND60626785420221119051327.0201127e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062678542DNAL7 a10.2478/ausal-2018-00042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCsapó, J.10aMethods and procedures for reducing soy trypsin inhibitor activity by means of heat treatment combined with chemical methods  ap. 58-80.  aWe have developed a new procedure for reducing soy trypsin inhibitor activity by means of heat treatment combined with chemical methods, through which soy trypsin inhibitor activity decreases to the tenth or twentieth part of the original value.

Sediments from a growing islet in the lower reach of Yangtze River as well as the suspended particles in the surrounding river water were used to identify anthropogenic influence on the magnetic susceptibility (MS) of the Yangtze River sediment. Results show that newly deposited sediments in 2004 have significantly higher MS (~150×10⁻⁸m³ kg⁻¹) on average than that of the ancient deposit (~50×10⁻⁸m³ kg⁻¹). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) of the extracted magnetic particles from newly deposited sediments and fly ash samples indicates large contribution of fly ash for the samples with elevated MS. Dependence of MS on grain size is evident, which enable calculation of the MS of suspended particles from river sediment. A value of 32×10⁻⁸m³ kg⁻¹is inferred for the suspended particles in ancient Yangtze River. The records from 2004 to 2010 indicate progressive increase in the MS of the suspended particles in Yangtze River from 67 to 96×10⁻⁸m³ kg⁻¹, which is much higher than that of the ancient. Mass balance calculation based on the increasing MS suggests that at least 7% of the fly ash produced within the catchment of Yangtze River was released into the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3afly ash 3amagnetic properties 3apollution 3ariver water 3arivers 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asediment deposition 3asediments 3asoil properties 3awatersheds 3aYangtze River1 aLi, Gaojun1 aJi, Junfeng0 tCatena.g2011 Oct., v. 87, no. 1 p.141-146dElsevier B.V.x0341-81627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2011.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245008600167500001900253520105100272592002801323650002001351650001801371650002001389650001601409650001501425650001101440650001701451650001001468650001301478653002301491653001101514653001201525653001601537653001301553653002401566700005301590773013301643856008401776852000901860655001201869IND60705689120221119055613.0210322e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070568912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijgfs.2020.1002462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehmood, Arif10aEffects of different cooking techniques on bioactive contents of leafy vegetables  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDomestic cooking is based on common techniques, which include boiling, microwaving, frying, and steaming. Most leafy vegetables are commonly consumed after cooking which may improve palatability by softening the food matrix, inactivate the anti-nutritional compounds, and toxic materials. However, cooking may or may not affect the bioavailability of the vital compounds like phenolic compounds, carotenoids, and ascorbic acid contents of vegetables. In this review, the available literature revealed that steaming is safer way of cooking in terms of retention of bioactive contents of vegetables as compared to boiling, frying, and microwaving. The boiling method has a very adverse effect on bioactive contents, especially on ascorbic acid contents. Microwaving and frying have moderate effects on bioactive contents of vegetables, however, the frying technique may improve the lutein (more than 60%) and β-carotene. Among the cooking techniques, a safer technique should be adopted, with priority on taste, and safety of the leafy vegetables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aascorbic acid 3abioavailability 3afood matrix 3agastronomy 3alutein 3apalatability 3ataste 3atoxicity 0aCooking techniques 0aFrying 0aBoiling 0aMicrowaving 0aSteaming 0aBioactive compounds1 aZeb, Alam1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6849-376X0 tInternational journal of gastronomy and food science.g2020 Dec., v. 22 p.100246-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21450x1878-450X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgfs.2020.1002463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03054naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245012100173300001400294520173400308592002802042650001902070650001502089650001502104650001702119650001702136650001302153650002002166650001102186650001702197650001202214650001502226650001802241650001602259651001102275653001702286653002802303653001102331653001802342700002002360700001802380773010702398856008202505852000902587655001202596IND60621861820221118183601.0181121e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062186182DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826507028001102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBezner Kerr, Rachel,10aBreastfeeding and Mixed Feeding Practices in Malawi: Timing, Reasons, Decision Makers, and Child Health Consequences  ap. 90-99.  aIn order to effectively promote exclusive breastfeeding, it is important to first understand who makes child-care and child-feeding decisions, and why those decisions are made; as in most parts of the world, exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months of age is uncommon in Malawi. To characterize early infant foods in rural northern Malawi, who the decision-makers are, their motivation, and the consequences for child growth, in order to design a more effective program for improved child health and nutrition. In a rural area of northern Malawi, 160 caregivers of children 6 to 48 months of age were asked to recall the child's age at introduction of 19 common early infant foods, who decided to introduce the food, and why. The heights and weights of the 160 children were measured. Sixty-five percent of the children were given food in their first month, and only 4% of the children were exclusively breastfed for 6 months. Mzuwula and dawale (two herbal infusions), water, and porridge were common early foods. Grandmothers introduced mzuwula to protect the children from illness; other foods were usually introduced by mothers or grandmothers in response to perceived hunger. The early introduction of porridge and dawale, but not mzuwula, was associated with worse anthropometric status. Mzuwula, which is not associated with poor growth, is usually made with boiled water and given in small amounts. Conversely, porridge, which is associated with poor child growth, is potentially contaminated and is served in larger amounts, which would displace breastmilk. Promoters of exclusive breastfeeding should target their messages to appropriate decision makers and consider targeting foods that are most harmful to child growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast feeding 3acaregivers 3achild care 3achild growth 3achild health 3achildren 3adecision making 3ahunger 3ainfant foods 3amothers 3amotivation 3apublic health 3arural areas 3aMalawi 0aChild growth 0aexclusive breastfeeding 0amalawi 0amixed feeding1 aBerti, Peter R.1 aChirwa, Marko0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 28, no. 1 p.90-99dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1564826507028001103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013100170500002200301500002200323520170500345592002802050650001402078650002102092650001902113650001702132650001102149650002502160650001902185650001902204650002402223650001002247650002102257650001302278650001602291650001502307650000902322650001802331650002702349650001202376653001702388653004002405653002502445653001602470653002102486700001802507700001902525700001302544700002002557700001802577700001902595773008902614856008402703852000902787655001202796IND60613730820221120070722.0180914s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061373082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2015.02.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShangguan, Lulu10aInvestigation of bi-enzymatic reactor based on hybrid monolith with nanoparticles embedded and its proteolytic characteristics  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aThe bottom-up strategy of proteomic profiling study based on mass spectrometer (MS) has drawn high attention. However, conventional solution-based digestion could not satisfy the demands of highly efficient and complete high throughput proteolysis of complex samples. We proposed a novel bi-enzymatic reactor by immobilizing two different enzymes (trypsin/chymotrypsin) onto a mixed support of hybrid organic–inorganic monolith with SBA-15 nanoparticles embedded. Typsin and chymotrypsin were crossly immobilized onto the mixed support by covalent bonding onto the monolith with glutaraldehyde as bridge reagent and chelation via copper ion onto the nanoparticles, respectively. Compared with single enzymatic reactors, the bi-enzymatic reactor improved the overall functional analysis of membrane proteins of rat liver by doubling the number of identified peptides (from 1184/1010 with trypsin/chymotrypsin enzymatic reactors to 2891 with bi-enzymatic reactor), which led to more proteins identified with deep coverage (from 452/336 to 620); the efficiency of the bi-enzymatic reactor is also better than that of solution-based tandem digestion, greatly shorting the digestion time from 24h to 50s. Moreover, more transmembrane proteins were identified by bi-enzymatic reactor (106) compared with solution-based tandem digestion (95) with the same two enzymes and enzymatic reactors with single enzyme immobilized (75 with trypsin and 66 with chymotrypsin). The proteolytic characteristics of the bi-enzymatic reactors were evaluated by applying them to digestion of rat liver proteins. The reactors showed good digestion capability for proteins with different hydrophobicity and molecular weight.  aPublisher supplied data 3achelation 3achemical bonding 3achromatography 3achymotrypsin 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3aglutaraldehyde 3ahydrophobicity 3aimmobilized enzymes 3aliver 3amolecular weight 3apeptides 3aproteolysis 3aproteomics 3arats 3aspectrometers 3atransmembrane proteins 3atrypsin 0aNanoparticle 0aHybrid organic–inorganic monolith 0aBi-enzymatic reactor 0aProteolysis 0aMembrane protein1 aZhang, Lingyi1 aXiong, Zhichao1 aRen, Jun1 aZhang, Runsheng1 aGao, Fangyuan1 aZhang, Weibing0 tJournal of chromatography.g2015, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2015.02.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02372naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001700180245008000197300002000277506007600297520129700373592002801670506003701698650001101735650002101746650001101767650001301778700001601791700002201807773012101829856007501950852000902025655001202034IND60550290520221207050150.0160910e20141107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055029052DNAL7 a10.1021/jo501694h2doi7 aPMC42275692pmcid7 a253295282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Wenjun10aβ-Amino Esters from the Reductive Ring Opening of Aziridine-2-carboxylates  ap. 10068-10080.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA general study is undertaken to examine the scope of the reductive ring opening of aziridine-2-carboxylates with samarium diiodide. The competition between C–C and C–N bond cleavage is examined as a function of the nature of the N-substituent of the aziridine, the nature of the substituent in the 3-position of the aziridine, and whether the substituent in the 3-position is in a cis or trans relationship with the carboxylate in the 2-position. The desired C–N bond cleavage leads to β-amino esters that are the predominant products for most aziridines with an N-activating group. However, C–C cleavage products are observed with an aryl group in the 3-position; this can be particularly pronounced with cis-aziridines where a nearly equal mixture of the two is observed. Exclusive formation of the C–N cleavage product is observed for all aziridines with the strongly N-activating p-toluene sulfonate group. Similarly high selectivity is observed for the 2-trimethylsilylethyl sulfonate group (SES), which is easier to remove. The utility of these methods is illustrated in the synthesis of protected forms of (R)-β³-DOPA and l-DOPA from the same aziridine, the former by SmI₂-mediated reductive opening at C-2 and the latter by palladium-mediated reductive opening at C-3.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aL-dopa 3achemical bonding 3aesters 3asamarium1 aLu, Zhenjie1 aWulff, William D.0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2014 Nov. 07, v. 79, no. 21 p.10068-10080dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo501694h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245009200181300001600273520123700289592002801526650002201554650002201576650001101598650001301609650001701622650001701639650000701656650001401663650003001677650001601707650002401723650003701747700003901784700002901823700003501852700003501887773013501922856008702057852000902144655001202153IND60637933120221122084841.0190606e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063793312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.04.1662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHudson, Eliara Acipreste10aCurcumin-micellar casein multisite interactions elucidated by surface plasmon resonance  ap. 860-866.  aDetermine the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of interaction between micellar casein (MC) and curcumin (CUR) is useful for the application of MC-CUR systems in food products. We used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry (UV–vis) to study the complex formation between MC obtained from skimmed milk and CUR, MC carrying capacity, and thermal protection for CUR at a pH of 6.6. An MC could carry about 18,000 molecules of CUR. SPR suggested an enthalpy-driven process (∆H° = −64.63 kJ∙mol−1 and T∆S° ranging from −42.45 to −44.46 kJ∙mol−1). Temperature increased reduced the rate of MC-CUR complex formation and increased its dissociation rate. The activation energy for the formation of MC-CUR activated complexes was negative for association of free MC and CUR molecules (−62.8 kJ mol−1) and positive for dissociation of the thermodynamically stable complexes (1.80 kJ mol−1). MC protected the CUR against its thermal degradation when it was subjected to different temperatures (30, 40, 50, and 60 °C for 5.5 h). This study shows the importance of characterizing MC-small molecules interactions for better application of MC as a nanocarrier.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acarrying capacity 3acasein 3acurcumin 3adissociation 3ananocarriers 3apH 3askim milk 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 ade Paula, Hauster Maximiler Campos1 ada Silva, Richard Marins1 aPires, Ana Clarissa dos Santos1 ada Silva, Luis Henrique Mendes0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 July 15, v. 133 p.860-866dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.04.1663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03743naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245023500169300001600404520195700420592002802377650002202405650001002427650001002437650001002447650000902457650001902466650002202485650001502507650000902522650001202531650002002543650001602563650001202579650000902591650001802600650001002618650002502628650001302653650001302666650002002679650001702699650001802716650002102734653003702755653004302792653003102835653000802866653001702874700002302891700002002914700002202934773010602956856008203062852000903144655001203153IND60709331020221117005810.0210209e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070933102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.psj.2019.10.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMwaniki, Zipporah10aComplete replacement of soybean meal with defatted black soldier fly larvae meal in Shaver White hens feeding program (28–43 wks of age): impact on egg production, egg quality, organ weight, and apparent retention of components  ap. 959-965.  aEffects of total replacement of soybean meal (SBM) with defatted black soldier fly larvae meal (BSFLM) on egg production and quality, organ weight, and apparent retention (AR) of components were investigated in Shaver White hens from 28 to 43 wk of age. A total of 108 birds, (6 birds/cage) were assigned to three diets (6 replicates/diet). Diets were control corn–SBM diet and two additional diets made with the addition of either 10 or 15% BSFLM. Diets met or exceeded breeder specifications, contained TiO₂ as an indigestible marker, and were prepared in pellet form. Birds had free access to feed and water throughout the experiment. Hen-day egg production (HDEP) was monitored daily. Feed intake (FI) and body weight (BW) were monitored in 4-wk intervals. All eggs laid on the sixth day of wks 31, 35, 39, and 43 were used for egg weight (EW), Haugh units (HU), yolk color (YC), shell breaking strength (SBS), and shell thickness (ST). Excreta samples were collected for 3 consecutive days on wk 33 for AR and two birds/cage were necropsied at the end. There were no (P > 0.05) diet effects on HDEP, FI, and HU. Inclusion of BSFLM linearly decreased (P < 0.05) egg mass and feed conversion ratio (FCR) and quadratically increased (P < 0.05) BW. There was no (P > 0.05) interaction between diet and sampling time point on egg quality parameters. Inclusion of BSFLM increased SBF and YC linearly (P < 0.05) and ST quadratically (P = 0.028). Inclusion of BSFLM quadratically (P ≤ 0.01) reduced empty ceca weight and increased liver weight and had no effect (P > 0.05) on gizzard, small intestine, and pancreas weights. Feeding BSFLM linearly (P = 0.001) and quadratically (P = 0.007) increased apparent metabolizable energy (AME). Data showed that defatted BSFLM resulted in deeper orange yolks and improved eggshell quality; however, unfavorable FCR linked to lighter eggs as well as heavier birds and liver warrants further investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHermetia illucens 3acages 3acecum 3acolor 3adiet 3aegg production 3aegg shell quality 3aegg weight 3aeggs 3aexcreta 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3agizzard 3ahens 3ainsect larvae 3aliver 3ametabolizable energy 3anecropsy 3apancreas 3asmall intestine 3asoybean meal 3atissue weight 3atitanium dioxide 0aapparent retention of components 0adefatted black soldier fly larvae meal 0aegg production and quality 0aFCR 0aorgan weight1 aShoveller, Anna K.1 aHuber, Lee-Anne1 aKiarie, Elijah G.0 tPoultry science.g2020 Feb., v. 99, no. 2 p.959-965dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2019.10.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03299naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245013500160300001800295520169700313592002802010596003702038650001102075650001802086650002802104650001802132650001702150650002502167650001502192650001302207650002102220650001102241650002002252650002302272650002802295650003802323650001802361650001902379650002402398650000902422650002802431650001502459650001702474700001302491700001802504700001502522700001702537773012402554856008202678852000902760655001202769IND60613517620221120125017.0190722e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061351762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-018-4252-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, J,10aEffects of low-density lipoprotein docosahexaenoic acid nanoparticles on cancer stem cells isolated from human hepatoma cell lines  ap. 1023-1036.  aDocosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid with anti-cancer properties. Recently, DHA packaged within low-density lipoprotein (LDL) nanoparticles (LDL–DHA) was demonstrated to be effective in a murine model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of tumor cells that are resistant to most cancer therapies and thereby, contribute to tumor recurrences. To determine whether LDL–DHA is effective against CSCs derived from human HCC cell lines and tumor bearing rats. Epithelial cellular adhesion molecule positive and CD133 negative (EpCAM⁺CD133⁻) CSCs were isolated from HuH-7 and HepG2 human HCC lines and exposed to varying concentrations (1–60 µM) of LDL–DHA nanoparticles for 0–72 h. HCC tumor bearing rats were treated with 2 mg/kg LDL–DHA nanoparticles for 3 days. Regardless of the cell line employed, LDL–DHA nanoparticles achieved 70–100% killing of EpCAM⁺CD133⁻ CSCs at a concentration of 40 µM after 48 h of exposure while DHA and LDL alone had minimal or no cytotoxic effects. Similar results were obtained with LDL–DHA nanoparticle treatment of EpCAM⁻CD133⁻ adult cancer cells (ACCs). In keeping with these findings were similar levels of low density lipoprotein receptor expression and LDL–DHA nanoparticle induced lipid peroxidation activity and reactive oxygen species in the CSC and ACC populations. However, differences in sensitivity to LDL–DHA treatment were observed in vivo experiments where LDL–DHA nanoparticle treated tumors had a higher percent of surviving CSCs relative to ACCs. Further research on LDL–DHA nanoparticle therapy for human HCC is warranted.  aPublisher supplied data  a41968cCanadian Liver Foundation 3aadults 3aanimal models 3aantineoplastic activity 3acell adhesion 3acytotoxicity 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aepithelium 3ahepatoma 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3ain vivo studies 3alipid peroxidation 3alow density lipoprotein 3alow density lipoprotein receptors 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3arats 3areactive oxygen species 3astem cells 3atherapeutics1 aGong, Y.1 aSontag, D.

The further development of viable p-wafer cells would open many industrial photovoltaic options. Here, the role of the interface defects density and the bandgap of the back surface field of p-type silicon heterojunction solar cells have been investigated in detail to provide guidelines for achieving high performance. The result indicates that the output characteristics of the heterojunction solar cells are sensitive to the density of interface defects (Dᵢₜ) at both sides of the c-Si surface. However, the output parameters primarily affected by Dᵢₜ at the front and rear side are not identical. Back surface field (BSF), which aims to reduce photo-generated carriers' recombination at the rear interface, has also been optimized by adjusting the bandgap to improve the collection efficiency. Finally, based on experimental results, we propose that the conversion efficiency of p-type silicon heterojunction solar cells could be increased beyond 23% by efficiently regulating the bifacial Dᵢₜ and the bandgap of the BSF layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aguidelines 3asilicon 3asolar cells1 aGao, Yanbo1 aPang, Zhenyu1 aYang, Lili1 aYang, Jinghai0 tRSC advances.g2017 May 19, v. 7, no. 43 p.26776-26782dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra04018k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245015900168300001600327520132500343592002801668650002001696650002101716650000901737650002001746650002201766650002101788650000901809650001101818650002801829650001001857650001501867650001601882650002101898650002101919650001501940650000901955653001101964653002101975653002201996653000902018653002202027700001802049700001402067700001702081700001802098700001602116700001702132700001702149773011902166856008802285852000902373655001202382IND60623293720221118165320.0190325e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062329372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.2972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Meng10aBiotransformation and bioconcentration of 6:2 and 8:2 polyfluoroalkyl phosphate diesters in common carp (Cyprinus carpio): Underestimated ecological risks  ap. 201-208.  aPolyfluoroalkyl phosphates esters (PAPs) are widely used in a variety of commercial products, and have been detected in many aquatic organisms. In this study, common carps (Cyprinus carpio) were administered with 6:2 and 8:2 diPAP in water to investigate their bio-accumulation and transformation in fish. Several degradation products, including fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acids (6:2 and 8:2 FTUCA), 5:3 and 7:3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acids (5:3 and 7:3 FTCA), perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) were identified in the carp liver. In addition, several phase-II metabolites, such as glutathione- and glucuronide-conjugated compounds were detected in the carp bile. 8:2 diPAP displayed lower accumulation potential than 6:2 diPAP probably due to its relatively large molecular size. However, 8:2 diPAP experienced more extensive transformation (transformation rate 6.78–14.6 mol%) and produced more phase I metabolites than 6:2 diPAP (0.49–0.66 mol%). The in vitro incubation with the liver S9 fraction confirmed that biotransformation of 6:2 and 8:2 diPAP took place in the carp liver. Further analyses of enzyme activities indicated that acid phosphatase (ACP) could be involved in mediating phase I while glutathione S-transferase (GST) involved in phase II metabolism of 6:2 and 8:2 diPAP in carp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3aacid phosphatase 3abile 3abioaccumulation 3abiotransformation 3acarboxylic acids 3acarp 3aesters 3aglutathione transferase 3aliver 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amolecular weight 3aperfluorocarbons 3aphosphates 3arisk 0adiPAPs 0aBioconcentration 0aBiotransformation 0aCarp 0aEnzyme activities1 aGuo, Tingting1 aHe, Keyan1 aZhu, Lingyan1 aJin, Hangbiao1 aWang, Qiang1 aLiu, Menglin1 aYang, Liping0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 656 p.201-208dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.2973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03410naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245015800211520159600369592002801965650001601993650002202009650002502031650002702056650002602083650000902109650001402118650003102132650002902163650002502192650001702217650001702234650001102251650001402262650001002276650002302286650001802309650001002327650001202337650001102349650003502360650001302395650001302408650000702421650002702428650001602455650001802471653002502489653001902514653003902533653004502572773012302617856008302740852000902823655001202832IND60749997220221121154058.0220103e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074999722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2021.1021502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Ghonemy, Dina H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4233-587210aAntioxidant and antimicrobial activities of exopolysaccharides produced by a novel Aspergillus sp. DHE6 under optimized submerged fermentation conditions  aMicrobial exopolysaccharides are biomacromolecules that are known for their significant importance. Fungal exopolysaccharides are widely utilized in different biotechnological applications such as pharmaceuticals, medicine, cosmetics and food. In this study, fifty fungal isolates were screened for their exopolysaccharides production under submerged fermentation. A novel Aspergillus sp. DHE6 was found to be the best exopolysaccharides producer, with a yield of 7.2 ± 0.24 g/L. Optimization of culture conditions increased exopolysaccharides yield by 3.6-fold (26.1 ± 0.42 g/L). The optimal incubation temperature, initial medium pH, incubation period and the rate of agitation were 30 °C, 6.0, ten days and 150 rpm, respectively. The best carbon and nitrogen sources were glucose at 40 g/L and yeast extract at 1.5 g/L, respectively. Exopolysaccharides were partially purified from Aspergillus sp. DHE6 and characterized using FT-IR-spectrum. Major functional groups were –OH, –CH, –CC, and C–O–C. The partially purified Aspergillus sp. DHE6 exopolysaccharides exhibited excellent antioxidant activity with median effective concentration (EC₅₀) of 573.6 μg/mL using DPPH radical scavenging assay. Agar diffusion assay showed that exopolysaccharide exhibited strong antibacterial activity against the tested hazardous human pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bordetella pertussis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Therefore, these results suggest the suitabilility of Aspergillus sp. DHE6 exopolysaccharides for medical purposes and food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aBacillus subtilis 3aBordetella pertussis 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aagar 3aagitation 3aagricultural biotechnology 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abiocatalysis 3acarbon 3acosmetics 3adrugs 3aexopolysaccharides 3afood industry 3afungi 3aglucose 3ahumans 3amedian effective concentration 3amedicine 3anitrogen 3apH 3asubmerged fermentation 3atemperature 3ayeast extract 0aAspergillus sp.

Feedbacks explain about two times more variance in transient climate response across the models than ocean heat uptake efficiency. Cloud feedbacks can clearly be identified as the main source of inter-model spread. Models with strong longwave feedbacks in the tropics feature substantial increases in cloud ice around the tropopause suggestive of changes in cloud-top heights. The lifting of the tropical tropopause goes together with a general weakening of the tropical circulation. Distinctive inter-model differences in cloud shortwave feedbacks occur in the subtropics including the equatorward flanks of the storm-tracks. Related cloud fraction changes are not confined to low clouds but comprise middle level clouds as well. A reduction in relative humidity through the lower and mid troposphere can be identified as being the main associated large-scale feature. Experiments with prescribed sea surface temperatures are analyzed in order to investigate whether the diagnosed feedbacks from the transient climate simulations contain a tropospheric adjustment component that is not conveyed through the surface temperature response. The strengths of the climate feedbacks computed from atmosphere-only experiments with prescribed increases in sea surface temperatures, but fixed CO₂concentrations, are close to the ones derived from the transient experiment. Only the cloud shortwave feedback exhibits discernible differences which, however, can not unequivocally be attributed to tropospheric adjustment to CO₂. Although for some models a tropospheric adjustment component is present in the global mean shortwave cloud feedback, an analysis of spatial patterns does not lend support to the view that cloud feedbacks are dominated by their tropospheric adjustment part. Nevertheless, there is positive correlation between the strength of tropospheric adjustment processes and cloud feedbacks across different climate models.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aheat 3aice 3arelative humidity 3asubtropics 3asurface temperature 3atropics 3atropopause 3avariance1 aGeoffroy, Olivier1 aDufresne, Jean-Louis1 aIdelkadi, Abderrahmane1 aCagnazzo, Chiara1 aBlock, Karoline1 aMauritsen, Thorsten1 aGiorgetta, Marco1 aQuaas, Johannes0 tClimate dynamics.g2013 Dec., v. 41, no. 11-12 p.3103-3126dSpringer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-013-1682-33Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001700159245007100176300001600247500000900263520153700272592002801809650001601837650003001853650001901883650001201902650001801914650002901932650001801961650002301979650001502002650001602017650000902033650001002042650001902052650002702071650002202098650001602120650002202136650001802158650002502176650002302201650003802224650003302262650001702295650002102312650004202333650002802375651001102403651001102414700001902425773019202444852000902636856007702645655001202722IND4430884020221120043233.0191028e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443088402DNAL7 a200483052pmid7 a10.2134/jeq2009.00982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuo, Yi-Ming10aDynamic Factor Analysis for Estimating Ground Water Arsenic Trends  ap. 176-184.  aepub  aDrinking ground water containing high arsenic (As) concentrations has been associated with blackfoot disease and the occurrence of cancer along the southwestern coast of Taiwan. As a result, 28 ground water observation wells were installed to monitor the ground water quality in this area. Dynamic factor analysis (DFA) is used to identify common trends that represent unexplained variability in ground water As concentrations of decommissioned wells and to investigate whether explanatory variables (total organic carbon [TOC], As, alkalinity, ground water elevation, and rainfall) affect the temporal variation in ground water As concentration. The results of the DFA show that rainfall dilutes As concentration in areas under aquacultural and agricultural use. Different combinations of geochemical variables (As, alkalinity, and TOC) of nearby monitoring wells affected the As concentrations of the most decommissioned wells. Model performance was acceptable for 11 wells (coefficient of efficiency >0.50), which represents 52% (11/21) of the decommissioned wells. Based on DFA results, we infer that surface water recharge may be effective for diluting the As concentration, especially in the areas that are relatively far from the coastline. We demonstrate that DFA can effectively identify the important factors and common effects representing unexplained variability common to decommissioned wells on As variation in ground water and extrapolate information from existing monitoring wells to the nearby decommissioned wells.  aPublisher supplied data 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3adrinking water 3aarsenic 3apublic health 3aenvironmental monitoring 3awater quality 3atemporal variation 3aalkalinity 3awater table 3arain 3awells 3aorganic matter 3achemical concentration 3aagricultural land 3aaquaculture 3ahydrologic models 3asurface water 3agroundwater recharge 2aArsenicxchemistry 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFactor Analysis, Statistical 2aTime Factors 2aWaterxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistry 2aWater Supplyxanalysis. 3aTaiwan 0aTaiwan1 aChang, Fi-John0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2010 Jan., v. 39, no. 1 p.176-184dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2009.00983Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02883naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245021600169520128500385592002801670650001901698650001901717650001501736650001501751650002201766650002101788650001201809650002301821650000901844650001401853650002601867650001101893650002001904650001201924650002001936650001001956653001501966653002001981653001402001653001102015653003502026653002202061653001102083653001102094700001502105700001402120700001502134773011202149856008302261852000902344655001202353IND60675613420221120073605.0200719e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067561342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2019.1118372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWestmacott, K.L.10aNovel, rapid, low-cost screen-printed (bio)sensors for the direct analysis of boar taint compounds androstenone and skatole in porcine adipose tissue: Comparison with a high-resolution gas chromatographic method  aThis is the first report on the fabrication, characterisation and application of an electrochemical (bio)sensor system for the simultaneous measurement of skatole and androstenone. A biosensor for androstenone was fabricated using a Meldola's Blue modified SPCE (MB-SPCE) by depositing NADH and the enzyme 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase onto the MB-SPCE surface; samples of adipose tissue were analysed using the biosensors in conjunction with chronoamperometry. Cyclic voltammetry was used to investigate the electrochemical behaviour of skatole at a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE vs. Ag/AgCl). An oxidation peak was observed around +0.55 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and differential pulse voltammetry was applied for quantification of skatole in adipose tissue (in-situ). Quantitative analysis was achieved using calibration plots obtained from fortified meat samples. The concentrations obtained by the electrochemical and gas chromatographic (GC) methods demonstrated a good positive correlation. The (bio)sensor system completed both measurements within 60 s, as compared to several hours for GC, and at a considerably reduced cost and complexity. Consequently, the novel (bio)sensor system should have applications for analysis of carcasses on the abattoir processing line.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aadipose tissue 3abiosensors 3aboar taint 3acarbon electrodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aenzymes 3agas chromatography 3ameat 3aoxidation 3aquantitative analysis 3asilver 3asilver chloride 3askatole 3aslaughterhouses 3aswine 0aBoar taint 0aScreen-printing 0aBiosensor 0aSensor 0aDifferential pulse voltammetry 0aChronoamperometry 0aGC-FID 0aGC-NPD1 aCrew, A.P.1 aDoran, O.1 aHart, J.P.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 150 p.111837-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2019.1118373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02644naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010100166300001800267520168900285592002801974650001202002650001902014650001602033650001502049650002202064650001602086700001602102700002102118773009702139856008502236852000902321655001202330IND60120756820221119225959.0150210e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012075682DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-013-1683-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Doug M.12aA comparison of full-field and anomaly initialization for seasonal to decadal climate prediction  ap. 3325-3338.  aThere are two main approaches for dealing with model biases in forecasts made with initialized climate models. In full-field initialization, model biases are removed during the assimilation process by constraining the model to be close to observations. Forecasts drift back towards the model’s preferred state, thereby re-establishing biases which are then removed with an a posterior lead-time dependent correction diagnosed from a set of historical tests (hindcasts). In anomaly initialization, the model is constrained by observed anomalies and deviates from its preferred climatology only by the observed variability. In theory, the forecasts do not drift, and biases may be removed based on the difference between observations and independent model simulations of a given period. Both approaches are currently in use, but their relative merits are unclear. Here we compare the skill of each approach in comprehensive decadal hindcasts starting each year from 1960 to 2009, made using the Met Office decadal prediction system. Both approaches are more skilful than climatology in most regions for temperature and some regions for precipitation. On seasonal timescales, full-field initialized hindcasts of regional temperature and precipitation are significantly more skilful on average than anomaly initialized hindcasts. Teleconnections associated with the El Niño Southern Oscillation are stronger with the full-field approach, providing a physical basis for the improved precipitation skill. Differences in skill on multi-year timescales are generally not significant. However, anomaly initialization provides a better estimate of forecast skill from a limited hindcast set.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3aclimatology 3aprediction 3asimulation models 3atemperature1 aEade, Rosie1 aPohlmann, Holger0 tClimate dynamics.g2013 Dec., v. 41, no. 11-12 p.3325-3338dSpringer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-013-1683-23Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001600186245007800202300002000280506007600300520128100376592002801657506003701685650002001722650001101742650002201753650001901775650001101794700001601805700001801821700002301839773017601862856007902038852000902117655001202126IND60172234120221207082215.0150602e20120821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017223412DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12014781092doi7 aPMC34270632pmcid7 a228728662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Dajun10aLaminar analysis of visually evoked activity in the primary visual cortex  ap. 13871-13876.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStudying the laminar pattern of neural activity is crucial for understanding the processing of neural signals in the cerebral cortex. We measured neural population activity [multiunit spike activity (MUA) and local field potential, LFP] in Macaque primary visual cortex (V1) in response to drifting grating stimuli. Sustained visually driven MUA was at an approximately constant level across cortical depth in V1. However, sustained, visually driven, local field potential power, which was concentrated in the γ-band (20–60 Hz), was greatest at the cortical depth corresponding to cortico-cortical output layers 2, 3, and 4B. γ-band power also tends to be more sustained in the output layers. Overall, cortico-cortical output layers accounted for 67% of total γ-band activity in V1, whereas 56% of total spikes evoked by drifting gratings were from layers 2, 3, and 4B. The high-resolution layer specificity of γ-band power, the laminar distribution of MUA and γ-band activity, and their dynamics imply that neural activity in V1 is generated by laminar-specific mechanisms. In particular, visual responses of MUA and γ-band activity in cortico-cortical output layers 2, 3, and 4B seem to be strongly influenced by laminar-specific recurrent circuitry and/or feedback.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acerebral cortex 3acortex 3aevoked potentials 3aphotoreceptors 3avision1 aYeh, Chun-I1 aBurns, Samuel1 aShapley, Robert M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Aug. 21, v. 109, no. 34 p.13871-13876dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12014781093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02294naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245013300164300002000297520101400317592002801331650002601359650001301385650002101398650001301419650001301432650001201445650001901457650001801476650000701494650001901501650002101520650001301541700001801554700001701572700002401589700001901613700002301632700002001655773010101675856007501776852000901851655001201860IND60576615820221117230422.0170806e20120807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057661582DNAL7 a10.1021/la30129582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKotsokechagia, Tania10aPEGylation of Nanosubstrates (Titania) with Multifunctional Reagents: At the Crossroads between Nanoparticles and Nanocomposites  ap. 11490-11501.  aTitania (anatase) nanoparticles were successfully PEGylated through the use of catechol (dopamine)-terminated PEG derivatives. The resulting materials were characterized by excellent stability at neutral pH and extremely low toxicity (phagocytic and nonphagocytic cell lines). In particular, we focused on the comparison between mono- and bis-catechol PEGs. Due to the double terminal anchorage on the titania surface, bis-catechol ligands can produce chains differing from classical monoanchored PEG in conformation (horseshoe-shaped vs brush) and thus the possibility of interactions with biomolecules. At the same time, less than quantitative catechol binding may lead to the presence of dangling chains with unbound catechols which can polymerize and eventually produce PEG/titania nanocomposite colloids. Our results on double-functional PEG2000 show the latter to be the case. Pluronic F127 was also used as a bifunctional ligand, leading to nanocomposite aggregates with an even larger organic content.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical compounds 3acatechol 3achemical bonding 3acolloids 3adopamine 3aligands 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apolymerization 3atitanium dioxide 3atoxicity1 aZaki, Noha M.1 aSyres, Karen1 aLeonardis, Piero de1 aThomas, Andrew1 aCellesi, Francesco1 aTirelli, Nicola0 tLangmuir.g2012 Aug. 07, v. 28, no. 31 p.11490-11501dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla30129583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01872naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245006100151300001600212520055400228592002800782650003300810650001500843650002200858650001300880650004400893650001800937650001000955650002100965650001400986700002001000700001901020700002401039700002001063700002101083700002701104700002101131700002101152700002801173773015301201856007501354852000901429655001201438IND60549464820221119214801.0160908e20150227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054946482DNAL7 a10.1021/np50066962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Jun10aSesquiterpenoid Tropolone Glycosides from Liriosma ovata  ap. 315-319.  aTwo new sesquiterpenoid tropolone glycosides, liriosmasides A (1) and B (2), along with two known compounds, secoxyloganin and oplopanpheside C, were isolated from a methanol extract of the roots of Liriosma ovata.

The increased production of data in turn has put forward other challenges as well thus, and there is the need to store this information and not only to store it but also to retain it for a prolonged time period. The reliance on DNA as a dense storage medium with high storage capacity and its ability to withstand extreme environmental conditions has increased over the past few years. There have been developments in reading and writing different forms of data on DNA, codes for encrypting data and using DNA as a way of secret writing leading towards new styles like stenography and cryptography. The article outlines different methods adopted for storing digital data on DNA with pros and cons of each method that has been applied plus the advantages and limitations of using DNA as a storage medium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3adigital database 3aenvironmental factors 3areading1 aIkram-ul-Haq,1 aAli, Haider1 aLaghari, Aiman Tahir0 tMolecular biology reports.g2018 Oct., v. 45, no. 5 p.1479-1490dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-018-4280-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012600159300002000285520140700305592002801712650001501740650002201755650001201777650001401789650001301803650002001816650001201836650001701848650002201865650002801887650001701915650001701932700002501949700003101974700001902005700002502024700001902049773013402068856007502202852000902277655001202286IND60538626820170620000000.0160815e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053862682DNAL7 a10.1021/ja300771w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurks, Peter
T.10aQuantum Dot Photoluminescence Quenching by Cr(III) Complexes. Photosensitized Reactions and Evidence for a FRET Mechanism  ap. 13266-13275.  aReported are quantitative studies of the energy transfer from water-soluble CdSe/ZnS and CdSeS/ZnS core/shell quantum dots (QDs) to the Cr(III) complexes trans-Cr(N₄)(X)₂⁺ (N₄ is a tetraazamacrocycle ligand, X– is CN–, Cl–, or ONO–) in aqueous solution. Variation of N₄, of X–, and of the QD size and composition allows one to probe the relationship between the emission/absorption overlap integral parameter and the efficiency of the quenching of the QD photoluminescence (PL) by the chromium(III) complexes. Steady-state studies of the QD PL in the presence of different concentrations of trans-Cr(N₄)(X)₂⁺ indicate a clear correlation between quenching efficiency and the overlap integral largely consistent with the predicted behavior of a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-type mechanism. PL lifetimes show analogous correlations, and these results demonstrate that spectral overlap is an important consideration when designing supramolecular systems that incorporate QDs as photosensitizers. In the latter context, we extend earlier studies demonstrating that the water-soluble CdSe/ZnS and CdSeS/ZnS QDs photosensitize nitric oxide release from the trans-Cr(cyclam)(ONO)₂⁺ cation (cyclam = 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) and report the efficiency (quantum yield) for this process. An improved synthesis of ternary CdSeS core/shell QDs is also described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acations 3achlorides 3achromium 3aenergy transfer 3aligands 3anitric oxide 3aphotoluminescence 3aphotosensitizing agents 3aquantum dots 3azinc sulfide1 aOstrowski, Alexis D.1 aMikhailovsky, Alexander

During the infective process, the cell wall acts at the interface between the fungus and the host. In this way, the cell wall has a key role in growth, environment sensing and interaction, as well as morphogenesis of the fungus. Since the cell wall is absent in mammals, it may present molecules that are described as target sites for new antifungal drugs. Despite its importance, up to now few studies have been conducted employing proteomics in for the identification of cell wall proteins in Paracoccidioides spp. Here, a detailed proteomic approach, including cell wall-fractionation coupled to NanoUPLC-MSᴱ, was used to study and compare the cell wall fractions from Paracoccidioides lutzii mycelia and yeast cells. The analyzed samples consisted of cell wall proteins extracted by hot SDS followed by extraction by mild alkali. In summary, 512 proteins constituting different cell wall fractions were identified, including 7 predicted GPI-dependent cell wall proteins that are potentially involved in cell wall metabolism. Adhesins previously described in Paracoccidioides spp. such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were identified. Comparing the proteins in mycelium and yeast cells, we detected some that are common to both fungal phases, such as Ecm33, and some specific proteins, as glucanase Crf1. All of those proteins were described in the metabolism of cell wall. Our study provides an important elucidation of cell wall composition of fractions in Paracoccidioides, opening a way to understand the fungus cell wall architecture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParacoccidioides 3aadhesins 3aantifungal agents 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3amammals 3ametabolism 3amorphogenesis 3amycelium 3amycoses 3aphosphopyruvate hydratase 3aproteomics 3astructural proteins 3ayeasts 0aCell wall proteins 0aParacoccidioides lutzii 0aMycelia 0aYeast cells 0aProteomics 0aParacoccidioidomycosis1 ade Sousa Lima, Patrícia1 aBaeza, Lilian Cristiane1 aParente, Ana Flávia Alves1 aMelo Bailão, Alexandre1 aBorges, Clayton Luiz1 ade Almeida Soares, Célia Maria0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2017 Nov., v. 1865, no. 11 p.1304-1314dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1570-96397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2017.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01858naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245007800159300001600237520067900253592002800932650001300960650001600973650002200989650001701011650003101028650002301059650000901082650001001091650001201101650001101113650002201124700002901146700001901175700004101194773015301235856007501388852000901463655001201472IND60549464920170925000000.0160908e20150227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054946492DNAL7 a10.1021/np500688c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaldonado, Emma10aAbsolute Configuration of Labdane Diterpenoids from Physalis nicandroides  ap. 202-207.  aA mixture of the new epimeric labdenetriols 1 and 2 was isolated from the aerial parts of Physalis nicandroides.

There was an increase of the activities of superoxide dismutase (total and Cu/Zn-SOD) and catalase in rats fed a high-fat diet to which 10% oxidized oil was added. Administration of α-lipoic acid resulted in a decrease of the activities of these enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aoxygen production 3ahigh fat diet 3alipoic acid 3acatalase 3acooking fats and oils 3amalondialdehyde 3alipid peroxidation 3areactive oxygen species 3arapeseed oil 3asuperoxide dismutase 3arats 3aenzyme activity 3ablood 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aCatalasexblood 2aDietary Fatsxpharmacology 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aMale 2aOxidoreductasesxblood 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aThioctic Acidxpharmacology 0aantioxidants1 aWielkoszyński, Tomasz1 aKasperczyk, Sławomir1 aKasperczyk, Aleksandra1 aBirkner, Ewa0 tBiological trace element research.g2012 Feb., v. 145, no. 2 p.217-221dSpringer-Verlagx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-011-9186-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010500171300001500276520149300291592002801784650002701812650001701839650002301856650002501879650002301904650001501927650002401942650002301966650002201989650001902011650001702030650001202047650002302059651001902082653004802101653002202149653001602171653002402187653003202211653001502243700001902258700002202277773009802299856008502397852000902482655001202491IND60537765420221119111231.0190416e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053776542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoser.2014.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJobstvogt, Niels10aLooking below the surface: The cultural ecosystem service values of UK marine protected areas (MPAs)  ap. 97-110.  aRecreational users appreciate the UK marine environment for its cultural ecosystem services (CES) and their use and non-use values. UK Governments are currently establishing a network of marine protected areas (MPAs) informed by ecological data and socio-economic evidence. Evidence on CES values is needed, but only limited data have been available. We present a case study from the UK National Ecosystem Assessment (NEA) follow-on phase that elicited divers’ and anglers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for potential MPAs. The case study is an innovative combination of a travel-cost based choice experiment and an attribute-based contingent valuation method. Our study design allowed us to understand the marine users’ preferences from both a user and a stewardship perspective. Following the UK NEA’s place-based CES framework, we characterised marine CES as environmental spaces that might be protected, with features including the underwater seascape, and iconic and non-iconic species. Our survey highlighted the importance of CES to divers and anglers. A wide variety of marine spaces influenced user-WTP, while stewardship-WTP was most influenced by management restrictions, species protection, and attitudes towards marine conservation. An understanding of key stakeholders’ CES values can inform a more holistic and sustainable approach to marine management, especially for decisions involving trade-offs between marine protection and opportunity costs of the blue economy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3acase studies 3aconservation areas 3acontingent valuation 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aexperimental design 3amarine environment 3aopportunity costs 3asocioeconomics 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3awillingness to pay 3aUnited Kingdom 0aAttribute-based contingent valuation method 0aChoice experiment 0aTravel cost 0aMarine biodiversity 0aCultural Ecosystem Services 0aRecreation1 aWatson, Verity1 aKenter, Jasper O.0 tEcosystem services.g2014 Dec., v. 10 p.97-110dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2014.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100003100190245018800221300001600409520159000425592002802015653002002043653001802063653001502081653001802096653001702114653002802131653002602159653000902185653000702194653000902201653000902210653000802219653000802227653001102235653001602246653000902262653000902271653001102280653000902291653001302300700002702313700001902340700002902359700002302388773007302411856008302484852000902567655001202576IND60555017920221121182255.0161026s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055501792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.redox.2014.07.0012doi7 aPMC42154632pmcid7 a254607322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStorniolo, Carolina Emilia10aPolyphenol fraction of extra virgin olive oil protects against endothelial dysfunction induced by high glucose and free fatty acids through modulation of nitric oxide and endothelin-1  ap. 971-977.  aEpidemiological and clinical studies have reported that olive oil reduces the incidence of cardiovascular disease. However, the mechanisms involved in this beneficial effect have not been delineated. The endothelium plays an important role in blood pressure regulation through the release of potent vasodilator and vasoconstrictor agents such as nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin-1 (ET-1), respectively, events that are disrupted in type 2 diabetes. Extra virgin olive oil contains polyphenols, compounds that exert a biological action on endothelial function. This study analyzes the effects of olive oil polyphenols on endothelial dysfunction using an in vitro model that simulates the conditions of type 2 diabetes. Our findings show that high glucose and linoleic and oleic acids decrease endothelial NO synthase phosphorylation, and consequently intracellular NO levels, and increase ET-1 synthesis by ECV304 cells. These effects may be related to the stimulation of reactive oxygen species production in these experimental conditions. Hydroxytyrosol and the polyphenol extract from extra virgin olive oil partially reversed the above events. Moreover, we observed that high glucose and free fatty acids reduced NO and increased ET-1 levels induced by acetylcholine through the modulation of intracellular calcium concentrations and endothelial NO synthase phosphorylation, events also reverted by hydroxytyrosol and polyphenol extract. Thus, our results suggest a protective effect of olive oil polyphenols on endothelial dysfunction induced by hyperglycemia and free fatty acids.  aPublisher supplied data 0aType 2 diabetes 0aHyperglycemia 0aOleic acid 0aLinoleic acid 0aECV304 cells 0aReactive oxygen species 0aCell oxidative stress 0aEVOO 0aNO 0aET-1 0aFFAs 0aROS 0aAch 0aDAF-DA 0aCM-H2DCF-DA 0aeNOS 0aMAPK 0aPEEVOO 0aPI3K 0aPREDIMED1 aRoselló-Catafau, Joan1 aPintó, Xavier1 aMitjavila, María Teresa1 aMoreno, Juan José0 tRedox Biology.g2014, v. 2 p.971-977dElsevier B.V.x2213-23177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2014.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03042naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245016400165520150200329592002801831650001501859650002101874650001801895650001501913650002201928650002201950650001401972650001401986650001302000650001102013650001602024650001002040650002002050653001502070653001702085653003102102700005402133700005402187700005502241700001602296700002302312700001502335700001802350773009802368856008502466852000902551655001202560IND60743628220221117235722.0211219e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074362822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2021.1173932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xuxu10aCiprofloxacin removal by ultrasound-enhanced carbon nanotubes/permanganate process: In situ generation of free reactive manganese species via electron transfer  aRecently, free reactive manganese species (RMnS) generated via permanganate catalytic oxidation technology has been applied to contaminants abatement and sludge dewatering. This study proposed a novel free RMnS generation method in ultrasound enhanced carbon nanotube (CNTs)/permanganate process (UCP) for organics removal. Taking ciprofloxacin as a target contaminant, the removal efficiency in the UCP process (9.78 s⁻¹) was remarkably higher than that of the permanganate (0.71 s⁻¹) and CNTs/permanganate (2.57 s⁻¹) processes. CNTs could enrich manganese compounds and ciprofloxacin, and act as an electronic platform for the electronic transfer from ciprofloxacin to manganese compounds for free RMnS generation, which was revealed by DFT calculation and spectrum analysis. Meanwhile, ultrasound further regulated the generation of RMnS as it could transform the inactive solid Mn(IV) into free RMnS. In the UCP process, non-free radical modes including RMnS oxidation (49.8%) and electron transfer (23.5%) were the dominant processes for ciprofloxacin removal in the UCP process, and hydroxyl radical oxidation (13.2%), CNTs adsorption (5.5%), and PM oxidation (8.0%) also contributed to ciprofloxacin removal. Interestingly, CNTs could be well reused in the UCP process as more than 88.75% of ciprofloxacin was removed after five times reuse of CNTs. The UCP process provides a novel strategy for rapid contaminants removal in water treatment via continuous generation of free RMnS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon nanotubes 3aciprofloxacin 3adewatering 3aelectron transfer 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amanganese 3aoxidation 3aresearch 3asludge 3aultrasonics 3awater 3awater treatment 0aUltrasound 0aPermanganate 0aReactive manganese species1 aWang, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9126-05821 aZhao, Chun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9118-99901 aZhu, Yunhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0913-88691 aSun, Zhihua1 aFan, Hua-Jun Shawn1 aHu, Xuebin1 aZheng, Huaili0 tWater research.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 202 p.117393-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.1173933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245016300164300001600327520127300343592002801616650004401644650001501688650001101703650002201714650001301736650001601749650001101765650001901776650002401795650002501819650001701844650001201861650001301873650001701886650002201903650001101925650002301936650002101959650003701980653001702017653004602034653002502080653001602105653001602121700001602137700001702153700001202170700001702182700001802199700001602217773010002233856008702333852000902420655001202429IND60542393720221120083804.0190402e20150715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054239372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Xin10aHydrophilic gallic acid–imprinted polymers over magnetic mesoporous silica microspheres with excellent molecular recognition ability in aqueous fruit juices  ap. 206-212.  aHydrophilic molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) for gallic acid (GA) were prepared with excellent recognition ability in an aqueous solution. The proposed MIPs were designed by self-polymerization of dopamine (DA) on magnetic mesoporous silica (Fe3O4@SiO2@mSiO2, MMS) using GA as template. Resulting Fe3O4@SiO2@mSiO2@MIPs (MMS–MIPs) were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and evaluated by adsorption isotherms/kinetics and competitive adsorption. The adsorption behavior between GA and MMS–MIPs followed Langmuir and Sips adsorption isotherms with a maximum adsorption capacity at 88.7mg/g and pseudo-second-order reaction kinetics with fast binding (equilibrium time at 100min). In addition, MMS–MIPs showed rapid magnetic separation (10s) and stability (retained 95.2% after six cycles). Subsequently, MMS–MIPs were applied for the selective extraction and determination of GA from grape, apple, peach and orange juices (4.02, 3.91, 5.97, and 0.67μg/g, respectively). Generally, the described method may pave the way towards rationally designing more advanced hydrophilic MIPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aapples 3aaqueous solutions 3adopamine 3agallic acid 3agrapes 3ahydrophilicity 3amagnetic separation 3amolecular imprinting 3aorange juice 3apeaches 3apolymers 3aporous media 3areaction kinetics 3asilica 3asorption isotherms 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aPolydopamine 0aHydrophilic molecularly imprinted polymer 0aSelective extraction 0aGallic acid 0aFruit juice1 aXie, Lianwu1 aGuo, Junfang1 aLi, Hui1 aJiang, Xinyu1 aZhang, Yuping1 aShi, Shuyun0 tFood chemistry.g2015 July 15, v. 179 p.206-212dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04154naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005100188245018100239300001200420506007600432520244000508592002802948596006202976506003703038650002303075650001803098650000903116650001203125650002003137650001003157650001803167650001303185650000903198650001103207650001403218650001903232650003503251650002203286650001903308650002403327651001003351700001603361700001803377700001703395700001603412773010503428856008203533852000903615655001203624IND60613870020221207061631.0190503e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061387002DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-018-1410-62doi7 aPMC61379132pmcid7 a302171752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0542-504310aHigh cryptic species diversity is revealed by genome-wide polymorphisms in a wild relative of banana, Musa itinerans, and implications for its conservation in subtropical China  ap. 194.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Species delimitation is a challenging but essential task in conservation biology. Morphologically similar species are sometimes difficult to recognize even after examination by experienced taxonomists. With the advent of molecular approaches in species delimitation, this hidden diversity has received much recent attention. In addition to DNA barcoding approaches, analytical tools based on the multi-species coalescence model (MSC) have been developed for species delimitation. Musa itinerans is widely distributed in subtropical Asia, and at least six varieties have been documented. However, the number of evolutionarily distinct lineages remains unknown. RESULTS: Using genome resequencing data of five populations (making up four varieties), we examined genome-wide variation and found four varieties that were evolutionary significant units. A Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography (BP&P) analysis using 123 single copy nuclear genes support three speciation events of M. itinerans varieties with robust posterior speciation probabilities; However, a Bayes factor delimitation of species with genomic data (BFD*) analysis using 1201 unlinked single nucleotide polymorphisms gave decisive support for a five-lineage model. When reconciling divergence time estimates with a speciation time scale, a modified three-lineage model was consistent with that of BP&P, in which the speciation time of two varieties (M. itinerans var. itinerans and M. itinerans var. lechangensis) were dated to 26.2 kya and 10.7 kya, respectively. In contrast, other two varieties (M. itinerans var. chinensis and M. itinerans var. guangdongensis) diverged only 3.8 kya in the Anthropocene; this may be a consequence of genetic drift rather than a speciation event. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the M. itinerans species complex harbours high cryptic species diversity. We recommend that M. itinerans var. itinerans and M. itinerans var. lechangensis be elevated to subspecies status, and the extremely rare latter subspecies be given priority for conservation. We also recommend that the very recently diverged M. itinerans var. chinensis and M. itinerans var. guangdongensis should be merged under the subspecies M. itinerans var. chinensis. Finally, we speculate that species delimitation of recently diverged lineages may be more effective using genome-wide bi-allelic SNP markers with BFD* than by using unlinked loci and BP&P.  aPublisher supplied data  a31261140366cNational Natural Science Foundation of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnthropocene epoch 3aDNA barcoding 3aMusa 3abananas 3acryptic species 3agenes 3agenetic drift 3agenomics 3aloci 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aspecies diversity 3awild relatives 3awildlife management 3aChina1 aNg, Wei-Lun1 aYang, Jun-Xin1 aLi, Weiming,1 aGe, Xue-Jun0 tBMC plant biology.g2018 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.194-194dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-018-1410-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245011000178520144500288592002801733650001401761650003401775650001901809650001401828650002501842650002001867650002001887650001501907650002401922650001001946650002301956650002201979650002002001650003002021650002002051650001802071650001002089650001402099650001602113650000902129653001802138653002902156653002802185700002202213700002002235700002202255700002002277773009902297856008502396852000902481655001202490IND60686132420221119044814.0200501e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068613242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2020.1051402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVicente Pérez, Javier,10aSpecific and sensitive PCR detection of Cadophora luteo-olivacea associated with grapevine trunk diseases  aGrapevine trunk diseases, caused by different fungal pathogens, are the most relevant group of diseases that affect vineyards, causing important economic losses.

Petri disease is caused by the infection of different fungal pathogens, mainly, Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, Phaeocremonium minimum and Cadophora luteo-olivacea. The molecular detection of plant pathogens is topical due to its facility, reproducibility and accuracy. Here we have described a PCR protocol based in a pair of new designed specific primers for the rapid detection of C. luteo-olivacea. The described procedure is intended for the direct inspection of plants suspected of being infected. Bovine serum albumin and MgCl₂ were used as PCR adjuvants in order to cope with the presence of polymerase inhibitors from wood samples. Several assays have been settled out in order to assign the sensitivity and specificity of the developed technique. Under the conditions tested, the procedure has a low detection limit (10 pg) and it is specific for C. luteo-olivacea detection among other Cadophora species and fungal endophytes of Vitis vinifera.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCadophora 3aPhaeoacremonium chlamydospora 3aVitis vinifera 3aadjuvants 3abovine serum albumin 3acrop production 3adetection limit 3aendophytes 3afinancial economics 3afungi 3amagnesium chloride 3aplant development 3aplant pathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquality control 3arapid methods 3avines 3avineyards 3aviticulture 3awood 0aPetri disease 0aCadophora luteo-olivacea 0aOptimized PCR procedure1 aAlonso, Alejandro1 aNavascués, Eva1 aMarquina, Domingo1 aSantos, Antonio0 tCrop protection.g2020 June, v. 132 p.105140-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2020.1051403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008200163300001800245520150100263592002801764650001301792650001501805650001001820650001101830650002001841650001101861650001301872650001301885650002501898650003501923650001801958650001501976650001001991700001602001700001902017700001602036773008402052856008102136852000902217655001202226IND50070760020221121065406.0150210e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007076002DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-013-1961-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Lijuan10aApplications and challenges of next-generation sequencing in Brassica species  ap. 1005-1024.  aNext-generation sequencing (NGS) produces numerous (often millions) short DNA sequence reads, typically varying between 25 and 400 bp in length, at a relatively low cost and in a short time. This revolutionary technology is being increasingly applied in whole-genome, transcriptome, epigenome and small RNA sequencing, molecular marker and gene discovery, comparative and evolutionary genomics, and association studies. The Brassica genus comprises some of the most agro-economically important crops, providing abundant vegetables, condiments, fodder, oil and medicinal products. Many Brassica species have undergone the process of polyploidization, which makes their genomes exceptionally complex and can create difficulties in genomics research. NGS injects new vigor into Brassica research, yet also faces specific challenges in the analysis of complex crop genomes and traits. In this article, we review the advantages and limitations of different NGS technologies and their applications and challenges, using Brassica as an advanced model system for agronomically important, polyploid crops. Specifically, we focus on the use of NGS for genome resequencing, transcriptome sequencing, development of single-nucleotide polymorphism markers, and identification of novel microRNAs and their targets. We present trends and advances in NGS technology in relation to Brassica crop improvement, with wide application for sophisticated genomics research into agronomically important polyploid crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica 3acondiments 3acrops 3aforage 3agenetic markers 3agenome 3agenomics 3amicroRNA 3anucleotide sequences 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atranscriptome 3avegetables 3avigor1 aXiao, Meili1 aHayward, Alice1 aFu, Donghui0 tPlanta.g2013 Dec., v. 238, no. 6 p.1005-1024dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-013-1961-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001400170245005000184300001600234520107100250592002801321650001801349650001301367650002401380650002501404650002701429650001801456650001501474650001201489650002101501650001501522650002201537650001601559650003801575650002701613650004101640650001101681650004401692650004201736650003901778700001801817700002201835700001901857700001901876700001701895700001701912700002201929773010201951856008702053852000902140655001202149IND4466801220221122052542.0141112e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446680122DNAL7 a208259782pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraga, M.10aEnvironment and T regulatory cells in allergy  ap. 193-201.  aThe central role of T regulatory cells in the responses against harmless environmental antigens has been confirmed by many studies. Impaired T regulatory cell function is implicated in many pathological conditions, particularly allergic diseases. The “hygiene hypothesis” suggests that infections and infestations may play a protective role for allergy, whereas environmental pollutants favor the development of allergic diseases. Developing countries suffer from a variety of infections and are also facing an increasing diffusion of environmental pollutants. In these countries allergies increase in relation to the spreading use of xenobiotics (pesticides, herbicides, pollution, etc.) with a rate similar to those of developed countries, overcoming the protective effects of infections. We review here the main mechanisms of non-self tolerance, with particular regard to relations between T regulatory cell activity, infections and infestations such as helminthiasis, and exposure to environmental xenobiotics with relevant diffusion in developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantigens 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3aenvironmental exposure 3ahelminthiasis 3aherbicides 3ahygiene 3ahypersensitivity 3apollutants 3aprotective effect 3axenobiotics 2aCommunicable Diseasesximmunology 2aEnvironmental Exposure 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsximmunology 2aHumans 2aHypersensitivityxetiologyximmunology. 2aT-Lymphocytes, Regulatoryximmunology 2aXenobioticsximmunologyxtoxicity.1 aSchiavone, C.1 aDi Gioacchino, G.1 aDe Angelis, I.1 aCavallucci, E.1 aLazzarin, F.1 aPetrarca, C.1 aDi Gioacchino, M.0 tScience of the total environment.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 423 p.193-201dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.08.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245008500154300002000239520140100259592002801660650002101688650001301709650002101722650001101743650002101754650001801775650001401793650001901807650002401826650001401850700001801864700001401882700001401896773012401910856007402034852000902108655001202117IND60642208820221122031819.0190506e20171113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064220882DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra10393j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Shuai10aCore-shell structured NaMnF₃: Yb, Er nanoparticles for bioimaging applications  ap. 52588-52594.  aNaMnF₃: Yb,Er upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have received considerable attention due to their single-band emission. In this paper, a modified thermal decomposition method to synthesize single or core/shell structured lanthanide-doped NaMnF₃ nanoparticles is proposed. The NaMnF₃: 20% Yb³⁺, 2% Er³⁺ nanoparticles displayed pure red emission under 980 nm laser excitation, and the emission intensity could be significantly enhanced by coating a NaMnF₃ or NaMnF₃: 20% Yb³⁺ shell layer on their surfaces. Moreover, NaMnF₃: 20% Yb³⁺, 2% Er³⁺ nanoparticles shelled with NaMnF₃: 20% Nd³⁺ or NaMnF₃: 20% Yb³⁺, 20% Nd³⁺ were synthesized for the first time, and displayed pure red emission when excited by an 808 nm laser. The core/shell structured NaMnF₃: Yb/Er@NaMnF₃: Yb or NaMnF₃: Yb/Er@NaMnF₃: Yb/Nd nanoparticles were applied to bioimaging. The NaMnF₃ based UCNPs exhibited good photostability and biocompatibility in HeLa cells. The obtained images indicated that the UCNPs could mainly exist in the cytoplasmic regions in the cells. Besides, images from the same region exposed to laser irradiations at 808 nm and 980 nm were found to be comparable. This result indicated that, for NaMnF₃: 20% Yb³⁺, 2% Er³⁺@NaMnF₃: 20% Yb³⁺, 20% Nd³⁺ nanoparticles, laser excitation at 808 nm was as efficient as that at 980 nm for bioimaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3acoatings 3aemissions factor 3aerbium 3ahuman cell lines 3ananoparticles 3aneodymium 3aphotostability 3athermal degradation 3aytterbium1 aZhao, Mengjie1 aSong, Jun1 aQu, Junle0 tRSC advances.g2017 Nov. 13, v. 7, no. 83 p.52588-52594dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra10393j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03271naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245011600204300001200320506007600332520131400408592002801722596005901750596006201809596005901871596006201930596006501992506003702057650001502094650001102109650001302120650002802133650001502161650001402176650001602190650001902206650001802225650001302243650001902256650001302275650001902288650001802307650002102325650001002346700001302356700001302369700001402382700001602396700001802412700005502430773010502485856008202590852000902672655001202681IND60613870120221207061725.0190503e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061387012DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-018-1415-12doi7 aPMC61391622pmcid7 a302190552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Huanan10aSmall RNA and degradome sequencing used to elucidate the basis of tolerance to salinity and alkalinity in wheat  ap. 195.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Soil salinity and/or alkalinity impose a major constraint over crop yield and quality. An understanding of the molecular basis of the plant response to these stresses could inform the breeding of more tolerant varieties. The bread wheat cultivar SR3 exhibits an enhanced level of salinity tolerance, while SR4 is distinguished by its superior tolerance of alkalinity. RESULTS: The small RNA and degradome sequencing was used to explore the miRNAs and corresponding targets associated with the superior stress tolerance of the SR lines. An examination of the small RNA content of these two closely related lines revealed the presence of 98 known and 219 novel miRNA sequences. Degradome libraries were constructed in order to identify the targets of the miRNAs, leading to the identification of 58 genes targeted by 26 of the known miRNAs and 549 targeted by 65 of the novel ones. The function of two of the stress-responsive miRNAs was explored using virus-induced gene silencing. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis indicated that regulation mediated by both auxin and epigenetic modification can be important in determining both salinity and alkalinity tolerance, while jasmonate signaling and carbohydrate metabolism are important for salinity tolerance, as is proton transport for alkalinity tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data  a31722038cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31720103910cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31872864cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016WLJH39cYoung Scholars Program of Shandong University  a2014JC048cFundamental Research Funds of Shandong University0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalkalinity 3aauxins 3abreeding 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3aepigenetics 3agene silencing 3ajasmonic acid 3amicroRNA 3aplant response 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3asoil salinity 3astress tolerance 3awheat1 aWang, Qi1 aWei, Lin1 aLiang, Yu1 aDai, Jiulan1 aXia, Guangmin1 aLiu, Shuwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3518-43320 tBMC plant biology.g2018 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.195-195dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-018-1415-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03303naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005400139245010600193300001600299500001400315500002000329520167400349592002802023596007502051596004402126650002202170650002702192650001902219650002502238650001602263650001702279650001202296650001002308650001102318650002102329650001402350650001502364650001402379650001002393650002602403650001302429650001802442700001602460700001502476700001402491700001202505700005402517773012002571856007302691852000902764655001202773IND60723029720221119034102.0210110e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072302972DNAL7 a10.1111/are.149262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ruijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8385-174810aWound healing at the body wall of the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus by Chinese herbal treatment  ap. 693-701.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe leading cause of death for sea cucumbers in aquaculture is damage to the body wall. Large‐scale use of antibiotics to treat such wounds is undesirable because this treatment leaves a drug residue in the animal's body as well as posing increased pathogen resistance in the environment. In this study, both naturally and artificially occurring wound sea cucumber were used as the experimental animals. Compound Chinese herbal medicines were then selected and evaluated for wound healing effects. The results showed that Chinese herbal medicine mixtures I (Angelica dahurica, Geosaurus, Rhus chinensis and Dark plum fruit), II (Angelica dahurica, Geosaurus and Taraxacum mongolicum Hand) and III (Angelica dahurica, Geosaurus, Taraxacum mongolicum Hand, Rhus chinensis and Dark plum fruit) significantly improved wound healing of artificially injured sea cucumbers. After 1 week of treatment, histological analysis showed that the epidermal layer was completely restored, indistinguishable from the control. Cyclin B, Protease inhibitor Epi11 and PCSK9 expression in immune coelomocytes showed a tendency to increase at first and then decrease at different time points of herbal treatment. Results of companion treatment trials for naturally wounded sea cucumbers showed that after 1 week in the treatment group, the skin ulcer areas of sea cucumbers were reduced, and the survival rate was significantly improved. The results of this study provide a scientific basis for the treatment and prevention of sea cucumber skin ulcerations and body wall damage. This treatment may provide an important natural healing modality for sea cucumbers in an aquaculture system.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFC1404503cState Key Research Project "Marine environment safety"  a201908210161cChina Scholarship Council 3aAngelica dahurica 3aApostichopus japonicus 3aRhus chinensis 3aTaraxacum mongolicum 3aaquaculture 3acoelomocytes 3acyclins 3adeath 3afruits 3aherbal medicines 3ahistology 3aintegument 3apathogens 3aplums 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aresearch 3asurvival rate1 aDu, Yanping1 aMa, Hongli1 aLi, Qiang1 aLi, Hua1 aYe, Shigen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9280-66040 tAquaculture research.g2021 Feb., v. 52, no. 2 p.693-701dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.149263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245009300166300001400259520113200273592002801405650001001433650001701443650001001460650001401470650001401484650002301498650001101521650001301532650002301545650001801568650002301586650000901609650001601618650001701634650001001651653000901661653001701670653001401687653001301701653002201714653001601736700002701752700002901779700002001808700002201828773009801850856008701948852000902035655001202044IND60542393820221120083904.0190402e20150801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054239382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPortu, J.10aPhenylalanine and urea foliar applications to grapevine: Effect on wine phenolic content  ap. 55-63.  aPhenolic compounds play a key role in the organoleptic properties of wines. Viticultural practices may influence grape and wine phenolic content, thus determining their quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of foliar applications of phenylalanine and urea, at two different doses, on wine phenolic composition. Grapes were harvested at their optimal technological maturity and their respective wines were elaborated at small scale. Wine detailed phenolic composition was determined. Results revealed that the content of several anthocyanins and flavonols was enhanced by the application of both phenylalanine doses and by the application of the low dose of urea. In contrast, flavanols and non-flavonoid compounds were less affected by the foliar treatments. The findings seem to be related to the time of application, since anthocyanins and flavonols are accumulated after veraison. In conclusion, nitrogen foliar fertilization increased the phenolic content of Tempranillo wines. This could be of interest since anthocyanins and flavonols are associated with wine quality, especially with its color.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis 3aanthocyanins 3acolor 3aflavanols 3aflavonols 3afoliar application 3agrapes 3anitrogen 3aphenolic compounds 3aphenylalanine 3asensory properties 3aurea 3aviticulture 3awine quality 3awines 0aWine 0aAnthocyanins 0aFlavonols 0aNitrogen 0aVitis vinifera L. 0aTempranillo1 aGonzález-Arenzana, L.1 aHermosín-Gutiérrez, I.1 aSantamaría, P.1 aGarde-Cerdán, T.0 tFood chemistry.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 180 p.55-63dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03516naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245016500165300001800330520169000348592002802038650001802066650001902084650001502103650002302118650001902141650001602160650001802176650003002194650001602224650002002240650003102260650001002291650001302301650001102314650002102325650000902346650001302355650003402368650002402402650002902426650002602455700001502481700001602496700002002512700001702532700001702549700001102566700001702577700001702594700001802611700002002629700001302649700001702662773009402679856008502773990002302858852000902881655001202890IND60098246220221118044159.0141104e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009824622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Peng10aSp1 is involved in regulation of cystathionine γ-lyase gene expression and biological function by PI3K/Akt pathway in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines  ap. 1229-1240.  aHydrogen sulfide (H₂S) has been found to play an important role as a novel gasotransmitter involved in many biological processes. The regulatory role of endogenous H₂S-producing enzyme on cancer cell survival is complex and unclear. According to the data that cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) gene, catalyzed H₂S production in trans-sulfuration pathway, was upregulated in Akt stably transformed mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, the mechanisms that elevated CSE expression by PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and its biological functions in cell survival were studied. In the present study, firstly, the results showed that PI3K/Akt positively correlated with CSE expression levels in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. CSE expression was decreased by the PI3K inhibitor or Akt deletion, while upregulated with the activating of Akt. Based on dual-luciferase reporter assay, the −592/+139 gene fragment represented the CSE core promoter, and the PI3K/Akt pathway regulated CSE expression on transcriptional level. Sp1 was the critical transcription factor in regulation of CSE expression via the mutation of transcription factor binding sites on the promoter. Furthermore, we proved that Sp1 could directly bind to CSE promoter by ChIP assay. In addition, we explored that the endogenous H₂S production was connected with the regulated CSE expression, and CSE/H₂S promoted human hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation via cell cycle progression regulation. In summary, we have, for the first time, demonstrated that PI3K/Akt pathway regulates the CSE expression via Sp1, which is particularly important to understand the effect of PI3K/Akt and CSE on the tumorigenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3acarcinogenesis 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3acorrelation 3acystathionine 3acystathionine gamma-lyase 3afibroblasts 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahepatoma 3ahumans 3ahydrogen sulfide 3amice 3amutation 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aZhao, Chao1 aLi, Zengxia1 aMei, Chuanzhong1 aYao, Wantong1 aLiu, Yonglei1 aLi, Na1 aQi, Jingjing1 aWang, Liying1 aShi, Yinghong1 aQiu, Shuangjian1 aFan, Jia1 aZha, Xiliang0 tCellular signalling.g2012 June, v. 24, no. 6 p.1229-1240dElsevier Inc.x0898-65687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.02.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02114naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002500186245007000211300002000281520087500301592002801176653001301204653001001217653001901227653000901246653000901255700001701264700001301281700001801294700002201312700002801334700002101362700003001383700002101413773019401434856007901628852000901707655001201716IND60518024420161210000000.0160406e20151222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051802442DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15095571122doi7 aPMC46974112pmcid7 a266445872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Lara, Jorge,10aSupramolecular structure in the membrane of Staphylococcus aureus  ap. 15725-15730.  aSignificance The fundamental processes of life are organized and based on common basic principles. Molecular organizers, often interacting with the membrane, capitalize on cellular polarity to precisely orientate essential processes. The study of organisms lacking apparent polarity or known cellular organizers (e.g., the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus) may enable the elucidation of the primal organizational drive in biology. How does a cell choose from infinite locations in its membrane? We have discovered a structure in the S. aureus membrane that organizes processes indispensable for life and can arise spontaneously from the geometric constraints of protein complexes on membranes. Building on this finding, the most basic cellular positioning system to optimize biological processes, known molecular coordinators could introduce further levels of complexity.  aPublisher supplied data 0amembrane 0amodel 0astaphylococcus 0aMreD 0aPlsY1 aWeihs, Felix1 aMa, Xing1 aWalker, Lucas1 aChaudhuri, Roy R.1 aKasturiarachchi, Jagath1 aCrossley, Howard1 aGolestanian, R.q(Ramin),1 aFoster, Simon J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Dec. 22, v. 112, no. 51 p.15725-15730dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15095571123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245019300163300001800356500001500374520138600389592002801775650000901803650001301812650002101825650000901846650002101855650001501876650002201891650002101913650001801934650001601952650002101968650001901989650001802008653002102026653001402047700001502061773014702076856008202223852000902305655001202314IND60592739620221121031357.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059273962DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-018-0970-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Baoshan10aNovel electrochemical aptasensor for ultrasensitive detection of sulfadimidine based on covalently linked multi-walled carbon nanotubes and in situ synthesized gold nanoparticle composites  ap. 2901-2910.  a2019-12-06  aIn the current study, a sensitive electrochemical sensing strategy based on aptamer (APT) for detection of sulfadimidine (SM₂) was developed. A bare gold electrode (AuE) was first modified with 2-aminoethanethiol (2-AET) through self-assembly, used as linker for the subsequent immobilization of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and gold nanoparticle composites (MWCNTs/AuNPs). Then, the thiolated APT was assembled onto the electrode via sulfur-gold affinity. When SM₂ existed, the APT combined with SM₂ and formed a complex structure. The specific binding of SM₂ and APT increased the impedance, leading to hard electron transfer between the electrode surface and the redox probe [Fe(CN)₆]³⁻/⁴⁻ and producing a significant reduction of the signal. The SM₂ concentration could be reflected by the current difference of the peak currents before and after target binding. Under optimized conditions, the linear dynamic range is from 0.1 to 50 ng mL⁻¹, with a detection limit of 0.055 ng mL⁻¹. The sensor exhibited desirable selectivity against other sulfonamides and performs successfully when analyzing SM₂ in pork samples.

However, harvesting these organisms for extracting biofuels is energy- and cost-intensive, limiting the commercial feasibility of large-scale production. Here, we demonstrate the use of a class of transport proteins of pharmacological interest to circumvent the need to harvest biomass during biofuel production. We show that membrane-embedded transporters, better known to efflux lipids and drugs, can be used to mediate the secretion of intracellularly synthesized model isoprenoid biofuel compounds to the extracellular milieu. Transporter-mediated biofuel secretion sustainably maintained an approximate three- to fivefold boost in biofuel production in our Escherichia coli test system. Because the transporters used in this study belong to the ubiquitous ATP-binding cassette protein family, we propose their use as “plug-and-play” biofuel-secreting systems in a variety of bacteria, cyanobacteria, diatoms, yeast, and algae used for biofuel production. This investigation showcases the potential of expressing desired membrane transport proteins in cell factories to achieve the export or import of substances of economic, environmental, or therapeutic importance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillariophyceae 3aCyanobacteria 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteria 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3adrugs 3aengineering 3aexports 3afuel production 3aharvesting 3aimports 3aisoprenoids 3alipids 3asecretion 3atransporters 3ayeasts 0aABC transporters 0abiofuel milking 0agreen fuel 0amultidrug efflux1 aNguyễn, Tuấn,1 aChang, Geoffrey0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 May 7, v. 110, no. 19 p.7642-7647dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13013581103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01945naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245016800170500002200338520063700360592002800997650002301025650001401048650001901062650000901081650001601090650001601106653003201122653003001154653001701184653001901201653001301220653001401233700001901247700002101266700002101287700002201308773011001330856008601440852000901526655001201535IND60573461220221117111451.0170724s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057346122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.07.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoyer, Maxime10aTowards a new universal way to describe the required hydrophilic lipophilic balance of oils using the phase inversion temperature of C10E4/n-octane/water emulsions  aPre-press version  aThe evaluation of the required hydrophilic lipophilic balance of several oils has been studied with the use of a new “PIT-slope”concept of classification of surfactants based on the phase inversion temperature.

A new step forms when a space leader attaches to the primary negative one. Space leaders originate from small fusiform plasma formations which are called space stems. For now, there is no any established idea about how space stems form in conditions when the background electric field inside the negative corona volume is about three times less than the dielectric strength of air. In this study, we propose a new mechanism of space stem precursors formation which is based on the joint action of ionization and electron drifting processes occurring at the negative corona streamer burst boundary in the presence of strongly inhomogeneous stochastic electric field. It is supposed that electric field fluctuations are formed by chaotically positioned clusters of negative charge which can be considered as basic elements of spatio-temporal noise and are transported into the negative corona volume by negative streamer heads. The last are emanated from the newly-formed leader tip during the development of the negative corona streamer burst finishing the step-formation process. The model is applied to specify conditions under which space stem precursor genesis is possible and to analyze the peculiarities of proposed mechanism at different altitudes above sea level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aelectric field 3aionization 3amodels 3aresearch 0aSpace stems 0aNegative leader 0aNegative corona streamer burst 0aStochastic dynamics 0aSpatio-temporal noise 0aNumerical simulation1 aIudin, D.I.0 tAtmospheric research.g2021 Sept., v. 259 p.105685-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2021.1056853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002400188245008900212300001100301506007600312520108600388592002801474596005601502506003701558650002001595650003501615650001501650650002501665650001001690650001401700650002401714650001501738650001601753650002201769650002101791651001401812700002901826700001601855700001901871700003301890773010301923856008202026852000902108655001202117IND60613870220221207061640.0220518e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061387022DNAL7 a302171582pmid7 aPMC61379082pmcid7 a10.1186/s12898-018-0189-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrannelly, Laura A.10aFungal infection has sublethal effects in a lowland subtropical amphibian population  ap. 34.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has been implicated as a primary cause of decline in many species around the globe. However, there are some species and populations that are known to become infected in the wild, yet declines have not been observed. Here we conducted a yearlong capture-mark-recapture study and a 2-year long disease monitoring study of northern cricket frogs, Acris crepitans, in the lowland subtropical forests of Louisiana. RESULTS: We found little evidence for an impact of Bd infection on survival; however, Bd infection did appear to cause sublethal effects, including increased capture probability in the field. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that even in apparently stable populations, where Bd does not appear to cause mortality, there may be sublethal effects of infection that can impact a host population’s dynamics and structure. Understanding and documenting such sublethal effects of infection on wild, seemingly stable populations is important, particularly for predicting future population declines.  aPublisher supplied data  aLEQSF (2011-14)-RD-A-26cLouisiana Board of Regents0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcris crepitans 3aBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis 3aamphibians 3adisease surveillance 3afungi 3amortality 3apopulation dynamics 3aprediction 3aprobability 3asublethal effects 3atropical forests 3aLouisiana1 aChatfield, Matthew W.

Fox Research and Demonstration Forest (Fox), in Hillsborough, New Hampshire. Long-term plot data provide a record of landscape-level changes in a managed forest setting. Changes in density, basal area, mortality, removal, and recruitment demonstrate the effects of forest management on growth and forest structure through time. Tree density peaked in 2001 at 716.1 trees/hectare, but the basal area continued to increase from 18.8 m2/ha in 1955 to 44.7 m2/ha 2011 despite forest management activities. Hemlock and red maple dominate stem recruitment. Tree mortality rates have increased from 0.26%/year 1955–1965 to 1.03%/year 2001–2011, while removal rates have dropped from 1.04%/year to 0.44%/year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer rubrum 3ademonstration forests 3aforest inventory 3aforest management 3aforestry development 3ahurricanes 3amortality 3atree mortality 3atrees 3aNew Hampshire1 aSeaboyer, Ingeborg V.0 tForests.g2017 June 27, v. 8, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f80702253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245008900171500002200260520162800282592002801910650002101938650002101959650001501980650001701995650002602012650001402038650001502052650002602067650002002093650001502113650001902128650001602147650002002163650001402183653003902197653001402236653002802250653003302278653001502311653003102326700001802357700001602375700003202391773011002423856008602533852000902619655001202628IND60573461320221117111742.0170724s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057346132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.07.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonilla, Pablo10aInfluence of crosslinked alginate on drug release from highly concentrated emulsions  aPre-press version  aBiocompatible water-in-oil (W/O) and oil-in-water (W/O) highly concentrated emulsions (HIPREs) have been formed at 25°C, in systems consisting of aqueous component/castor oil derivative surfactant/oil compound. In both kinds of emulsions the concentration of internal phase was 83% and the aqueous component consisted of water, 1% sodium alginate solution or a mixture of sodium alginate solution and calcium chloride solution (crosslinked calcium alginate). Ketoprofen (KP) or clindamycine hydrochloride (CH) were solubilized in both kinds of HIPREs and the influence of the composition of the aqueous phase on drug release was studied. Droplet sizes of the W/O HIPREs formed were in the nanometric range, being smaller than other HIPREs described in the literature. Dynamic viscoelastic measurements showed an increase in the elastic modulus (G’) of the emulsions in the presence of alginate or crosslinked alginate. The influence of the order of incorporation of alginate and calcium chloride on the viscosity was demonstrated, as an indication of crosslinking efficiency. KP release to a PBS receptor solution was slower when crosslinked alginate was formed in the internal phase of W/O HIPREs. In contrast, the influence of crosslinked alginate on the release of CH was negligible and the solubility of the drug in the disperse phase demonstrated to be the main mechanism responsible of CH diffusion. The results obtained suggest that the formation of a crosslinked alginate matrix in the internal phase of HIPREs is a factor that has to be taken into account in the development of controlled drug delivery systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium alginate 3acalcium chloride 3acastor oil 3acrosslinking 3adrug delivery systems 3aemulsions 3aketoprofen 3amodulus of elasticity 3asodium alginate 3asolubility 3asolubilization 3asurfactants 3aviscoelasticity 3aviscosity 0aHigh internal phase ratio emulsion 0adiffusion 0acontrolled drug release 0acrosslinked calcium alginate 0aketoprofen 0aclindamycine hydrochloride1 aArias, Eva M.1 aSolans, C.,1 aGarcía-Celma, María José0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.07.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02002naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011700173520096500290592002801255650001701283650001601300650002101316650001101337651000901348653002101357653002401378653001501402653002301417700002901440773011201469856008601581852000901667655001201676IND60681566020221122041021.0220906e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068156602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1201172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhakzad, Abolfazl14aThe effect of inspection on deterioration rate: An inventory model for deteriorating items with advanced payment  aIn many inventory deterioration problems of real world, deterioration rate of some items may be affected by other adjacent items. Accordingly, the effect of deteriorated items on other items could be declined by removing them through inspection. In this sense, an inventory model for deteriorating items is introduced in this paper, considering the effect of inspection times during the replenishment period on average deterioration rate. Also, supplier is considered to impose some prepayments to the retailer. In the proposed model, the average deterioration rate is related to the number of inspections at each period. Likewise, to illustrate the uniqueness of the solution, the convexity of the model is proved. Moreover, the proposed model is validated by discussing and analyzing a case study in Iran through which noticeable results are achieved. The findings indicate that compared to previous models, the proposed model is superior in cost management.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3ainventories 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aIran 0aInventory models 0aDeteriorating items 0aInspection 0aDeterioration rate1 aGholamian, Mohammad Reza0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 May 01, v. 254 p.120117-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1201173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245005900174300001600233520114900249592002801398650001201426650001601438650001101454650001801465650002101483650001101504650002301515650001301538650001701551650001501568650001601583650002501599650001901624700002201643700003701665700002601702700002101728700001801749773014001767856008201907852000901989655001201998IND60590025820221122143907.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059002582DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-017-2965-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaranowska, HannaMaria10aWater properties in pâtés enriched with potato juice  ap. 387-393.  aFreshly squeezed potato juice was used in the traditional European folk medicine. Potato juice can be introduced into food products both in its fresh as well as in thermally preserved form as a component of functional food. An attempt was made to analyse the impact of potato juice supplementation on qualitative and quantitative parameters characterising water bonds in poultry meat batters and pâtés. On the basis of temperature studies of water activity changes and spin–lattice and spin–spin relaxation times, the authors determined energy values of water transport in meat batters. It was found that supplementation with fresh potato juice limited significantly water transport. The performed analyses of temperature value changes of T ₂ spin–spin relaxation times revealed significant differences in the molecular dynamics of both water fractions in temperatures exceeding 50 °C. Measurement results of relaxation times in pâtés demonstrated that the amount of free water in relation to the amount of bound water in the examined systems depended on the addition of the probiotic factor and on the form in which it was added.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatters 3abound water 3aenergy 3afood research 3afunctional foods 3ajuices 3amolecular dynamics 3apotatoes 3apoultry meat 3aprobiotics 3atemperature 3atraditional medicine 3awater activity1 aMasewicz, Łukasz1 aKowalczewski, PrzemysławŁukasz1 aLewandowicz, Grażyna1 aPiątek, Michał1 aKubiak, Piotr0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2018 Mar., v. 244, no. 3 p.387-393dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58946x1438-23777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-017-2965-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094024002200120024001900142040001800161100002100179245011200200300001600312506007600328520165200404592002802056506003702084650003002121650001502151650001102166650001302177650002102190650001402211650001402225650001702239650002002256650001702276650001902293650001702312650001502329650001102344650001902355650001302374700002202387700001502409700002202424700002102446700002002467700002002487700002002507773012702527856007202654852000902726655001202735IND60663045520221207125239.0190909e20090601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066304552DNAL7 a10.1039/b904890a2doi7 aPMC27968412pmcid7 a200237452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlson, Emilia S.10aIn vivo characterization of activatable cell penetrating peptides for targeting protease activity in cancer  ap. 382-393.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aActivatable cell penetrating peptides (ACPPs) are novel in vivo targeting agents comprised of a polycationic cell penetrating peptide (CPP) connected via a cleavable linker to a neutralizing polyanion (Fig. 1A). Adsorption and uptake into cells are inhibited until the linker is proteolyzed. An ACPP cleavable by matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in vitro was the first one demonstrated to work in a tumor model in vivo, but only HT-1080 xenografts and resected human squamous cell carcinomas were tested. Generality to other cancer types, in vivo selectivity of ACPPs for MMPs, and spatial resolution require further characterization. We now show that ACPPs can target many xenograft tumor models from different cancer sites, as well as a thoroughly studied transgenic model of spontaneous breast cancer (mouse mammary tumor virus promoter driving polyoma middle T antigen, MMTV-PyMT). Pharmacological inhibitors and genetic knockouts indicate that current ACPPs are selective for MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the above in vivo models. In accord with the known local distribution of MMP activity, accumulation is strongest at the tumor–stromal interface in primary tumors and associated metastases, indicating better spatial resolution (<50 μm) than other currently available MMP-cleavable probes. We also find that background uptake of ACPPs into normal tissues such as cartilage can be decreased by appending inert macromolecules of 30–50 KDa to the polyanionic inhibitory domain. Our results validate an approach that should generally deliver imaging agents and chemotherapeutics to sites of invasion, tumor-promoting inflammation, and metastasis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMouse mammary tumor virus 3aadsorption 3aanions 3aantigens 3abreast neoplasms 3acarcinoma 3acartilage 3adrug therapy 3aenzyme activity 3agelatinase A 3aimage analysis 3ainflammation 3ametastasis 3amodels 3aneutralization 3apeptides1 aAguilera, Todd A.1 aJiang, Tao1 aEllies, Lesley G.1 aNguyen, Quyen T.1 aWong, Edmund H.1 aGross, Larry A.1 aTsien, Roger Y.0 tIntegrative biology.g2009 June 1, v. 1, no. 5-6 p.382-393dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26905x1757-97087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b904890a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02038naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005700145245015100202300002000353520061400373592002800987650002301015650001001038650001601048650002401064650002401088650002201112650001301134650001401147700001901161700005901180700001901239700005501258700005601313700005901369773013601428856007901564852000901643655001201652IND60712062320221117224114.0201009e20200827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071206232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.0c016862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Chuan-Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3821-396310aMicrowave-Assisted Copper Catalysis of α-Difluorinated gem-Diol toward Difluoroalkyl Radical for Hydrodifluoroalkylation of para-Quinone Methides  ap. 12785-12796.  aReported herein is a unified strategy to generate difluoroalkyl radicals from readily prepared α-difluorinated gem-diols by single electron oxidation.

The synthetic utility of this new methodology was also explored for the synthesis of difluoroalkylated spiro-cyclohexadienones, which is an important core structure in natural products and pharmaceuticals.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3adrugs 3amethodology 3amicrowave radiation 3amicrowave treatment 3aorganic chemistry 3aoxidants 3aoxidation1 aSong, Gui-Ting1 aTang, Dian-Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9389-870X1 aShao, Jing-Wei1 aLi, Hong-yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9212-20101 aXu, Zhi-Gang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0190-13131 aChen, Zhong-Zhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9555-67380 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2020 Aug. 27, v. 85, no. 19 p.12785-12796dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.0c016863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00999naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012100169300001600290500001500306520000800321592002800329650001000357650001500367650001400382651002600396653001100422700001500433700002200448773009900470856008200569961001300651852000900664655001200673IND60121201420221123041117.0190910e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012120142DNAL7 a10.1007/s13592-014-0271-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrange, James P.12aA scientific note on Bombus (Psithyrus) insularis invasions of bumblebee nests and honeybee hives in the western USA  ap. 554-556.  a2019-12-04  aᅟ  aPublisher supplied data 3anests 3ahoney bees 3aPsithyrus 3aWestern United States 0aBombus1 aBaur, Abby1 aKoch, Jonathan B.0 tApidologie.g2014 Sept., v. 45, no. 5 p.554-556dSpringer PariswJournal:1968x0044-84357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13592-014-0271-83Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012700171300001800298520094700316592002801263596016201291650001101453650001401464650001701478650002001495650001801515650001401533650001301547650001401560653002301574653002901597653002501626653002601651653003001677700005601707773014401763856008601907852000901993655001202002IND60777919920221118062951.0220523e20220513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077791992DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c003592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaq, Tanveer ul10aNiOₓ–FeOₓ Nanoclusters Anchored on g-C₃N₄ Sheets for Selective Seawater Oxidation with High Corrosion Resistance  ap. 6622-6632.  aNickel-iron oxides have been suggested to be an efficient and selective low-cost anode for seawater oxidation due to their unique orbital confinement and compatible electronic structure. However, their poor stability at high current density in corrosive seawater is the main bottleneck in the seawater electrolysis for H₂ production. Herein, a g-C₃N₄-supported Ni–Fe oxide nanocluster (NiOₓ–FeOₓ@g-C₃N₄) as an efficient and durable anode for alkaline seawater oxidation is reported. The experimental findings demonstrate that the NiOₓ–FeOₓ@g-C₃N₄ anode is more anticorrosive than pristine NiOₓ–FeOₓ NCs. The synergistic effect of the heterostructure enhances the corrosion resistance, structural integrity, and accelerates the gas release ability, resulting in outstanding sustainability over 100 h of continuous electrolysis at high current density without noticeable degradation and hypochlorite formation.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcTexas A and M University-Kingsville, Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Frank H.

This work for the first time provides evidence that a phytochemical may modulate the arachidonate (AA) metabolism in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages, promoting the ultimate formation of anti-inflammatory cyclopentenone 15deoxy-PGJ2. Added 1h before LPS, indicaxanthin from Opuntia Ficus Indica prevented activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and over-expression of PGE2 synthase-1 (mPGES-1), but up-regulated cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) and PGD2 synthase (H-PGDS), with final production of the anti-inflammatory cyclopentenone. The effects were positively related with concentration between 50 and 100µM. Indicaxanthin did not have any effect in the absence of LPS.A kinetic study investigating the redox status of LPS-stimulated macrophages between 0.5 and 12h, either in the absence or in the presence of 50–100µM indicaxanthin, revealed a differential control of ROS production, with early (0.5–3h) modest inhibition, followed by a progressive (3–12h) concentration-dependent enhancement over the level induced by LPS alone. In addition, indicaxanthin caused early (0.5–3h) concentration-dependent elevation of conjugated diene lipid hydroperoxides, and production of hydroxynonenal-protein adducts, over the amount induced by LPS. In LPS-stimulated macrophages indicaxanthin did not affect PG metabolism when co-incubated with either an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase or vitamin E. It is concluded that LPS-induced pro-oxidant activity of indicaxanthin at the membrane level allows formation of signaling intermediates whose accumulation modulates PG biosynthetic pathway in inflamed macrophages.  aPublisher supplied data 0aIndicaxanthin 0aPhytochemicals 0aEicosanoids 0aInflammation 0aOxidative stress1 aD’Acquisto, F.1 aTesoriere, L.1 aAttanzio, A.1 aLivrea, M.A.0 tRedox Biology.g2014, v. 2 p.892-900dElsevier B.V.x2213-23177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2014.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008800172520164900260592002801909650002401937650001101961650002301972650001601995650001702011650001502028650002902043650002602072650001802098650001702116650001502133650001602148650002002164653002602184653001102210653001502221653001302236653002502249653001902274653001702293653001802310700001702328700001502345773011202360856008602472852000902558655001202567IND60681566120221120084844.0220906e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068156612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1201192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrazzabosco, A.10aQuantification of renewable electricity generation in the Australian water industry  aWater and wastewater utilities have increasingly invested in on-site renewable electricity generation to address rising energy costs, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and meet renewable energy targets. Yet, the extent to which renewable electricity sources are currently adopted by these utilities is unknown. This work quantifies the current level of renewable electricity generated by Australian water and wastewater utilities, the renewable electricity sources adopted, and their overall contribution to the total water industry electricity generation. In 2018, the Australian water industry generated 18% (279 GWh/y) of its electricity demand from on-site renewable electricity sources. Biogas from anaerobic digestion of wastewater and sewage sludge accounted for 67% (187 GWh/y) of the electricity generated, followed by hydropower (30%, 84 GWh/y), biogas from co-digestion and waste-to-energy through anaerobic digestion of organic feedstock (2%, 5.5 GWh/y), and solar photovoltaic (1%, 2.2 GWh/y). Further recovery of biogas from wastewater and sewage sludge might be limited by the economies of scale. However, hydropower could still be an untapped resource. Solar photovoltaic did not contribute significantly to the electricity generation of the industry, and space requirements to install large systems might limit its future development to a more significant level of electricity generation. To increase electricity generation and achieve the renewable energy targets, external energy sources will need to be imported, such as organic feedstock in co-digestion systems or waste-to-energy through anaerobic digestion facilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3aeconomies of scale 3aelectricity 3aenergy costs 3afeedstocks 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3arenewable electricity 3asewage sludge 3asolar energy 3awastewater 3awater power 3awater utilities 0aRenewable electricity 0aBiogas 0aHydropower 0aSolar PV 0aWater and wastewater 0aQuantification 0aBenchmarking 0aUtility scale1 aKenway, S.J.1 aLant, P.A.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 May 01, v. 254 p.120119-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1201193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01804naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245006900176300001600245520090700261592002801168650001201196650001401208650001201222650000901234650001901243650001001262700002001272773011901292856008201411852000901493655001201502IND60616931220221118145320.0181021e200302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061693122DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517503073002092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuo, Chung-Feng Jeffrey12aA Back-Propagation Neural Network for Recognizing Fabric Defects  ap. 147-151.  aAppearance is an important property of fabrics. Traditionally, fabric ins on is done by workers, but it is so subjective that accuracy is a problem because inspectors tire easily and suffer eyestrain. To overcome these disadvantages, an image system is used as the detecting tool in this paper. A plain white fabric is adopted as the sample, and the distinguishing defects are holes, oil stains, warp-lacking, and weft-lacking. An area scan camera with 512 × 512 resolution is used in the scheme, and a grabbed image is transmitted to a computer for filtering and thresholding. The corresponding image data are then used in the back-propagation neural network as input. There are three input units, maximum length, maximum width, and gray level of fabric defects, in the input layer of the neural network. This system is successfully employed to determine nonlinear properties and enhance recognition.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3acomputers 3afabrics 3aoils 3atextile fibers 3atires1 aLee, Ching-Jeng0 tTextile research journal.g2003 Feb., v. 73, no. 2 p.147-151dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517503073002093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013000167520154000297592002801837650002501865650003101890650002201921650003001943650002001973650002101993650002002014650002502034650002602059650001502085650001902100650001302119650001602132650001102148650001402159650001902173650001002192651001702202653001702219653002902236653002002265653001402285700001402299700001502313700002002328773009902348856008502447852000902532655001202541IND60686132720221119045307.0200501e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068613272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2020.1051462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKgatle, M.G.10aControl of Alternaria leaf blight caused by Alternaria alternata on sunflower using fungicides and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens  aRecent sunflower disease surveys in the major production fields of South Africa reported Alternaria alternata (Fries) Kiessler as the main causal agent of Alternaria leaf blight (ALB). The economic impact of ALB caused by A. alternata on sunflower in South Africa is unknown and there are currently no fungicide treatments registered for its control. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of five fungicides and one biological control agent (Integral® Pro, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens) as seed treatments, and three spray fungicides to control ALB on sunflower over three sunflower growing seasons (2013/14, 2014/15 and 2015/16). Alternaria leaf blight developed as early as three weeks after emergence in field trials, suggesting seed transmission of the pathogen. Alternaria leaf blight severity negatively correlated with 1000-seed weight (r = −0.33). Seed-borne A. alternata was significantly reduced in the field by treating seeds with Celest® XL and Dynasty® CST. Integral® Pro showed potential for future use as part of an integrated control measure for ALB of sunflower. Abacus® and Amistar® TOP were the most effective spray fungicides in reducing ALB disease severity. As ALB of sunflower has numerous possible sources of inoculum such as wind-blown inoculum, infected seed and plant debris, control should include various approaches. In this study the use of strobilurin-based fungicide seed treatments and spray fungicides both reduced ALB disease severity and also delayed sunflower leaf senescence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria alternata 3aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 3aHelianthus annuus 3abiological control agents 3acontrol methods 3adisease severity 3adisease surveys 3adisease transmission 3afield experimentation 3afungicides 3agrowing season 3ainoculum 3aleaf blight 3aleaves 3apathogens 3aseed treatment 3aseeds 3aSouth Africa 0aField trials 0aFungicide spray programs 0aSeed treatments 0aSunflower1 aFlett, B.1 aTruter, M.1 aAveling, T.A.S.0 tCrop protection.g2020 June, v. 132 p.105146-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2020.1051463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245010600163300001400269520167300283592002801956650001501984650001001999650002702009650001102036650001902047650001402066650002002080650001702100650001002117650000902127650000902136650001502145650001802160650001002178650001702188700001602205700001502221773008502236856008402321852000902405655001202414IND60635703420221123033337.0190403e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063570342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2015.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarg, A.10aTranspiration reduction and root distribution functions for a non-crop species Schefflera heptaphylla  ap. 78-82.  aQuantifying soil suction induced by plant transpiration is vital for engineers to analyse the performance of geotechnical infrastructure such as landfill covers. Transpiration reduction function (Trf) and root distribution function (Rdf) are the two plant properties that govern root-water uptake ability. These two functions have been quantified for various crop species, but they are sometimes used to study the behaviour of non-crop species, even though these two functions are known to be plant-specific. In this study, specific Trf and Rdf were measured for six replicates of Schefflera heptaphylla that have a range of leaf area index (LAI) from 1.0 to 3.5 in clayey sand with gravel. S. heptaphylla is a non-crop tree species that has been commonly used for ecological restoration in many subtropical regions of the world. Trf of each replicate was obtained by relating normalized transpiration rate with suction. After testing, the root system of each tree individual was imaged to determine the normalized root area index (RAI) profile (i.e., Rdf). The normalized transpiration rate for S. heptaphylla with higher LAI (3 and 3.5) is revealed to have lower tolerance of water stress as their normalized transpiration rate reduced at much lower suctions, as compared to those with lower LAI (i.e., 1–2.5). Only when suction is lower than 50kPa, the measured Trf of S. heptaphylla is similar to some of those presumed in the literature. The measurement of Rdf shows that the maximum amount of roots for S. heptaphylla was at depths of 70–80% of the root depth, in contrast to crops species whose root distribution is typically uniform or linearly decreasing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchefflera 3acrops 3aecological restoration 3agravel 3ainfrastructure 3alandfills 3aleaf area index 3aroot systems 3aroots 3asand 3asoil 3asubtropics 3atranspiration 3atrees 3awater stress1 aLeung, A.K.1 aNg, C.W.W.0 tCatena.g2015 Dec., v. 135 p.78-82dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2015.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02490naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094024002200120024001900142040001800161100001800179245009000197300001600287506007600303520129500379592002801674506003701702650002601739650002601765650001001791650003801801650001801839650002601857650001901883700001801902773012701920856007202047852000902119655001202128IND60663045620221207125148.0190909e20090601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066304562DNAL7 a10.1039/b905502a2doi7 aPMC71085502pmcid7 a200237422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBirtwell, Sam10aMicroparticle encoding technologies for high-throughput multiplexed suspension assays  ap. 345-362.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe requirement for analysis of large numbers of biomolecules for drug discovery and clinical diagnostics has driven the development of low-cost, flexible and high-throughput methods for simultaneous detection of multiple molecular targets in a single sample (multiplexed analysis). The technique that seems most likely to satisfy all of these requirements is the multiplexed suspension (bead-based) assay, which offers a number of advantages over alternative approaches such as ELISAs and microarrays. In a bead based assay, different probe molecules are attached to different beads (of a few tens of microns in size), which are then reacted in suspension with the target sample. After reaction, the beads must be identifiable in order to determine the attached probe molecule, and thus each bead must be labelled (encoded) with a unique identifier. A large number of techniques have been proposed for encoding beads. This critical review analyses each technology on the basis of its ability to fulfil the practical requirements of assays, whilst being compatible with low-cost, high-throughput manufacturing processes and high-throughput detection methods. As a result, we identify the most likely candidates to be used for future integrated device development for practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiochemical compounds 3adiagnostic techniques 3adrugs 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3amanufacturing 3amicroarray technology 3amicroparticles1 aMorgan, Hywel0 tIntegrative biology.g2009 June 1, v. 1, no. 5-6 p.345-362dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26905x1757-97087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b905502a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245015600173520118800329592002801517650002201545650002401567650001901591650001101610650002501621650001301646650001501659650002901674650002901703650002901732650001901761650001101780650003301791650001001824650002101834650001601855653005101871653002101922653001501943653001401958653002201972653000801994700002002002700002602022700001802048700002602066700002202092700002202114773011202136856008602248852000902334655001202343IND60681566220221122041143.0220906e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068156622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1201262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehdipour, Sadegh10aMechanical properties, durability and environmental evaluation of rubberized concrete incorporating steel fiber and metakaolin at elevated temperatures  aIn this study, the effects of metakaolin (MK), as a replacement for the Portland cement, in the ratios of 0%, 10% and 20% by cement weight and steel fiber (SF) dosages of 0%, 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1% by concrete volume were investigated on the microstructure, mechanical properties, durability and global warming potential (GWP) of concrete containing 25% volume percentage of crumb rubber replaced with natural fine aggregates at elevated temperatures. Several specimens were exposed to the high temperatures of 150, 300, 450 and 600 °C for an hour, and were then compared in terms of mass loss, compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), splitting tensile strength (STS), and impact resistance at the ambient temperature. The role of MK and SF on the concrete microstructure at high temperatures was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. The results show that not only does the combination of MK and SF improve the mechanical properties and durability of rubberized concrete at high temperatures, but it can also introduce more environmentally friendly mixes by reducing CO₂ emissions, compared to a plain concrete mix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3acement 3acompression strength 3aconcrete 3adurability 3aenvironmental assessment 3aglobal warming potential 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amicrostructure 3arubber 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asteel 3atensile strength 3aultrasonics 0aRubberized and steel fiber reinforced concrete 0aHigh temperature 0aMetakaolin 0aMass loss 0aImpact resistance 0aGWP1 aNikbin, Iman.M.1 aDezhampanah, Soudabeh1 aMohebbi, Reza1 aMoghadam, HamidHabibi1 aCharkhtab, Shahin1 aMoradi, Abolhasan0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 May 01, v. 254 p.120126-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1201263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009100167300002000258520119900278592002801477650000901505650001601514650002201530650001101552650002301563650001501586650001401601650001401615650002601629650001201655650000901667650001801676650000901694650002001703650001101723650001401734650001801748650001501766650001501781650001101796651001001807700002101817700001901838700001501857700002301872700002001895773014901915856008102064852000902145655001202154IND60569600120221121223857.0170608e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056960012DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-7377-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiao -Wen10aEvaluation of estrogenic activity in the Pearl River by using effect-directed analysis  ap. 21692-21702.  aThis study investigated estrogenic activity of water, sediment, and fish bile of the Pearl River in southern China by effect-directed analysis based on in vitro yeast screen assay and chemical analysis. Results showed higher estradiol equivalents (EEQ) for surface water in dry season than in wet season. Simple risk assessment suggested that high estrogenic risk would be expected in Shima River and Danshui River receiving discharge of effluents from cities in the region. Fractionation and effect-directed analysis showed that estrogenic activity mainly occurred in relatively polar fractions of surface water. Seven target estrogenic compounds (bisphenol A, 4-nonylphenol, 4-tert-octylphenol, 17α-ethynyl estradiol, estrone, diethylstilbestrol, and 17β-estradiol) only accounted for part of the measured estrogenic activity, with the rest contributions from other potential estrogenic chemicals such as phenols. Findings from this study suggest that fish in the river could be affected by those estrogenic chemicals. Proper measures should be taken to reduce the estrogenic activity in wastewaters before they are discharged into the riverine system in order to protect aquatic organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3abile 3abisphenol A 3achemical analysis 3acities 3adiethylstilbestrol 3adry season 3aeffluents 3aestradiol 3aestrogenic properties 3aestrone 3afish 3afractionation 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3asediments 3asurface water 3awastewater 3awet season 3ayeasts 3aChina1 aZhao, Jian-Liang1 aLiu, You-Sheng1 aHu, Li-Xin1 aLiu, Shuang-Shuang1 aYing, Guang-Guo0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Nov., v. 23, no. 21 p.21692-21702dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7377-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02111naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245010200210300002000312520084500332592002801177653001201205653002201217653001401239653002001253653001401273700002001287700001801307700002601325700002501351700002501376700002101401700002101422773019401443856007901637852000901716655001201725IND60518024720221120210744.0160406e20151222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051802472DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15115931122doi7 aPMC46974082pmcid7 a266445592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBocarsly, Miriam E.10aObesity diminishes synaptic markers, alters microglial morphology, and impairs cognitive function  ap. 15731-15736.  aSignificance In humans, obesity impairs cognition and produces atrophy of brain regions associated with learning and memory, but few studies have investigated the underlying cellular mechanisms. We used a diet-induced model of obesity in rats to study excessive weight gain and found that early stage obesity, before the onset of diabetes or metabolic syndrome, produced deficits on cognitive tasks that require the prefrontal cortex. Impaired cognition was associated with synapse loss, including reduced numbers of dendritic spines and expression of synaptic proteins, as well as structural alterations in the brain’s immune cells, the microglia. These results strongly suggest that obesity must be considered as a contributing factor to brain dysfunction, with implications for its increasing frequency in contemporary western society.  aPublisher supplied data 0aobesity 0aprefrontal cortex 0acognition 0adendritic spine 0amicroglia1 aFasolino, Maria1 aKane, Gary A.1 aLaMarca, Elizabeth A.1 aKirschen, Gregory W.1 aKaratsoreos, Ilia N.1 aMcEwen, Bruce S.1 aGould, Elizabeth0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Dec. 22, v. 112, no. 51 p.15731-15736dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15115931123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01829naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011900168300001600287520081200303592002801115650001101143650001401154650001301168650001501181650001301196650001301209650001001222651001701232700002601249700004201275773008401317856008101401852000901482655001201491IND60439612920221120162132.0151024e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043961292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10745-015-9755-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlexander, Jamie14aThe Landscape of Childhood: Play and Place as Tools to Understanding Children’s Enviromental Use and Perceptions  ap. 467-480.  aResearch has shown that children are the greatest users of natural areas and that childhood experiences strongly shape adults’ environmental values.

Several factors influenced children’s environmental use, including safety fears, increased consumption of western media and environmental restrictions imposed by the state, revealing how South Africa’s high level of violence against women and children contributes to gendered environmental use and knowledge, and bringing about concern for children’s cultural identity in an increasingly westernised world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3achildhood 3achildren 3alandscapes 3avillages 3aviolence 3awomen 3aSouth Africa1 aCocks, Michelle Linda1 aShackleton, C.

Exploring trade-offs between ESs and linking them with stakeholders can help reveal the potential losers and winners of land use changes. In this paper, we demonstrate that ES trade-offs do not always go hand in hand with conflicts. The perception of local stakeholders about trade-offs between ESs at three protected sites in the Great Hungarian Plain were assessed through qualitative methods. In all areas significant conservation measures had been introduced since the 1990s resulting in land use changes. Locals (farmers at each site and inhabitants at one site) were the main ‘losers’ of the land use changes and related ES trade-offs, while there were many winners at different spatial and temporal scales. Conflicts appeared only between locals and the national park directorates, and not between locals and other beneficiaries of the new ESs. Due to scale mismatch, locals might not be in direct contact with other stakeholders, and vice versa, and therefore there is no interface between them for confrontation and negotiation. Integrating scale into the analysis also helps in advising policy instruments to minimise local-level conflicts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation areas 3adirect contact 3aecosystem services 3afarmers 3aland use change 3anational parks 3aqualitative analysis 3astakeholders 0aEcosystem services 0aTrade-offs 0aQualitative research 0aLand use conflicts 0aScale 0aProtected areas1 aKelemen, Eszter1 aKalóczkai, Ágnes1 aMargóczi, Katalin1 aPataki, György,1 aGébert, Judit1 aMálovics, György1 aBalázs, Bálint1 aRoboz, Agnes,1 aKrasznai Kovács, Eszter1 aMihók, Barbara0 tEcosystem services.g2015 Apr., v. 12 p.117-127dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2014.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245012900177300001600306520136900322592002801691650002001719650001901739650001501758650001601773650002201789650001801811650001101829650001301840650001501853650001101868651001801879700001901897773011201916856008102028852000902109655001202118IND60121201820221123025120.0150217e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012120182DNAL7 a10.1007/s10640-013-9720-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRødseth, Kenneth Løvold10aEnvironmental Regulations, Producer Responses, and Secondary Benefits: Carbon Dioxide Reductions Under the Acid Rain Program  ap. 111-135.  aThis paper derives a production analysis framework for modeling secondary benefits from environmental regulation, i.e. induced changes in yet unregulated pollutants. We emphasize the various ways in which the producers can respond to environmental regulations, and evaluate them in terms of their costs and their generation of secondary benefits. An application on the US electricity sector illustrates our main point: In our case, abatement technologies that reduce regulated emissions while leaving the plants’ unregulated emissions unchanged appear to be among the least costly producer responses to the existing sulfur and nitrogen regulations, but at the expense of limited secondary reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. This finding raises questions about the magnitude of the much debated secondary benefits from future regulations on carbon dioxide emissions, since similar abatement technologies are currently being developed for carbon dioxide. With new environmental issues emerging over time, our findings suggest that regulators should signal the possibilities of new regulations on connected pollutants to producers. Such information may be relevant for producers when choosing current abatement strategies—with minor cost increases to deal with today’s issues, overall compliance costs for near-future environmental problems may be lowered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid deposition 3acarbon dioxide 3acompliance 3aelectricity 3aenvironmental law 3agas emissions 3amodels 3anitrogen 3apollutants 3asulfur 3aUnited States1 aRomstad, Eirik0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2014 Sept., v. 59, no. 1 p.111-135dSpringer-Verlagx0924-64607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-013-9720-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01441naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245005300169300001600222520061900238592002800857650001700885650001400902650001500916650001100931650001700942650001200959773008700971856008401058852000901142655001201151IND60635703620221123033256.0190403e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063570362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2016.03.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoardman, John14aThe value of Google Earth™ for erosion mapping  ap. 123-127.  aGoogle Earth™ (GE) has been used in several geomorphological contexts, especially in the study of river networks, glacial, coastal, landslides and desert landforms. In some cases, quantification is possible and landform-process relations can be inferred. GE has been little used in studies of contemporary soil erosion. This brief case study illustrates the potential for quick, free and accurate surveys that are particularly valuable as an aid to field work. The main drawback of GE is the arbitrary timing of imagery, in this case with only 3years of complete coverage of the study area between 2001 and 2015.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3alandforms 3alandslides 3arivers 3asoil erosion 3asurveys0 tCatena.g2016 Aug., v. 143 p.123-127dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2016.03.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01612naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006200168300001600230520046900246592002800715650001800743650001700761650001400778650003600792650001500828650001500843650002200858650004400880650001200924700002100936700001900957700002700976700002501003773012001028856008101148852000901229655001201238IND60614172520221119230343.0181002e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061417252DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-018-2499-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlennikov, D.

There is currently no standardized method for quantifying cumulative vaccination maintenance, however, and no simple way to explore predictors of adherence to vaccination schedules. We therefore sought to (1) develop a Vaccination Maintenance Score (VMS) and (2) apply this score to determine the predictors of vaccination behavior among infants in western Kenya (n = 245).Women in western Kenya were enrolled during pregnancy and surveyed repeatedly through one year postpartum. Data were collected on a range of sociodemographic and health indicators and vaccinations. For each infant, we analyzed receipt of 11 vaccines recommended by the Kenyan Ministry of Health. We operationalized VMS as the total number of vaccines received on schedule. Vaccines that were not received or received off schedule were scored 0. VMS was modeled using multivariable tobit regression models.We found that 85.7% of infants were fully immunized, but only 42.4% had optimal VMS, i.e. scored 11. The median (IQR) VMS was 10 (3). In multivariable regression, each one-point increase in maternal quality of life score (range: 0–32) was associated with a 0.22-point increase in VMS; each additional child in the household was associated with a 0.34-point increase in VMS; and initiating breastfeeding at birth was associated a 2.01-point increase in VMS.Coverage of the recommended vaccinations (85.7%) was nearly twice as high as cumulative timely receipt (42.4%). The VMS satisfies a need for a location-specific but easily adaptable metric of vaccination adherence behavior. It can be used to complement traditional methods of vaccination coverage and timeliness to better understand underlying behaviors that influence vaccination events, and thereby inform interventions to improve vaccination rates and decrease the burden of vaccine-preventable disease.NCT02974972 and NCT02979418.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreast feeding 3achildren 3ainfants 3apregnancy 3apublic health 3aquality of life 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aKenya 0aVaccination coverage 0aVaccination adherence 0aVaccination maintenance 0aVaccination timeliness 0asub-Saharan Africa 0aVMS 0atOPV 0aIFIAS 0aCES-D 0aPSS 0aSF-8 0aBCG 0aANC 0aQOL 0aEBF 0aKEPI 0aWHO 0aHIV 0aDHS1 aMiller, Joshua D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2171-856X1 aOnono, Maricianah1 aYoung, Sera L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1763-12180 tVaccine.g2020 Apr. 16, v. 38, no. 18 p.3429-3435dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02116naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245007800155300001600233520107900249592002801328650003101356650002901387650002001416650001901436650001401455650001801469650002501487700002101512700001701533700001901550773012801569856007201697852000901769655001201778IND60663045820221122061052.0190909e20090930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066304582DNAL7 a10.1039/b905844c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jungkyu10aMicrofluidic sample preparation: cell lysis and nucleic acid purification  ap. 574-586.  aDue to the lack of development in the area of sample preparation, few complete lab-on-a-chip systems have appeared in recent years that can deal with raw samples. Cell lysis and nucleic acid extraction systems are sufficiently complex even before adding the complexity of an analysis system. In this review, a variety of microfluidic sample preparation methods are discussed and evaluated. Microsystems for cell lysis are discussed by grouping them into categories based on their lysis mechanisms: mechanical, chemical, thermal or electrical. We classify the nucleic acid purification techniques according to the mechanism that links nucleic acids to substrates: silica-based surface affinity, electrostatic interaction, nanoporous membrane filtration, and functionalized microparticles. The techniques for microfluidic cell lysis and nucleic acid purification are compared based on the ease of microfabrication and integration, and sample flexibility. These assessments can help us determine the appropriate sample preparation technique for generating a true lab-on-a-chip.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrostatic interactions 3alab-on-a-chip technology 3amicrofiltration 3amicroparticles 3ananopores 3anucleic acids 3apurification methods1 aJohnson, Michael1 aHill, Parker1 aGale, Bruce K.0 tIntegrative biology.g2009 Sept. 30, v. 1, no. 10 p.574-586dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26905x1757-97087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b905844c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009800167300001600265520088700281592002801168650001701196650002301213650002301236650001501259650001201274650002401286650001601310653001601326653000901342653002001351653002301371653002701394653001501421700001901436700001801455700001901473773009901492856008501591852000901676655001201685IND60537766120221119111326.0190416e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053776612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoser.2014.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanley, Nick10aMeasuring the economic value of pollination services: Principles, evidence and knowledge gaps  ap. 124-132.  aAn increasing degree of attention is being given to the ecosystem services which insect pollinators supply, and the economic value of these services. Recent research suggests that a range of factors are contributing to a global decline in pollination services, which are often used as a “headline” ecosystem service in terms of communicating the concept of ecosystem services, and how this ties peoples׳ well-being to the condition of ecosystems and the biodiversity found therein. Our paper offers a conceptual framework for measuring the economic value of changes in insect pollinator populations, and then reviews what evidence exists on the empirical magnitude of these values (both market and non-market). This allows us to highlight where the largest gaps in knowledge are, where the greatest conceptual and empirical challenges remain, and where research is most needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aeconomic valuation 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3amarkets 3apollinating insects 3apollination 0aPollination 0aBees 0aEconomic values 0aEcosystem services 0aNatural capital assets 0aThresholds1 aBreeze, Tom D.1 aEllis, Ciaran1 aGoulson, David0 tEcosystem services.g2015 Aug., v. 14 p.124-132dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2014.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002600137245011200163300001600275500002000291520150500311592002801816650001601844650002401860650001801884650001901902650001501921650001001936650000901946650001301955650003101968650001801999650002002017650002002037650001002057650002302067650001402090650001402104650000902118650001902127650001302146651002502159700002602184700002102210700002202231773012302253856007102376852000902447655001202456IND60588539120221117233306.0180118e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058853912DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.47032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichaelides, Georgios10aFunctional response and multiple predator effects of two generalist predators preying on Tuta absoluta eggs  ap. 332-339.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKROUND: Interactions among invertebrate predators could affect a pest suppression. The hemipteran species Macrolophus pygmaeus (Rambur) and Nesidiocoris tenuis (Reuter) (Hemiptera: Miridae) are natural enemies of several pests in agroecosystems and coexist in tomato crops in Mediterranean countries. By using the multiplicative risk model (MRM) and the substitutive model, the multiple predator effects (MPEs) on prey suppression were calculated when two individuals of the predators foraged at the same densities on South American tomato pinworm, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), eggs. RESULTS: Egg consumption increased with increasing egg density and the two predators exhibited a type III functional response. Predation rates were strongly affected by prey density. Using the MRM, we found risk reduction at intraspecific treatments at high prey density. Applying the substitutive model, we detect risk enhancement at interspecific treatments at high egg density. CONCLUSIONS: At low prey densities, most of the interactions were independent, whereas at high densities most interactions were not independent and resulted in prey risk reduction, indicating antagonism between the individuals involved. We also showed that N. tenuis is a more competitive predator species for T. absoluta eggs than M. pygmaeus; however, combination of the two predator species will lead to better pest suppression at high T. absoluta population densities. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrolophus 3aNesidiocoris tenuis 3aTuta absoluta 3aagroecosystems 3aantagonism 3acrops 3aeggs 3aforaging 3afunctional response models 3ainvertebrates 3anatural enemies 3apest management 3apests 3apopulation density 3apredation 3apredators 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3atomatoes 3aMediterranean region1 aSfenthourakis, Spyros1 aPitsillou, Maria1 aSeraphides, Nicos0 tPest management science.g2018 Feb., v. 74, no. 2 p.332-339dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.47033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245012800162300001800290520140200308592002801710650002001738650002801758650002601786650001701812650001001829650001301839650002101852650003201873650001001905650002901915650001301944650001901957653001001976653000801986653002701994653002202021653002302043700001302066700001402079700001902093700001902112773012302131856008002254852000902334655001202343IND60563476020221119085257.0170223e20170222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056347602DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b152002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Rui-Hui10aTAT-Modified Gold Nanoparticle Carrier with Enhanced Anticancer Activity and Size Effect on Overcoming Multidrug Resistance  ap. 5828-5837.  aHighly efficient targeted delivery is crucial for successful anticancer chemotherapy. In this study, we developed a drug delivery system ANS-TAT-AuNP that loads anticancer molecule 2-(9-anthracenylmethylene)-hydrazinecarbothioamide (ANS) via conjugation with cell-penetrating peptide TAT modified AuNPs. The in vitro study showed that the IC₅₀ value of ANS-TAT-AuNPs₃.₈ ₙₘ reduced by 11.28- (24 h) and 12.64-fold (48 h) after incubation with liver hepatocellular carcinoma HepG₂ cells compared to that of free ANS, suggesting that TAT modified AuNPs could enhance the antiproliferative activity of ANS. Also, ANS-TAT-AuNPs showed a size effect on overcoming multidrug resistance (MDR). The potential of ANS-TAT-AuNPs in overcoming MDR was assessed with MCF-7/ADR drug-resistant cell line, the drug resistance index (DRI) of which was extremely high (>190). The DRI of ANS-TAT-AuNPs₂₂.₁ ₙₘ decreased dramatically to 1.48 (24 h) and 2.20 (48 h), while that of ANS-TAT-AuNPs₃.₈ ₙₘ decreased to 7.64 (24 h) and 7.77 (48 h), indicating that ANS-TAT-AuNPs₂₂.₁ ₙₘ could treat extremely resistant MCF-7/ADR cancer cells as drug sensitive ones. The data suggest that the larger AuNPs had more profound effect on overcoming MDR, which could effectively prevent drug efflux due to their size being much larger than that of the p-glycoprotein channel (9–25 Å).  aPublisher supplied data 3aP-glycoproteins 3aantineoplastic activity 3adrug delivery systems 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3ahepatoma 3ain vitro studies 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aliver 3amultiple drug resistance 3ananogold 3aneoplasm cells 0aAuNPs 0aTAT 0aanthracene derivatives 0aantiproliferation 0asize effect on MDR1 aBai, Jie1 aDeng, Jun1 aFang, Chen-Jie1 aChen, Xiaoyuan0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Feb. 22, v. 9, no. 7 p.5828-5837dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b152003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02029naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011000169300001600279520085200295592002801147650003401175650001201209650001701221650002501238650001401263650001801277650001201295650000701307650001601314650001401330650001601344651001101360700002001371700002101391773014001412856008201552852000901634655001201643IND60590026320221122221200.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059002632DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-017-2972-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKapusta, Ireneusz10aCharacterization of polish wines produced from the interspecific hybrid grapes grown in south-east Poland  ap. 441-455.  aThe chemical characterization of 14 wines (six red and eight white) made from interspecific hybrids grown in Poland has been made. The study evaluated basic oenological parameters (acidity, pH, sugars content, alcohols content) as well as polyphenolics composition (UPLC-PDA-MS/MS) and antioxidant activity (ABTS, DPPH, FRAP, ORAC). Additionally, PCA was applied to differentiate tested wines. The content of total phenolics ranged from 74.79 mg/L (Musct Odesski) to 1860.8 mg/L (Regent). The red wines strongly differed in polyphenolics content, while white wine turned out to be similar to each other. Antioxidant activity was strongly correlated with total phenolics content (r ² = 0.98). However, antioxidant potential depended mainly on the type of polyphenolic group: anthocyanins and flavan-3-ols, respectively, in red and white wines.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aacidity 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aflavanols 3afood research 3ahybrids 3apH 3apolyphenols 3ared wines 3awhite wines 3aPoland1 aCebulak, Tomasz1 aOszmiański, Jan0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2018 Mar., v. 244, no. 3 p.441-455dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58946x1438-23777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-017-2972-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009900157300002000256520154100276592002801817650002101845650001501866650002401881650001001905650002801915650001501943650001901958650004101977650002002018650001402038650005202052650001702104700001402121700001402135700001402149700001302163700001602176700001202192700001702204700001502221773012402236856007402360852000902434655001202443IND60642209620221122053127.0190506e20171121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064220962DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra10436g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Tingting10aKISS1 gene suppresses metastasis of nasopharyngeal cancer via activation of the ERK1/2 pathway  ap. 53445-53453.  aNasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) is one of the most common head and neck cancers in the world. The failure of the treatment of NPC is mainly caused by the metastasis of the cancer cells. There is a great need to study the mechanism of metastasis for accurate diagnosis, prognosis and efficient therapeutic strategy. The KISS1 gene has already been reported as a metastasis suppressor in numerous cancers. In this study, by integrating the Transwell assay, western blotting and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, we found that the expression of KISS1 and its receptor gene (hOT7T175, KISS1R) negatively related with the metastasis of NPC cells. Overexpression of the KISS1 and KISS1R genes reduced migration and invasion of the SUNE-1-5-8F cells that are a cell line of NPC. Additionally, overexpression of these genes significantly increased the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and decreased the expression of ezrin (EZR), indicated by western blotting. Further study showed the metastasis suppression role of KISS1 and KISS1R was mediated though phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 pathway for that blocking the phosphorylation of the pathway with inhibitor (PD98059) reversed the metastasis suppression and phosphorylation of FAK as well as up-regulation of EZR simultaneously. Together, all of these results suggested for the first time that KISS1 and KISS1R suppress the metastasis of NPC cells by phosphorylation of FAK and decreasing EZR through phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3acell lines 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahead and neck neoplasms 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3anon-specific protein-tyrosine kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aprognosis 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atherapeutics1 aSun, Qian1 aZhou, Yan1 aHe, Zelai1 aLiu, Hao1 aXiang, Ping1 aXi, Jin1 aZhang, Xiazi1 aJiang, Hao0 tRSC advances.g2017 Nov. 21, v. 7, no. 84 p.53445-53453dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra10436g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04310naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245018700166300001800353520204600371592002802417650001902445650001802464650002802482650002702510650001602537650001002553650001102563650001302574650001902587650002102606650001402627650002402641650002002665650001402685650001702699650002002716650001302736650001702749650001202766650001402778650001302792651001002805653004702815653001402862653001202876653000802888653000802896653000902904653000802913653000802921653000702929653000802936653000802944653001002952653000802962653000702970653000802977653001102985653000702996653000803003653000803011653000903019653000703028653000803035653000803043653001203051653000803063700001303071700001903084700001703103700001503120700001503135700001603150700006103166700001103227773009903238856008603337852000903423655001203432IND60686133020221119045041.0200405e20200416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068613302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Kui10aIncidence rates of health outcomes of interest among Chinese children exposed to selected vaccines in Yinzhou Electronic Health Records: A population-based retrospective cohort study  ap. 3422-3428.  aOral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) and diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) are widely used in China while Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines (Hib) and a DTaP, inactivated poliovirus (IPV) andHib polysaccharide conjugated to tetanus protein (PRP ~ T) combined vaccine (DTaP–IPV//PRP ~ T) have lower coverage. There are limited safety data on these vaccines in Chinese pediatric populations. Methods: To estimate incidence rates (IRs) of health outcomes of interest (HOIs) among children exposed to OPV, DTaP, Hib, and DTaP–IPV//PRP ~ T, we conducted a retrospective cohort study using a population-based electronic health record (EHR) database in Yinzhou district, Ningbo City. Children 0–2 years of age receiving at least one dose of these vaccines between January 1, 2012 and March 31, 2017 were included in the study. Yinzhou EHR database consisted of immunization records and healthcare data of children from hospitals and community health centers in the district. Eight HOIs (i.e., anaphylaxis, febrile seizures, all seizures, asthma, apnea, Kawasaki disease [KD], urticaria/angioedema, Guillain–Barré syndrome [GBS]) were identified using ICD-10 codes. Results: A total of 220,422 eligible children was identified. No cases of apnea, KD, and GBS were observed within 7 days post-vaccination. During 0–7 days post-vaccination for OPV, DTaP, Hib, and DTaP–IPV//PRP ~ T, the IRs of anaphylaxis, febrile seizures, all seizures, urticaria/angioedema and asthma ranged from 0.0 to 50.0, 0.0 to 99.9, 29.1 to 249.8, 297.8 to 949.1, and 992.7 to 2298.2 per 100,000 person-years, respectively, and 0.0 to 0.9, 0.0 to 1.9, 0.6 to 4.6, 5.6 to 17.5, and 18.7 to 42.3 per 100,000 doses, respectively. Conclusion: IRs of some HOIs in our study were comparable with those in the literature while IRs of other HOIs were not due to differences in study design, post-vaccination risk periods assessed, and vaccine types. Future studies should consider medical chart review for validating HOIs obtained in the EHR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese people 3aEnterovirus C 3aGuillain-Barre Syndrome 3aHaemophilus influenzae 3aanaphylaxis 3aapnea 3aasthma 3achildren 3acohort studies 3acommunity health 3adatabases 3aexperimental design 3ahealth services 3ahospitals 3aimmunization 3apolysaccharides 3aseizures 3atelemedicine 3atetanus 3aurticaria 3avaccines 3aChina 0aPopulation-based electronic health records 0aIncidence 0aVaccine 0aEPI 0aOPV 0aDTaP 0aHib 0aCDC 0aIR 0aHOI 0aEHR 0aAEFIS 0aNID 0aKD 0aGBS 0aICD-10 0aCI 0aWHO 0aDTP 0aDTwP 0aUS 0aMMR 0aIPV 0aPhiD-CV 0aHBV1 aTao, Sha1 aZhou, Xiaofeng1 aMo, Jingping1 aZhu, Bowen1 aShen, Peng1 aLin, Hongbo1 aArena, Patrick J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3024-771X1 aHe, Na0 tVaccine.g2020 Apr. 16, v. 38, no. 18 p.3422-3428dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010000168300001600268520144500284592002801729650001301757650001701770650001701787650001901804650002201823650001301845650001101858650001501869650002301884650001601907650001901923650001601942650000901958650001901967650002201986650001702008650001802025650002002043700002102063700002402084700002002108700002202128700002202150773009602172856008102268852000902349655001202358IND60087615220221120134925.0141102e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008761522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2012.03.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPascucci, Simone10aUsing imaging spectroscopy to map red mud dust waste: The Podgorica Aluminum Complex case study  ap. 139-154.  aThe aim of this study is to explore the capability of hyperspectral remote sensing to map areas affected by Red Dust (RD) pollution on soil and river water. The chosen study area contains residues from the extraction of aluminum from bauxite in a mud pond (i.e. the red mud), which contain high concentrations of contaminants such as heavy metals, so that special precaution must be taken when disposing to avoid RD pollution of land surface and river water resources. We perform laboratory analysis and in situ measurements of RD polluted samples to recognize the dominant minerals and identify the optical characteristics of the samples and their spectral features. Both an unsupervised methodology and a shape-based spectral analysis technique, using the significant RD reflectance spectral features, were applied to airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data to map the RD distribution on bare soils. Whereas, to assess a tool for the detection of RD in river waters a semi-analytical model for the radiative transfer in water bodies was used. The results of the spectral shape-based analysis and of the semi-analytical model used for this study were consistent with ground truth data and hence support the application of hyperspectral technologies for a rapid detection and mapping of industrial wastes, such as the RD. This information is suitable to support the development of effective intervention policies and monitoring programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acase studies 3aheavy metals 3aimage analysis 3aindustrial wastes 3aminerals 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aradiative transfer 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3ariver water 3asoil 3asoil pollution 3aspectral analysis 3aspectroscopy 3asurface water 3awater resources1 aBelviso, Claudia1 aCavalli, Rosa Maria1 aPalombo, Angelo1 aPignatti, Stefano1 aSantini, Federico0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2012 Aug., v. 123 p.139-154dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2012.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245012500169300001800294520148000312592002801792650002301820650001701843650002201860650001401882650001801896650002301914650002401937650001701961653001401978653001801992653003502010653003902045653003302084653002602117700002202143700001702165700001902182700002302201700002302224700002602247700002602273700002302299773012402322856008002446852000902526655001202535IND60528882520221120101727.0160717e20160406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052888252DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b005612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlanco, Gwendolyn
D.10aSyntheses, Charge Separation, and Inverted Bulk Heterojunction Solar Cell Application of Phenothiazine–Fullerene Dyads  ap. 8481-8490.  aA series of phenothiazine–fulleropyrrolidine (PTZ-C₆₀) dyads having fullerene either at the C-3 aromatic ring position or at the N-position of phenothiazine macrocycle were newly synthesized and characterized. Photoinduced electron transfer leading to PTZ• ⁺-C₆₀• – charge-separated species was established from studies involving femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Because of the close proximity of the donor and acceptor entities, the C-3 ring substituted PTZ-C₆₀ dyads revealed faster charge separation and charge recombination processes than that observed in the dyad functionalized through the N-position. Next, inverted organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells were constructed using the dyads in place of traditionally used [6,6]-phenyl-C61- butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and an additional electron donor material poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). The performance of the C-3 ring substituted PTZ-C₆₀ dyad having a polyethylene glycol substituent produced a power conversion efficiency of 3.5% under inverted bulk heterojunction (BHJ) configuration. This was attributed to optimal BHJ morphology between the polymer and the dyad, which was further promoted by the efficient intramolecular charge separation and relatively slow charge recombination promoted by the dyad within the BHJ structure. The present finding demonstrate PTZ-C₆₀ dyads as being good prospective materials for building organic photovoltaic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3abutyric acid 3aelectron transfer 3afullerene 3aphenothiazine 3aphotovoltaic cells 3apolyethylene glycol 3aspectroscopy 0afullerene 0aphenothiazine 0aphotoinduced electron transfer 0afemtosecond transient spectroscopy 0ainverted bulk heterojunction 0aorganic photovoltaics1 aHiltunen, Arto J.1 aLim, Gary N.1 aKC, Chandra B.1 aKaunisto, Kimmo M.1 aVuorinen, Tommi

The implementation of new standards and the development of Cleaner production technologies in China, decreased the energy consumption per panel. China’s wood-based panels acted as a carbon sink between 2008 and 2015, with the average contribution to CO<inf>2</inf> removal of 31.71 Mt/year. Plywood produced the largest contributions to the emission and removal of CO<inf>2,</inf> and was followed by fiberboard and particleboard. China’s wood-based panels, with good prospects and strong demands projected in the future, can potentially contribute to climate change mitigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate change 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3afiberboards 3agate-to-gate 3aparticleboards 3aplywood 3aChina1 aZhang, Han1 aNie, Ying1 aYang, Hongqiang0 tForests.g2017 July 29, v. 8, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f80802733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245014400202300001600346520167500362592002802037596013502065650002502200650001402225650001202239650001302251650001402264650001302278650001902291650001002310653001702320653001702337653001802354653003702372700001502409700001702424700001602441700001402457700001402471700001502485773012102500856008002621852000902701655001202710IND60686970020221119053740.0200320e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068697002DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175198798992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHossain, M.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2362-344910aIn situ measurement of the dynamic yarn path in a turbo ring spinning process based on the superconducting magnetic bearing twisting system  ap. 951-968.  aThe yarn tension and balloon form are the most important physical process parameters to characterize the dynamic yarn path in ring spinning. The present research work focuses on the in situ measurement of yarn tension in different regions of the yarn path in a developed turbo ring spinning tester with a friction-free superconducting magnetic bearing (SMB) twisting system and at an angular spindle speed of up to 50,000 rpm. The influence of different parameters, such as angular spindle speeds (15,000–50,000 rpm), yarn counts (15–40 tex) and balloon control ring (one or multiple), were evaluated to identify the influence of acting forces, for example, centrifugal forces. The effects of these process parameters were analyzed statistically using an analysis of variance. The yarn tension between the delivery rollers and the yarn guide was measured using a modified one-roller tensile yarn tension sensor. The yarn tension between the yarn guide and the SMB system was determined with an already existing optical approach at a higher angular spindle speed. As the highest yarn tension theoretically occurs between the SMB system and the cop, it was estimated in this region by measuring the coefficient of friction between the yarn and the yarn guide using the friction module of the constant tension tester equipment. The maximum balloon diameter was determined from the recorded balloon form between the yarn guide and the SMB system with respect to different angular spindle speeds. The results provide valuable information about the highest possible spinnable speed and enable a better understanding of the dynamic yarn path in the SMB spinning system.  aPublisher supplied data  aProject No. CH 174/33-2 and SCHU 1118/12-2cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaftdhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001659 3aanalysis of variance 3aequipment 3afabrics 3afriction 3amagnetism 3aspinning 3atextile fibers 3ayarns 0ayarn tension 0aballoon form 0aring spinning 0asuperconducting magnetic bearing1 aSparing, M1 aEspenhahn, T1 aAbdkader, A1 aCherif, C1 aHühne, R1 aNielsch, K0 tTextile research journal.g2020 Apr., v. 90, no. 7-8 p.951-968dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175198798993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04480naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008100168300001200249520253300261592002802794650002602822650002202848650001702870650001602887650001502903650003902918650001102957650001702968650001702985650002403002650001203026650001603038650002303054650002303077650001703100653001103117653001003128653001003138653000903148653000803157653000803165653001403173653000803187653000703195653000803202653000803210653000903218653001503227653000803242653000703250653000803257653000803265653000903273653001103282653001503293653001603308653001703324653001103341653001903352653002703371700001803398700002703416700001903443700001803462700001703480700002203497773009703519856008503616852000903701655001203710IND60650979320221118012001.0200712e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065097932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2019.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJenny, Lorenz10aMASP-1 of the complement system alters fibrinolytic behaviour of blood clots  ap. 1-9.  aThe lectin pathway serine protease mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease 1 (MASP-1) has been demonstrated to be a major link between complement and coagulation, yet little is known about its interactions with the fibrinolytic system. The aim of this work was to assess the effects of MASP-1 on fibrin clot lysis in different experimental settings.Rotational thrombelastometry was used to evaluate the effect of MASP-1 on the lysis of clots formed in whole blood under static conditions. Whole blood clots were also formed in the presence and absence of MASP-1 under flow conditions in the Chandler loop and their lysis was analysed separately by fluorescence release of incorporated labelled fibrin. Real-time observation by laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to investigate the lysis of plasma clots where MASP-1 was present either during clot formation or lysis. Cleavage of tPA or plasminogen by MASP-1 was analysed by gel electrophoresis. We performed a turbidimetric clot lysis assay in the presence and absence of the MASP-1 inhibitor SGMI-1 (Schistocerca gregaria protease inhibitor (SGPI)-based MASP inhibitor-1) to evaluate the effect of endogenous MASP-1 in normal plasma and plasma samples from sepsis patients.In the thrombelastometric experiments, where MASP-1 was present during the entire clotting and lysis process, MASP-1 had a significant profibrinolytic effect and accelerated clot lysis. When clots were formed in the presence of MASP-1 under flow in the Chandler loop, the effects on fibrinolysis were heterogenous with impaired fibrinolysis in some individuals (n = 5) and no (n = 3) or even the opposite effect (n = 2) in others. In plasma clot lysis observed by confocal microscopy, lysis was prolonged when MASP-1 was added to the lysis solution, yet there was no difference in lysis time when MASP-1 was present during clot formation. When MASP-1 was incubated with tPA or plasminogen, respectively, cleavage of single-chain tPA into two-chain tPA and a slight reduction of plasminogen were observed. SGMI-1 significantly prolonged clot lysis in the turbidimetric clot lysis assay suggesting that MASP-1 accelerated lysis in plasma samples.MASP-1 is able to alter the susceptibility of blood clots to the fibrinolytic system. MASP-1 has complex, mostly promoting effects on fibrinolysis with high inter-individual variation. Interactions of MASP-1 with the fibrinolytic system may be relevant in the development and therapy of cardiovascular and thrombotic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchistocerca gregaria 3ablood coagulation 3ablood plasma 3acoagulation 3acomplement 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3afibrin 3afibrinolysis 3afluorescence 3agel electrophoresis 3alectins 3aplasminogen 3asepsis (infection) 3aserine proteinases 3atherapeutics 0aMASP-1 0aPAI-1 0aFXIII 0aTAFI 0aCVD 0aDIC 0arMASP-1cf 0atPA 0aCT 0aCFT 0aMCF 0aMCFt 0aLI30/45/60 0aLOT 0aLT 0aCLR 0aTLT 0aPAR4 0aSGMI-1 0aComplement 0aCoagulation 0aFibrinolysis 0aMASP-1 0aClot formation 0aCardiovascular disease1 aNoser, Danilo1 aLarsen, Julie Brogaard1 aDobó, József1 aGál, Péter,1 aPál, Gábor1 aSchroeder, Verena0 tMolecular immunology.g2019 Oct., v. 114 p.1-9dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2019.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100009900188245011600287300001600403506007600419520137700495592002801872596004501900596005001945506003701995650001302032650001702045650001902062650001402081650001202095650002002107650002602127650002902153650001202182650001202194650002702206650001302233650001502246650001502261650001102276650001702287650001302304650002402317650001402341650001302355650001302368700003002381700002602411700005902437773012702496856008202623852000902705655001202714IND60593208220221207075413.0191104e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059320822DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-018-0436-z2doi7 aPMC67507222pmcid7 a315342912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerbert, Ellen R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3345-6592 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3345-659210aDifferential effects of chronic and acute simulated seawater intrusion on tidal freshwater marsh carbon cycling  ap. 137-154.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTidal freshwater ecosystems experience acute seawater intrusion associated with periodic droughts, but are expected to become chronically salinized as sea level rises. Here we report the results from an experimental manipulation in a tidal freshwater Zizaniopsis miliacea marsh on the Altamaha River, GA where diluted seawater was added to replicate marsh plots on either a press (constant) or pulse (2 months per year) basis. We measured changes in porewater chemistry (SO₄²⁻, Cl⁻, organic C, inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus), ecosystem CO₂ and CH₄ exchange, and microbial extracellular enzyme activity. We found that press (chronic) seawater additions increased porewater chloride and sulfate almost immediately, and ammonium and phosphate after 2–4 months. Chronic increases in salinity also decreased net ecosystem exchange, resulting in reduced CO₂ and CH₄ emissions from press plots. Our pulse treatment, designed to mimic natural salinity incursion in the Altamaha River (September and October), temporarily increased porewater ammonium concentrations but had few lasting effects on porewater chemistry or ecosystem carbon balance. Our findings suggest that long-term, chronic saltwater intrusion will lead to reduced C fixation and the potential for increased nutrient (N, P) export while acute pulses of saltwater will have temporary effects.  aPublisher supplied data  aOCE-1237140cNational Science Foundation  aGRFP (2011117001cNational Science Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aammonium 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorides 3adrought 3aenzyme activity 3afreshwater ecosystems 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amarshes 3amethane 3anet ecosystem exchange 3anitrogen 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3arivers 3asaline water 3asalinity 3asaltwater intrusion 3asea level 3aseawater 3asulfates1 aSchubauer-Berigan, Joseph1 aCraft, Christopher B.1 aHerbert, EllenR.1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3345-65920 tBiogeochemistry.g2018 Apr., v. 138, no. 2 p.137-154dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl36028x0168-25637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-018-0436-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010400167520105900271592002801330650001901358650001601377650001301393650001501406650001701421650001301438650001601451650002501467650001901492650002201511650001301533650002401546653002001570653002101590653002201611653001501633653002001648653000801668653000801676653000701684653000901691653000801700700001601708700002101724700001201745700001901757700001801776700001701794773009601811856008501907852000901992655001202001IND60749995520221121154056.0220307e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074999552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.margen.2021.1008992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xue-Gong10aComplete genome sequence of Crassaminicella sp. 143-21，isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent  aCrassaminicella sp. 143-21, a putative new species isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal vent chimney on the Central Indian Ridge (CIR), is an anaerobic, thermophilic and rod-shaped bacterium belonging to the family Clostridiaceae.

Genomic analysis of strain 143-21 revealed that numerous genes related to organic matter transport and catabolism, including peptide transport, amino acid transport, saccharide transport, ethanolamine transport and corresponding metabolic pathways. Further, the genome contains a large proportion of genes involved in translation, ribosomal structure, and signal transduction.

In this study we have carried out temperature and field-dependent magnetization measurements to investigate the magnetic anisotropy of AF Cr₂O₃ nanorods (NRs) with 〈d〉XRD = 24 nm diameter. Our experimental findings suggest that the observed field-cooled memory effect from exchange-coupled Cr₂O₃ NRs is mediated by unidirectional anisotropy.

From the viewpoint of theoretical simulation and practical application, the precise control of nanoparticles still remains a significant challenge. Herein, a strategy was successfully developed to fabricate in situ a polymer-encapsulated Au nanoparticle dimer based on the C–C coupling reaction of p-aminophenylacetylene (p-APAC). The balance between the polymerization processes and the coupling reaction resulted in Au nanoparticle assemblies with different configurations, such as monomer, dimer, and multimer, depending on the concentration of p-APAC. The gap distance of about 1.8 nm was well consistent with the length of the coupling products of p-APAC, i.e. the gap distance was about double the length of a single p-APAC molecule. The observation of a longitudinal peak in the UV-vis spectrum demonstrated that the aspect ratio of the Au nanoparticles was about 2.5, indicating the formation of Au dimers with reasonable yield. Moreover, the thickness of the polymer shell was well-controlled via changing the concentration of p-APAC. The gap of the dimer resulted in a very large coupling effect of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), and the surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) signal of the molecules was accordingly enhanced in the gap areas, which served as the hot spots. Based on the characteristic spectral feature of the coupling products, the single Au nanoparticle dimer was positioned via SERS mapping. The large LSPR coupling effect in the gap area allowed the conversion of p-nitrothiophenol (PNTP) to dimercaptoazobenzene (DMAB) with high efficiency. Thus, it was confirmed that the SPR-catalyzed coupling reaction preferentially occurred on a hot spot area. The proposed approach is expected to be developed into a promising tool for precisely controlling the gap distance of a nanoparticle assembly, and it may serve as a simple model for theoretical consideration in understanding the SERS mechanism(s).  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3agold 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3asimulation models 3asurface plasmon resonance 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aZhang, Chenjie1 aZhang, Jing1 aYuan, Yaxian1 aXu, Minmin1 aYao, Jianlin0 tRSC advances.g2017 May 16, v. 7, no. 42 p.26153-26160dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra03942e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03375naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245015400165300001600319520188100335592002802216650002202244650002002266650001302286650003102299650001502330650001802345650001902363650001702382650002502399650001302424650001602437650001402453650001402467653001702481653001702498653003102515653002002546653003002566700001602596700002002612700001502632700001702647700001502664773010602679856008702785852000902872655001202881IND60625592020221120025740.0190213e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062559202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.11.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Xie10aNovel breviscapine nanocrystals modified by panax notoginseng saponins for enhancing bioavailability and synergistic anti-platelet aggregation effect  ap. 333-342.  aBreviscapine (BVP) is a flavonoid compound with strong neuroprotective and anti-platelet aggregation effect. The objective of this study is to design novel BVP nanocrystals modified by natural panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) for enhancing dissolution and anti-platelet aggregation effect of BVP. BVP nanocrystals modified by PNS (BVP-NC/PNS) were firstly prepared by coupling homogenization technology and freeze-drying technology, and BVP nanocrystals modified by RH40 (BVP-NC/RH40) as reference for comparison. The morphology, crystals characterization, dissolution behavior and anti-platelet aggregation effect of BVP-NC/PNS was systemically evaluated. The results demonstrated that the PNS could effectively maintain stability of BVP-NC at suspensions state dependent of its surface activity and the electrostatic repulsion effect. Combination of PNS and trehalose could prevent the aggregation of BVP-NC/PNS during freeze-drying. The PXRD and DSC results demonstrated that the BVP crystal state in BVP-NC/PNS was not changed owing to PNS modification and homogenization treatment. And the freeze-dried BVP-NC could easily recover back to BVP-NS and significantly improve the dissolution of BVP. The AUC(0-∞) of the BVP-NC/PNS was 4.54 times as high as that of the coarse BVP, but not significantly different compared to that of BVP-NC/RH40 (p < 0.05). The anti-platelet aggregation results demonstrated that, BVP-NC/PNS group showed more effective inhibition on PAF-induced platelet aggregation compared with corresponding control groups, which might attribute to the enhanced bioavailability of BVP and synergistic effect of PNS with BVP. In conclusion, PNS could be used as an alternative stabilizer for preparation of BVP-NC, and BVP-NC modified by PNS is a promising formulation strategy for enhancing oral bioavailability and anti-platelet aggregation of BVP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax notoginseng 3abioavailability 3acolloids 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aflavonoids 3afreeze drying 3ahomogenization 3ananocrystals 3aplatelet aggregation 3asaponins 3astabilizers 3asynergism 3atrehalose 0aNanocrystals 0aBreviscapine 0aPanax notoginseng saponins 0aBioavailability 0aAnti-platelet aggregation1 aLuo, Yijing1 aChen, Yingchong1 aMa, Yueqin1 aYue, Pengfei1 aYang, Ming0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 175 p.333-342dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.11.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245012600155300002000281520174800301592002802049650002302077650001702100650002002117650001902137650001702156650003902173650002302212650002102235650001302256650001302269650004402282650002402326650001902350650001602369650001102385650003702396700001902433700001702452700001802469773010102487856007502588852000902663655001202672IND60576614520221117230541.0170806e20120731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057661452DNAL7 a10.1021/la30208172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Liang10aSelf-Assembly of a Diblock Copolymer with Pendant Disulfide Bonds and Chromophore Groups: A New Platform for Fast Release  ap. 11232-11240.  aAn amphiphilic block copolymer comprising poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(2-(methacryloyl)oxyethyl-2′-hydroxyethyl disulfide) (PMAOHD) blocks was synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Pyrenebutyric acid was conjugated to the block copolymer by esterification, and a block copolymer with pendant disulfide bonds and pyrenyl groups (PEG-b-P(MAOHD-g-Py)) was obtained. ¹H NMR and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) results demonstrated the successful synthesis of the block copolymer. The cleavage of the disulfide bonds and the degrafting of the pyrenyl groups were investigated in THF and a THF/methanol mixture. Fluorescence spectroscopy, GPC, and ¹H NMR results demonstrated fast cleavage of the disulfide bonds by Bu₃P in THF. Fluorescence results showed the ratio of the intensity of the excimer peak to the monomer peak decreased rapidly within 20 min. GPC traces of the block copolymer moved to a long retention time region after addition of Bu₃P, indicating the cleavage of the disulfide bonds and the degrafting of the pyrenyl groups. PEG-b-P(MAOHD-g-Py) can self-assemble into micelles with poly(MAOHD-g-Py) cores and PEG coronae in a mixture of methanol and THF (9:1 by volume). The dissociation of the micelles in the presence of Bu₃P was investigated. After cleavage of the disulfide bonds in the micellar cores, a pyrene-containing small molecular compound and a block copolymer with pendant thiol groups were produced. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and ¹H NMR were employed to track the dissociation of the polymeric micelles. All the techniques demonstrated the dissociation of the micelles and the fast release of pyrenyl groups from the micelles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3adissociation 3adisulfide bonds 3aesterification 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3agel chromatography 3alight scattering 3amethanol 3amicelles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3asurfactants 3athiols 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aLiu, Jingchuan1 aWen, Jianguo1 aZhao, Hanying0 tLangmuir.g2012 July 31, v. 28, no. 30 p.11232-11240dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla30208173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245011700208300001600325520136100341592002801702650000901730650001601739650002001755650002401775650002101799650001501820650002901835650002101864650001701885650002001902650002501922650001601947650001601963653001801979653003401997653003302031653002202064653001602086700005702102700002502159700001302184773009002197856008502287852000902372655001202381IND60616134220221117234801.0190214e20181215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061613422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.09.1342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarukčić, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1703-452512aA simple stochastic method for modelling the uncertainty of photovoltaic power production based on measured data  ap. 246-256.  aThis paper describes statistical quantification tools for predicting photovoltaic (PV) production considering uncertainty in PV production at same irradiation levels and PV panel temperatures. When analysing measured data, it is observed that there are different PV power production levels for the same irradiation levels and panel temperatures. These PV power spread out can be caused by different causes, such as dust deposition over the panel, non-ideal working of maximal power point tracking devices, device efficiencies' dependence on power, different temperatures over the PV panel, and others. Due to the stochastic character of these occurrences, they can be challenging when considered in the deterministic mathematical models usually used for PV power prediction. The probabilistic method for PV power production is proposed based on the probability density function with respect to the solar irradiation and the panel temperature. The simulation results are compared among the different models based on the probability density function with respect to the solar irradiation and panel temperature. The best overlapping between measured and calculated PV power production gives the proposed stochastic models dependent only on irradiance. The proposed stochastic model gives a PV energy prediction on a yearly basis with an error of less than 1%.  aPublisher supplied data 3adust 3airradiation 3alight intensity 3amathematical models 3apower generation 3aprediction 3aprobability distribution 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3astochastic processes 3atemperature 3auncertainty 0aCurve fitting 0aPhotovoltaic power production 0aProbability density function 0aIrradiance ranges 0aUncertainty1 aHederić, Ž.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7265-09321 aHadžiselimović, M.1 aSeme, S.0 tEnergy.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 165 p.246-256dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.09.1343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245009100162300001600253520106200269592002801331650001801359650001101377650001801388650001501406650001801421650002001439650002001459650002001479650001201499650000901511650001101520650001701531653000801548653001001556653001001566653001101576700001801587700001801605700001601623700001401639700001901653700001701672773010101689856008501790852000901875655001201884IND60650979620221118012041.0190725e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065097962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2019.06.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yan10aSplenomegaly induced by anemia impairs T cell movement in the spleen partially via EPO  ap. 399-405.  aThe spleen is an important secondary lymph organ. Splenomegaly induced by anemia could affect the function of spleen in immune responses. We observe that anemia induced in mice with reduced peripheral T cell trafficking to the spleen T cell zones as well as CCL21 and CCL19 expression. In accordance with previous research, we found that the production of EPO in the mice kidney was sharply increased post anemia. In addition, mice were injected with different doses of EPO. Our results show that with the increased dosage of EPO, the chemokine expression in the spleen is lowered with a decrease in peripheral T cell homing to the spleen T cell zones. At last, our results show that the anemia mice model administrated with anti-EPO antibody had a higher expression of spleen CCL19 and CCL21 and an increased count of periphery T cells trafficking to spleen T cell zones at day 3 post induction. These data indicate that anemia could disturb T cell movement in the spleen, which might further affect T cell immune response, with partial involvement of EPO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aanemia 3aanimal models 3aantibodies 3acell movement 3achemokine CCL19 3achemokine CCL21 3aimmune response 3akidneys 3amice 3aspleen 3asplenomegaly 0aEPO 0aCCL21 0aCCL19 0aT cell1 aYue, Honggang1 aYang, Shouyan1 aYuan, Dandi1 aLi, Luxia1 aZhao, Jinghong1 aZhao, Lintao0 tMolecular immunology.g2019 Aug., v. 112 p.399-405dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2019.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03537naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100002000159245010600179300001400285500000900299520167400308592002801982650001802010650002202028650002302050650001502073650002002088650001602108650001702124650001602141650001202157650001802169650001802187650002502205650002002230650002102250650001802271650002202289650001502311650001902326650003802345650001402383650003802397650002502435650003102460650002002491650001502511650002002526651002202546651002202568700001802590700002002608700001902628773019002647852000902837856007702846655001202923IND4430882620221122053220.0191028e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443088262DNAL7 a200482912pmid7 a10.2134/jeq2009.00372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaccetta, Peter12aA Methodology to Estimate the Future Extent of Dryland Salinity in the Southwest of Western Australia  ap. 26-34.  aepub  aIn the southwestern agricultural region of Western Australia, the clearing of the original perennial vegetation for annual vegetation-based dryland agriculture has lead to rising saline groundwater levels.

This has lead to efforts to quantify, in a spatially explicit way, the historical and likely future extent of the area affected, with the view to informing management decisions. This study was conducted to determine whether the likely future extent of the area affected by dryland salinity could be estimated by means of developing spatially explicit maps for use in management and planning. We derived catchment-related variables from digital elevation models and perennial vegetation presence/absence maps. We then used these variables to predict the salinity hazard extent by applying a combination of decision tree classification and morphological image processing algorithms. Sufficient objective data such as groundwater depth, its rate of rise, and its concentration of dissolved salts were generally not available, so we used regional expert opinion (derived from the limited existing studies on salinity hazard extent) as training and validation data. We obtained an 87% agreement in the salinity hazard extent estimated by this method compared with the validation data, and conclude that the maps are sufficient for planning. We estimate that the salinity hazard extent is 29.7% of the agricultural land.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil salinity 3asoil salinization 3asoil water content 3avegetation 3adryland farming 3agroundwater 3asaline water 3awater table 3astreams 3asurface water 3awater quality 3aspatial distribution 3aland management 3amodel validation 3adata analysis 3asimulation models 3aalgorithms 3aimage analysis 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGeological Phenomena 2aSodium Chloridexchemistry 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSpacecraft 2aWater Movements 3aWestern Australia 0aWestern Australia1 aDunne, Robert1 aGeorge, Richard1 aMcFarlane, Don0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2010 Jan., v. 39, no. 1 p.26-34dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2009.00373Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03057naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245020200167300001600369500001900385520109700404592002801501650002101529650001101550650002801561650001801589650003401607650001601641650002901657650001101686651001301697653002301710653004601733653003301779700002001812700001301832700002001845700001301865700001801878700002001896700001301916700001801929700002101947700002001968700001301988700001802001700002102019700002102040700002002061700001302081700001802094700002102112700002102133700001902154700002102173773014702194856008102341852000902422655001202431IND60689325920221120163001.0200421e20090101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068932592DNAL7 a10.1080/096374809027550612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Sangita10aAssessment of dietary intake in an inner-city African American population and development of a quantitative food frequency questionnaire to highlight foods and nutrients for a nutritional invention  ap. 155-167.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPrimary objective To characterize the diets of low-income inner-city African Americans to develop a population-specific quantitative food frequency questionnaire (QFFQ) that will be used to highlight foods and nutrients for a nutritional intervention program aimed at reducing the risk of chronic disease and to evaluate the program.

Main outcomes and results The average daily energy intake was approximately 2,165 kcal for women and 2,509 kcal for men. The percentages of energy from fat were approximately 34% and 33% for women and men, respectively. Sodas were the main contributor to energy and sugar intake. A 113-item QFFQ was developed. Conclusions The results highlighted specific foods and nutrients that would be targeted in the nutritional intervention. The QFFQ developed is culturally appropriate and specific for low-income African Americans in inner-city Baltimore.  aPublisher supplied data 3achronic diseases 3acities 3across-sectional studies 3aenergy intake 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood intake 3anutritional intervention 3asugars 3aMaryland 0aDietary assessment 0aquantitative food frequency questionnaire 0alow-income African Americans1 aSharma, Sangita1 aCao, Xia1 aSharma, Sangita1 aCao, Xia1 aArcan, Chrisa1 aSharma, Sangita1 aCao, Xia1 aArcan, Chrisa1 aMattingly, Megan1 aSharma, Sangita1 aCao, Xia1 aArcan, Chrisa1 aMattingly, Megan1 aJennings, Sharla1 aSharma, Sangita1 aCao, Xia1 aArcan, Chrisa1 aMattingly, Megan1 aJennings, Sharla1 aSong, Hee-Jung1 aGittelsohn, Joel0 tInternational journal of food sciences and nutrition.g2009 Jan. 1, v. 60, no. sup5 p.155-167dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2066x1465-34787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096374809027550613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245014300170300001800313520169400331592002802025650001302053650002702066650000902093650001502102650001502117650002902132650001102161650002402172650002002196650001002216650002302226650002202249650001602271650002202287650001402309650001002323650001902333650001802352650000902370650002002379650001902399650001702418650002202435650001902457650001702476650001402493650001202507700005802519773012402577856008202701852000902783655001202792IND60613516520221122045211.0190722e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061351652DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-018-4273-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeikard, Rosemarie10aDifferent mitochondrial DNA copy number in liver and mammary gland of lactating cows with divergent genetic background for milk production  ap. 1209-1218.  aAdequate metabolic adaptation of key tissues playing an essential role for bioenergetic homeostasis and lactogenesis is critical in cows to adapt to changes in energy requirements and physiological processes during the lactation period. Mitochondria are recognized as central to meet energy needs and maintaining of metabolic homeostasis because mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is template for several polypeptides of the respiratory chain complexes essential for ATP generation. The quantity of mtDNA in a cell has been widely used as a surrogate marker for the capacity of cells for energy generation. In our study we analyzed the mtDNA copy number and the mRNA expression of important nuclear encoded genes controlling mitochondrial biogenesis in liver and mammary gland. We compared cows with a nuclear genome dairy × beef crossbred make-up to purebred German Holstein dairy cows. The study revealed tissue-specific variations of mtDNA copy number and expression levels of nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis when comparing lactating cows with different genetic predisposition regarding milk performance. This may reflect nuclear genome-determined genetic differences between the cow groups in coping with metabolic demands and physiological changes during lactation. The results indicate that mitochondrial biogenesis processes in the liver and mammary gland appear to be impaired in high lactating dairy cows, which consequently, would point to a disturbed energy adaptation. The results provide a basis to further elucidate the adaptive and regulatory modulation of the mitochondrial biogenesis in response to lactation-associated metabolic challenges in lactating cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abeef 3abiogenesis 3adairy cows 3aelectron transport chain 3aenergy 3aenergy requirements 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetic background 3agenetic variation 3ahomeostasis 3alactating females 3alactation 3aliver 3amammary glands 3amessenger RNA 3amilk 3amilk production 3amilk synthesis 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3anuclear genome 3apolypeptides 3apurebreds 3atissues1 aKuehn, Christa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0216-424X0 tMolecular biology reports.g2018 Oct., v. 45, no. 5 p.1209-1218dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-018-4273-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245013000173300001600303520167400319592002801993650002402021650001602045650001102061650001902072650001102091650002102102650002002123650002302143650001302166650002002179650001302199650001302212650001402225650001402239650001202253650001502265650001202280650001402292650001202306650001302318650003802331650001402369650001802383653001002401653001902411653002102430653003702451700002002488700002402508773011302532856009002645852000902735655001202744IND60576087220221123034341.0190405e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057608722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2017.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadboly, M.M.10aImpact of cryopreservation method on dromedary camel ovary structure, viability, and development of antral follicular oocytes  ap. 120-131.  aThe objectives of this study were, a) to compare two different vitrification techniques, the solid surface vitrification (SSV) and direct vitrification (DV) method, b) to evaluate the effect of four cryoprotectant agents and their toxicity on the morphological appearance and ultrastructural of camel ovarian cortex, c) to examine the development of oocytes recovered from the vitrified ovarian cortex. Fragments of ovarian cortex were exposed to equilibration solution consisting of TCM- 199 with 10% fetal camel serum (FCS); 0.10M sucrose and including one of the following cryoprotectants; 20% glycerol (GLY); 3.5M ethylene glycol (EG); 3.5M propanediol (PROH) or 3M dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO). After vitrification of ovarian fragments, they were warmed and evaluated by histological and transmission electron microscope. The oocytes isolated from vitrified ovarian cortex were cultured in TCM-199 at 38.5°C under 5% CO2 for 44h. Maturation was indicated through cumulus expansion and calculated by oocytes reaching first telophase and second metaphase (TI+MII). The percentage of morphologically normal and viable follicles of SSV was significantly higher P<0.05 than DV group (52.9 vs. 38.1, respectively). In conclusion, viability, histological and ultrastructural observations revealed that SSV method and ethylene glycol-based freezing solution were able to remain morphology better follicle and oocyte. Additionally, most organelles of oocytes are able to recover their normal morphology in camel ovarian cortex following cryopreservation and thawing processes, and oocytes isolated from vitrified ovarian cortex can exhibit maturation and reaches to (TI+MII).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamelus dromedarius 3ablood serum 3acamels 3acarbon dioxide 3acortex 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aethylene 3aethylene glycol 3afreezing 3aglycerol 3ahistology 3ametaphase 3aoocytes 3aorganelles 3asucrose 3atelophase 3athawing 3atoxicity 3atransmission electron microscopes 3aviability 3avitrification 0aCamel 0aOvarian tissue 0aCryopreservation 0aTransmission electron microscopy1 aAbdel-Aal, E.S.1 aElsayed, Eitedal H.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2017 Sept., v. 184 p.120-131dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2017.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245013700202300001600339520183200355592002802187650001202215650001902227650001902246650001202265650001002277653002602287653002102313653002502334700002302359700002002382700001902402700002202421773012102443856008002564852000902644655001202653IND60686970420221119054334.0200320e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068697042DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175198818172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Pauw, Ben1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9606-048310aOptical fiber-based sensors as an experimental tool to assess the weft and warp yarn tension beam-to-roll in rapier weaving machines  ap. 857-865.  aHigh cycle rates are important in commercial weaving machines to maximize productivity. Faster operation, however, can lead to higher tension on the yarns, which in turn increases the occurrence of yarn breakage and thus machine interruptions. Significant work has therefore been conducted to improve the many weaving machine components with the goal to attain higher production rates without increasing the yarn loads. Quantifying the impact of such improvements is not always possible using conventional, indirect measurement techniques. In addition, these techniques are limited to locations with sufficient access to the yarn to mount a sensor, typically between the warp beam and the first harness. In this paper, we show that the use of optical fiber-based sensors allows directly measuring the yarn tension in both the warp and weft directions in the region from the warp beam to the fabric rolls in rapier-type weaving machines. To do so, we replaced one warp and one weft yarn with an optical fiber equipped with strain sensors and measured strain throughout the subsequent weaving process. The small diameter of the optical fiber allowed minimizing our intrusion on the weaving operation. Our main observations are four-fold. Firstly, we demonstrated how the strain on the warp yarns evolves during the weaving cycle and we used this to focus on the beat-up phase for a low weaving resistance situation. Secondly, we monitored the warp yarn tension between the warp beam and the fabric rolls. Thirdly, we exploited the multiplexing capability of the optical fiber sensors to obtain a tension distribution along the width of the fabric in the weft direction between the reed to the fabric roll. Fourthly, we observed and identified the different phases of a yarn insertion (weft-wise) in a double rigid rapier machine.  aPublisher supplied data 3afabrics 3aoptical fibers 3atextile fibers 3aweaving 3ayarns 0aoptical fiber sensors 0asmart structures 0afiber Bragg gratings1 aBerghmans, Francis1 aThienpont, Hugo1 aVerdiere, Piet1 aGeernaert, Thomas0 tTextile research journal.g2020 Apr., v. 90, no. 7-8 p.857-865dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175198818173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245011600152300002000268520153700288592002801825650001301853650001701866650001601883650001401899650001101913650002201924650001901946650001201965650002301977650001802000650000902018650000702027650001302034650002102047650001302068650001202081700002002093700001802113700001902131700001502150773010102165856007502266852000902341655001202350IND60576614620221117230516.0170806e20120731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057661462DNAL7 a10.1021/la30211132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hao10aSimple, Reversible Emulsion System Switched by pH on the Basis of Chitosan without Any Hydrophobic Modification  ap. 11017-11024.  aChitosan without hydrophobic modification is not a good emulsifier itself. However, it has a pH-tunable sol–gel transition due to free amino groups along its backbone. In the present work, a simple reversible Pickering emulsion system based on the pH-tunable sol–gel transition of chitosan was developed. At pH > 6.0, as adjusted by NaOH, chitosan was insoluble in water. Chitosan nanoparticles or micrometer-sized floccular precipitates were formed in situ. These chitosan aggregates could adsorb at the interface of oil and water to stabilize the o/w emulsions, so-called Pickering emulsions. At pH < 6.0, as adjusted by HCl, chitosan was soluble in water. Demulsification happened. Four organic solvents (liquid paraffin, n-hexane, toluene, and dichloromethane) were chosen as the oil phase. Reversible emulsions were formed for all four oils. Chitosan-based Pickering emulsions could undergo five cycles of emulsification–demulsification with only a slight increase in the emulsion droplet size. They also had good long-term stability for more than 2 months. Herein, we give an example of chitosan without any hydrophobic modification to act as an effective emulsifier for various oil–water systems. From the results, we have determined that natural polymers with a stimulus-responsive sol–gel transition should be a good particulate emulsifier. The method for in situ formation of pH-responsive Pickering emulsions based on chitosan will open up a new route to the preparation of a wide range of reversible emulsions.  aPublisher supplied data 3achitosan 3adroplet size 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3ahexane 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquids 3amethylene chloride 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3apH 3apolymers 3asodium hydroxide 3asolvents 3atoluene1 aWang, Shuzhong,1 aZou, Shengwen1 aWei, Zengjiang1 aTong, Zhen0 tLangmuir.g2012 July 31, v. 28, no. 30 p.11017-11024dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla30211133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01619naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010200167300001600269520064200285592002800927650001100955650001300966650001800979650001400997650001601011650001301027650001201040650001201052700001901064773011901083856008201202852000901284655001201293IND60593208620221120031150.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059320862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-018-2308-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabakaeva, O.V.10aLipids, Vinyl Alcohols, and Fatty Acids From Soft Tissues of the Bivalve Mollusk Mactra chinensis  ap. 223-227.  aThe compositions of lipids, vinyl alcohols, and fatty acids from total lipids of the soft tissues of the bivalve mollusk Mactra chinensis were analyzed.

Laser diagnostic imaging is used to simultaneously reveal the in situ distribution of the hydroxyl radical (OH), formaldehyde (H₂CO), and temperature using the Jet in Hot Coflow (JHC) burner. The fuels considered are natural gas, ethylene, and LPG (each diluted with hydrogen 1:1 by volume). Hydrogen addition to the primary fuel was found necessary to stabilise the flames. Further to the role of hydrogen in the stabilisation of the flames, hydrogen addition also leads to the reaction zone exhibiting similar structure for different primary fuel types. The independence of the reaction zone structure with hydrogen addition suggests that a wide variety of fuels may be usable for achieving MILD combustion.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3aethylene 3aformaldehyde 3ahydrogen 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aimage analysis 3aliquid petroleum gas 3anatural gas 3aoxidants 3aoxygen 3astreams 3atemperature1 aDally, Bassam B.0 tCombustion and Flame.g2012 Oct., v. 159, no. 10 p.3138-3145dElsevier Inc.x0010-21807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2012.04.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04311naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100001900191245011600210300001400326506007600340520247900416592002802895506003702923650001802960650001502978650001602993650001503009650001503024650002203039650001703061650001303078650001203091650001303103650001803116650002203134650000903156650001103165653000903176653000803185653000803193653000703201653000803208653000903216653000903225653000903234653001503243653001503258653002303273653001403296700001903310700002103329700001803350700002103368700002003389700002403409700002303433773009903456856008503555852000903640655001203649IND60650979720221207130011.0200712e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065097972DNAL7 a313266532pmid7 aPMC67748672pmcid7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2019.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRegal, Jean F.10aInteractions between the complement and endothelin systems in normal pregnancy and following placental ischemia  ap. 10-18.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPreeclampsia is characterized by new onset hypertension and fetal growth restriction and is associated with aberrant activation of the innate immune complement system and stressed or ischemic placenta. Previous studies have suggested a role for both endothelin and complement system activation products in new onset hypertension in pregnancy, but inter-relationships of the pathways are unclear. We hypothesized that complement activation following placental ischemia stimulates the endothelin pathway to cause hypertension and impair fetal growth. The Reduced Uterine Perfusion Pressure (RUPP) model results in hypertension and fetal growth restriction in a pregnant rat due to placental ischemia caused by mechanical obstruction of blood flow to uterus and placenta. The effect of inhibitor of complement activation soluble Complement Receptor 1 (sCR1) and endothelin A receptor (ETA) antagonist atrasentan on hypertension, fetal weight, complement activation (systemic circulating C3a and local C3 placental deposition) and endothelin [circulating endothelin and message for preproendothelin (PPE), ETA and endothelin B receptor (ETB₎ in placenta] in the RUPP rat model were determined. Following placental ischemia, sCR1 attenuated hypertension but increased message for PPE and ETA in placenta, suggesting complement activation causes hypertension via an endothelin independent pathway. With ETA antagonism the placental ischemia-induced increase in circulating C3a was unaffected despite inhibition of hypertension, indicating systemic C3a alone is not sufficient. In normal pregnancy, inhibiting complement activation increased plasma endothelin but not placental PPE message. Atrasentan treatment increased fetal weight, circulating endothelin and placental ETA message, and unexpectedly increased local complement activation in placenta (C3 deposition) but not C3a in circulation, suggesting endothelin controls local placental complement activation in normal pregnancy. Atrasentan also significantly decreased message for endogenous complement regulators Crry and CD55 in placenta and kidney in normal pregnancy. Results of our study indicate that complement/endothelin interactions differ in pregnancies complicated with placental ischemia vs normal pregnancy, as well as locally vs systemically. These data clearly illustrate the complex interplay between complement and endothelin indicating that perturbations of either pathway may affect pregnancy outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3aantagonism 3aantagonists 3ablood flow 3acomplement 3afetal development 3ahypertension 3aischemia 3akidneys 3aplacenta 3apre-eclampsia 3apregnancy outcome 3arats 3auterus 0aET-1 0aETA 0aETB 0aGD 0aPPE 0aRUPP 0asCR1 0aVEGF 0aComplement 0aEndothelin 0aPlacental ischemia 0aPregnancy1 aLund, Jenna M.1 aWing, Cameron R.1 aRoot, Kate M.1 aMcCutcheon, Luke1 aBemis, Lynne T.1 aGilbert, Jeffrey S.1 aFleming, Sherry D.0 tMolecular immunology.g2019 Oct., v. 114 p.10-18dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2019.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001600147245006500163300001600228500000900244520146300253592002801716650001901744650001401763650002401777650002601801650003701827650001801864650002501882650002201907650001001929700002001939700001501959700001801974700002301992773012102015852000902136856008402145655001202229IND4390297220221123003001.0191228e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439029722DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2006.06.03742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Weikai10aGGE Biplot vs. AMMI Analysis of Genotype-by-Environment Data  ap. 643-653.  aepub  aThe use of genotype main effect (G) plus genotype-by-environment (GE) interaction (G+GE) biplot analysis by plant breeders and other agricultural researchers has increased dramatically during the past 5 yr for analyzing multi-environment trial (MET) data. Recently, however, its legitimacy was questioned by a proponent of Additive Main Effect and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) analysis. The objectives of this review are: (i) to compare GGE biplot analysis and AMMI analysis on three aspects of genotype-by-environment data (GED) analysis, namely mega-environment analysis, genotype evaluation, and test-environment evaluation; (ii) to discuss whether G and GE should be combined or separated in these three aspects of GED analysis; and (iii) to discuss the role and importance of model diagnosis in biplot analysis of GED. Our main conclusions are: (i) both GGE biplot analysis and AMMI analysis combine rather than separate G and GE in mega-environment analysis and genotype evaluation, (ii) the GGE biplot is superior to the AMMI1 graph in mega-environment analysis and genotype evaluation because it explains more G+GE and has the inner-product property of the biplot, (iii) the discriminating power vs. representativeness view of the GGE biplot is effective in evaluating test environments, which is not possible in AMMI analysis, and (iv) model diagnosis for each dataset is useful, but accuracy gain from model diagnosis should not be overstated.  aPublisher supplied data 3avariety trials 3acultivars 3amathematical models 3aenvironmental factors 3agenotype-environment interaction 3adata analysis 3astatistical analysis 3agenetic variation 3acrops1 aKang, Manjit S.1 aMa, Baoluo1 aWoods, Sheila1 aCornelius, Paul L.0 tCrop science.g2007 Mar., v. 47, no. 2 p.643-653dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2006.06.03743Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03339naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245013600206300001600342506007600358520160900434592002802043506003702071650002502108650003102133650001602164650002702180650002502207650001702232650001202249650002202261650001002283650001602293650001202309650001502321650001502336650002402351650001302375650002202388650002002410650002902430650001702459700002002476700002202496700001702518700002202535700002502557773011702582856007702699852000902776655001202785IND60690428120221207090818.0200426e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069042812DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.6.2.143172doi7 aPMC31219852pmcid7 a213307822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlcázar, Rubén,10aPolyamine metabolic canalization in response to drought stress in Arabidopsis and the resurrection plant Craterostigma plantagineum  ap. 243-250.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this work, we have studied the transcriptional profiles of polyamine biosynthetic genes and analyzed polyamine metabolic fluxes during a gradual drought acclimation response in Arabidopsis thaliana and the resurrection plant Craterostigma plantagineum. The analysis of free putrescine, spermidine and spermine titers in Arabidopsis arginine decarboxylase (adc1-3, adc2-3), spermidine synthase (spds1-2, spds2-3) and spermine synthase (spms-2) mutants during drought stress, combined with the quantitative expression of the entire polyamine biosynthetic pathway in the wild-type, has revealed a strong metabolic canalization of putrescine to spermine induced by drought. Such canalization requires spermidine synthase 1 (SPDS1) and spermine synthase (SPMS) activities and, intriguingly, does not lead to spermine accumulation but to a progressive reduction in spermidine and spermine pools in the wild-type. Our results suggest the participation of the polyamine back-conversion pathway during the drought stress response rather than the terminal catabolism of spermine. The putrescine to spermine canalization coupled to the spermine to putrescine back-conversion confers an effective polyamine recycling-loop during drought acclimation. Putrescine to spermine canalization has also been revealed in the desiccation tolerant plant C. plantagineum, which conversely to Arabidopsis, accumulates high spermine levels which associate with drought tolerance. Our results provide a new insight to the polyamine homeostasis mechanisms during drought stress acclimation in Arabidopsis and resurrection plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aCraterostigma plantagineum 3aacclimation 3aarginine decarboxylase 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3amutants 3aputrescine 3aspermidine 3aspermidine synthase 3aspermine 3aspermine synthase 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics) 3awater stress1 aBitrián, Marta1 aBartels, Dorothea1 aKoncz, Csaba1 aAltabella, Teresa1 aTiburcio, Antonio F.0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 6, no. 2 p.243-250dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.6.2.143173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01428naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245006900157300002000226520026300246592002800509650001100537650001400548650002300562650002100585650002300606650001200629650001100641650001200652700002200664700002000686700002100706700002100727700002100748700002300769700002000792773013400812856007500946852000901021655001201030IND60538625620221118035457.0160815e20120808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053862562DNAL7 a10.1021/ja30541392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPouy, Mark J.10aFlavin-Catalyzed Insertion of Oxygen into Rhenium–Methyl Bonds  ap. 12920-12923.  aFlavins and related molecules catalyze organic Baeyer–Villiger reactions.

The specimens were fabricated using silicon wet etching, black silicon formation, or the combination of these methods. On the surfaces, the microstructures form obstacles to drop spreading and retracting, the nanostructures give extreme water-repellency, and the hierarchical micro/nanostructures facilitate drop fragmentation. The maximum spreading factor (D*ₘₐₓ) differed among the structures. On the basis of published models of D*ₘₐₓ, we interpret the results of our experiment and suggest reasonable explanations for these differences.

Adv. Mater.2008, 20, 1]. Simulated X-ray diffraction, small angle neutron scattering, and electronic microscopy for the atomistic model are in good agreement with experimental data. The morphological features are also assessed from chord length distributions and porous volume and specific geometrical surface calculations, etc. The N₂, CO₂, and H₂O adsorption isotherms in the atomistic model of MCM-41 are also in reasonable agreement with their experimental counterpart. An important finding of the present work is that water forms a film adsorbed on specific hydrophilic regions of the surface while the rest of the surface is depleted in water molecules. This result suggests that the surface of MCM-41 materials is heterogeneous, as it is made up of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic patches. While adsorption and irreversible capillary condensation can be described using the thermodynamical approach by Derjaguin (also known as the Derjaguin–Broekhoff–De Boer model), the Freundlich equation fits nicely the data for reversible and continuous filling in small pores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectron microscopy 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amathematical models 3aneutrons 3anitrogen 3aporous media 3asorption isotherms1 aUgliengo, Piero0 tLangmuir.g2012 July 31, v. 28, no. 30 p.11131-11141dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla30225293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03209naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245014600169500001400315520199200329592002802321650001502349650001602364650001602380650002502396650002602421650001102447650001102458650000702469650001402476650003302490650001002523700002702533700003102560700003102591773011802622856007402740852000902814655001202823IND60704504220221123023602.0200723e20200507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070450422DNAL7 a10.3390/w120513202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorral Bobadilla, Marina 10aAdsorptive of Nickel in Wastewater by Olive Stone Waste: Optimization through Multi-Response Surface Methodology Using Desirability Functions  aNAL-light  aPollution from industrial wastewater has the greatest impact on the environment due to the wide variety of wastes and materials that water can contain. These include heavy metals. Some of the technologies that are used to remove heavy metals from industrial effluents are inadequate, because they cannot reduce their concentration of the former to below the discharge limits. Biosorption technology has demonstrated its potential in recent years as an alternative for this type of application. This paper examines the biosorption process for the removal of nickel ions that are present in wastewater using olive stone waste as the biosorbent. Kinetic studies were conducted to investigate the biosorbent dosage, pH of the solution, and stirring speed. These are input variables that are frequently used to determine the efficiency of the adsorption process. This paper describes an effort to identify regression models, in which the biosorption process variables are related to the process output (i.e., the removal efficiency). It uses the Response Surface Method (RSM) and it is based on Box Benken Design experiments (BBD), in which olive stones serves as the biosorbent. Several scenarios of biosorption were proposed and demonstrated by use of the Multi-Response Surface (MRS) and desirability functions. The optimum conditions that were necessary to remove nickel when the dosage of biosorbent was the minimum (0.553 g/L) were determined to be a stirring speed of 199.234 rpm and a pH of 6.369. The maximum removal of nickel under optimized conditions was 61.73%. Therefore, the olive stone waste that was investigated has the potential to provide an inexpensive biosorbent material for use in recovering the water that the nickel has contaminated. The experimental results agree closely with what the regression models have provided. This confirms the use of MRS since this technique and enables satisfactory predictions with use of the least possible amount of experimental data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiosorbents 3abiosorption 3aenvironmental impact 3aindustrial wastewater 3anickel 3aolives 3apH 3apollution 3aresponse surface methodology 3awater1 aLostado Lorza, Rubén 1 aSomovilla Gómez, Fátima 1 aEscribano García, Rubén 0 tWater.g2020 May 07, v. 12, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120513203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245011400165300001400279520144400293592002801737650001801765650001001783650000901793650001501802650001001817650001301827650002101840650001001861650002001871650001401891650001901905650000701924650001801931650001501949650001401964650001901978650001101997650002102008650001502029700002202044700002502066773009402091856004802185852000902233655001202242IND4475630920221120215857.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447563092DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293120100972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLesovaya, S. N.10aSoil formation and weathering on ultramafic rocks in the mountainous tundra of the Rai-Iz massif, Polar Urals  ap. 33-44.  aGravelly clay loamy and clayey soils developed from the derivatives of ultramafic rocks of the dunite-harzburgite complex of the Rai-Iz massif in the Polar Urals have been studied. They are represented by raw-humus pelozems (weakly developed clayey soils) under conditions of perfect drainage on steep slopes and by the gleyzems (Gleysols) with vivid gley color patterns in the eluvial positions on leveled elements of the relief. The magnesium released from the silicates with the high content of this element (mainly from olivine) specifies the neutral-alkaline reaction in these soils. Cryoturbation, the accumulation of raw humus, the impregnation of the soil mass with humic substances, gleyzation, and the ferrugination of the gleyed horizons are also clearly pronounced in the studied soils. Despite the high pH values, the destruction of supergene smectites in the upper horizons and ferrugination (the accumulation of iron hydroxides) in the microfissures dissecting the grains of olivine, pyroxene, and serpentine, and in decomposing plant tissues take place. The development of these processes may be related to the local acidification (neutralization) of the soil medium under the impact of biota and carbonic acids. The specificity of gleyzation in the soils developing from ultramafic rocks is shown in the absence of iron depletion from the fine earth material against the background of the greenish blue gley color pattern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aacids 3aclay 3aclay soils 3acolor 3adrainage 3ahumic substances 3ahumus 3airon hydroxides 3amagnesium 3aneutralization 3apH 3aplant tissues 3aserpentine 3asilicates 3asoil formation 3atundra 3aultramafic rocks 3aweathering1 aGoryachkin, S.

The sedimentary models of coal and shale associations are very important to explore the coal and shales. However, whether the transgression affected the lithofacies and geochemical characteristics of coal and shale in the Paleogene Huangxian Basin in eastern China has not been reported in detail, which is important to construct the sedimentary models. In this study, petrological and geochemical methods are used to comprehensively analyze the mineral composition, contents of major and trace elements, and distribution characteristics of geochemical parameters of coal and shale in Huangxian Basin. The results show that coal and shale have different macerals. The study of typical geochemical parameters (Mn/Ti, K₂O/Na₂O, Sr/Ba, and Th/U) shows that the no. 1 coal seam (CB1) and no. 4 coal seam (CB4) are least affected by seawater, while the no. 1-3 coal seam (CB1-3) is affected by seawater to some extent. Shale 1-3 (S1-3), shale 2 (S2), and shale 4 (S4) are affected by seawater, while shale 1 (S1) is little affected by seawater. In order to discuss the sedimentary model of coal and shale, the tectonic background, provenance, paleoclimate, and fault movement of Huangxian basin are analyzed. The results show that the basin is located at the continental island arc and the active continental margin. Transgression and tectonic movement affect the input of terrigenous debris. The paleoclimate during coal formation was warmer and wetter, while shale was cooler and drier. During basin subsidence, CB4–S4 and CB1–S2–S1 combinations were basically formed under the influence of transgression driven by paleoclimate change. The combination of S1-3 and CB1-3 was formed in a stable freshwater lacustrine environment, followed by transgression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaleogene period 3abarium 3abasins 3acoal 3afreshwater 3amanganese 3amineral content 3amodels 3apaleoclimatology 3apotassium 3aprovenance 3aseawater 3ashale 3asodium 3astrontium 3asubsidence 3atectonics 3athorium 3atitanium 3auranium 3aChina1 aLi, Zengxue1 aWang, Dongdong1 aLi, Ying1 aLiu, Haiyan1 aLiu, Ying1 aWang, Pingli0 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Oct. 07, v. 33, no. 11 p.10442-10456dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b012993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01273naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010400170520031700274592002800591650001100619650001100630650001000641650000900651653000800660653000800668653002400676653002100700653002300721653001000744773009800754856008600852852000900938655001200947IND60650980220221118010752.0200110e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065098022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2019.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVu, Anh Nguyet10aOn the impact of quantitative easing on credit standards and systemic risk: The Japanese experience  aThis study provides empirical evidence on the impact of quantitative easing on credit standards and systemic risk in Japanese banks.

Here, we test the hypothesis that these phonological difficulties are associated with a dysfunction of the auditory sensory thalamus, the medial geniculate body (MGB). By using functional MRI, we found that, in dyslexic adults, the MGB responded abnormally when the task required attending to phonemes compared with other speech features. No other structure in the auditory pathway showed distinct functional neural patterns between the two tasks for dyslexic and control participants. Furthermore, MGB activity correlated with dyslexia diagnostic scores, indicating that the task modulation of the MGB is critical for performance in dyslexics. These results suggest that deficits in dyslexia are associated with a failure of the neural mechanism that dynamically tunes MGB according to predictions from cortical areas to optimize speech processing. This view on task-related MGB dysfunction in dyslexics has the potential to reconcile influential theories of dyslexia within a predictive coding framework of brain function.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3aprediction 3areading 3aspeech 3athalamus 0afunctional MRI 0aspeech recognition 0aauditory processing 0amagnocellular1 aHintz, Florian1 aKiebel, Stefan J.1 avon Kriegstein, Katharina0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Aug. 21, v. 109, no. 34 p.13841-13846dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11198281093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01754naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245014800159300001800307520035800325592002800683650001600711650002300727650002400750650002200774650002100796650003200817650002600849650002200875650001400897650002000911650002100931700001400952700001900966700001700985700001701002700001201019700001101031700001201042700001401054700001301068773013201081856007401213852000901287655001201296IND60660799620221118185118.0190827e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066079962DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc08728c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Hui-Peng12aA strategy for screening of high-quality enzyme inhibitors from herbal medicines based on ultrafiltration LC-MS and in silico molecular docking  ap. 1494-1497.  aA novel strategy of ultrafiltration LC-MS and in silico molecular docking was proposed to discover high-quality enzyme inhibitors from herbal medicines.

Thus, the detection of biothiols is highly important for early diagnosis of diseases and evaluation of disease progression. Herein, new types of BODIPY-based fluorescent probes (probe 1, probe 2 and probe 3) capable of cysteine (Cys)/homocysteine (Hcy) sensing with high selectivity over other amino acids were developed. In addition, we further studied the influence of different electronegativity substituents on these probes to sensing Cys/Hcy. Ultimately, we concluded that the electron withdrawing group on probe 1 can accelerate the probe response to Cys/Hcy, and probe 1 was successfully applied for selective imaging Cys/Hcy in living cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acysteine 3adisease course 3aearly diagnosis 3afluorescent dyes 3aglutathione 3ahomocysteine 3aimage analysis 0aBODIPY 0aFluorescent probe 0aCysteine 0aHomocysteine1 aChen, Miao1 aGao, Jinhua1 aJi, Xin1 aHe, Jinling1 aZhang, Jian1 aZhao, Weili0 tTalanta.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 195 p.281-289dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2018.11.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02286naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002100161245008100182300001600263500000900279520121500288592002801503650001001531650001501541650001901556650000901575650001901584650002001603650001501623650001201638700001601650700001701666773014801683856009601831852000901927655001201936IND60668580920221119184408.0191125e195304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066858092DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1953.03615995001700020020x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZwerman, Paul J.10aSoil Structural Stability of Brookston Clay as a Factor in Sugar Beet Yields  ap. 159-164.  aepub  aThe purpose of this research was to determine the influence of the structural stability of soil upon the yield of sugar beets. Structural units of soil between one-eighth inch and one-fourth inch were used in 20 small plots. The main comparison made was of highly stable structure (12% organic matter) against highly unstable structure (5% organic matter). The top soil (10 inches) of each of 10 of these plots was made up of stable soil structure. The other 10 plots were made up of unstable structure. Five rainfall conditions were studied: frequent half-inch, no rain, natural rain for 1947, 4 inches per week, and rain similar to 1942. There were 16 harvested beets on each plot or 64 per rainfall condition. Film-glass cloth houses used to protect the soil from natural rainfall transmitted only one-half of the sunlight. Apparently this light factor was responsible for the highest beet yield under natural rain and sunlight. There were no differences in yield associated with soil structural differences except in the case of 4 inches rain per week. This difference was significant. Differences in yield as affected by rainfall were significant for all comparisons except “ideal” rain and 1942 rain.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeets 3acrop yield 3aorganic matter 3arain 3asoil structure 3asolar radiation 3asugar beet 3atopsoil1 aPage, J.

CCM and PG were incorporated using co-solvent mixing followed by spray- or vacuum-drying. The obtained CCM/PG solid dispersions were evaluated for soluble CCM amount, CCM-PG interactions, Caco-2 monolayer permeation, and inhibitory efficacy against HeLa cells. Results showed that preparation method and PG-to-CCM ratio affected CCM soluble amount, favoring spray-drying and high PG-to-CCM ratios. FTIR spectra suggested the presence of hydrogen bonding between CCM and PG in spray-dried solid dispersions. For Caco-2 monolayer permeation, CCM/PG solid dispersion resulted in the basolateral CCM accumulation of 0.53 μg per well in 120 min, compared with 0.13 μg for curcumin alone. In particular, CCM/PG solid dispersions showed much greater efficacy than CCM alone in reducing the viability of HeLa cells, suggesting the potential of PG to enable CCM as a bioactive compound.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive compounds 3acell viability 3acurcumin 3aglucans 3ahuman cell lines 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrogen 3apermeability 3aspray drying 3avacuum drying 0aPhytoglycogen 0aSoluble amount 0aCaco-2 monolayer permeation 0aHeLa cells1 aYao, Yuan0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2020 Mar., v. 100 p.105442-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1054423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03603naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245015000174300001600324520206600340592002802406650002502434650002502459650001102484650001902495650001302514650001502527650001402542650001902556650001602575650002702591650001902618650001202637650001202649650002402661650002502685650001202710650001002722650002502732653001102757653002302768653002402791653001502815653001702830700001502847700001802862773011102880856008502991852000903076655001203085IND60591871020221121190825.0190207e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059187102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2018.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRongwong, Wichitpan10aEnergy analysis and optimization of hollow fiber membrane contactors for recovery of dissolve methane from anaerobic membrane bioreactor effluent  ap. 184-194.  aThis work presents an energy analysis and optimization of the hollow fiber membrane contactors for the recovery of dissolved methane (CH4) in effluents of anaerobic membrane bioreactor wastewater treatment processes. The obtained CH4 could be merged with biogas for further purification or used with a micro-turbine for electricity generation to achieve an energy self-sufficient wastewater treatment process. A mathematical model considering simultaneous CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) desorption was used to estimate the membrane area required to remove the dissolved CH4, as well as quality of the outlet gas from the membrane contactor. Energy balance between electrical energy obtained from the recovered CH4 and energies consumed by vacuum and liquid pumps for the operation of membrane contactor were investigated and reported as a Net Electricity obtained per m3 of effluent or simply Net E. Results revealed that a combination of a high strip gas flow rate and slightly low vacuum condition closed to the atmospheric pressure can provide the highest Net E at 0.178 MJ/m3. This value is 85.37% of the total electrical energy that can generated from a 90% recovery of dissolved CH4 using an effluent saturated with a 60 vol% CH4 biogas and flow rate at 2 m3/day. The calculation was made based on the assumptions that 1) the membrane contactor is operated in a non-wetting mode where membrane properties remain constant, 2) flux decline due to the membrane fouling is not considered and 3) the energy required for membrane cleaning and other relevant activities are not factored into the energy analysis. Based on our results, to obtain a high CH4 mole fraction at the gas outlet, a low strip gas flow rate is recommended, however, the operating gas pressure needs to be lowered by applying a vacuum condition to improve the Net E. In addition, it was found that the Net E could be improved by increasing the number of membrane fibers, and lowering the liquid flow rate. The CH4 recovery efficiency could also be optimized to obtain an optimal Net E.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3aatmospheric pressure 3abiogas 3acarbon dioxide 3acleaning 3adesorption 3aeffluents 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3aenergy balance 3afouling 3aliquids 3amathematical models 3amembrane bioreactors 3amethane 3apumps 3awastewater treatment 0aBiogas 0aMembrane contactor 0aAnaerobic treatment 0aNet energy 0aHollow fiber1 aGoh, Kunli1 aBae, Tae-Hyun0 tJournal of membrane science.g2018 May 15, v. 554 p.184-194dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2018.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01366naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012200158300001800280520031300298592002800611650001900639650001400658650002300672650002300695650002300718650001100741650001600752700001100768700001700779700001600796773013300812856007400945852000901019655001201028IND60660799820221118184846.0190827e20150115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066079982DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc08733j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhen, Wenlong10aEnhancing catalytic activity and stability for CO₂ methanation on Ni@MOF-5 via control of active species dispersion  ap. 1728-1731.  aA novel, highly active catalyst Ni@MOF-5 showed unexpected activity at low temperature for CO₂ methanation.

A combination of noble metal Ag and semiconductor CeO₂ in certain solvents (such as methanol and ethylene glycol) enhanced surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which was attributed to the good dispersion of Ag particles on CeO₂ and high Ag⁰ ratios on the surface. The enhanced SPR effect boosted absorption of incident light and facilitated charge carrier separation and transport efficiency caused by the formation of Schottky barriers, thus promoting VLPCR performance. The optimum ACG sample (ethylene glycol was adopted as the solvent) exhibited the maximum VLPCR activity, achieving a CH₄ yield of 100 μmol and a CH₃OH yield of 35 μmol per gram of catalyst per hour during 6 h visible-light irradiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3aceric oxide 3aethylene glycol 3airradiation 3amethane 3amethanol 3aoptical properties 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asemiconductors 3asilver 3asolvents 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aShi, Yunpeng1 aZhao, Yunxia1 aChen, Mindong1 aZhong, Qin1 aBu, Yunfei0 tRSC advances.g2018 Dec. 11, v. 8, no. 71 p.40731-40739dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra08938h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03791naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245014800171300001600319500001900335520180300354592002802157650002602185650001802211650001702229650002102246650001602267650000902283650001802292650001802310650001302328650001302341650001502354650001802369650001102387650001602398650002102414650001602435650001602451650001902467650001302486653002202499653002102521653001902542653001502561653002802576653002702604700002902631700002402660700002002684700002902704700002902733700002702762700002102789700002402810700002702834700002502861700002502886773012402911856008503035852000903120655001203129IND60704845120221121015029.0201104e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070484512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez, Jenny D.10aLeaf metabolic profiles of two soybean genotypes differentially affect the survival and the digestibility of Anticarsia gemmatalis caterpillars  ap. 196-212.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aInsect pests such as Anticarsia gemmatalis cause defoliation and yield losses. Soybean breeding has obtained resistant genotypes, however the mechanism remains unknown. Studies indicated the presence of deterrents compounds in the resistant genotype IAC17, and their leaf metabolite profiles were compared to the susceptible genotype UFV105, which was elicited or not by caterpillar infestation. Cluster analysis indicated a significative distinction between these profiles as well as differences in plant defense pathways. Methylquercetins were constitutively present in the largest concentrations, specifically in the IAC17. Relationship between the resistance and the levels of phytohormones jasmonic acid, abscisic acid and salicylic acid was not observed. However, 1-aminocyclopropane -1carboxylic acid levels indicated that the ethylene may be involved in the constitutive biosynthesis of bioactive compounds. Extracts were added to the diets at three different concentrations to evaluate the effect on caterpillar survival. Lowest survival rates were observed when extracts from the resistant IAC 17 were used, at the lowest concentrations. Survival rates were not higher when IAC 17 infested by caterpillars were used. On the other hand, when extracts from the susceptible were used, the survival reductions were only observed in the highest extract concentrations. These supplementations of the diet reduced the digestive capacity, agreeing with the proteolytic activities, whereas malformations of the intestinal cells were dose dependent. The inhibitory effects persisted in higher dilutions only for the IAC17. Constitutive resistance was also explained by higher levels of protease inhibition. These results can be useful to elucidate the genes and cascades controlling the resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnticarsia gemmatalis 3aabscisic acid 3abiosynthesis 3acluster analysis 3adefoliation 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adose response 3aethylene 3agenotype 3aintestines 3ajasmonic acid 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3aplant physiology 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3asalicylic acid 3asoybeans 0aInsect resistance 0aSoybean breeding 0aLC/MS profiles 0aFlavonoids 0aMethylquercetin pathway 0aPhytohormonal response1 aPinheiro, Valquiria J.M.1 aSilva, João Carlos1 aRomero, Juan V.1 aMeriño-Cabrera, Yaremis1 aCoutinho, Flaviane Silva1 aLourenção, André L.1 aSerrão, Jose E.1 aVital, Camilo Elber1 aFontes, Elizabeth P.B.1 aOliveira, Maria G.A.1 aRamos, Humberto J.O.0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2020 Oct., v. 155 p.196-212dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01700naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245022400167300001600391520032300407592002800730650001300758650004400771650001400815650001500829650001300844650002200857650002000879653005000899653002000949653004400969653002001013653001501033700002101048700001901069773013901088856007801227852000901305655001201314IND60521464020221119112627.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052146402DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1975-7-8152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKreutzer, Peter H.10aDarstellung und spektroskopische Eigenschaften von planaren Dipseudohalogeno-bis(phosphin)-platin(II)-Komplexen / Preparation and Spectroscopic Properties of Planar Dipseudohalogeno-bis(phosphine)-platinum(II) Complexes  ap. 544-549.  aThe preparation and properties of cis-diazido platinum complexes (R₃P)₂Pt(N₃)₂ are described.

The Chinese Government has implemented a series of subsidy policies to promote NEVs and replace traditional fuel vehicles (TFVs). However, the contribution of NEVs in reducing atmospheric pollutants varies due to differences in mileages and emission factors. Previous literature has rarely studied the influence of NEV subsidy policies on the reduction of atmospheric pollutants, especially with respect to different kinds of vehicles. This paper divides motor vehicles into four categories: buses, taxis, passenger cars, and special vehicles. Taking into account the purchase subsidies and construction subsidies on the charging infrastructure of NEVs, this paper proposes an evaluation index, namely, the comprehensive subsidy efficiency, that measures the effectiveness of the two subsidies in reducing emissions of atmospheric pollutants among different NEVs. In response to Beijing’s plan to prioritize the promotion of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), this paper uses relevant data of BEVs instead of NEVs for the analysis. Taking Beijing as a case study, promotion proportion of NEVs were set according to the comprehensive subsidy efficiency of various NEVs; furthermore, scenario simulation of NEV subsidy policies in 2017 and 2020 was conducted. The results revealed new energy taxis and special vehicles have great a potential to alleviate the greenhouse effect and haze weather, respectively. By prioritizing the promotion of NEVs with higher comprehensive subsidy efficiency, one can achieve greater reduction in the emissions of atmospheric pollutants with equal financial funds. Furthermore, this paper suggests subsidy policies of NEVs from the perspective of reducing emissions of atmospheric pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aautomobiles 3acase studies 3aemissions 3aemissions factor 3aenergy 3afuels 3agreenhouse effect 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3apollutants 3apollution control 3asubsidies 3aweather 3aChina 0aReduce emissions 0aNEV subsidy Policies 0aComprehensive subsidy efficiency 0aHaze weather1 aWang, Liwan1 aChai, Jianxue0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 275 p.124069-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1240693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012900167300001400296520136600310592002801676650002801704650001701732650002301749650002201772650002401794650002401818653002801842653003101870653002101901653001801922653002401940653002501964700001501989700006402004700001702068700001702085773008702102856008402189852000902273655001202282IND60600438520221121055241.0180703e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060043852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2014.02.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSousa, Tiago12aA hybrid simulated annealing approach to handle energy resource management considering an intensive use of electric vehicles  ap. 81-96.  aThe massification of electric vehicles (EVs) can have a significant impact on the power system, requiring a new approach for the energy resource management. The energy resource management has the objective to obtain the optimal scheduling of the available resources considering distributed generators, storage units, demand response and EVs. The large number of resources causes more complexity in the energy resource management, taking several hours to reach the optimal solution which requires a quick solution for the next day. Therefore, it is necessary to use adequate optimization techniques to determine the best solution in a reasonable amount of time.This paper presents a hybrid artificial intelligence technique to solve a complex energy resource management problem with a large number of resources, including EVs, connected to the electric network. The hybrid approach combines simulated annealing (SA) and ant colony optimization (ACO) techniques. The case study concerns different EVs penetration levels. Comparisons with a previous SA approach and a deterministic technique are also presented. For 2000 EVs scenario, the proposed hybrid approach found a solution better than the previous SA version, resulting in a cost reduction of 1.94%. For this scenario, the proposed approach is approximately 94 times faster than the deterministic approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3acase studies 3acost effectiveness 3aelectric vehicles 3aresource management 3asystem optimization 0aAnt colony optimization 0aEnergy resource management 0aElectric vehicle 0aHybridization 0aSimulated annealing 0aVirtual power player1 aVale, Zita1 aCarvalho, Joao Paulo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0005-82991 aPinto, Tiago1 aMorais, Hugo0 tEnergy.g2014 Apr. 01, v. 67 p.81-96dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.02.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02473naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010600168500001900274520106800293592002801361650000901389650001901398650003101417650002601448650003101474650002101505650001401526650001701540650002101557650001801578650002001596650002001616650002201636650001401658653002201672653002001694700002001714700001601734700001801750700001901768700001901787773010201806856008601908852000901994655001202003IND60673024820221120121457.0200503e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067302482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1054452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ming-Zhi14aThe protective effects against cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced immunosuppression of three glucomannans  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe protective effects against cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced immunosuppression of three glucomannans from Dendrobium officinale (DOP), Aloe (ASP), and Konjac (KGM) respectively are investigated from the aspects of cellular and humoral immunity. Results showed that glucomannans enhanced the secretion of T helper type 1 (Th1) cytokines and the proportion of CD4 T lymphocytes, promoted the subpopulation of T lymphocytes by up-regulating T-bet and GATA-3 mRNA expressions. Meanwhile, glucomannans increased the secretion of immunoglobulins, stimulated the differentiation of plasmocytes by up-regulating IRF4, Blimp-1 and XBP-1 mRNA expressions. In addition, DOP had better effects on promoting T lymphocytes function and immunoglobulins production, KGM showed better effects in increasing cytokines production, while ASP had better effects in stimulating Th1 type immune response. These results suggested that all three glucomannans from different sources exhibited immunoregulatory function, however, each expressed their bioactivities in different mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAloe 3aAmorphophallus 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aDendrobium officinale 3aGATA transcription factors 3acyclophosphamide 3acytokines 3aglucomannans 3ahumoral immunity 3ahydrocolloids 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulins 3aimmunosuppression 3asecretion 0aCellular immunity 0amRNA expression1 aHuang, Xiao-Jun1 aHu, Jie-Lun1 aCui, Steve W.1 aXie, Ming-Yong1 aNie, Shao-Ping0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2020 Mar., v. 100 p.105445-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1054453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245016800175300001400343520115700357592002801514650002501542650001601567650002401583650001701607650002001624650001301644650002501657650001201682650001001694650002201704650002101726650001401747650001301761650001201774650001301786653002501799653002501824653001501849653001401864653001801878653001901896700001901915700001901934700001701953773009601970856008802066852000902154655001202163IND60619095620221121063057.0220326e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061909562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2018.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShah, Md Nur Ahad10aMolecular evolution of SUN-domain containing proteins in diverse plant species and their expression profiling in response to developmental and perturbation stimuli  ap. 28-42.  aSUN (Sad1/UNC-84) domain-containing proteins are highly conserved throughout evolution. They are localized to the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope and are involved in nuclear migration and nucleoskeleton formation. In the present study, a genome-wide investigation was performed in three dicotyledonous (Arabidopsis thaliana, Glycine max and Medicago truncatula) and three monocotyledonous (Oryza sativa, Zea mays and Sorghum bicolor) plants. A total of 56 SUN proteins encoded by 30 genes were identified. Based on their length, transmembrane topology, conserved domains and phylogenetic relationships, they could be divided into two previously defined groups- Cter-SUN and mid-SUN proteins. Expression of these genes was analyzed in different developmental stages, tissues and various unfavorable conditions such as salinity, drought, and hormonal treatment. Analyses indicated that the expression of SUN1/2 transcripts are ubiquitous; that of SUN3/4 are development/tissue regulated, and SUN5 are inflorescence stage-specific. This study provides an initial framework for the characterization and functional validation of the plant SUN family.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aGlycine max 3aMedicago truncatula 3aOryza sativa 3aSorghum bicolor 3aZea mays 3adevelopmental stages 3adrought 3agenes 3amembrane proteins 3anuclear membrane 3aphylogeny 3asalinity 3atissues 3atopology 0aExpression profiling 0aGenome-wide analysis 0aSUN domain 0aEvolution 0aPlant kingdom 0aAbiotic stress1 aArabia, Shatil1 aIslam, Tahmina1 aGhose, Ajit,0 tPhytochemistry.g2019 Jan., v. 157 p.28-42dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2018.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012500167300001600292520170800308592002802016650002902044650002402073650001402097650001402111650001102125650002402136650001502160650001402175650002402189650002302213650002102236650001002257650001102267650001102278650001302289650002002302650001302322651002302335700002602358700002102384773008302405856008102488852000902569655001202578IND60574564020221120045459.0170728e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057456402DNAL7 a10.1007/s10201-016-0505-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarson, Eric R.10aComparison of trophic function between the globally invasive crayfishes Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii  ap. 275-286.  aImpacts of invasive species may manifest most strongly if these organisms are highly distinct functionally from the native species they often replace. Yet, should we expect functional differences between native and invasive species of generalist organisms like freshwater crayfish? Some existing evidence has pointed to native and invasive crayfish species as ecologically equivalent. We contribute to this literature by comparing the trophic niches of the globally invasive crayfishes Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii, by applying carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses to replicated allopatric (alone) and sympatric (together) lake populations in western Washington State, USA, where P. clarkii has been recently introduced and P. leniusculus is presumed native. Our study corrected for potential inherent differences in lake food webs as a consequence of lake abiotic or biotic characteristics using random effects in linear mixed effects models. We found that although overall trophic niche size or area of these species was not significantly different, P. leniusculus was significantly higher in trophic position than P. clarkii when also accounting for the effects of body size, sex, and lakes as random effects. This pattern of increased trophic position of P. leniusculus over P. clarkii was conserved over time in one sympatric lake for which we had data over multiple years. Cumulatively, our findings point to trophic differences between the globally cosmopolitan crayfishes P. leniusculus and P. clarkii, particularly when accounting for the ways that ecosystem context can affect food web structure of communities and the trophic resources available to these consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPacifastacus leniusculus 3aProcambarus clarkii 3aallopatry 3abody size 3acarbon 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3afood webs 3afreshwater crayfish 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3alakes 3amodels 3aniches 3anitrogen 3astable isotopes 3asympatry 3aWashington (state)1 aTwardochleb, Laura A.1 aOlden, Julian D.0 tLimnology.g2017 Aug., v. 18, no. 3 p.275-286dSpringer Japanx1439-86217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-016-0505-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245013000209520168500339592002802024650002302052650001402075650001102089650001802100650001202118650001402130650001002144650001202154650001002166650001602176650001402192650002002206650000902226653001302235653001302248653001302261653001602274653001402290653001702304700002002321773011302341856008802454852000902542655001202551IND60767875120221120220921.0220523e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076787512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.domaniend.2022.1067212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFowler, K.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6147-301010aCharacterizing zoo-housed Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) reproduction using gonadal steroid metabolite analysis in feces  aMillions of people globally depend on camelids, which demands an increased knowledge of their reproduction. We used zoo-housed Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus) to better understand camelid reproductive physiology. Our specific objectives were to: 1) validate the use of fecal hormone metabolite analysis to characterize camel reproductive physiology during sexual maturity and pregnancy; and 2) determine the influence of season on male and female reproduction. We collected fecal samples from 1 male and 3 females housed at Lincoln Park Zoo (Chicago, IL, USA) 1 to 2 times per week for 3.5 years. Extracted hormones were analyzed using enzyme immunoassays for progestogen (FPM), estrogen (FEM), and androgen (FAM) metabolite concentrations. One female sexually matured during our study as evidenced by increased FEM baseline. Results demonstrated seasonal effects on male androgen production with FAMs higher (P < 0.05) January to June (mean ± SEM: 664.6 ± 22.6 ng/g wet feces), compared to July to December (401.6 ± 17.5 ng/g wet feces). One female experienced a persistent corpus luteum, a reproductive abnormality, which was identified by prolonged elevated FPM. FPMs increased during pregnancy for two females (452.9 ± 24.9 and 294.4 ± 19.8 ng/g wet feces) with a gestation of 404 d and 442 d, respectively. The third female never conceived. The FEMs varied (P < 0.05) during the year with no clear seasonal patterns (monthly mean range: 213.1–371.0 ng/g wet feces). Fecal hormone metabolite analysis is a validated method for assessing male seasonality and female pregnancy in the Bactrian camel and can for their management and conservation in zoos and the wild.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamelus bactrianus 3aandrogens 3acamels 3acorpus luteum 3aenzymes 3aestrogens 3afeces 3afemales 3amales 3ametabolites 3apregnancy 3asexual maturity 3azoos 0aAndrogen 0aCamelids 0aEstrogen 0aNoninvasive 0aPregnancy 0aProgesterone1 aSantymire, R.M.0 tDomestic animal endocrinology.g2022 July, v. 80 p.106721-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl34945x0739-72407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.domaniend.2022.1067213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04939naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010900166500001900275520254000294592002802834650001202862650001702874650001102891650001702902650001902919650002202938650002002960650001502980650001602995650001903011650001503030650001603045650001903061650001903080650001103099650001703110650002803127650001703155650001303172651001103185651001203196651001603208653002003224653003803244653001803282653002103300653001303321653001503334700001803349700001803367700001903385700001903404700001703423700002203440700002003462700001903482700001803501700001503519700002003534700002103554700002503575700002303600700002203623700002303645700002603668700002003694700001803714700001603732700001803748700002103766700001403787700001903801700002403820700002303844773011503867856008203982852000904064655001204073IND60699638420221118012731.0210401e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069963842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1118922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeise, Kathrin10aWetland extent tools for SDG 6.6.1 reporting from the Satellite-based Wetland Observation Service (SWOS)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWetlands are the most fragile and threatened ecosystems worldwide, and also one of the most rapidly declining. At the same time wetlands are typically biodiversity hotspots and provide a range of valuable ecosystem services, such as water supply and purification, disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and carbon sequestration.Pressures on wetlands are likely to further intensify in the coming decades due to increased global demand for land and water, and due to climate change. Stakeholders at all levels of governance have to be involved to slow, stop and reverse these processes. However, the information they need on wetland extent, their ecological character, and their ecosystem services is often scattered, sparse and difficult to find and access.The freely available Sentinel satellite data of the Copernicus Programme, as well as the Landsat archive, provide a comprehensive basis to map and inventory wetland areas (extent), to derive information on the ecological status, as well as long- and short-term trends in wetland characteristics. However, making use of these Earth Observation (EO) resources for robust and standardized wetland monitoring requires expert knowledge on often complex data processing techniques, which impedes practical implementation. In this respect, the Satellite-based Wetland Observation Service (SWOS), a Horizon 2020 funded project (www.swos-service.eu) has developed and made disseminated monitoring approaches based on EO data, specifically designed for less experienced satellite data users.The SWOS monitoring tools aim at assisting countries in conducting national wetland inventories for their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting and monitoring obligations, and additionally facilitates other monitoring obligations such as those required by the Ramsar Convention and supports decision-making in local conservation activities. The four main components of the SWOS approach are: map and indicator production; software development; capacity building; and initializing the GEO Wetlands Community Portal. Wetland managers and data analysists from more than fifty wetland sites and river basins across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa investigated the benefits and limitations of this EO-based wetland mapping and monitoring approach.We describe research that applies the SWOS tools to test their potential for the mapping of wetlands in a case study based in Albania, and show its effectiveness to derive metrics relevant to the monitoring of SDG indicator 6.6.1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3abiodiversity 3acarbon 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3acomputer software 3adecision making 3aecosystems 3aenvironment 3aexpert opinion 3agovernance 3ainventories 3aremote sensing 3arisk reduction 3arivers 3astakeholders 3asustainable development 3awater supply 3awetlands 3aAfrica 3aAlbania 3aMiddle East 0aWetland decline 0aWetland management and monitoring 0aSDG reporting 0aRamsar reporting 0aSentinel 0aCopernicus1 aHofer, René,1 aFranke, Jonas1 aGuelmami, Anis1 aSimonson, Will1 aMuro, Javier1 aO’Connor, Brian1 aStrauch, Adrian1 aFlink, Stephan1 aEberle, Jonas1 aMino, Eric1 aThulin, Susanne1 aPhilipson, Petra1 avan Valkengoed, Eric1 aTruckenbrodt, John1 aZander, Franziska1 aSánchez, Antonio,1 aSchröder, Christoph,1 aThonfeld, Frank1 aFitoka, Eleni1 aScott, Emma1 aLing, Matthew1 aSchwarz, Michael1 aKunz, Ina1 aThürmer, Grit1 aPlasmeijer, Anouska1 aHilarides, Lammert0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 247 p.111892-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1118923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01675naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245009100178300001600269520075500285592002801040653002701068653001501095653001201110653001901122773017601141856008301317852000901400655001201409IND60527273320221121025240.0160713e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052727332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrras.2015.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Sheikh, Enass Mohamed10aApplication of waste frying oil as an extractant for uranium from sulfate leach liquor  ap. 155-163.  aThe possibility of using the waste frying oil (WFO) as an extractant for uranium from its sulfate liquor has been studied. Several experiments were conducted to determine the relevant factors affecting both the extraction and stripping of the uranium from a synthetic solution. At the optimum conditions, it was found that the maximum uranium uptake would attain 54 mg/g at a solution pH of 3.5. Kinetic characteristics of the loading process have been found to satisfactorily fitting to the pseudo-ﬁrst-order equation.

Additional uranium-thorium ages have extended the paleoenvironmental record back from 3250 to 5250calyr BP, and the stable isotope (δ18O and δ13C) record is dramatically improved by 660 new values. A series of major dry events (MDEs) evident in stable isotopes, ultraviolet-stimulated luminescence, and petrography began ~3100calyr BP, and the initiation of these events coincides with an increase in El Niño dominance and southern shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Three MDEs, centered at 1750calyr BP (200CE), 1100calyr BP (850CE), and 850calyr BP (1100CE) and found in other regional climate records, coincide with Maya sociopolitical changes. Residuals from regression of δ13C versus δ18O are interpreted as a proxy for maize cultivation and land clearing, with residual values gradually increasing at the start of Preclassic Period settlement (3950calyr BP/2000BCE), peaking after 2250calyr BP (300BCE) during major Maya development in the Late Preclassic and Classic Periods, and dropping to pre-Preclassic values after regional land abandonment (~850calyr BP/1100CE). Regional Maya population growth and cultural expansion may have been aided by abnormally low precipitation variability, as stable isotope variability suggests the Late Preclassic through the Late Classic was the most stable precipitation regime of the past 4000years. This additional research on MC01 complements other regional paleoenvironmental records that suggest that MDEs coincided with disruptions in Maya society from the Preclassic through the Postclassic Periods. Although it is clear that not all significant sociopolitical changes can be attributed to the MDEs, these events likely played an antagonistic role in social stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aabandoned land 3acarbon 3aclimate 3acorn 3aland clearing 3aland use 3aluminescence 3aoxygen 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3aplateaus 3apopulation growth 3asociety 3astable isotopes 3aBelize 0aClassic Maya collapse 0aPaleoclimate 0aStalagmite 0aSpeleothem 0aBelize 0aResilience1 aBrook, George A.1 aRailsback, L.

Early screening of suspected cases is key to controlling the spread of AIVs. In this study, an accurate, rapid, and triplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed for the simultaneous detection of AIV subtypes H5, H7 and H9. The sensitivity of the real-time PCR was at least 100 times higher than that of the conventional PCR, with a detection limit of 50 copies and an EID50 of 1 (50% egg infections dose) for the H5, H7, and H9 subtypes. The lack of cross-reaction with other avian respiratory viruses suggested that the real-time PCR assay was highly specific. The reproducibility of the assay was confirmed using plasmids containing targets genes. Furthermore, 362 clinical field samples were evaluated. Subtypes H5, H7 and H9 were detected in 102 (28.18%) samples by real-time PCR and in 35 (9.67%) samples by conventional virus isolation. These results indicate that the triplex real-time PCR assay has good sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility and that it might be useful for laboratory surveillance and rapid diagnosis of the H5, H7 and H9 subtypes of influenza A viruses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3abirds 3across reaction 3aeggs 3afinancial economics 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3apandemic 3aplasmids 3apublic health 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 3aviruses 0aReal-time PCR 0aH5 0aH7 0aH9 0aAvian influenza virus1 aYao, Lu1 aZhai, Feifei1 aChen, Yuqing1 aLei, Jing1 aBi, Zhenwei1 aHu, Jianhua1 aXiao, Qian1 aSong, Suquan1 aYan, Liping1 aZhou, Jiyong0 tJournal of virological methods.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002400180245012900204506007600333520153500409592002801944506003701972650001302009650001902022650001102041650001202052650002102064650003002085650001302115650001902128650001902147650002302166700001902189700002902208700002802237700001602265700002202281700002602303700002902329700002702358773012202385856007302507852000902580655001202589IND60650217020221207104337.0190709e20171113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065021702DNAL7 a10.3390/nu91112392doi7 aPMC57077112pmcid7 a291371912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbel, Marianne Hope10aMaternal Iodine Intake and Offspring Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: Results from a Large Prospective Cohort Study  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCurrent knowledge about the relationship between mild to moderately inadequate maternal iodine intake and/or supplemental iodine on child neurodevelopment is sparse. Using information from 77,164 mother-child pairs in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, this study explored associations between maternal iodine intake and child attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis, registered in the Norwegian Patient Registry and maternally-reported child ADHD symptoms at eight years of age. Pregnant women reported food and supplement intakes by questionnaire in gestational week 22. In total, 1725 children (2.2%) were diagnosed with ADHD. In non-users of supplemental iodine (53,360 mothers), we found no association between iodine intake from food and risk of child ADHD diagnosis (p = 0.89), while low iodine from food (<200 µg/day) was associated with higher child ADHD symptom scores (adjusted difference in score up to 0.08 standard deviation (SD), p < 0.001, n = 19,086). In the total sample, we found no evidence of beneficial effects of maternal use of iodine-containing supplements (n = 23,804) on child ADHD diagnosis or symptom score. Initiation of iodine supplement use in gestational weeks 0–12 was associated with an increased risk of child ADHD (both measures). In conclusion, insufficient maternal iodine intake was associated with increased child ADHD symptom scores at eight years of age, but not with ADHD diagnosis. No reduction of risk was associated with maternal iodine supplement use.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achildren 3acohort studies 3aiodine 3amothers 3aneurodevelopment 3anutrition risk assessment 3apatients 3apregnant women 3aquestionnaires 3astandard deviation1 aYstrom, Eivind1 aCaspersen, Ida Henriette1 aMeltzer, Helle Margrete1 aAase, Heidi1 aTorheim, Liv Elin1 aAskeland, Ragna Bugge1 aReichborn-Kjennerud, Ted1 aBrantsæter, Anne Lise0 tNutrients.g2017 Nov. 13, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu91112393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01827naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003400151245009900185300001600284520075800300592002801058650002201086650001901108650001101127650001501138650002101153650001101174651000901185653001101194653001101205653001901216653001001235653000901245773011701254856008501371852000901456655001201465IND60573615320221119170054.0170724e20170704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057361532DNAL7 a10.1080/00207233.2017.13304932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdulrahman, Salam Abdulqadir10aFailure to securitise environmental problems in Iraq: the case of the Alwand and Sirwan Rivers  ap. 540-557.  aThe major rivers in Iraq are threatened by water and irrigation projects in neighbouring countries. The dried up Alwand River caused great damage to the agricultural lands in and around the town of Khanaqin and created a huge shortage of drinking water. After some years a dam was built which slowly and partially recovered the losses. Neither the Iraqi government nor the regional government of Iraqi Kurdistan dealt with the problem of the Alwand River as a security issue. After some years, the Iraqi government responded to it within its normal agenda. Drying up is looming for a much greater river in the region, the Sirwan River. There is almost no chance for a similar solution, let alone securitisation, to this problem, as this article reports.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3adrinking water 3adrying 3airrigation 3alocal government 3arivers 3aIraq 0aAlwand 0aSirwan 0asecuritisation 0awater 0aIraq0 tInternational journal of environmental studies.g2017 July 4, v. 74, no. 4 p.540-557dRoutledgex1029-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207233.2017.13304933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245016600164300001400330520191000344592002802254650001802282650001202300651001002312653002102322653002702343653001402370653001602384653002302400700001602423700001802439700002002457700001802477773013002495856008502625852000902710655001202719IND60524901820221120150103.0181010e20170515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052490182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2016.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Zhen10aStacking patterns and growth models of multiscopic structures within Cambrian Series 3 thrombolites at the Jiulongshan section, Shandong Province, northern China  ap. 45-57.  aThe Cambrian Series 3 thrombolites from the Changhia Formation, at the Jiulongshan section in Shandong Province, northern China, provide an excellent example for studying the development of calcimicrobial structures. Thrombolites constructed by calcimicrobes have particular stacking patterns, which are controlled by their environments and are reflected in the relationships between micro-, meso- and macroscopic structures, requiring an approach we term “multiscopic”. Under high-energy conditions, Epiphyton A (with dense micritic bifurcating thalli) grew sporadically and adapted to the environment by taking a bushy-lateral form, because the bushy-upward form is more likely to be broken by waves or currents. Epiphyton A was fused with each other to form spotted frameworks at the mesoscopic level. The weak baffling of spotted frameworks led to the formation of low-relief tabular/lentoid macrostructures via preferential lateral accretion. In low-energy, deep-subtidal settings, Epiphyton A and Epiphyton B (with microsparry segments in the bifurcating thalli) coexisted with Hedstroemia A (with a wide terminal) and B (with a narrow terminal). These calcimicrobes grew abundantly in both the vertical and lateral directions, fusing together to form meshed frameworks, or dendritic frameworks if vertical fusion of bushy-upward calcimicrobes was predominant. The preferential vertical stacking of meshed and dendritic mesostructures highlights the ability of these frameworks to actively baffle lime mud, and ultimately to form large-domed macrostructures. Stacking patterns in these multiscopic structures help to inform environmental interpretations of thrombolites. The thrombolitic growth model we present here provides important insights into the environmental interpretations of thrombolites in other cases, especially the calcimicrobe-dominated early and middle Palaeozoic thrombolites.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrowth models 3athallus 3aChina 0aGrowth processes 0aEnvironmental controls 0aEpiphyton 0aHedstroemia 0aChanghia Formation1 aLiu, Jianbo1 aEzaki, Yoichi1 aAdachi, Natsuko1 aDu, Shengxian0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2017 May 15, v. 474 p.45-57dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2016.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245009100165300001400256520140300270592002801673650001401701650001301715650001001728650001801738650001001756650000901766650002101775650002001796650001401816650001501830650001701845650002001862650001901882653003101901653002201932653003401954653003101988700001802019700002002037700002202057700002002079773011202099856008602211852000902297655001202306IND60617901620221121155932.0181207e20181210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061790162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHo, Yi-Ju10aThermal-sensitive acoustic droplets for dual-mode ultrasound imaging and drug delivery  ap. 26-36.  aMild hyperthermia (40–43 °C) could assist with acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV) via focused ultrasound heating and enable ultrasound thermal imaging to monitor the heating position. We explored the possibility of predicting the treatment position of ADV using thermal-sensitive droplets (TSDs) and ultrasound thermal imaging. The TSDs were created with an encapsulated mixture of C5F12 and C6F14 that could be vaporized by ultrasound under mild hyperthermia. The ultrasound imaging-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound system was used to collect ultrasound images, heat tumors, and vaporize the TSDs. The overlap between the location of heating and ADV-induced bubble formation was used to evaluate the accuracy of predicting the treatment position. The optimal fabrication of TSDs (1.21 ± 0.19 μm, volume ratio of C5F12:C6F14 = 7:3) increased ADV efficiency by 33 ± 11% at 41 °C under an acoustic pressure of 8.6 MPa. The accuracy of ADV region prediction by ultrasound thermal imaging was 87.2 ± 3.5% for the in vitro study and 83.2 ± 8.6% for the in vivo study. The similarity among the location of bubble enhancement and distribution of 41 °C areas demonstrated the credibility of our estimates.

In present study, the role of Si in regulating the photosynthesis and its associated metabolic events in Kentucky bluegrass (cv. Arcadia) were investigated under drought stress. Drought stress and four levels (0, 200, 400, 800 mg L⁻¹) of Si (Na₂SiO₃.9H₂O) were imposed on 1-year-old plants removed from field and cultured under glasshouse conditions. After 20 days of drought stress, the plants were re-watered to reach soil field capacity for the examination of recovery on the second and the seventh day. The experiment was arranged in completely randomized design replicated four times. Drought stress severely decreased the photosynthesis, water use efficiency, stomatal conductance, cholorophyll contents, Rubisco activity, and Rubisco activation state in Kentucky bluegrass. Nevertheless, application of Si had a positive influence on all these attributes, particularly under stress conditions. As compared to control, Si application at 400 mg L⁻¹ recorded 78, 64, and 48 % increase in photosynthesis, Rubisco initial activity, and Rubisco total activity, respectively, at 20 days of drought. Higher photosynthesis and higher Rubisco activity in Si-applied treatments suggest that Si may have possible (direct or indirect) role in maintenance of more active Rubisco enzyme and Rubisco activase and more stable proteins for carbon assimilation under stress conditions, which needs to be elucidated in further studies.  aPublisher supplied data  aProjects No.31272191, 31372091, and 30871735cKey Technology program R&D of China; National natural science founding of China, 3aPoa pratensis 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3adrought 3afield capacity 3agreenhouses 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3aproteins 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase activase 3asilicon 3astomatal conductance 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency1 aYajun, Chen1 aShah, Fahad,1 aHussain, Saddam1 aNa, Li1 aXin, Li1 aAlhussien, Safa Abd Alaleem Fadal Elseed0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2016 Sept., v. 23, no. 17 p.17647-17655dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6957-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02306naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002400180245013300204506007600337520100600413592002801419506003701447650001001484650001401494650002201508650001601530650000901546650002401555650002201579650002601601650001801627700002201645700001901667700001801686773012201704856007301826852000901899655001201908IND60650217120221207104422.0190709e20171027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065021712DNAL7 a10.3390/nu91111782doi7 aPMC57076502pmcid7 a290770102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTokudome, Yoshihiro10aRecovery Effects of Oral Administration of Glucosylceramide and Beet Extract on Skin Barrier Destruction by UVB in Hairless Mice  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPurified glucosylceramide from beet extract (beet GlcCer) and beet extract containing an equal amount of GlcCer were administered orally to ultra violet B (UVB)-irradiated mice, and differences in the protective effects against skin barrier dysfunction caused by UVB irradiation were compared. In the beet GlcCer group, epidermal thickening and the decrease in stratum corneum (SC) ceramide content caused by UVB irradiation were reduced. In the group that was orally administered beet extract containing glucosylceramide, effects similar to those in the beet GlcCer group were observed. Oral administration of beet GlcCer had no obvious effects against an increase in TEWL or decrease in SC water content after UVB irradiation, but there was improvement in the beet extract group. Oral administration of beet GlcCer is effective in improving skin barrier function in UVB-irradiated mice. Beet extract contains constituents other than GlcCer that are also effective in improving skin barrier function.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abeets 3aceramides 3aglucosylceramides 3airradiation 3amice 3aoral administration 3aprotective effect 3aultraviolet radiation 3awater content1 aMasutani, Noriomi1 aUchino, Shohei1 aFukai, Hisano0 tNutrients.g2017 Oct. 27, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu91111783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010700166300001400273520149900287592002801786650001701814650001301831650001701844650003101861650001001892650002201902650001201924650001501936650001801951650001901969650001401988650002102002650001302023650001302036650001302049650003302062650004002095700001702135700001702152700005702169773011202226856008602338852000902424655001202433IND60617901820221123023444.0181207e20181210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061790182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.10.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Bo-Ya10aTumor targeted genome editing mediated by a multi-functional gene vector for regulating cell behaviors  ap. 90-98.  aFor effective regulation of cell behaviors and prevention of tumor development by genome editing, we constructed multi-functional self-assembled nanoparticles based on natural polymers to deliver CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid to tumorous cells. The CRISPR based gene editing plasmid to knockout CDK11 gene was complexed with protamine sulfate, and then the complex was decorated by a multi-functional outer layer composed of an endosomolytic peptide (KALA) and aptamer AS1411 incorporated carboxymethyl chitosan. The resultant multi-functional nanoparticles, which exhibit significantly enhanced delivery efficiency, can specifically deliver the plasmid into tumor cell nuclei owing to the favorable effects of KALA in cellular uptake and endosomal escape, together with the cancer cell and cell nucleus targeting capability of AS1411 ligands. The genome editing mediated by the nanoparticles leads to a dramatic decrease (>75%) in CDK11 expression, which results in further modulation of cancer cells with significant down-regulation of the proteins (MMP-9 and VEGF) involved in tumor development and metastasis as well as up-regulation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. More importantly, the detection of immune-related proteins after genome editing shows that the significantly enhanced Fas, CD80, MICA, MICB, and HLA-1 expression and decreased CD47 and MUC1 expression, indicating the genome editing is favorable for reversal of tumor-induced immunosuppression and prevention of tumor development.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell nucleus 3achitosan 3agene editing 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aimmunosuppression 3aligands 3ametastasis 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aoligonucleotides 3aplasmids 3apolymers 3asulfates 3atumor suppressor protein p53 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aHe, Xiao-Yan1 aZhuo, Ren-Xi1 aCheng, Si-Xue1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9611-44210 tJournal of controlled release.g2018 Dec. 10, v. 291 p.90-98dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.10.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01992naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245005900166520100400225592002801229650001601257650002501273650001001298650001501308650000901323653001701332653002301349653001901372653002101391700001301412700001401425773011801439856008801557852000901645655001201654IND60762983820221123002148.0221004e20220510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076298382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1530032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xian10aAerosolization of fungal spores in indoor environments  aFungi in indoor environments can cause adverse health effects through inhalation and epidermal exposure. The risk of fungal exposure originates from the aerosolization of fungal spores. However, spore aerosolization is still not well understood. This paper provides a review of indoor fungal contamination, especially the aerosolization of fungal spores. We attempted to summarize what is known today and to identify what more information is needed to predict the aerosolization of fungal spores. This paper first reviews fungal contamination in indoor environments and HVAC systems. The detachment of fungal spores from colonies and the spore aerosolization principle are then summarized. Based on the above discussion, prediction methods for spore aerosolization are discussed. This review further clarifies the current situation and future efforts required to accurately predict spore aerosolization. This information is useful for forecasting and controlling the aerosolization of fungal spores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironment 3afungal contamination 3afungi 3aprediction 3arisk 0aFungal spore 0aIndoor environment 0aAerosolization 0aDetachment force1 aLiu, Dan1 aYao, Jian0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 May 10, v. 820 p.153003-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1530033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010200170300001600272520111200288592002801400650001501428650001501443650001301458650001201471650001201483650001401495650002201509650001101531650001801542650001301560650001501573650002001588653001501608653001901623653000801642653000901650653001501659653001501674700001901689773008301708856008401791852000901875655001201884IND60524902020221120125506.0160711e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052490202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2016.06.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorum, Katie W.10aUsing density functional theory to study shape-reactivity relationships in Keggin Al-nanoclusters  ap. 413-420.  aKeggin-based aluminum nanoclusters have been shown to be efficient sorbents for the removal of arsenic from water. Obtaining a molecular-level understanding of the adsorption processes associated with these molecules is of fundamental importance, and could pave the way for rational design strategies for water treatment. Due to their size and the availability of experimental crystal structures, Al nanoclusters are computationally tractable at the density functional theory (DFT) level. Here, we compare the reactivity of three aluminum polycations: [Al13O4(OH)24(H2O)12]7+ (Al13), [Al30O8(OH)56(H2O)26]18+ (Al30), and [Al32O8(OH)60(H2O)30]20+ (Al32). We use DFT calculations to determine reactivity as a function of particle topography, using sulfate and chloride as adsorption probes. Our comparative modeling of outer-sphere adsorption of Cl− and SO42− on Al13, Al30, and A132 supports that the unique “hourglass” shape characteristic to Al30 gives rise to relatively strong adsorption in the molecular beltway, as well as a wide range of reaction energies as a function of particle topography.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3aarsenic 3acations 3achlorides 3acrystal structure 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3asulfates 3atopography 3awater treatment 0aAl Keggins 0aAl polycations 0aDFT 0aAl30 0aReactivity 0aAdsorption1 aMason, Sara E.0 tWater research.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 102 p.413-420dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2016.06.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245009000169300001400259500001500273520096400288592002801252650002001280650001301300650002801313650001101341650001301352650001101365650001801376650001901394650001901413650001201432650001301444650000701457650001601464650001801480650002101498650001701519650002101536651001101557653002201568653001701590700001801607700002101625700001801646700001801664700001901682700002001701700002001721773009501741856008701836852000901923655001201932IND60088540320221122030738.0141102e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008854032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2011.10.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoresco, V.10aMicrobiological and physicochemical analysis of the coastal waters of southern Brazil  ap. 40-48.  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this study was to assess the impact of sewage discharge on coastal waters by evaluating the influence of physicochemical parameters on the presence of enteric microorganisms in seawater samples collected from 11 beaches in Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil, over a one-year period (August 2009 to July 2010).

Very little is known regarding the occurrence or diversity of these fungi in South America. The aim of this study was to consider their occurrence on native Nothofagus trees in the Patagonian Andes of Argentina. Isolates were collected in national parks and provincial reserves in Patagonia between 2009 and 2011. These were grouped based on morphology, and 22 representative isolates were included in phylogenetic analyses based on sequence data of multiple loci (LSU, ITS, beta-tubulin and translation elongation factor-1 alpha genes). The isolates could be assigned to ten different taxa, and included eight species of Ophiostoma s. l., one species of Leptographium, and one species in the Sporothrix lignivora complex. Three of the species are described as new, including Ophiostoma patagonicum, Leptographium gestamen, and Sporothrix cabralii. Ophiostoma quercus and O. noveae-zelandiae are reported for the first time from Argentina, and we show that the latter species is distinct from O. pluriannulatum, in contrast to a previous suggestion that they represent the same taxon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeptographium 3aNothofagus 3aOphiostoma 3aSporothrix 3afungi 3agenes 3ainsects 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aloci 3anational parks 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3atranslation (genetics) 3atubulin 3aAndes region 3aArgentina1 ade Beer, Z.

This paper reports an investigation into the impact of 12 freeze-thaw cycles on the mechanical properties of stabilized soils. Results indicate that freeze-thaw cycles reduce the unconfined compressive strength of all the test specimens by 10%. A weak stabilized material, with a small compressive strength, has a great material loss and a big drop in compressive strength. In this study, the various stabilized test pieces do not undergo volume change after eight cycles. The water content of all test pieces decreases, until equilibrium between forward and reverse water migration.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompression strength 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3aloam soils 3amechanical properties 3awater content 3aBelgium 0aFrost 0asoils 0acement 0alime 0aresistance 0adurability1 aSierens, Zeger1 aJoseph i Mayol, Miquel,1 aBenoot, Jelle1 aBoehme, Luc0 tInternational journal of environmental studies.g2017 July 4, v. 74, no. 4 p.603-612dRoutledgex1029-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207233.2017.13350213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03564naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245016800175520168700343592002802030650001802058650002102076650001702097650002502114650002002139650001602159650001602175650001602191650001002207650002102217650001902238650001502257650002602272650003502298650004102333650001002374650001102384650001202395650002902407650001002436650001002446650001302456650001102469650001202480653001502492653001402507653001002521653001702531653001702548700002202565700002402587700003102611700001902642700003802661700003202699700001802731773008202749856008602831852000902917655001202926IND60666046120221122055530.0190913e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066604612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2019.1203312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPastor-Belda, Marta10aDual stir bar sorptive extraction coupled to thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for the determination of endocrine disruptors in human tissues  aThe validation of a procedure for the determination of six alkylphenols (APs), 4-tert-butylphenol, 4-pentylphenol, 4-tert-octylphenol, 4-hexylphenol, 4-octylphenol and 4-nonylphenol, and three bisphenols (BPs), bisphenol A, bisphenol F and bisphenol Z, in seven human organs and tissues (kidney, liver, heart, lung, spleen, brain and abdominal fat) obtained from eight autopsies is presented. Previously ground samples were treated by salt-assisted liquid-liquid extraction (SALLE) for isolation of the analytes and then pre-concentrated using dual stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE), allowing two different extraction conditions for the same sample. Finally, thermal desorption was used as the injector system in combination with gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). To determine BPs, derivatization using acetic anhydride was required, although this step was not necessary for the APs. Two parallel extractions of the contaminants with the stir bars were performed, followed by thermal desorption and chromatographic analysis. The procedure provided quantification limits between 0.050 and 4.0 ng g−1 for APs and from 0.26 to 2.6 ng g−1 for BPs. Repeatability and reproducibility values were lower than 15% in all cases. The accuracy of the procedure was established by a recovery study, which provided values in the 85.8–115% range for APs and 83.6–120% for BPs. Samples were analyzed with the proposed methodology and data were processed by ANOVA tests to study the behaviour and bioaccumulation of these compounds in human tissues or organs. In addition, discriminant analysis detected age- and sex-dependent differences in bioaccumulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdominal fat 3aacetic anhydride 3aalkylphenols 3aanalysis of variance 3abioaccumulation 3abisphenol A 3abisphenol F 3abisphenol Z 3abrain 3achemical species 3aderivatization 3adesorption 3adiscriminant analysis 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheart 3ahumans 3akidneys 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3aliver 3alungs 3anecropsy 3aspleen 3atissues 0aBisphenols 0aDual SBSE 0aGC-MS 0aHuman organs 0aChemometrics1 aDrauschke, Tamara1 aCampillo, Natália,1 aArroyo-Manzanares, Natalia1 aTorres, Carmen1 aPérez Cárceles, María Dolores,1 aHernández-Córdoba, Manuel1 aViñas, Pilar0 tTalanta.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 207dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.1203313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245010900203500001900312520175200331592002802083650001902111650001302130650001202143650001802155650002902173650001802202650001802220650001502238650001402253650001402267650001902281650002502300650001002325651001602335700003302351700002502384773011502409856008202524852000902606655001202615IND60699638920221118012834.0210401e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069963892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1119402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Yanlei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5711-754710aRemote sensing and statistical analysis of the effects of hurricane María on the forests of Puerto Rico  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWidely recognized as one of the worst natural disaster in Puerto Rico's history, hurricane María made landfall on September 20, 2017 in southeast Puerto Rico as a high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale causing widespread destruction, fatalities and forest disturbance. This study focused on hurricane María's effect on Puerto Rico's forests as well as the effect of landform and forest characteristics on observed disturbance patterns. We used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to assess the severity of forest disturbance using a disturbance metric based on Landsat 8 satellite data composites with pre and post-hurricane María. Forest structure, tree phenology characteristics, and landforms were obtained from satellite data products, including digital elevation model and global forest canopy height. Our analyses showed that forest structure, and characteristics such as forest age and forest type affected patterns of forest disturbance. Among forest types, highest disturbance values were found in sierra palm, transitional, and tall cloud forests; seasonal evergreen forests with coconut palm; and mangrove forests. For landforms, greatest disturbance metrics was found at high elevations, steeper slopes, and windward surfaces. As expected, high levels of disturbance were also found close to the hurricane track, with disturbance less severe as hurricane María moved inland. Results demonstrated that forest and landform characteristics accounted for 34% of the variation in spatial forest spectral disturbance patterns. This study demonstrated an informative regional approach, combining remote sensing with statistical analyses to investigate factors that result in variability in hurricane effects on forest ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCocos nucifera 3aInternet 3aLandsat 3acanopy height 3adigital elevation models 3aforest canopy 3aforest damage 3ahurricanes 3alandforms 3aphenology 3aremote sensing 3astatistical analysis 3atrees 3aPuerto Rico1 aNegrón-Juárez, Robinson I.1 aChambers, Jeffrey Q.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 247 p.111940-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1119403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01448naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002200161245006100183300001800244500000900262520056300271592002800834650002200862650001600884650002600900773015100926856009601077852000901173655001201182IND60667846520221118165626.0191125e198809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066784652DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1988.03615995005200050058x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHubbell, David H.10aDevelopmental Aspects of Water-Repellency of Sandy Soils  ap. 1512-1514.  aepub  aIncrease in water-repellency of some sandy soils has been reported to be induced by conditions of high relative humidity.

To study the relationship between endotoxin tolerance and macrophage polarization, endotoxin tolerance was induced by 1 μg/mL LPS from the periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), in peritoneal macrophages (PMs) and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Repeated P. gingivalis LPS challenges increased the quantities of CD206+ PMs, while the number of CD86+CD206+ PMs was reduced compared with the non-tolerant group (p < 0.05). However, there were no changes in BMDMs (p > 0.05). Down regulations of TNF-α, IL-12, nitric oxide and MMP-2 production, and upregulated IL-10, MMP-9 levels and arginase-1 activities occurred in tolerant PMs and BMDMs (p < 0.05). P. gingivalis LPS-tolerant PMs and BMDMs also enhanced scrape-wound healing abilities of 15p-1 cells (p < 0.05). Expressions of phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (p-STAT6) and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) were increased, while p-MEK1/2 levels were downregulated in tolerant PMs and BMDMs (p < 0.05). IL-10 production in tolerant Stat6 knockdown RAW264.7 cells was lower than tolerant control cells (p < 0.05). P. gingivalis LPS-tolerant macrophages represented an intermediate state between M1/M2 polarization, which functioned as M2-like cells, and led to limited inflammatory responses and enhanced wound healing activities. The PTP1B-MEK1/2-STAT6 signaling pathway might be involved in the polarization of tolerant macrophages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorphyromonas gingivalis 3aendotoxins 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-12 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3anitric oxide 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3aprotein-tyrosine-phosphatase 3atransactivators 0alipopolysaccharide 0aendotoxin tolerance 0amacrophage polarization1 aFu, Zi-bo1 aJia-lu Chen, 1 aLiu, Yu-Jie1 aCao, Xian-zi1 aSun, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3996-99460 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2022 Mar., v. 164 p.105448-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2022.1054483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245009800158300001400256520157400270592002801844650002501872650001701897650002201914650001501936650001101951653004601962653000902008653001702017653002502034653002802059700001802087700002002105700002802125700001602153700002002169700002302189700002702212773011602239856007602355852000902431655001202440IND60517728820221120140936.0160405e20130912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051772882DNAL7 a10.1139/er-2013-00362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWine, Osnat10aUsing pollutant release and transfer register data in human health research: a scoping review  ap. 51-65.  aPollutant release and transfer registers (PRTRs) collect and provide information on chemicals released to the environment or otherwise managed as waste. They support the public’s right-to-know and provide useful information in gauging performance of facilities, sectors, and governments. The extent to which these data have been used in research, particularly in relation to human health, has not been documented. In this scoping review our objective was to learn from scholarly literature the extent and nature of the use of PRTR data in human health research. We performed literature searches (1994–2011) using various search engines and (or) key words. Articles selected for review were chosen following predefined criteria, to extract and analyze data. One hundred and eighty four papers were identified. Forty investigated possible relations with health outcomes: 33 of them identified positive associations. The rest explored other uses of PRTR data. Papers identified challenges, some imputable to the PRTR. We conclude that PRTR data are useful for research, including health-related studies, and have significant potential for prioritizing research needs that can influence policy, management, and ultimately human health. In spite of their inherent limitations, PRTRs represent a perfectible, unique useful source, whose application to human health research appears to be underutilized. Developing strategies to overcome these limitations could improve data quality and increase its utility in future environmental health research and policy applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental health 3ahuman health 3aissues and policy 3apollutants 3awastes 0apollutant release and transfer registries 0aPRTR 0ahuman health 0aindustrial emissions 0atoxic chemical releases1 aHackett, Cian1 aCampbell, Sandy1 aCabrera-Rivera, Orlando1 aBuka, Irena1 aZaïane, Osmar,1 aDeVito, Stephen C.1 aOsornio-Vargas, Alvaro0 tEnvironmental reviews.g2013 Sept. 12, v. 22, no. 1 p.51-65dNRC Research PresswJournal:18950x1208-60537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/er-2013-00363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001700161245012300178300001400301500000900315520181800324592002802142650002202170650001302192650001402205650002502219650000902244650001802253650001502271650000902286650002202295650001402317650002302331650001802354650001402372650001102386650002002397650001402417651001202431700001502443773014602458856009602604852000902700655001202709IND60667846720221118165610.0191125e197001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066784672DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1970.03615995003400010017x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, D.

Sodium Uptake by Corn Seedlings  ap. 49-56.  aepub  aHomoionic Na- and K- clay were prepared from the < 2µ fraction of Wyoming bentonite. The Na- clay separately, or combined with the K-clay, was mixed with water to produce clay-water systems having different clay contents. These systems were extruded through a hypodermic needle to orient the particles within them. Thereafter, some of them were disturbed by tapping their containers on the laboratory bench. Then the following quantities were measured on all or part of them: viscosity, relative partial molar free energy, (F̄ − F̄°), of NaCl, KCl and HCl, and water tension. It was found that the viscosity, the (F̄ − F̄°) of HCl, and the water tension were decreased by disturbing the clay systems, whereas, the (F̄ − F̄°) of both NaCl and KCl were increased. The physical significance of these changes was discussed. Samples of the Na- clay systems were mixed with 22ᴺᵃ and extruded around the radicles of corn seedlings (Zea mays L.). Then Na⁺ uptake was determined by analyzing the seedlings for ²²Na. It was found that Na⁺ uptake increased curvilinearly with Na- clay content in the range 0–4% clay and then leveled off. In the curvilinear range, Na⁺ uptake was directly proportional to the (F̄ − F̄°) of NaCl. Combined samples of Na- and K- clay were also mixed with 22Nₐ and extruded around the radicles of corn seedlings. The K- clay was used to maintain consistency and yet dilute the Na- clay enough so that the seedlings would respond to changes in the (F̄ − F̄°) of NaCl. As before, some of the systems were disturbed by tapping. It was found that Na⁺ uptake was greater from the disturbed than from the undisturbed systems. And since the disturbance also increased the (F̄ − F̄°) of NaCl, it was concluded that Na⁺ uptake depended on this quantity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aZea mays 3abentonite 3abioactive properties 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3acontainers 3acorn 3ahydrochloric acid 3apotassium 3apotassium chloride 3aradionuclides 3aseedlings 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3aviscosity 3aWyoming1 aLow, P.

Therefore, the use of bacteria as therapeutics has attracted much interest. Recent research has found that there are a variety of mechanisms by which bacteria can signal to the brain and influence several processes in relation to neurotransmission, neurogenesis, and behaviour. Data derived from both in vitro experiments and in vivo clinical trials have supported some of these new health implications. While recent molecular advancement has provided strong indications to support and justify the role of the gut microbiota on the gut–brain axis, it is still not clear whether manipulations through probiotics and prebiotics administration could be beneficial in the treatment of neurological problems. The understanding of the gut microbiota and its activities is essential for the generation of future personalized healthcare strategies. Here, we explore and summarize the potential beneficial effects of probiotics and prebiotics in the neurodevelopmental process and in the prevention and treatment of certain neurological human diseases, highlighting current and future perspectives in this topic.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacteria 3abrain 3aclinical trials 3acognition 3ahealth services 3ahuman diseases 3ain vitro studies 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aneurogenesis 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3atherapeutics1 aRuiz, Alicia,1 aSuárez, Antonio,1 aCampoy, Cristina0 tNutrients.g2017 Nov. 14, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu91112473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245008000167300001600247520101800263592002801281650001501309650002201324650000901346650001001355650001401365650002301379650001601402650001601418650001201434650002601446650001301472650002001485650001101505650001601516651001201532653001301544653001201557653001101569653002301580700001601603700001601619700001801635773012401653856008501777852000901862655001201871IND60573616220221119165932.0170724e20170304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057361622DNAL7 a10.1080/10236244.2017.13436312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanetta, D.10aSmall-scale rearing of cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) for research purposes  ap. 115-124.  aWe report a methodology refined over 20 years to culture and maintain a small colony of Sepia officinalis for research year-round. Wild-caught eggs were obtained annually from England and reared in semi-closed natural seawater systems of large volume. Constant temperature (15 °C) and day length (12L/12D) delayed sexual maturation and reproductive behavior. This extended life cycle by roughly 50%, thus providing small research animals for about 18 months from every annual batch of eggs. A novel live food – gammarid crustaceans collected from washed up seagrass– was provided to hatchlings and juveniles. Juveniles were then trained to take thawed shrimp thereafter, thus reducing the expense of live foods. Typical survival to one year was >65%. With these methods, healthy sexually immature cuttlefish were available year-round for behavioral and physiological studies without the confounding influences of hormonally-induced fighting, mating, and egg laying that typically occur within six months.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGammaridae 3aSepia officinalis 3aeggs 3afoods 3ajuveniles 3alaboratory animals 3aoviposition 3aphotoperiod 3arearing 3areproductive behavior 3aseawater 3asexual maturity 3ashrimp 3atemperature 3aEngland 0aBehavior 0afeeding 0agrowth 0alaboratory culture1 aSolomon, M.1 aBuresch, K.1 aHanlon, R.

Bacteria possessing multiple copies of rrs lead to overestimation of its diversity. Staphylococcus genomes carries 5–6 copies of rrs showing high similarity in their nucleotide sequences, which lead to ambiguous results. The genomes of 31 strains of Staphylococcus representing 7 species were searched for the presence of common genes. In silico digestion of 34 common genes using 10 restriction endonucleases (REs) lead to select gene-RE combinations, which could be used as biomarkers. RE digestion of recA allowed unambiguous identification of 13 genomes representing all the 7 species. In addition, a few more genes (argH, argR, cysS, gyrB, purH, and pyrE) and RE combinations permitted further identification of 12 strains. By employing additional RE and genes unique to a particular strain, it was possible to identify the rest 6 Staphylococcus aureus strains. This approach has the potential to be utilized for rapid detection of Staphylococcus strains.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abacteria 3abiomarkers 3adigestion 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3arapid methods 3arestriction endonucleases 3aribosomal RNA1 aKoul, Shikha1 aKumar, Prasun1 aKalia, Vipin Chandra0 tIndian journal of microbiology.g2016 Mar., v. 56, no. 1 p.64-71dSpringer Indiax0046-89917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12088-016-0565-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03577naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147242052100161245012200682300001800804520165700822592002802479650002202507650001502529650001402544650001602558650002702574650001102601650001502612650002202627650001602649650001102665650001202676650001602688650001802704650002302722650002102745650001502766651001002781700001902791700002202810700002302832700001802855700001202873773010802885856008102993852000903074655001203083IND60574565020221120220701.0170728e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057456502DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-017-1541-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zhi10aInteractions entre les eaux souterraines et les eaux de surface et impacts des activités anthropiques dans le bassin versant d’Hailiutu, Nord-Ouest de la Chine Interacciones e impactos de las actividades humanas en el agua subterránea y superficial en la cuenca Hailiutu, noroeste de China 中国西北地区Hailiutu流域地下水和地表水相互作用及人类活动影响 Interações entre águas subterrâneas e águas superficiais e impactos das atividades humanas na bacia de Hailiutu, noroeste da China10aGroundwater and surface-water interactions and impacts of human activities in the Hailiutu catchment, northwest China  ap. 1341-1355.  aThe interactions between groundwater and surface water have been significantly affected by human activities in the semi-arid Hailiutu catchment, northwest China. Several methods were used to investigate the spatial and temporal interactions between groundwater and surface water. Isotopic and chemical analyses of water samples determined that groundwater discharges to the Hailiutu River, and mass balance equations were employed to estimate groundwater seepage rates along the river using chemical profiles. The hydrograph separation method was used to estimate temporal variations of groundwater discharges to the river. A numerical groundwater model was constructed to simulate groundwater discharges along the river and to analyze effects of water use in the catchment. The simulated seepage rates along the river compare reasonably well with the seepage estimates derived from a chemical profile in 2012. The impacts of human activities (river-water diversion and groundwater abstraction) on the river discharge were analyzed by calculating the differences between the simulated natural groundwater discharge and the measured river discharge. Water use associated with the Hailiutu River increased from 1986 to 1991, reached its highest level from 1992 to 2000, and decreased from 2001 onwards. The reduction of river discharge might have negative impacts on the riparian ecosystem and the water availability for downstream users. The interactions between groundwater and surface water as well as the consequences of human activities should be taken into account when implementing sustainable water resources management in the Hailiutu catchment.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical analysis 3aecosystems 3aequations 3agroundwater 3agroundwater extraction 3ahumans 3ahydrograph 3ahydrologic models 3ariver water 3arivers 3aseepage 3astream flow 3asurface water 3atemporal variation 3awater management 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aZhou, Yangxiao1 aWenninger, Jochen1 aUhlenbrook, Stefan1 aWang, Xusheng1 aWan, Li0 tHydrogeology journal.g2017 Aug., v. 25, no. 5 p.1341-1355dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1431-21747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-017-1541-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02069naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245008700169300001600256520112700272592002801399653003201427653002801459653002201487700002601509773017601535856008301711852000901794655001201803IND60527274520221121044025.0160713e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052727452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrras.2015.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaved, Muhammad10aNutritional optimization for anaerobic growth of Bacillus steaothermophilus LLD-16  ap. 170-179.  aIn this study, a range of nutritional supplements including twenty amino acids, major vitamins and four nucleic acid bases were exploited as added-value supplements for the growth of a lactate-minus (ldh) mutant Bacillus stearothermophilus LLD-16 under anaerobic environment. The chemostat studies revealed that five amino acids that includes aspartate, glutamate, isoleucine, methionine, and serine were essential for persuaded growth of B. stearothermophilus LLD-16. The anaerobic batch studies showed that a number of nutritional supplements, such as, p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), folic acid, pantothenic acid, adenine, glycine, leucine, tryptophan, proline, alanine and α-ketoglutarate, when added individually, improved the biomass levels. In contrast, the higher concentrations of cyanocobalamine or biotin, guanine, uracil and isoleucine were found inhibitory. Furthermore, the study explains why the highest biomass formation cannot necessarily be achieved on the richest mixture of amino acids, and the inadequacy of the biosynthetic machinery is very much dependent on the growth conditions of the microorganism.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBacillus stearothermophilus 0aNutritional supplements 0aChemostat culture1 aBaghaei-Yazdi, Namdar0 tJournal of Radiation Research and Applied Sciences.g2016 Apr., v. 9 p.170-179dElsevier B.V.aThe Egyptian Society of Radiation Sciences and Applicationsx1687-85077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrras.2015.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245022100175300001600396500001900412520161500431592002802046650001502074650001902089650001502108650001002123650001302133650001702146650002402163653002702187653001902214653002602233653001502259653003402274700002102308700003302329700001802362773011402380856008302494852000902577655001202586IND60699639420221118012659.0200907e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069963942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Sanz, Virginia10aEffect of recumbency and body condition score on open-lung positive end-expiratory pressure and respiratory system compliance following a stepwise lung recruitment manoeuvre in healthy dogs during general anaesthesia  ap. 177-185.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim was to assess the effects of recumbency and body condition score (BCS) on open-lung positive end-expiratory pressure (OL-PEEP) and quasistatic respiratory system compliance (Crs) following stepwise lung recruitment manoeuvre (RM) in healthy dogs under general anaesthesia. Thirty-four dogs were anaesthetised and mechanically ventilated (tidal volume of 10 mL/kg) without PEEP for 1 min (baseline). A stepwise RM was then performed and the individual OL-PEEP was subsequently applied. The Crs was registered at baseline and every 10-min for 50 min after RM. Dogs were classified into either dorsal or lateral recumbency groups, and as normal (score 4–5/9) or high (≥6/9) BCS groups.The OL-PEEP was higher in lateral than in dorsal recumbency (P = .002), but differences were not observed between normal and high BCS (P = .865). The Crs was increased from baseline at all time points after RM in all groups. The Crs did not differ between dorsally and laterally recumbent dogs at any time point. However, the baseline Crs was significantly lower in dogs with a high BCS than in those with a normal BCS (P < .001); therefore, the absolute change from baseline was considered when comparing Crs after the RM and it was similar in both BCS groups. In conclusion, in anaesthetised healthy dogs the OL-PEEP following RM was lower when dogs were positioned in dorsal than in lateral recumbency. The Crs after RM remained unchanged regardless of the dogs' recumbency. A stepwise RM followed by OL-PEEP could compensate for the potential negative impact of moderately increased BCS on Crs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanesthesia 3abody condition 3acompliance 3alungs 3aresearch 3atidal volume 3aveterinary medicine 0aMechanical ventilation 0aOpen-lung PEEP 0aRecruitment manoeuvre 0aRecumbency 0aRespiratory system compliance1 aCanfrán, Susana1 aGómez de Segura, Ignacio A.1 aAguado, Delia0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2020 Oct., v. 132 p.177-185dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04074naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002800113040001800141100001800159245012000177300001600297520195300313592002802266650002402294650003902318650002402357650002302381650002602404650001002430650001302440650001702453650000902470650001502479650002002494650001302514650001202527650001902539650002102558650000902579650002002588650001202608650001202620650002102632650001202653650001302665650002902678650001302707650006302720650002102783650002502804650003002829650003402859650001502893650002902908650003502937650003602972650002303008651001203031651001003043651002703053651002503080700002003105700001803125700001703143700001803160773011203178856004103290852000903331655001203340IND50088777620221119055945.0140415e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008877762DNAL7 a230953492pmid7 a10.1111/tbed.120272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPearce, F.

The likelihood was estimated for one import from an infected farm. Four main routes by which susceptible populations could be exposed to VHSV via processing waste were considered: (i) run‐off from solid waste to watercourses, (ii) contamination of birds or rodents with VHSV by scavenging solid waste, (iii) discharge of liquid waste to mains drainage, and (iv) discharge of liquid waste directly to watercourses. Data on the biophysical characteristics of VHSV, its epidemiology, fish processing practices and waste management were collected. Likelihoods for each step of the four pathways were estimated. Pathway 4 (discharge of liquid waste to a watercourse) was judged as the most likely to result in infection of susceptible individuals. Levels of virus entering the aquatic environment via pathways 1–3 were judged to be many times lower than pathway 4 due mainly to the treatment of solid waste (pathways 1 and 2) and high levels of dilution (pathways 1, 2 and 3). Thirty‐four trout farms process fish, of which seven have imported carcasses for processing. Compared with other processing facilities, on‐farm processing results in a higher likelihood of VHSV exposure and establishment via all four pathways. Data availability was an issue; the analysis was particularly constrained by a lack of data on the prevalence of VHSV in Europe, volume of trade of carcasses into the UK and processing practices in E&W. It was concluded that the threat of VHSV introduction into E&W could be reduced by treatment of liquid effluent from processing plants and by sourcing carcasses for on‐farm processing only from approved VHSV free areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aViral hemorrhagic septicemia virus 3aaquatic environment 3aat-risk population 3abiological resistance 3abirds 3adrainage 3aepidemiology 3afish 3afish farms 3afish processing 3agenotype 3aimports 3ameat carcasses 3aprocessing waste 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arodents 3aviruses 3awaste management 2aAnimals 2aCommerce 2aFood-Processing Industry 2aGenotype 2aHemorrhagic Septicemia, Viralxepidemiologyxtransmission. 2aInternationality 2aLikelihood Functions 2aNovirhabdovirusxgenetics 2aOncorhynchus mykissxvirology 2aPrevalence 2aRisk Assessmentxmethods 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWaste Productsxadverse effects 2aWater Microbiology 3aEngland 3aWales 0aEnglandxepidemiology. 0aWalesxepidemiology.1 aOidtmann, B.

We assessed the feral pigeon (Columba livia) as a lead bioindicator in New York City. We collected blood lead level records from 825 visibly ill or abnormally behaving pigeons from various NYC neighborhoods between 2010 and 2015. We found that blood lead levels were significantly higher during the summer, an effect reported in children. Pigeon blood lead levels were not significantly different between years or among neighborhoods. However, blood lead levels per neighborhood in Manhattan were positively correlated with mean rates of lead in children identified by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene as having elevated blood lead levels (>10 μg/dl). We provide support for the use of the feral pigeon as a bioindicator of environmental lead contamination for the first time in the U.S. and for the first time anywhere in association with rates of elevated blood lead levels in children. This information has the potential to enable measures to assess, strategize, and potentially circumvent the negative impacts of lead and other environmental contaminants on human and wildlife communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColumba livia 3ablood 3achildren 3acorrelation 3aferal animals 3ahumans 3alead 3apandemic 3apigeons 3apollution 3asummer 3atoxicity 3awildlife 3aNew York 0aLead 0aPb 0aLead toxicity 0aPigeon 0aColumba livia 0aBioindicator 0aNew York City1 aCalisi, Rebecca M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3107-84710 tChemosphere.g2016 Oct., v. 161 p.274-279dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245014200167300001600309500001900325520150300344592002801847650002801875650002401903650001801927650001301945650002801958650002501986650001102011650001302022650001802035650002502053650001002078650001602088650002402104653002002128653001502148653001502163653001702178700001902195700002602214700002502240700002302265700002402288700002102312700001702333773011402350856008302464852000902547655001202556IND60699639520221118012806.0200907e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069963952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.06.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouci, Laurent10aIntranasal inoculations of naked or PLGA-PEI nanovectored DNA vaccine induce systemic and mucosal antibodies in pigs: A feasibility study  ap. 194-201.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMucosa are the routes of entry of most pathogens into animals' organisms. Reducing the important global burden of mucosal infectious diseases in livestock animals is required in the field of veterinary public health. For veterinary respiratory pathogens, one possible strategy is the development of intranasal (IN) DNA vaccination. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of IN DNA vaccination in pigs, an important species in livestock production industry, and a source of zoonotic diseases. To achieve this goal, we used a DNA vaccine against pseudorabies virus (PrV) encoding the immunogenic glycoprotein B (pcDNA3-gB plasmid). When pigs were inoculated with the naked DNA vaccine through the IN route, PrV-specific IgG and IgA type antibodies were detected in porcine sera. Interestingly, mucosal salivary IgA antibodies against PrV were also detected, at similar levels to those measured following intramuscular injection (positive controls). Furthermore, the IN delivery of pcDNA3-gB combined with PLGA-PEI nanoparticles resulted in similar levels of antibodies but was associated with an increase in the duration of detection of mucosal IgA for 2 out of 3 pigs. Our results suggest that there is room to improve the efficacy of IN DNA vaccination in pigs through optimization of IN inoculations, for example by using nanoparticles such as PLGA-PEI. Further studies will be dedicated to optimizing and testing the protective potential of IN DNA vaccination procedures against PrV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSuid alphaherpesvirus 1 3afeasibility studies 3aglycoproteins 3aindustry 3aintramuscular injection 3alivestock production 3amucosa 3aplasmids 3apublic health 3arecombinant vaccines 3aswine 3avaccination 3aveterinary medicine 0aDNA vaccination 0aIntranasal 0aAntibodies 0aSalivary IgA1 aJaunet, Hervé1 aLe Diguerher, Gérald1 aGuionnet, Jean-Marie1 aBéven, Véronique1 aPaboeuf, Frédéric1 aMontier, Tristan1 aDory, Daniel0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2020 Oct., v. 132 p.194-201dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.06.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011500169300002000284520127300304592002801577650001401605650001101619650000901630650001301639650001001652650002601662650002001688650000901708650001401717650001801731650001101749650001301760650001401773650000901787650001701796650001401813650001201827650001201839650001701851700002501868700002401893700002801917700003101945700002601976700002302002773015602025856008202181852000902263655001202272IND60549320220221119133133.0211023e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054932022DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6938-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarap, Nataša B.10aDistribution of natural and artificial radionuclides in chernozem soil/crop system from stationary experiments  ap. 17761-17773.  aThe present paper focuses on the determination of radiological characteristics of cultivated chernozem soil and crops from long-term field experiments, taking into account the importance of distribution and transfer of radionuclides in the soil-plant system, especially in agricultural cropland. The investigation was performed on the experimental fields where maize, winter wheat, and rapeseed were cultivated. Analysis of radioactivity included determination of the gross alpha and beta activity as a screening method, as well as the activities of the following radionuclides: natural (²¹⁰Pb, ²³⁵U, ²³⁸U, ²²⁶Ra, ²³²Th, ⁴⁰K, ⁷Be) and artificial (⁹⁰Sr and ¹³⁷Cs). The activities of natural and artificial (¹³⁷Cs) radionuclides were determined by gamma spectrometry, while the artificial radionuclide ⁹⁰Sr was determined by a radiochemical analytical method. Based on the obtained results for the specific activity of ⁴⁰K, ¹³⁷Cs, and ⁹⁰Sr, accumulation factors for these radionuclides were calculated in order to estimate transfer of radionuclides from soil to crops. The results of performed analyses showed that there is no increase of radioactivity that could endanger the food production through the grown crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aberyllium 3acesium 3acorn 3acropland 3acrops 3afield experimentation 3afood production 3alead 3apotassium 3aradionuclides 3aradium 3arapeseed 3ascreening 3asoil 3aspectroscopy 3astrontium 3athorium 3auranium 3awinter wheat1 aRajačić, Milica M.1 aĐalović, Ivica G.1 aŠeremešić, Srđan I.1 aĐorđević, Aleksandar R.1 aJanković, Marija M.,1 aDaković, Marko Z.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2016 Sept., v. 23, no. 17 p.17761-17773dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6938-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03600naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245010300170520217700273592002802450650002202478650002502500650001002525650001702535650002502552650001802577650001202595650001302607650002002620650002002640650002002660650003602680650001502716650002002731650000902751650002102760650001802781650002502799650001302824650001002837650001002847700002402857700002802881773012102909856007903030852000903109655001203118IND60792723120221120154410.0220908e20220830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079272312DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111722612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbrahim, Rashid I. H.10aAlleviation of Herbicide Toxicity in Solanum lycopersicum L.—An Antioxidant Stimulation Approach  aApplication of the herbicide glyphosate in crops is a common practice among farmers around the world. Tomato is one of the crops that are treated with glyphosate to fight weed growth and loss of crop. However, tomato plants often show phytotoxic effects from glyphosate. In this study, the ability of pongamia oil derived from Pongamia pinnata (known also as Millettia pinnata) tree to alleviate the herbicide glyphosate toxicity effects in tomato (S.lycopersicum L. cv. Micro-tom) plants was tested. Tomato plants were treated with a mixture of a dose of (GLY) glyphosate (10 mg kg⁻¹) and different doses of pongamia oil (PO) foliar spray (5, 10, 50, and 100 mM) and compared with the herbicide or oil control (glyphosate 10 mg kg⁻¹ or pongamia oil PO 50 mM). Some morphological features, non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants, and gene expression were observed. Glyphosate-treated plants sprayed with PO 50 mM (GLY + PO 50) showed increased root biomass (0.28 g-p ≤ 0.001), shoot biomass (1.2 g-p ≤ 0.01), H₂O₂ (68 nmol/g), and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD; 40 mg-p ≤ 0.001), catalase (CAT; 81.21 mg-p ≤ 0.05), ascorbate peroxidase (APX; 80 mg-p ≤ 0.01) and glutathione reductase (GR; 53 min/mg-F₄,₂₀ = 15.88, p ≤ 0.05). In contrast, these plants showed reduced contents of Malondialdehyde (MDA; 30 nmol/g-F₄,₂₀ = 18.55, p ≤ 0.01), O₂ (0.6 Abs/g), Prolne (Pro; 345 µg/g), Glutathine (GSH; 341 nmol/mg-p ≤ 0.001), ascorbate (AsA; 1.8 µmol/gm), ascorbic acid (AA; 1.62 mg-p ≤ 0.05) and dehydroascorbate (DHAR; 0.32 mg p ≤ 0.05). The gene expression analysis was conducted for seven oxidative stress related genes besides the house-keeping gene Actin as a reference. The gene CYP1A1450 showed the highest mRNA expression level (6.8 fold ± 0.4) in GLY-treated tomato plants, whereas GLY-treated plants + PO 50 showed 2.9 fold. The study concluded that foliar spray of 50 mM pongamia oil alleviated the toxic effects of glyphosate on tomato plants in the form of increased root and shoot biomass, SOD, CAT, APX, and GR activity, while reduced MDA, O₂, Pro, GSH, AsA, AA, DHAR, and gene CYP1A1450 expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMillettia pinnata 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aactin 3aantioxidants 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aascorbic acid 3abiomass 3acatalase 3aessential genes 3afoliar spraying 3agene expression 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3aglyphosate 3amalondialdehyde 3aoils 3aoxidative stress 3aphytotoxicity 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atomatoes 3atrees 3aweeds1 aAlkhudairi, Ubai A.1 aAlhusayni, Sultan A.

Such computationally light analysis is often discounted in favor of more complex models. However, this study demonstrates the merits of summarizing high-resolution temperature data, obtained from a fiber optic cable installation at several depths within a water delivery channel, into daily amplitudes and mean temperatures. These results are compared to fluid flux estimates from a one-dimensional (1D) advection-conduction model and to the results of a previous study that used a full three-dimensional (3D) model. At a depth of 0.1 m below the channel, plots of amplitude suggested areas of advective water movement (as confirmed by the 1D and 3D models). Due to lack of diurnal signal at depths below 0.1 m, mean temperature was better able to identify probable areas of water movement at depths of 0.25–0.5 m below the channel.

Results showed that Al(III) reduced Pb(II) sorption on KB550 primarily via pH buffering against biochar alkalinity, thus inhibiting lead carbonate formation. In contrast, the reduction on SB550 mainly resulted from direct competition for sorption sites, especially on Fe-rich phengite 2M1 and metakaolinite. Because of Pb-P precipitation and Pb-K interlayer exchange, the residual Pb(II) adsorption capacity resistant to coexisting Al(III) was 3–5 times higher on SB550 than on KB550. The Pb-K interlayer exchange was enhanced by lower pH and coexisting Al(III), while Pb-P precipitation was the dominant Pb(II) sorption mechanism on SB550 resistant to Al(III) buffering and competition at higher pH. Application of these two biochars as amendments confirmed that the mineral-rich SB550 was more suitable for Pb(II) immobilization in acidic soils with high levels of extractable Al(III).  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid soils 3aadsorption 3aalkalinity 3aaluminum 3aaqueous solutions 3abiochar 3acarbon 3acerussite 3aheavy metals 3aions 3akenaf 3alead 3apH 3asewage sludge 0aBiochar 0aAluminum ion 0aLead ion 0aCompetitive sorption 0aSoil remediation1 aZhang, Weihua1 aQiu, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4743-97021 aTsang, Daniel C.W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6850-733X1 aMorel, J.

We assessed the effects of the presence of opposite-sex conspecifics on adult crab spacing at a low density to infer potential mate acquisition behaviors. Adult crabs held in all-male, all-female, and mixed-sex treatments were observed twice daily over five days to determine nearest-neighbor (NN) distances and relative activity. Males in the mixed-sex treatment with the shortest NN distances (NN ₁) were most commonly (1) closest to females, and, when compared to NN ₁ males in the all-male treatment, were (2) closer to their NN and (3) had lower activity levels. Female movement did not differ between treatments. Percent ovigerous females at the end of trials were higher in the mixed-sex treatment, reflecting mating activity, which when observed, involved inter-molt females. Mate guarding, rather than pure-searching behavior, was the mating behavior most consistent with observed spacing and movement patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acrabs 3afemales 3ainvasive species 3amales 3amate guarding 3amating behavior 3aoysters 3areefs 0aNearest-neighbor 0aPorcellanidae 0abehavior 0aCrustacea1 aHughes, Melissa1 aAntonio Baeza, J.1 aFowler, Amy1 aWilber, Dara0 tMarine and freshwater behaviour and physiology.g2017 Mar. 4, v. 50, no. 2 p.165-177dTaylor & Francisx1029-03627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10236244.2017.13470203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03814naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245020000164500002200364520211900386592002802505650001502533650001302548650001502561650001402576650002202590650001102612650002002623650002002643650001402663650003202677650002202709650001702731650001402748650001402762650002602776650001302802650001502815650002602830650001502856653003202871653001602903653002302919653004702942700001302989700001503002700001303017700001803030700001503048700001303063773007703076856008603153852000903239655001203248IND60666046820221122055529.0190913e20190910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066604682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2019.1203462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Fang10aMultiplexed chemiluminescence determination of three acute myocardial infarction biomarkers based on microfluidic paper-based immunodevice dual amplified by multifunctionalized gold nanoparticles  aPre-press version  aAcute myocardial infarction (AMI) causes significant mortality and morbidity. The determination of multiple AMI biomarkers is very important for the timely diagnosis of AMI. In this work, simultaneous determination of three AMI biomarkers were achieved by virtue of a three-dimensional (3D) microfluidic paper-analytical device (μPAD) with temporally resolved chemiluminescence (CL) emissions for the first time. A dual-signal amplification strategy was introduced including by employing primary antibody functionalized gold nanoparticles (Ab1-GNPs) immobilized on the detection zone as amplified capture probes, and Co(II) catalyst, secondary antibody, luminol multifunctionalized gold nanoparticles (Co(II)-Ab2-luminol-GNPs) with excellent CL activity as amplified signal probes. CL immunoreactions were performed at three detection zone of the fabricated 3D μPAD by assembling Ab1-GNPs, antigen, and Co(II)-Ab2-luminol-GNPs to form sandwich-type immunocomplexes. Auto separated CL signals with temporal resolution were obtained by time delayed transport of H2O2 to different detection zones for multiplexed analysis. The CL signal obtained by using Co(II)-Ab2-luminol-GNPs as signal probe (10576 a.u.) were about 20-fold higher than that by using conventional horseradish peroxidase labeled antibody modified luminol-GNPs as signal probe (531 a.u.). Finally, three AMI biomarkers including heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP), cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and copeptin were quantitatively analyzed in one CL detection run by reading the CL intensity of the obtained three CL emission peaks. The detection range were ultra-wide ranged from 0.1 pg/mL to 1 μg/mL, 0.5 pg/mL to 1 μg/mL and 1 pg/mL to 1 mg/mL with the detection limits down to 0.06 pg/mL, 0.3 pg/mL and 0.4 pg/mL for H-FABP, cTnI and copeptin detection, respectively. The developed μPAD based immunoassay performing multiplexed analysis ability, high sensitivity, ultra-wide dynamic range, favorable selectivity, accessible accuracy and reproducibility, have great application potential for the early diagnosis of AMI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abiomarkers 3acatalysts 3achemiluminescence 3acobalt 3adetection limit 3aearly diagnosis 3aemissions 3afatty acid-binding proteins 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimmunoassays 3amorbidity 3amortality 3amyocardial infarction 3ananogold 3aperoxidase 3aquantitative analysis 3atroponin I 0aAcute myocardial infarction 0aImmunoassay 0aGold nanoparticles 0aMicrofluidic paper-based analytical device1 aGuo, Lei1 aHu, Yuting1 aLi, Zimu1 aLiu, Jiachang1 aHe, Jianbo1 aCui, Hua0 tTalanta.g2019 Sept. 10, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.1203463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03449naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245010800170300001600278520180400294592002802098650001602126650001002142650001602152650001702168650001602185650001602201650001502217650002502232650001702257650000902274650001502283650001602298650001002314650002502324650001502349650000902364650002102373650002302394650001802417651001002435653001602445653002402461653002002485653001002505653001302515700001602528700001502544700001602559700001202575700001902587700001702606700001802623700001902641773007702660856008902737852000902826655001202835IND60524902920221120125427.0160724e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052490292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Chao10aOccurrence of antibiotics and their impacts to primary productivity in fishponds around Tai Lake, China  ap. 127-135.  aAntibiotics are widely used to improve the health and yields of farmed animals, including fish, but their use is accompanied by undesirable ecological effects. Relatively little is known about the water-body burden of antibiotics and their influence on primary productivity in aquaculture ecosystem. In this study, antibiotics usage within 24 fishponds, covering 4 areas, sampled 5 times, and having 5 fish species, was investigated surrounding Tai Lake in China. The study analyzed 15 antibiotics (including 5 sulfonamides, 2 quinolones, 3 β-lactams, 3 tetracyclines, 1 amphenicol, and 1 macrolide), and all of them were detected in water samples, with a detection frequency of 2–60%. Sulfonamides were the most prevalent, and concentrations of sulfamethoxazole, sulfamonomethoxine, and florfenicol being over 2000 ng L−1 in some samples, while the other antibiotics levels ranged from ND (no detection) to 551.18 ng L−1. Significant differences were observed in antibiotic burden among different regions for total antibiotics, sulfonamides, quinolones, and amphenicols; among time points for quinolones, β-lactams, and tetracyclines; and among species for quinolones and macrolides. Furthermore, basing on the risk quotient (RQ) method, the assessment revealed that florfenicol was of highest risk to algae with RQ values exceeding 0.1, while macrolide erythromycin posed the second highest risk. The partial correlation coefficient between total antibiotics and chlorophyll (a) was −0.035 that clearly indicated total antibiotics were detrimental to green algae growth, while the nutrient input and other physical – chemical factors were much more beneficial. Overall, holistic far-reaching measures of antibiotics control are recommended to preserve aquaculture ecosystem health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorophyta 3aalgae 3aaquaculture 3abeta-lactams 3achlorophyll 3acorrelation 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental health 3aerythromycin 3afish 3afish ponds 3aflorfenicol 3alakes 3aprimary productivity 3aquinolones 3arisk 3asulfamethoxazole 3asulfamonomethoxine 3atetracyclines 3aChina 0aAntibiotics 0aDetection frequency 0aRisk assessment 0aAlgae 0aFishpond1 aZhang, Cong1 aFan, Limin1 aQiu, Liping1 aWu, Wei1 aMeng, Shunlong1 aHu, Gengdong1 aKamira, Barry1 aChen, Jiazhang0 tChemosphere.g2016 Oct., v. 161 p.127-135dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245016100157500001900318520122200337592002801559650001701587650001701604650001501621650001001636650002501646650002501671650001401696650002501710651001001735653003101745653003501776653001801811700001901829700001501848700001401863700001801877700001401895700001801909700002001927700001601947773011301963856007602076852000902152655001202161IND60735590720221117225155.0210427e20210419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073559072DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.9.e623952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Peng10aComplete mitochondrial DNA sequence of the Psammocora profundacella (Scleractinia, Psammocoridae): mitogenome characterisation and phylogenetic implications  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aComplete mitochondrial DNA sequence data have played a significant role in phylogenetic and evolutionary studies of scleractinian corals. In this study, the complete mitogenome of Psammocora profundacella Gardiner, 1898, collected from Guangdong Province, China, was sequenced by next-generation sequencing for the first time. Psammocora profundacella is the first species for which a mitogenome has been sequenced in the family Psammocoridae. The length of its assembled mitogenome sequence was 16,274 bp, including 13 protein-coding genes, two tRNAs and two rRNAs. Its gene content and gene order were consistent with the other Scleractinia species. All genes were encoded on the H strand and the GC content of the mitochondrial genome was 30.49%. Gene content and order were consistent with the other Scleractinia species. Based on 13 protein-coding genes, Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analysis showed that P. profundacella belongs to the “Robust” clade. Mitochondrial genome data provide important molecular information for understanding the phylogeny of stony corals. More variable markers and additional species should be sequenced to confirm the evolutionary relationships of Scleractinia in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScleractinia 3abiodiversity 3agene order 3agenes 3amitochondrial genome 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3astatistical analysis 3aChina 0aevolutionary relationships 0anext-generation sequence (NGS) 0aphylogenetics1 aXiao, Jiaguang1 aJia, Zhiyu1 aGuo, Feng1 aWang, Xiaolei1 aWang, Wei1 aWang, Jianjia1 aHuang, Dingyong1 aNiu, Wentao0 tBiodiversity data journal.g2021 Apr. 19, v. 9 p.e62395-dPensoft PublisherswJournal:21364x1314-28287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.9.e623953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012400162300002000286520135600306592002801662596004801690596008701738596011501825650002701940650001201967650001301979650001801992650001102010650000902021650001702030650001702047650000902064650001802073650001402091650000902105650002002114650001402134650001102148650001902159650000902178650001602187651001002203700001702213700001602230700001602246700001702262700001402279700001802293773015602311856008202467852000902549655001202558IND60549320720221119133045.0211023e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054932072DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6948-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yan10aHeavy metals in aquatic organisms of different trophic levels and their potential human health risk in Bohai Bay, China  ap. 17801-17810.  aFourteen aquatic organism samples were collected from Bohai Bay, and concentrations of five heavy metals were measured to evaluate the pollution levels in aquatic organisms and the potential risk to human health. The concentrations of Zn and Cu were much higher than those of Cd, Cr, and Pb in all the organisms. In general, the heavy metal concentration levels were in the order phytoplankton < zooplankton < fish < shrimp < shellfish. Heavy metal concentrations in higher trophic-level aquatic organisms in Bohai Bay were compared to those in the organisms from other worldwide coastal waters. The concentration levels of most heavy metals were higher than the 75th percentile, except that Pb concentration was between the 25th and 50th percentiles. The calculated bioconcentration factors (BCF) of Cr, Cu, and Pb for phytoplankton were less than 100, indicating no accumulation in primary producers. The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) of Pb for zooplankton was the highest, indicating significant Pb accumulation in zooplankton. For higher trophic-level aquatic organisms, the order of BAF values was fish < shrimp < shellfish for most metals except for Pb. The human health risk assessment suggests that strict abatement measures of heavy metals must be taken to decrease the health risk caused by consuming aquatic products.  aPublisher supplied data  a41273068cThe National Natural Science Fund  a11JCZDJC24100cTianjin Research Program of Applied Science and Advanced Technology  aContract No. DCI-ASIE/2013/323-550, EuropeAid/133-582/L/ACT/CNcEU-funded Environmental Sustainability Program 3abioaccumulation factor 3acadmium 3achromium 3acoastal water 3acopper 3afish 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3alead 3aphytoplankton 3apollution 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3ashellfish 3ashrimp 3atrophic levels 3azinc 3azooplankton 3aChina1 aLu, Xueqiang1 aWang, Naili1 aXin, Meinan1 aGeng, Shiwei1 aJia, Jing1 aMeng, Qinghui0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2016 Sept., v. 23, no. 17 p.17801-17810dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6948-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01807naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245007300185300001600258520060000274592002800874650002000902650001500922650005800937650000900995650004101004650003801045650002501083650002001108650003001128650002401158700002001182700001601202773012501218856008101343852000901424655001201433IND50071862320221123022632.0151123e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007186232DNAL7 a242406342pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-013-1151-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Satyen,10aDetermination and Method Validation of Metamitron in Soil by RP-HPLC  ap. 165-168.  aA simple, rapid and economical method was developed and validated for the determination of metamitron using UV detector with RP-HPLC.

Located in the epiblast of a stage X (EG&K) embryo, the PGCs translocate anteriorly to the germinal crescent and migrate, within 48 to 56 hours of development, through the blood vascular system to the germinal ridges where they become the gonadal germ cells (GGCs). We aim to generate, compare, and determine the basic characters of the in vitro long-term cultured PGCs derived from (1) the chicken blastodermal cells (at stages IX–XII); (2) the chicken blood of a 2-day old embryo (stages 14–17 Hamburger Hamilton [HH]); and (3) the long-term cultured gonocytes taken from male gonads of a 5- to 6-day-old embryo (stages 29–30 HH). In presence of fibroblast growth factor, chicken blastodermal cells are able to long-term proliferate and generate small, round, alkaline phosphatase–positive cell clusters. Molecular characterization shows that these selected and amplified clusters show a PGC-like cell profile, as they express cPOUV (a pluripotent-associated marker), NR6A1/GCNF and DDX4/CVH (germ cell–specific genes). Both chicken PGCs and GGCs, obtained from embryonic blood and gonads, at 14 to 17 HH and 29 to 30 HH, respectively, generate long-term germ cell cultures and positively react in vitro to periodic acid–Schiff. Immunochemical analyses reveal that these cell lines are specifically recognized by anti-SSEA-1, anti-EMA-1, anti-CVH, anti-β1-integrin, and anti-CEACAM antibodies. The presence of surrounding cells may suggest a stronger dependency toward the niche process for the GGCs. The reactivity of chicken embryonic germ cells obtained from the two different sources to the specific markers used in this study was not altered through the culture. In conclusion, the morphologic analysis specific for chicken PGCs and GGCs will further contribute to quick and reliable characterization of long-term cultured in vitro chicken germ cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3ablood 3acell culture 3achickens 3afibroblast growth factors 3agenes 3agerm cells 3agonads 3aimmunochemistry 3amales 0aPrimordial germ cell 0aGonadal germ cell 0aChicken blastodermal cell 0aChicken embryo 0aPolyclonal and monoclonal anti-CVH antibodies1 aFuet, Aurelie1 aPain, Bertrand1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1210-84440 tTheriogenology.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 84, no. 5 p.732-742.e2dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.04.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245007400163300002000237520077700257592002801034650001601062650001801078650002101096650002501117650001001142650001201152650001101164650001401175650001401189650001001203700002801213700001701241700002101258700005901279773014801338856007601486852000901562655001201571IND60699964820221122055305.0200624e20200529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069996482DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c046742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevy, Jeffrey N.10aSelective Halogenation of Pyridines Using Designed Phosphine Reagents  ap. 11295-11305.  aHalopyridines are key building blocks for synthesizing pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and ligands for metal complexes, but strategies to selectively halogenate pyridine C–H precursors are lacking. We designed a set of heterocyclic phosphines that are installed at the 4-position of pyridines as phosphonium salts and then displaced with halide nucleophiles. A broad range of unactivated pyridines can be halogenated, and the method is viable for late-stage halogenation of complex pharmaceuticals. Computational studies indicate that C–halogen bond formation occurs via an SNAr pathway, and phosphine elimination is the rate-determining step. Steric interactions during C–P bond cleavage account for differences in reactivity between 2- and 3-substituted pyridines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aagrochemicals 3achemical bonding 3acleavage (chemistry) 3adrugs 3aligands 3ametals 3aphosphine 3apyridines 3asalts1 aAlegre-Requena, Juan V.1 aLiu, Renrong1 aPaton, Robert S.1 aMcNally, Andrew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8651-16310 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 May 29, v. 142, no. 25 p.11295-11305dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c046743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01737naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002800144245006800172300001600240520074100256592002800997650001501025650002101040650001101061650002301072650001201095650001201107650001301119650001501132700002501147773015201172856007801324852000901402655001201411IND60521461020221119112507.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052146102DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1975-5-6192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchuchmann, Heinz-Peter14aThe UV Photolysis (λ = 185 nm) of Liquid Methyl n-Propyl Ether  ap. 399-403.  aThe main products of the 185 nm photolysis of liquid methyl n-propyl ether (quantum yields in parentheses) are n-propanol (0.70), methane (0.29), sec-butyl methyl ether (0.20), methanol (0.16), propionaldehyde (0.13), 3,4-dimethoxyhexane (0.09), ethane (0.08), and ethyl n-propyl ether (0.08).

However, there are few high-temperature-dependent radiation property data that can be used to accurately determine the temperature field, which hinders its further application. Thus, a theoretical approach using a combination of molecular dynamics and first principle methods is adopted to predict the radiation properties of molten solar salt from 525 to 875 K, which covers its working temperature range. According to the theoretical computation results, the main absorption region is observed when the wavelength is less than 500 nm. There are two absorption peaks located at approximately 130 and 250 nm, and there are also two refractive index peaks located at approximately 160 and 400 nm, which are slightly different from the absorption peaks. Moreover, increasing the working temperature subtly decreases the refractive index and extinction coefficient simultaneously. In addition, by investigating the effects of the simulation size, we found a 195-atoms system that satisfies the requirements for computations of related thermodynamic quantities. We believe that the results of this study show the significance of solar salt in the future applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aenergy 3amolecular dynamics 3arefractive index 3asolar energy 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3awavelengths 0aSolar salt 0aSolar energy 0aMolecular dynamics 0aMolten salt 0aFirst principles 0aRadiation properties1 aGao, Peng1 aYuanyuan,1 aTan, He-Ping0 tEnergy.g2022 May 01, v. 246 p.123379-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1233793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010500168520143300273592002801706650001101734650001901745650001701764650001401781650002401795650002201819650001201841650001001853650001601863650000901879650002801888650002501916650001601941651001001957653001901967653001801986653002002004653001802024653000802042653001002050653000902060653000802069653000802077653000702085653000902092700001702101700001502118700001302133700001502146773011302161856008602274852000902360655001202369IND60709491420221120024453.0201216e20201220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070949142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1240182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Lingbo10aEvaluating energy efficiency improvement of pulp and paper production: Case study from factory level  aTo reduce energy use and achieve a low carbon production in pulp and paper industry (PPI), it is essential to improve energy efficiency in pulp and paper production. In this study, the energy savings from the PPI were estimated based on a techno-economic analysis by EAGER tool for PPI at the factory level. The structure and implement procedure were introduced initially. Two typical pulp and paper mills from China were determined to estimate the impact of selected energy efficiency technologies (EETs) on energy savings as the cases in the base year. One Factory (A) only produced paper products (i.e. corrugated paper and Kraft linerboard) while the other Factory (B) also produced market pulp besides sack paper. In totally 22 selected EETs were applied to assess their saving potential in Factory A, and 29 measures were applied in Factory B. The results show that 2290 TJ and 1179 TJ of final energy could be saved annually in Factory A and B, corresponding to reduction of 29.4% and 13.6% total energy consumption respectively for the case factories. The CO₂ reduction potential was 32.3% for Factory A compared with that of 16.6% in Factory B. It suggests that the pulp and paper mills should encouraged to use this method estimating energy saving potential, and improve their energy efficiency with suggested measures in order to reduce energy consumption and related carbon emissions further in the coming years.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3aemissions 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy efficiency 3amarkets 3apaper 3apapermaking 3apulp 3apulp and paper industry 3apulp and paper mills 3awaste paper 3aChina 0aPulp and paper 0aEnergy saving 0aCarbon emission 0aFactory level 0aPPI 0aEAGER 0aEETs 0aCHP 0aO&M 0aPM 0aIPCC1 aZhao, Jingyi1 aLi, Jiahao1 aLou, Rui1 aZhang, Yao0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Dec. 20, v. 277 p.124018-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1240183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245015800172300001600330520121000346592002801556650001401584650002401598650002001622650000901642650002001651650001201671650002101683650001701704650001001721650001601731653003101747653003201778653001701810653002001827653003701847700002101884700002401905700002001929773008901949856008402038852000902122655001202131IND60600435520221121064720.0180703e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060043552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2014.01.1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGōkon, Nobuyuki,10aSteam reforming of methane using double-walled reformer tubes containing high-temperature thermal storage Na2CO3/MgO composites for solar fuel production  ap. 773-782.  aDouble-walled reactor tubes containing thermal storage materials based on the molten carbonate salts—100 wt% Na2CO3 molten salt, 90 wt% Na2CO3/10 wt% MgO and 80 wt% Na2CO3/20 wt% MgO composite materials—were studied for the performances of the reactor during the heat charging mode, while those of methane reforming with steam during heat discharging mode for solar steam reforming.

The double-walled reactor tubes with the 90 wt% Na2CO3/10 wt% MgO composite material was the most desirable for steam reforming of methane to realize large HHV amounts of reformed gas and higher efficiencies during heat-discharging mode.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acomposite materials 3afuel production 3aheat 3amagnesium oxide 3amethane 3asodium carbonate 3asolar energy 3asteam 3atemperature 0aHigher heating value (HHV) 0aPhase-change material (PCM) 0aSolar energy 0aSteam reforming 0aGas hourly space velocity (GHSV)1 aNakamura, Shohei1 aHatamachi, Tsuyoshi1 aKodama, Tatsuya0 tEnergy.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 68 p.773-782dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.01.1073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245009800175520098700273592002801260650002201288650002501310650001801335650002301353650001201376650002201388650001301410650001601423653002301439653001801462653002201480653001501502653001201517653001501529700006501544773009501609856008901704852000901793655001201802IND60673021720221120203212.0210624e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067302172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.05.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Kimberlee10aContextual factors that enable forest users to engage in tree-planting for forest restoration  aSocial, biophysical, and institutional contexts affect forest users’ incentives to work together to restore forests. With renewed government commitments to support such activities, we argue that effective interventions need to consider several context-specific factors – such as the user groups’ future discount rates, opportunity costs, and collective-action capabilities – because these factors will help determine the effectiveness of such interventions. To test the effects of a suite of contextual factors, we analyzed observations from 184 different groups in 133 forests across eight developing countries. We find that the combination of certain enabling factors increases the probability of users undertaking forest improvement activities, and that social contexts can condition the effect of institutional and biophysical contexts. Our findings carry implications for the design and implementation of future interventions to restore forests in developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollective action 3adeveloping countries 3adiscount rate 3aforest restoration 3aforests 3aopportunity costs 3aplanting 3aprobability 0aForest restoration 0aReforestation 0aCollective action 0aGovernance 0aContext 0aMotivation1 aAndersson, Krister P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9320-81550 tLand use policy.g2021 May, v. 104 p.104017-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.05.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245011800178300001600296520124300312592002801555650002201583650002201605650001301627650002401640650001101664650001901675650001601694651001701710653000801727653001601735653002901751653001801780700002401798700002701822773009701849856008501946852000902031655001202040IND60704842220221119205502.0201024e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070484222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.07.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aḤayātī, Muḥammad,10aSequential optimization of the geometrical parameters of an OWC device based on the specific wave characteristics  ap. 386-394.  aConventional Wave Energy Converters (WECs) are designed to extract the wave energy from the oceans with the wave power of 20–50 kW-per-meter. If these WECs are used where the wave energy is less than the mentioned values they cannot work in their maximum performance. Therefore it is proposed to optimize the WECs for the average wave power in each place. In this research, an Oscillating Water Column (OWC) is investigated to extract the maximum output power based on the characteristics of the Faroor island waves in the Persian Gulf. The average power of the Persian Gulf Waves is less than 10 kW-per-meter and using a conventional wave energy converter is not efficient. Numerical simulation is performed using ANSYS-Fluent software. In this study, waves are generated using nonlinear second order stokes theory. Also, the k-ω turbulence model and volume of fluid scheme are used for turbulence modeling and interface tracking respectively. Finally, with optimizing each parameter an optimum geometry with an efficiency of 41.5% is obtained to extract the Faroor Island waves’ energy. This study emphasizes on this fact that one should design a new geometry to reach the best performance of the OWC in new wave characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aenergy conversion 3ageometry 3amathematical models 3aoceans 3aturbulent flow 3awater power 3aPersian Gulf 0aOWC 0aWave energy 0aGeometrical optimization 0aFaroor island1 aNikseresht, Amir H.1 aHaghighi, Ali Taherian0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Dec., v. 161 p.386-394dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.07.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245011400171300001400285520176700299592002802066650001702094650001302111650002302124650002202147653002002169653002302189653002202212653002202234653002002256653002802276700001902304700002302323773008702346856008402433852000902517655001202526IND60591868620221117193620.0190403e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059186862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2018.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMosena, Alexander10aReconstructing the historical spread of non-native plants in the North American West from herbarium specimens  ap. 45-52.  aThe aim of this study is to demonstrate that the historical spread patterns of 10, in part poorly investigated exotic plant species can be reconstructed from herbarium records, using methods to account for herbarium collection bias. We collected herbarium specimen data of native and non-native plants from several North American herbaria, digitized and examined them at county scale. The year of the first collection in each county of the research area was recorded for all taxa. Cumulative number of specimen locations was plotted vs. time to construct invasion curves. For native species, these curves represent the spatiotemporal sampling distribution for herbarium specimens in the research area as well as the history of knowledge about geographical species distribution over time. Deviations from this curve provide information on the spread rates of non-native species over time. Periods of invasiveness become visible if the ratio of cumulative number of (a) locations of each exotic species and (b) locations of all native species for every year on record is plotted vs. time (proportion curves). We could identify main plant collection periods in the late 1930s, the 1970s and between 2007 and 2011. Starting in the 19th century, the intensive collection period of these plants was between 1980 and 2010. Invasion curves of three of the investigated alien species showed significant deviations from the native plant collection curve. Several highly variable periods of invasiveness could be detected for all studied non-natives, many of these periods occurring in the late 19th century. The calculation of proportion curves successfully revealed periods of invasiveness for the first time in the research area and minimized effects of collection bias.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3aherbaria 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 0aCollection bias 0aHerbarium specimen 0aHistorical spread 0aPacific northwest 0aPlant invasions 0aSpatiotemporal analysis1 aSteinlein, Tom1 aBeyschlag, Wolfram0 tFlora.g2018 May, v. 242 p.45-52dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl51878x0367-25307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2018.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245014400167300002000311520145900331592002801790596008401818596007501902650002201977650001401999650001502013650002302028650001302051653002802064653002202092653002802114653002802142653003102170700002502201700006102226700006502287773014202352856007902494852000902573655001202582IND60780141120221121064659.0220615e20220603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078014112DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c064492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Eric Chih-Kuan10aMolecular Dynamics Study of the Thermodynamics of Integer Charge Transfer vs Charge-Transfer Complex Formation in Doped Conjugated Polymers  ap. 26988-27001.  aMolecular dopants such as 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F₄TCNQ) can interact with conjugated polymers such as poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) in two different ways: they can undergo integer charge transfer (ICT) or they can form a partial-charge-transfer complex (CTC). Both are seen experimentally, but the CTC has been challenging to characterize, making it difficult to answer questions such as the following. Which polymorph is more stable? Do they have similar barriers for formation? Is there a thermodynamic route to convert one to the other? Here, we study the structure and the thermodynamics of bulk F₄TCNQ-doped P3HT with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, using thermodynamic integration to calculate the relative free energies. We find that the ICT and CTC polymorphs have similar thermodynamic stabilities. The barrier to create the ICT polymorph, however, is lower than that to make the CTC polymorph, because the ICT polymorph has a small critical nucleus, but the critical nucleus for the CTC polymorph is larger than what we can simulate. Moreover, simulated thermal annealing shows that the activation barrier for converting the CTC polymorph to the ICT polymorph is relatively modest. Overall, the simulations explain both the observed structures and the thermodynamics of F₄TCNQ-doped P3HT and offer guidelines for targeting the production of a desired polymorph for different applications.  aPublisher supplied data  aDMR-2105896cDivision of Materials Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000078  aCHE-2003755cDivision of Chemistrydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000165 3aGibbs free energy 3aannealing 3aguidelines 3amolecular dynamics 3apolymers 0asemiconducting polymers 0amolecular dopants 0ainteger charge transfer 0acharge-transfer complex 0athermodynamics vs kinetics1 aSalamat, Charlene Z.1 aTolbert, Sarah H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9969-15821 aSchwartz, Benjamin J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3257-91520 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 June 03, v. 14, no. 23 p.26988-27001dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c064493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013400169520174200303592002802045650001002073650001202083650001902095650001902114650000702133650001702140650001902157650001902176650001502195650001702210650001702227650001702244650002102261650001302282650001502295650002502310653000902335653000902344653001802353700001502371700001602386700001502402700001602417700001902433700001602452700002002468700001702488700001502505700001502520700002002535773011302555856008602668852000902754655001202763IND60709491620221120024307.0201216e20201220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070949162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1240212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Yingying10aVisible-light-driven AgBr–TiO2-Palygorskite photocatalyst with excellent photocatalytic activity for tetracycline hydrochloride  aTetracycline hydrochloride (TC) wastewater has complex components, high concentration of organic matter and certain biological toxicity. Photocatalytic degradation is of great application prospect due to its green, thorough and efficient removal of TC. In this study, heterojunction photocatalyst supported on Palygorskite (Pal) AgBr–TiO₂-Pal with visible light response was successfully prepared via sol-gel and liquid deposition method successfully. Taking TC as the target pollutant, the photocatalytic performance of AgBr–TiO₂-Pal photocatalys excited by visible light was studied. The spreading/grafting of AgBr–TiO₂ on the surface of Pal was improved by a series of structural characterization and composition analysis. The results also demonstrated that the specific surface area of AgBr–TiO₂-Pal was about 48.06 m²⋅g⁻¹ with uniform mesoporous slit. The AgBr–TiO₂-Pal catalyst was very effective for the degradation of TC, and it still retained its high stability and reusability after five cycles. The results showed that under the best reaction conditions (initial concentration of tetracycline 10 mg⋅L⁻¹, catalyst dosage 0.5 g⋅L⁻¹, pH value 9), with the excitation of visible light, the maximum removal ratio of TC was 90%, and the mineralization ratio was 67%. The removal efficiency and degradation rate of TC by AgBr–TiO₂-Pal catalyst were 2.17 and 4.75 times as much as those of TiO₂ respectively. The outstanding photocatalytic performance of heterogeneous AgBr–TiO₂-Pal catalyst was obtained by fully participate in the reaction by photoinduced charge. This study could be expected to be used in photocatalytic degradation of antibiotic pollutants in wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3alight 3aliquids 3amineralization 3aorganic matter 3apH 3apalygorskite 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apollutants 3aporous media 3asurface area 3atetracycline 3atitanium dioxide 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aAgBr 0aTiO2 0aVisible light1 aYan, Zhuan1 aXu, Yingtao1 aTian, Tian1 aZhang, Jing1 aPang, Jianfeng1 aPeng, Xihua1 aZhang, Qianghua1 aShao, Mingli1 aTan, Wenyi1 aLi, Hailun1 aXiong, Qingping0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Dec. 20, v. 277 p.124021-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1240213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03925naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001300158245012100171300001600292520231200308592002802620650001802648650002102666650002302687650001102710650001402721650001402735650001502749650001902764650001402783650001802797650002502815650000802840650000902848650001202857650002502869650001802894650002002912650001402932650002702946650002002973653002702993653001703020653001903037653001703056653001903073653001003092700001403102700001903116700001403135773010803149856009303257852000903350655001203359IND60540572620221122044125.0190318e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054057262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRode, K.10aCharacterization of the equine blood–testis barrier during tubular development in normal and cryptorchid stallions  ap. 763-772.  aThe formation of the blood–testis barrier (BTB) is defined as occurring with the first appearance of spermatocytes at around puberty and is vital for normal spermatogenesis. This barrier between two adjacent Sertoli cells (SCs) consists of a cell junctional protein complex, which includes tight junctions (TJs), adherens junctions, and gap junctions. In many mammalian species, BTB composition has already been investigated, whereas little is known about the equine BTB. In the present study, immunohistochemistry and qualitative Western Blot analysis were used to assess the expression and distribution patterns of the junctional proteins claudin-11 (TJ), zonula occludens-1 (TJ associated), N-cadherin (adherens junctions), and connexin 43 (gap junctions) in equine testes during tubular development and in testes of stallions exhibiting unilateral cryptorchidism. Therefore, testes of 21 warmblood stallions (aged 12 months–11 years) were obtained during routine surgical castration. In the normal adult equine testis, the junctional proteins are localized at the basolateral region of the seminiferous tubules forming a circumferential seal corresponding to the known BTB localization. N-cadherin is additionally expressed along the lateral SC surface. In immature seminiferous cords still lacking a lumen, a diffuse distribution pattern of the junctional proteins throughout the SC cytoplasm is visible. As lumen formation advances, the immunolocalization shifts progressively toward the basolateral SC membranes. Additionally, apoptotic germ cells were detected and quantified in prepubertal stallions using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay and correlated with junctional protein localization. In the retained testis of cryptorchid stallions, which exhibit an aberrant testicular morphology, a deviating expression of the junctional proteins is visible. The present data show for the first time that (1) the equine SC junctional complex contains claudin-11, zonula occludens-1, N-Cadherin, and connexin 43, as already described for men or mice, and that (2) different distribution patterns of these proteins exist during testicular development in the context of lumen formation (lumen scores: 1–7) and in retained testes of unilateral cryptorchid stallions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSertoli cells 3aWestern blotting 3aadherens junctions 3aadults 3aapoptosis 3acadherins 3acastration 3acryptorchidism 3acytoplasm 3agap junctions 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amen 3amice 3apuberty 3aseminiferous tubules 3aspermatocytes 3aspermatogenesis 3astallions 3atesticular development 3atight junctions 0aBlood–testis barrier 0aSertoli cell 0aTight junction 0aGap junction 0aCryptorchidism 0aHorse1 aSieme, H.1 aRichterich, P.1 aBrehm, R.0 tTheriogenology.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 84, no. 5 p.763-772dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01749naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013800159300001800297520068300315592002800998650001201026650001401038650002301052650000901075650001101084650002201095650000701117700002101124700002301145700002601168773013401194856007401328852000901402655001201411IND60660797520221118185058.0190827e20150312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066079752DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc08670h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Adam M.10aContributions to activity enhancement via Fe incorporation in Ni-(oxy)hydroxide/borate catalysts for near-neutral pH oxygen evolution  ap. 5261-5263.  aNi–borate materials are oxygen evolution catalysts that operate at near-neutral pH and have been found previously to improve due to structural changes induced via anodic conditioning. We find that this increased activity after conditioning at 0.856 V vs. SCE, as measured on a turn-over frequency basis (TOF) at 400 mV overpotential (TOF = 0.38 s⁻¹), accompanies significant Fe incorporation (14%). Films conditioned in Fe-free electrolyte exhibit ∼10 times lower activity (TOF = 0.03 s⁻¹). By co-depositing Fe–Ni we demonstrate high activity without conditioning (TOF = 0.24 s⁻¹) which improves further with shortened (∼30 min) conditioning (TOF = 1.4 s⁻¹).  aPublisher supplied data 3aborates 3acatalysts 3achemical reactions 3airon 3anickel 3aoxygen production 3apH1 aTrotochaud, Lena1 aBurke, Michaela S.1 aBoettcher, Shannon W.0 tChemical communications.g2015 Mar. 12, v. 51, no. 25 p.5261-5263dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4cc08670h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007000172520126100242592002801503650001401531650001501545650002801560650002001588650001401608650002701622650001701649653001901666653001701685653002801702653002101730653000801751773011301759856008601872852000901958655001201967IND60709491720221120024430.0210708e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070949172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1240222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuman, Siddharth10aArtificial intelligence in nuclear industry: Chimera or solution?  aNuclear industry is in crisis and innovation is the central theme of its survival in future. Artificial intelligence has made a quantum leap in last few years. This paper comprehensively analyses recent advancement in artificial intelligence for its applications in nuclear power industry. A brief background of machine learning techniques researched and proposed in this domain is outlined. A critical assessment of various nuances of artificial intelligence for nuclear industry is provided. Lack of operational data from real power plant especially for transients and accident scenario is a major concern regarding the accuracy of intelligent systems. There is no universally agreed opinion among researchers for selecting the best artificial intelligence techniques for a specific purpose as intelligent systems developed by various researchers are based on different data set. Interlaboratory work frame or round-robin programme to develop the artificial intelligent tool for any specific purpose, based on the same data base, can be crucial in claiming the accuracy and thus the best technique. The black box nature of artificial techniques also poses a serious challenge for its implementation in nuclear industry, as it makes them prone to fooling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3adata collection 3adatabases 3anuclear power industry 3apower plants 0aSustainability 0aClean energy 0aArtificial intelligence 0aMachine learning 0aANN0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 278 p.124022-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1240223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013000166300001600296520130800312592002801620650000801648650000901656650000901665650001501674650002201689650002901711650001601740650001101756650001101767653002501778653001701803653001701820653002301837653002301860700001301883700001401896700001401910700001401924700001401938700001601952773009701968856008502065852000902150655001202159IND60704842520221120135112.0201024e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070484252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.07.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Wenzhe12aA new frosting map of variable-frequency air source heat pump in severe cold region considering the variation of heating load  ap. 184-199.  aDuring experiments on investigating the application feasibility of variable-frequency air source heat pump with vapor injection (ASHPVI) in severe cold region, it was found its frosting performance varied significantly from that in former investigations, e.g. in a severe frosting condition (0 °C, 80%), the experimental unit was frost-free. To investigate the frosting characteristics of variable-frequency ASHPVI for space heating in severe cold region, a test rig was built and used to supply heating for a lab in two heating seasons. A new frosting map was developed through summarizing its running performance under frosting condition. Results showed the frosting map of variable-frequency ASHPVI was affected by heating load. Owing to the consideration of heating load, the critical relative humidity decreased from 80.60% to 62.75% when outdoor temperature (OT) dropped from 1.0 °C to −26.5 °C, opposite to the change trend in former investigations. Besides, compared with values obtained in cold region, the upper and lower limits of OT of frosting region in severe cold region were both lower, and its critical relative humidity was higher. Moreover, the highest frosting speed appeared at OT of approximately −10 °C in severe cold region, but not at 0 °C as previously thought.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acold 3aheat 3aheat pumps 3arelative humidity 3arenewable energy sources 3atemperature 3avapors 3awinter 0aAir source heat pump 0aFrosting map 0aHeating load 0aSevere cold region 0aVariable-frequency1 aNi, Long1 aLi, Shuyi1 aWang, Wei1 aYao, Yang1 aXu, Laifu1 aYang, Yahua0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Dec., v. 161 p.184-199dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.07.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03497naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001200154245013500166520219500301592002802496650001202524650002002536650002402556650001202580650002202592650001302614650001502627650001102642650001902653650001702672650001702689650001302706651001002719653002502729653001802754653001902772653002802791653001202819653001002831700001702841773009502858856008902953852000903042655001203051IND60673022020221120193457.0200628e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067302202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.1042682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Bin10aSocial capital for rural revitalization in China: A critical evaluation on the government’s new countryside programme in Chengdu  aIn the context of urbanisation and decline of its countryside in the 21ˢᵗ century, the Chinese government has initiated a campaign namely “building a socialist new countryside” in 2006 which is now renamed as “rural revitalisation”. Bringing together social capital, government intervention and other capital, we argue that rural revitalisation can be viewed as a process of the interaction between land transfer and community building leading to multiple gains of all stakeholders. Given the predomination of top-down government intervention and external capital investment in its campaign, this paper sheds new light on social capital in terms of not only mobilising community members’ participation, but also reaching a balance with interests of government and other stakeholders. The importance of social capital can be illustrated from critical evaluation on governmental pilot projects in the suburban zone of Chengdu, a model municipal in China in urban-rural integration. In particular, this paper aims to address the following questions: How does social capital engage and contribute to rural restructuring for sustainable rural livelihoods? What role can social capital play in the decision making of land transfer and community building? This paper contributes to rural revitalisation and land use debates in three aspects. Firstly, we post a triangular model by bringing together government intervention, social and other capital to emphasize the interwoven nature of the relationship between land transfer and community building for better understanding of the intrinsic dynamics within the communities and their interests interfaced with external stakeholders. Secondly, with respect to the impact of land transfer on sustainable livelihoods, we propose an evaluation framework to account and compare the roles of social capital against government intervention and other conditions in land transfer decision making. Thirdly, applying the above framework to sample villages, we identify three types of rural restructuring: government-led, farmer self-organising, and returned entrepreneur-oriented. Policy implications and further research direction are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3adecision making 3aeconomic investment 3afarmers 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3alivelihood 3amodels 3asocial capital 3astakeholders 3aurbanization 3avillages 3aChina 0aRural revitalisation 0aLand transfer 0aSocial capital 0aGovernment intervention 0aChengdu 0aChina1 aLiu, Linghui0 tLand use policy.g2020 Feb., v. 91 p.104268-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.1042683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03624naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002200188245003400210300001800244506007600262520192800338592002802266506003702294650002302331650001802354650001302372650001902385650001402404650001802418650002102436650002102457650001702478650002602495650002302521650001702544650002002561650002402581650001702605650002102622650002802643650001102671650002502682650002502707650002202732650002702754650004002781650003802821700002702859773011502886856004803001852000903049655001203058IND50062517920221207054247.0130322e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006251792DNAL7 a232805392pmid7 aPMC35553482pmcid7 a10.1007/s00253-012-4641-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSachdev, Dhara P.10aBiosurfactants in agriculture  ap. 1005-1016.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAgricultural productivity to meet growing demands of human population is a matter of great concern for all countries. Use of green compounds to achieve the sustainable agriculture is the present necessity. This review highlights the enormous use of harsh surfactants in agricultural soil and agrochemical industries. Biosurfactants which are reported to be produced by bacteria, yeasts, and fungi can serve as green surfactants. Biosurfactants are considered to be less toxic and eco-friendly and thus several types of biosurfactants have the potential to be commercially produced for extensive applications in pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and food industries. The biosurfactants synthesized by environmental isolates also has promising role in the agricultural industry. Many rhizosphere and plant associated microbes produce biosurfactant; these biomolecules play vital role in motility, signaling, and biofilm formation, indicating that biosurfactant governs plant–microbe interaction. In agriculture, biosurfactants can be used for plant pathogen elimination and for increasing the bioavailability of nutrient for beneficial plant associated microbes. Biosurfactants can widely be applied for improving the agricultural soil quality by soil remediation. These biomolecules can replace the harsh surfactant presently being used in million dollar pesticide industries. Thus, exploring biosurfactants from environmental isolates for investigating their potential role in plant growth promotion and other related agricultural applications warrants details research. Conventional methods are followed for screening the microbial population for production of biosurfactant. However, molecular methods are fewer in reaching biosurfactants from diverse microbial population and there is need to explore novel biosurfactant from uncultured microbes in soil biosphere by using advanced methodologies like functional metagenomics.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural soils 3aagrochemicals 3abacteria 3abiosurfactants 3acosmetics 3afood industry 3agrowth promotion 3ahuman population 3ametagenomics 3anutrient availability 3apesticide industry 3aplant growth 3aplant pathogens 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil quality 3asoil remediation 3asustainable agriculture 3ayeasts 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aFungixmetabolism 2aPesticidesxmetabolism 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolism 2aSurface-Active Agentsxmetabolism1 aCameotra, Swaranjit S.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2013 Feb., v. 97, no. 3 p.1005-1016dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-012-4641-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005900142245008500201300002000286520102700306592002801333650001501361650001401376650002501390650001001415650001401425650003801439650001401477650001101491700005801502700002101560700005901581700001601640700002101656700002201677700002401699700002301723700006201746700001801808700002401826700006001850773014901910856007602059852000902135655001202144IND60699965320221122035921.0200624e20200601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069996532DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b136522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKitamura, Seiya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2453-849X10aSulfur(VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx)-Enabled High-Throughput Medicinal Chemistry  ap. 10899-10904.  aOptimization of small-molecule probes or drugs is a synthetically lengthy, challenging, and resource-intensive process. Lack of automation and reliance on skilled medicinal chemists is cumbersome in both academic and industrial settings. Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput hit-to-lead process based on the biocompatible sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) click chemistry. A high-throughput screening hit benzyl (cyanomethyl)carbamate (Kᵢ = 8 μM) against a bacterial cysteine protease SpeB was modified with a SuFExable iminosulfur oxydifluoride [RN═S(O)F₂] motif, rapidly diversified into 460 analogs in overnight reactions, and the products were directly screened to yield drug-like inhibitors with 480-fold higher potency (Kᵢ = 18 nM). We showed that the improved molecule is active in a bacteria-host coculture. Since this SuFEx linkage reaction succeeds on picomole scale for direct screening, we anticipate our methodology can accelerate the development of robust biological probes and drug candidates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3acoculture 3acysteine proteinases 3adrugs 3afluorides 3ahigh-throughput screening methods 3ascreening 3asulfur1 aZheng, Qinheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8440-86731 aWoehl, Jordan L.1 aSolania, Angelo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7872-43301 aChen, Emily1 aDillon, Nicholas1 aHull, Mitchell V.1 aKotaniguchi, Miyako1 aCappiello, John R.1 aKitamura, Shinichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7115-65611 aNizet, Victor1 aSharpless, K.

Herein, we present the design and fabrication of a solid-state nanoplasmonic biosensing platform that is capable of quantifying SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody IgG with a limit of detection as low as 30.0 attomolar (aM) and a wide dynamic range spanning seven orders of magnitude. Based on IgG binding constant determination for different biological motifs, we show that the covalent attachment of highly specific SARS-CoV-2 linear epitopes with an appropriate ratio, in contrast to using SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunits as receptor molecules, to gold triangular nanoprisms (Au TNPs) results in a construction of a highly selective and more sensitive, label-free IgG biosensor. The biosensing platform displays specificity against other human antibodies and no cross reactivity against MERS-CoV antibodies. Furthermore, the nanoplasmonic biosensing platform can be assembled in a multi-well plate format to translate to a high-throughput assay that allowed us to conduct SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays of COVID-19 positive patient (n = 121) and healthy individual (n = 65) plasma samples. Most importantly, performing a blind test in an additional cohort of 30 patient plasma samples, our nanoplasmonic biosensing platform successfully identified COVID-19 positive samples with 90% specificity and 100% sensitivity. Very recent studies show that our selected epitopes are conserved in the highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variant “Omicron”; therefore, the demonstrated high-throughput nanoplasmonic biosensing platform holds great promise for a highly specific serological assay for conducting large-scale COVID-19 testing and epidemiological studies and monitoring the immune response and durability of immunity as part of the global immunization programs.  aPublisher supplied data  aUL1TR002529cNational Center for Advancing Translational Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006108  aNAcIndiana University-Purdue University Indianapolisdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008113 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3abiosensors 3across reaction 3adetection limit 3adurability 3aepitopes 3agold 3ahumans 3aimmunization 3aimmunologic techniques 3amonitoring 3ananoprisms 3apatients 0aCOVID-19 0aSARS-CoV-2 0alinear epitope 0aneutralizing antibody IgG 0ananoplasmonic biosensing 0aselectivity 0aclinical samples1 aSardar, Rajesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9680-13010 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 May 31, v. 14, no. 23 p.26517-26527dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c065993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002500158245010100183300001800284520148800302592002801790650001501818650002101833650001001854650002201864650001301886650001101899650002601910650001501936650000901951650003001960650007101990650001402061650000902075651001402084700002302098700002202121700002302143700001902166700002702185700002102212773010602233856004002339852000902379655001202388IND50089196320221116172056.0140430e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008919632DNAL7 a243297262pmid7 a10.1111/pce.122512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMCLEAN, ELIZABETH H.10aPlasticity of functional traits varies clinally along a rainfall gradient in Eucalyptus tricarpa  ap. 1440-1451.  aWidespread species often occur across a range of climatic conditions, through a combination of local genetic adaptations and phenotypic plasticity. Species with greater phenotypic plasticity are likely to be better positioned to cope with rapid anthropogenic climate changes, while those displaying strong local adaptations might benefit from translocations to assist the movement of adaptive genes as the climate changes. Eucalyptus tricarpa occurs across a climatic gradient in south‐eastern Australia, a region of increasing aridity, and we hypothesized that this species would display local adaptation to climate. We measured morphological and physiological traits reflecting climate responses in nine provenances from sites of 460 to 1040 mm annual rainfall, in their natural habitat and in common gardens near each end of the gradient. Local adaptation was evident in functional traits and differential growth rates in the common gardens. Some traits displayed complex combinations of plasticity and genetic divergence among provenances, including clinal variation in plasticity itself. Provenances from drier locations were more plastic in leaf thickness, whereas leaf size was more plastic in provenances from higher rainfall locations. Leaf density and stomatal physiology (as indicated by δ¹³C and δ¹⁸O) were highly and uniformly plastic. In addition to variation in mean trait values, genetic variation in trait plasticity may play a role in climate adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aclimatic factors 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3aleaves 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aphysiology 3arain 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aEucalyptusxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPhenotype 2aRain 0aAustralia1 aPROBER, SUZANNE M.1 aSTOCK, WILLIAM D.1 aSTEANE, DOROTHY A.1 aPOTTS, BRAD M.1 aVAILLANCOURT, RENÉ E.1 aByrne, Margaret,0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2014 June, v. 37, no. 6 p.1440-1451dBlackwell Sciencex0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.12251  aDNAL 7aarticle03594naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002400158245011100182300001600293520225600309592002802565650001102593650001802604650002302622650002002645650003402665650000902699650003302708650001402741653002302755653002002778653002602798653004302824700001402867700001602881700002302897700001702920700002502937773010802962856009303070852000903163655001203172IND60540572820221120153252.0190318e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054057282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruno-Galarraga, M.10aPreselection of high and low ovulatory responders in sheep multiple ovulation and embryo transfer programs  ap. 784-790.  aThe present study evaluated the feasibility of carrying out an easy-to-handle and cost-efficient test for the preselection of high– and low–ovulatory responder ewes under superovulatory protocols. The test was based on the assessment of the number of ovulations obtained in response to the administration of a single-shot eCG treatment. The predictive value of the test was determined by comparing the number of ovulations with yields obtained in response to a multiple-dose FSH treatment. In addition, the study determined possible effects of follicular status at first FSH dose and their relationship with subsequent ovarian response. A total of 31 Merino ewes received hormonal treatment comprising the administration of 800 IU of eCG at the end of progestative treatment. Twenty-three days later, multiple-dose FSH treatment (80-mg FSH, in six decreasing doses between Days 12 and 14 of a second progestative treatment) was applied to the same ewes. The study showed a significant relationship between the number of corpora lutea obtained in response to eCG treatment with respect to those obtained in response to FSH treatment (r = 0.791; P < 0.05), which resulted in 84% recurrence rate. The number of embryos was greater for high-responder in relation to low-responder ewes (7.2 ± 3.7 and 4.0 ± 3.9, respectively; P < 0.05), whereas rates of recovery and fertilization were similar between groups (P > 0.05). Hence, there was a tendency for a higher mean of grades 1 and 2 embryos in high-responder in relation to low-responder ewes (6.1 ± 3.8 and 3.7 ± 4.0, respectively; P < 0.1). No significant relationship was found between the number of corpora lutea in response to FSH treatment and the number of small and total follicles at first FSH dose (P > 0.05). However, a negative low relationship was found between the presence of large follicles and the ovulation rate in response to FSH treatment (r = −0.361; P < 0.05). In conclusion, the results show the feasibility of carrying out an easy-to-handle and cost-efficient procedure for the preselection of embryo donors. The procedure was based on high recurrence rate between hormonal treatments, which in turn accounts for a distinctive ewe ovulatory response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMerino 3acorpus luteum 3acost effectiveness 3aembryo transfer 3aequine chorionic gonadotropin 3aewes 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3aovulation 0aMultiple ovulation 0aEmbryo recovery 0aFollicular population 0aMultiple ovulation and embryo transfer1 aCueto, M.1 aGibbons, A.1 aPereyra-Bonnet, F.1 aSubiabre, M.1 aGonzález-Bulnes, A.0 tTheriogenology.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 84, no. 5 p.784-790dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245021900168300001600387520134800403592002801751650002201779650001201801650002501813650001001838650001901848650002001867650002601887650001001913650001701923650001901940650002701959650002301986650001402009650002602023700002002049700002302069700002102092700001702113773010402130856008102234852000902315655001202324IND4468974120221121032631.0141111e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446897412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2011.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaminiti, Irene M.13aTheeffect of pulsed electric fields, ultraviolet light or high intensity light pulses in combination with manothermosonication on selected physico-chemical and sensory attributes of an orange and carrot juice blend  ap. 442-448.  aA blend of orange and carrot juice was processed by three selected treatments combining pulsed electric fields (PEF) (24kV/cm, 18Hz, 93Î¼s), ultraviolet light (UV) (10.6J/cmÂ²) or high intensity light pulses (HILP) (3.3J/cmÂ²), in each case, with manothermosonication (MTS) technology (400kPa, 35Â°C, 1000W, 20kHz). Treatment effects on selected physico-chemical and sensory properties of the juice were evaluated. No significant changes were found in non-enzymatic browning (NEBI) or antioxidant activity compared to an untreated control. However, the treatments increased all the Hunter Lab colour values, while total phenolics were significantly decreased. Each combination achieved on average 78% inactivation of pectin methyl esterase (PME). Sensory analysis showed that the colour of the product processed by hurdle combinations was preferred to that of a pasteurised sample (72Â°C, 26s), while the flavour was adversely affected by all of the non-thermal treatments. Panellists did not perceive differences in the odour, sweetness or acidity of the product. Results indicate that, under the current experimental conditions, the application of the selected combinations of non-thermal technologies resulted in a product in which certain quality attributes were somewhat inferior to those of a lightly pasteurised control juice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaillard reaction 3aacidity 3aantioxidant activity 3acolor 3aelectric field 3alight intensity 3anonthermal processing 3aodors 3aorange juice 3apectinesterase 3apulsed electric fields 3asensory evaluation 3asweetness 3aultraviolet radiation1 aNoci, Francesco1 aMorgan, Desmond J.1 aCronin, Denis A.1 aLyng, James,0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2012 July, v. 90, no. 3 p.442-448dElsevier B.V.x0960-30857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbp.2011.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002600161245006900187300001600256500000900272520125100281592002801532650002901560650001301589650001401602650000901616650001301625650001701638651001201655700002101667700001901688700002101707773014701728856009601875852000901971655001201980IND60668579020221120183951.0191125e198805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066857902DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1988.03615995005200030027x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchellentrager, G.

In Florida, because of optimum soil conditions, large amounts of soils information can be gathered at a rapid rate by using ground-penetrating radar (GPR). The information is being used to update soil surveys. Soil maps of the older soil survey report were evaluated first in order to determine if the map unit delineations consistently separate mappable landform and vegetative features. Using GPR, transects were made within randomly selected map unit delineations. Soils were identified and classified using conventional methods and their respective proportion and distribution along the transects were determined using the GPR imagery. These data were statistically analyzed to estimate the variability and composition of closely similar soils within each map unit and to justify correlation decisions. These data are presented in descriptive as well as tabular form in the published soil surveys. When compared to costs for traditional methods, the costs for updating soil survey information with GPR were dramatically reduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aground-penetrating radar 3aland use 3alandforms 3asoil 3asoil map 3asoil surveys 3aFlorida1 aDoolittle, J.

The objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the volatilization potential of pesticides used on golf courses in the United States and to assess the resulting inhalation health risks. Long-term exposures were simulated using a fate and transport model for inhaled concentrations. The model was tested using data from field experiments for eight pesticides. Mean concentrations were overestimated by a factor of two, and the model explained 82% of observed variations. The model was subsequently used to estimate volatilization mass fluxes and air concentrations for 37 chemicals using weather information from nine climatic zones in the United States. Simulation results indicated substantial regional variations in volatilization fluxes, concentrations, and health risks, largely due to weather and pesticide application variations. Hazard quotients associated with chronic noncarcinogenic health risks were found to be less than 10⁻⁴ for all chemicals and locations. Similarly, carcinogenic health risks for the 10 pesticides considered likely or possible carcinogens were determined to be less than 10⁻⁸. Based on currently available levels of chronic toxicity endpoints for human health (chronic reference doses and cancer potency factors), we could find no evidence of health risk to golfers from inhalation of these 37 pesticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarcinogenicity 3acarcinogens 3achronic toxicity 3aclimatic zones 3afield experimentation 3agolf courses 3ahuman health 3ainhalation exposure 3alawns and turf 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3apesticide application 3apesticides 3arisk 3avapors 3avolatilization 3aUnited States1 aHaith, Douglas A.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2013 Nov., v. 42, no. 6 p.1615-1622dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2013.01.00173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03807naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245013500202300002000337520178500357592002802142650001602170650001202186650001202198650002702210650001202237650002802249650001602277650002202293650001302315700005502328700005702383700005802440700002102498700005702519700005802576700006602634700006002700700005702760700006102817700006102878700002202939700005902961700006003020773014803080856007603228852000903304655001203313IND60699965420200904000000.0200624e20200527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069996542DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b137692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlanina, Tomáš1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8092-726810aImpact of Excited-State Antiaromaticity Relief in a Fundamental Benzene Photoreaction Leading to Substituted Bicyclo[3.1.0]hexenes  ap. 10942-10954.  aBenzene exhibits a rich photochemistry which can provide access to complex molecular scaffolds that are difficult to access with reactions in the electronic ground state. While benzene is aromatic in its ground state, it is antiaromatic in its lowest ππ* excited states. Herein, we clarify to what extent relief of excited-state antiaromaticity (ESAA) triggers a fundamental benzene photoreaction: the photoinitiated nucleophilic addition of solvent to benzene in acidic media leading to substituted bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-enes. The reaction scope was probed experimentally, and it was found that silyl-substituted benzenes provide the most rapid access to bicyclo[3.1.0]hexene derivatives, formed as single isomers with three stereogenic centers in yields up to 75% in one step. Two major mechanism hypotheses, both involving ESAA relief, were explored through quantum chemical calculations and experiments. The first mechanism involves protonation of excited-state benzene and subsequent rearrangement to bicyclo[3.1.0]hexenium cation, trapped by a nucleophile, while the second involves photorearrangement of benzene to benzvalene followed by protonation and nucleophilic addition. Our studies reveal that the second mechanism is operative. We also clarify that similar ESAA relief leads to puckering of S₁-state silabenzene and pyridinium ion, where the photorearrangement of the latter is of established synthetic utility. Finally, we identified causes for the limitations of the reaction, information that should be valuable in explorations of similar photoreactions. Taken together, we reveal how the ESAA in benzene and 6π-electron heterocycles trigger photochemical distortions that provide access to complex three-dimensional molecular scaffolds from simple reactants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3abenzene 3acations 3aheterocyclic compounds 3aisomers 3aphotochemical reactions 3aprotonation 3aquantum mechanics 3asolvents1 aAyub, Rabia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2128-67331 aToldo, Josene1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8969-66351 aSundell, Johan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8579-92931 aRabten, Wangchuk1 aNicaso, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0389-50411 aAlabugin, Igor1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9289-38191 aFdez.

Alternative time and cost-effective methods are thus needed. Our objective was to assess and compare the efficiency of laser granulometry (LG) and soil mid- and near-infrared spectroscopy (MIR/NIR) as alternative methods to assess soil aggregate stability in Mediterranean badland soils. A collection of 75 badland soil samples was used, showing wide variations in soil aggregate stability. Three different categories of measurements were performed: (i) the aggregate breakdown kinetics of the [<1mm] size fraction under stirring and sonication, tracked by repeated particle size distribution measurements, using LG, (ii) mid-(diffuse-MIR-DR and attenuate transmitted reflectance — MIR-ATR) and near-(NIR-DR) infrared spectra of the fine soil fraction [<2mm] and (iii) the soil aggregate [3–5mm] stability, using the standardized method (ISO/FDIS 10930, 2012). Partial least squares regression models were used to predict soil aggregate stability using LG data and infrared spectra. Results showed that NIR-DR and MIR-ATR data provided the best prediction model for soil aggregate stability values (RPD=2.61 & 2.74; R2=0.85 & 0.87), followed by MIR-DR data (RPD=2.24; R2=0.89) and finally LG data (RPD=2.12; R2=0.80). For a quantitative use of the models to assign soil samples to standardized soil aggregate stability classes (ISO/FDIS 10930, 2012), infrared spectra also provided the best accuracy, with a misclassification rate below 30% for NIR-DR and MIR-ATR models, while it reached 43% with the LG-based model. The combination of IR and LG data did not yield a better prediction model for soil aggregate stability values and classes. Infrared-based method also provided best results in terms of time-saving strategy, reducing the measurement time to 8min only. To conclude, infrared spectra (NIR-DR and MIR-ATR) outperformed LG-data to predict soil aggregate stability. Further development of this technique would require calibrating a set of soil-type specific prediction models for a wide range of soil types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggregate stability 3acost effectiveness 3aleast squares 3amixing 3amodels 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aparticle size distribution 3areflectance 3asoil aggregates 3asoil sampling 3asoil types 0aMWD 0aSOC 0aNIR 0aMIR 0aDR 0aATR 0aPLS 0aRPD 0aRMSECV 0aRMSEP 0ad10 0ad50 0ad90 0aSoil erosion 0aBadland soils 0aMediterranean climate 0aInfrared spectroscopy 0aSoil aggregate stability 0aLaser granulometry1 aLegout, Cédric1 aDe Danieli, Sébastien1 aDaumergue, Nathan1 aCécillon, Lauric0 tGeoderma.g2016 June 01, v. 271 p.225-233dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2016.02.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245016800157300002000325520158000345592002801925596009801953596010502051650001502156650001502171650001802186650001102204650001602215650002502231650001502256650002202271650001802293650002502311653002902336653002002365653002502385700001302410700001702423700001702440700001502457700001502472700001702487700001802504700005702522773014102579856007902720852000902799655001202808IND60780141520221121064709.0220615e20220531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078014152DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c066642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Yao10aTeamed Boronate Affinity-Functionalized Zn-MOF/PAN-Derived Molecularly Imprinted Hollow Carbon Electrospinning Nanofibers for Selective Adsorption of Shikimic Acid  ap. 27294-27308.  aElectrospun micro-/nanofibers with tailor-made specific binding sites are extremely popular due to their tremendous potential in separation applications. In this work, teamed boronate affinity (TBA)-functionalized molecularly imprinted hollow carbon electrospun nanofibers (MI-HCESNFs) derived from ZIF-8/PAN fibers with selective binding sites toward shikimic acid (SA) are presented. Each ingredient used in this strategy plays its own part: HCESNFs with excellent structural characteristics as the highly porous electrospun substrate, KH560 as the grafting material for the follow-up polyethyleneimine (PEI) modification, PEI as the dendritic platform to approach more boronic acid owing to its long chain with abundant amino groups, and TBA molecular group as the functional monomer to specifically bind with SA under the neutral condition. Benefiting from the porous structure, the high density of boronic acid, and the highly accessible imprinted sites on the surface, MI-HCESNFs show strong affinity and selectivity to the SA molecules. The adsorption capacity of MI-HCESNFs can reach 127.8 mg g–¹, which is 3.1 times larger than that of the non-imprinted material. Besides, MI-HCESNFs are stable when treated with continuous ultrasonication and can be recycled eight times with a slight loss of 8.615% on the adsorption quantity. This work presents a new strategy to prepare boronate affinity adsorbents based on the electrospinning technique for the capture of SA and also proposes a path for the integration of molecularly imprinted polymers and electrospinning.  aPublisher supplied data  a21878132cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aKYCX20_3042cGraduate scientific research innovation program of Jiangsu Provincedhttps://doi.org/NA 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aboronic acids 3acarbon 3aingredients 3amolecular imprinting 3ananofibers 3apolyethyleneimine 3ashikimic acid 3aultrasonic treatment 0ateamed boronate affinity 0aelectrospinning 0aselective separation1 aWang, Ke1 aLü, Jiahui,1 aPan, Zhiyuan1 aRong, Jian1 aZhang, Tao1 aYang, Dongya1 aPan, Jianming1 aQiu, Fengxian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7475-75650 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 May 31, v. 14, no. 23 p.27294-27308dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c066643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013200156300001800288520090100306592002801207650002401235650001101259650001401270650001101284650002101295650001401316650002301330650002301353650001101376650002101387650000901408650001101417650002201428650002401450650001101474700001301485700001701498700001501515700001701530700001501547700001301562700001501575700001901590773013401609856007401743852000901817655001201826IND60699965620221122035931.0200624e20200623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069996562DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc00229a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Dengyu10aSingle-layer carbon-coated FeCo alloy nanoparticles embedded in single-walled carbon nanotubes for high oxygen electrocatalysis  ap. 6842-6845.  aHerein, novel and durable single-layer carbon-coated FeCo alloy nanoparticles embedded in single-walled carbon nanotubes (FeCo/SWCNTs) are rationally synthesized using a facile one-step route by aerosol-assisted floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (CCVD).

To reduce the possibility of overheating operation and decrease the explosion of reheater, the operating temperature of reheater should be accurately monitored in real-time. Through the real-time prediction of the temperature distribution of the reheater tube, the alarm threshold is set to prevent tube burst and other faults. To accurately predict the metal temperature of the reheater tube in real-time, a multi-feature-scale fusion temporal convolution network prediction model is proposed in this paper. The model has a strong ability of feature extraction and nonlinear function fitting, and can infinitely approximate the mapping relationship between input and output data. Innovative methods feature construction, spatial partition and feature fusion, are proposed to improve the accuracy. Original data are collected from one thermal power plant reheater in the Guangdong province of China. The multi-feature-scale fusion temporal convolution network is applied to study the real-life data from March 2020 to May 2020. Compared with 20 prediction models such as random forest, the proposed model has higher accuracy. The mean absolute percentage error result of the proposed model is smaller 0.16% than the second smallest model and 25.70% smaller than the largest model.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3aenergy 3amodels 3apower plants 3aprediction 3asteam 3atemperature 3aChina 0aMulti-feature-scale fusion temporal convolution networks 0aMetal temperature forecasting 0aFeature construction 0aSpatial partition model 0aFeature fusion1 aXie, Jiaxing0 tEnergy.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 238 p.121657-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1216573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03652naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013400173520227700307592002802584650001402612650001302626650001902639650001202658650002402670650001202694650002202706650001802728650002302746650001502769650002702784650001702811650002902828650001802857650000902875650001802884650002302902651001302925700001902938700002102957773013402978856008503112852000903197655001203206IND60672858420221119090302.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067285842DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz051.P04-040-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelayneh, Mehretu10aFood Insecurity, Wasting and Stunting Among Young Children in a Drought Prone Area in South Ethiopia: A Cohort Study (P04-040-19)  aAs many households in Ethiopia are food insecure, seasonal malnutrition could be an important public health problem related to food availability. Ethiopia requires effective community-based nutrition interventions to curb childhood malnutrition. Improving our understanding of the association between the agricultural cycle, rainfall pattern, and malnutrition is important. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the risks of food insecurity, wasting, and stunting among children in households of the Sidama Zone of Ethiopia during different seasons. A cohort study design was employed in the chronically food insecure Boricha area. Data was collected on Pre-harvest season (March and June) and Post-harvest season (September and December) of 2017. Post-harvest season was food plenty season. We studied 935 mothers-child (aged 6 to 47 months) pairs from 894 households. At four seasons over a year, we did 3449 measurement (894 households) and 82% (2816) (95% CI: 80.3–82.9) were food in-secured. Severe food insecurity was higher in March (69%) as compared to 50% of September (X2 = 55.5, P < 0.001). From 3488 measurements, 44% (1533) (95% CI: 42.3–45.6) of children were stunted. Stunting showed seasonal variations with 38% (95% CI: 34.7–41.0) in March and 49% (95% CI: 45.8–52.5) in December (X2 = 22, P < 0.001). Six % (95% CI: 5.0–6.6) of children were wasted, with higher prevalence in March (8%) as compared to 3% of September (X2 = 20, P < 0.001). Multivariate risk analysis showed that wasting was higher among poor households, households with uneducated fathers, food in-secured households, and among children with recent illness. Stunting was higher among poor households and in households with low education. The highest prevalence of wasting and food insecurity occurred in the same season. However, stunting occurred some months after the period with highest prevalence of food insecurity. Such a finding could have implications in evaluating the effect of interventions as the time relationship between food security and acute and chronic malnutrition differs.

This asymmetric cost of reproduction is thought to cause female preference for elaborate male ornamentation. Subsequent co-evolution of female preferences and male ornaments is thought then to lead to a greater preference for conspecific mates in females as compared to males. Thus, female choice is classically assumed to contribute more than male choice to behavioral isolation between sexually dimorphic species. However, this hypothesis fails to account for the cost of maintaining a territory, building a nest, courtship displays, ornament investment, and parental care, as seen in males of the Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens. Here we show that male B. splendens have a greater preference for female conspecifics than females have for male conspecifics, when given a choice between conspecifics and the allopatric Betta imbellis. We hypothesize that in B. splendens, the cost of mating may be higher for males than females, and predict that male choice would contribute to behavioral isolation upon secondary contact of wild populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallopatry 3acoevolution 3acourtship 3afemales 3afish 3amales 3anests 3areproduction 3asexual dimorphism 3asexual selection 0aBehavioral isolation 0aFemale choice 0aMale choice 0aSexual selection1 aMendelson, Tamra C.0 tBehavioural processes.g2018 June, v. 151 p.6-10dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11891x0376-63577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2018.02.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001800159245008300177300001600260500000900276520149200285592002801777650001901805650001401824650001701838650001901855650003001874650001001904650001101914650000901925650002001934650001501954650001601969700001701985700002402002700001902026700001402045773020702059856009402266852000902360655001202369IND60666380820221116190405.0191028e198910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066638082DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1989.00472425001800040024x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarcomini, A.10aBehavior of Aromatic Surfactants and PCBs in Sludge-Treated Soil and Landfills  ap. 523-528.  aepub  aThe aromatic surfactant linear alkylbenzenesulphonate (LAS) and the refractory biointermediates of nonylphenol polyethoxylates (NPEO), namely nonylphenol (NP), nonylphenol monoethoxylate (NP1EO) and nonylphenol diethoxylate (NP2EO), together with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organic carbon (OC), were determined in sludge-treated soil at 19 time intervals during a 1-yr period after sludge application. The initial concentrations of LAS, NP, NP1EO, and NP2EO in the amended soil were 45, 4.7, 1.1 and 0.1 mg/kg (dry wt.); the residual mean concentrations, 320 d after the last sludge application, were 5, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.01 mg/kg for LAS, NP, NP1EO, and NP2EO, respectively. All of the aromatic surfactants demonstrated a very fast decrease in concentration (>80% within the first month), presumably due to biodegradation, but all of them exhibited a residual concentration in the soil after 320 d. Total PCBs and OC showed no significant soil concentration changes, within the error of analysis, over this same 1-yr period. The pattern of PCB congeners also demonstrated no substantial changes, indicating that they all behave very similarly. The LAS and PCBs were also measured in samples from dated ponds of four sludge-only landfills which were in use at different times over the past 30 yr. The increase in the use of LAS and decrease in the open use of PCBs was reflected in the sludge pond concentrations at one site where there was a continuous record from 1972 to 1986.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3alandfills 3anonylphenols 3aorganic carbon 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aponds 3asludge 3asoil 3asoil amendments 3asulfonates 3asurfactants1 aCapel, P.

Wake superposition models such as Linear and Katic produce inconsistent wake predictions that are empirically derived. Designing an explicit cumulative model based on the momentum deficit and thrust budget analysis is not feasible. We use the analytical and machine learning approach to predict and correct inconsistencies between momentum deficits and thrust. The Mass Flow Conservation Superposition (MFCS) model is derived using the Linear Momentum equation, and the Mass Flow and Thrust Conservation Superposition (MFTCS) model is derived by fitting the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model to Large Eddy Simulation (LES) data. Noticeably from our results, the MFCS underestimates the thrust magnitude and the wake recovery rates. The MFTCS model based on the GPR model fit correctly estimates the momentum deficit and thrust balance. The GPR model assesses the smoothness and differentiability of the LES data to predict wake recovery. The MFTCS outperforms Katic and MFCS results but is more accurate than the LES data based on the goodness of fit criteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aequations 3amass flow 3anormal distribution 3atroposphere 3awind 0aWind turbine 0aGaussian process regression 0aWake superposition 0aMomentum deficit 0aWind farm1 aLi, Xuemin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2440-13461 aZhang, Yi1 aXu, Weiming0 tEnergy.g2022 May 01, v. 246 p.123399-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1233993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03988naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006100152245012600213300001400339520216900353592002802522650001202550650002002562650001502582650001402597650001002611650000902621650002602630650002302656650001502679650002602694650002802720650001402748650001102762650001202773650001302785650001002798650001902808650001902827650001802846650001102864650001502875651001702890651001602907653001602923653001802939653002402957653001202981653002602993653002203019700002403041700002303065700001803088700006203106700002303168773007603191856008603267852000903353655001203362IND60531177620221120215239.0160723e20160701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053117762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2016.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYesavage, Tiffany1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9433-763X10aInvestigation of a diabase-derived regolith profile from Pennsylvania: Mineralogy, chemistry and Fe isotope fractionation  ap. 83-97.  aAt Earth's surface, bedrock transforms to regolith in a process that has many implications for water storage, soil formation, and nutrient availability to ecosystems. To understand deep regolith formation, we investigate three zones demarcating changes in mineralogy, chemistry and Fe isotopic composition in a 4-m thick regolith profile developed at a ridge top in Pennsylvania (U.S.A.) that is underlain entirely by diabase. Relative to the unweathered diabase, Zone 1 at the bottom is characterized by major element depletion, abrupt oxidation of Fe(II), a rapid decrease in sulfur concentrations and the presence of short-range ordered (SRO) Fe with depleted δ56Fe values relative to unweathered diabase. We attribute many of the observations at this depth (which we refer to as the lithogenic zone) to the effects of spheroidal weathering, which may be releasing a flux of Fe(II) with low δ56Fe values as the mineral pyroxene is weathered. This Fe(II) is oxidized due to the presence of oxygen at the bottom of the profile and is likely precipitated as isotopically light SRO Fe phases, which then recrystallize with time. Zone 2 is interpreted as a region of crystallization in which minimal bulk chemical changes occur. Finally, SRO Fe isotopic compositions become lighter again near the land surface in Zone 3, the zone of most intense biogenic weathering. Biological Fe weathering likely involves enhanced microbial activity, exudation of protons and organic acids by plant roots and fungi, and plant uptake. This pattern of SRO Fe isotopic variability (with isotopically depleted values both at depth and near the surface) has been observed in another regolith profile on spheroidally weathering bedrock in Puerto Rico. We further used pore-water concentrations and soil chemistry to calculate rates of diabase weathering. While pore-water concentrations yield modern rates, soil chemistry concentrations indicate longer-term rates. The similarity in the diabase dissolution rates using modern pore fluids and soil chemistry is consistent with steady-state weathering. Similar approaches can be applied to other Appalachian soil profiles in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3abedrock 3acrystallization 3aecosystems 3aexudation 3afungi 3airon 3aisotope fractionation 3amicrobial activity 3amineralogy 3anutrient availability 3aorganic acids and salts 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aprotons 3aregolith 3aroots 3asoil chemistry 3asoil formation 3asoil profiles 3asulfur 3aweathering 3aPennsylvania 3aPuerto Rico 0aFe isotopes 0aDeep regolith 0aChemical weathering 0aDiabase 0aSpheroidal weathering 0aPreferential flow1 aStinchcomb, Gary E.1 aFantle, Matthew S.1 aSak, Peter B.1 aKasznel, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4541-89401 aBrantley, Susan L.0 tGeoderma.g2016 July 01, v. 273 p.83-97dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2016.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245018400174300001600358520167300374592002802047650002402075650002302099650001902122650001202141650002202153650001002175650001202185650001502197650001102212650001602223650001502239650000802254650001102262650001002273650001002283650001902293700001802312773010902330856005702439852000902496655001202505IND50066180720221121032753.0130504e197809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006618072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2494.1978.tb00822.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTETLOW, R.

Effect of steam and formic acid on the moisture concentration of lucerne, ryegrass and tall fescue before and after cutting  ap. 213-222.  aFive experiments were conducted to determine the effect of pre‐harvest treatment with steam or formic acid on the moisture concentration (MC) in crops of lucerne, two varieties of perennial ryegrass, tall fescue and Italian ryegrass. In each experiment, plots were treated with a mixture of hot gases and steam (S) or sprayed with an aqueous solution of formic acid (F). In the tall fescue experiment the F treatment was applied to the cut swath but in all other instances the F and S treatments were applied to the swards before cutting and the MC changes after treatment compared with those in untreated cut swaths (W 1). Twenty‐four hours after initial treatment all S plots, and those F plots other than tall fescue, were cut and the subsequent water loss compared with that from (i) untreated material cut at the same time (W 2) and (ii) the W 1 plots cut the previous day. In all five experiments the change in the MC of the S plots was similar to that of the W 1 plots both before and after cutting. The reduction in the MC of the F plots before cutting was less than that of the S and W 1 plots, and in three of the five experiments water loss from cut F plots was apparently restricted in comparison with that from untreated cut material (W2). Neither desiccant treatment showed great promise as a pre‐treatment to cutting for hay making although formic acid may have limited value when a crop is to be harvested directly for silage or artificial dehydration. In an appendix, the efficacy of using accumulated vapour pressure deficit as a basis for comparing the water loss from the untreated cut crops drying under different conditions is demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aLolium multiflorum 3aLolium perenne 3aalfalfa 3aaqueous solutions 3acrops 3acutting 3adesiccants 3adrying 3aformic acid 3aharvesting 3ahay 3asilage 3asteam 3asward 3avapor pressure1 aFENLON, J.

When it comes to residential buildings, the added values of sharing systems are reduced parking space and increased use of solar photovoltaics generation on-site. This work proposes a simple and complete method to define residential building tenants’ optimal investment and operation, switching from car ownership to an e-car-sharing system. A mixed-integer linear optimization framework describes technologies such as battery storages, solar photovoltaics, electric vehicles, and charging stations. Furthermore, different scenarios are defined and simulated in order to investigate and evaluate the economic potential of residential on-site e-car-sharing. It is shown that with the actual grid tariff design in Austria, the integration of bidirectional charging stations is not cost-effective if considering only the Day-Ahead spot market. The results show that integrating an e-car-sharing system in a residential building allows for fewer cars and charging stations with higher nominal power, reducing the annual total costs of the residential building tenants by up to 29%. On the other hand, the results indicate that e-car-sharing systems can also lead to lower optimal installed solar photovoltaic power.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abatteries 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3amarkets 3aownership 3aresidential housing 3asolar energy 3atariffs 3aAustria 0aElectric Vehicle 0aE-Car-sharing systems 0aEnergy modeling 0aInvestment 0aMixed-integer linear programming 0aEnergy management 0aPhotovoltaic 0aBattery storage1 aLettner, Georg1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4921-46701 aAuer, H.q(Hans),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9111-99410 tEnergy.g2022 May 01, v. 246 p.123400-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1234003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007000167300001600237520120600253592002801459650001201487650001101499650002201510650001201532650001901544650001601563650001101579651001301590653001501603653002401618653002101642653002201663700002201685700001701707773008901724856008401813852000901897655001201906IND60600436420221121064618.0180703e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060043642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2014.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirzaei, Ali10aWave energy potential along the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia  ap. 722-734.  aThe wave power potential along the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia was investigated using the 31-year (1979–2009) output simulation of the NOAA WAVEWATCH III™. The result shows strong seasonal fluctuation in which the wave power during winter monsoon is much higher than other seasons. Additionally, the wave power also fluctuates inter-annually due to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). It was revealed that wave power along the northern section of the coast is more energetic than the southern region, with mean annual of 4 and 2.5 kW/m, respectively. The significant difference between the two regions is due to the sheltering effects of the multiple islands. The 5% exceedance values, which represent the highest wave power, range from 8 to 15 kW/m and 1.5 to 4.2 kW/m for the northern and southern sections of the coast, respectively. It was also found that the bulk of the wave energy flux is generated by waves with significant wave height between 1 to 3 m and mean wave energy periods between 6 to 9 s. Generally, with efficient wave energy converters, the renewable wave energy can be viable to be harvested, particularly in the northern region during winter monsoon period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3acoasts 3aenergy conversion 3aislands 3amonsoon season 3awater power 3awinter 3aMalaysia 0aWave power 0aPeninsular Malaysia 0aWAVEWATCH III™ 0aSheltering effect1 aTangang, Fredolin1 aJuneng, Liew0 tEnergy.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 68 p.722-734dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02131naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245008900165246009700254300001600351500001500367520076900382592002801151650001601179650001301195650001101208650001901219650002101238650002501259650002001284650001201304650000901316650001401325650001701339650002301356653002001379700002201399700002001421700001801441700001801459700002201477773011701499856004801616852000901664655001201673IND4469480520221121032621.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446948052DNAL7 a10.1007/s00107-010-0506-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukuta, Satoshi10aBiegeeigenschaften von Pressholz imprägniert mit Phenolharz über gebohrte Löcher3 aBending properties of compressed wood impregnated with phenolic resin through drilled holes  ap. 633-639.  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of drilling on the permeability of Japanese cedar and the bending properties of resin treated compressed wood were examined.

A dye solution permeated the entire specimen when the density of drilled holes exceeded approximately 5000 holes/m2.

This research aims to interpret the multifaceted relationship between social media information and sustainable consumption in terms of food choices, environmental awareness, and consumer information, which is the novel contribution of this study. A survey of 162 individuals in Benevento, Italy, revealed how information from social media is linked to non-sustainable food behaviour. That is, variables that positively affect the probability that information is obtained through social networks are linked to behaviours that could be unsustainable from an environmental perspective. Moreover, among the new findings is the result that social media tends to create homogenised consumption, which, in many cases, is an attitude that depletes the environment. Limitations of this study and the results obtained outline future research directions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer information 3afood choices 3aprobability 3asocial networks 3asurveys 3aItaly 0aSustainable food consumption 0aSocial media 0aSocial network 0aFood choice1 aScarpato, Debora0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Dec. 20, v. 277 p.124036-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1240363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245013600200300002000336520161000356592002801966596010601994596006702100650000802167650002502175650002602200650001502226650001502241650002202256653002302278653003102301653002302332653002002355653002602375700001402401700005402415700005302469700001502522773014202537856007902679852000902758655001202767IND60780142020221121064631.0220615e20220603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078014202DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c068082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Zhuolun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4596-712X10aInvestigating the Influence of Metal–Organic Framework Loading on the Filtration Performance of Electrospun Nanofiber Air Filters  ap. 27096-27106.  aIntegrating metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) into electrospun nanofiber filters has become an effective method for improving particle filtration efficiency. This study hypothesized that there is an optimal amount of MOFs that can be integrated into electrospun nanofiber filters to achieve the maximum particle removal efficiency while minimizing the corresponding MOF synthesis time. To test the hypothesis, this study systematically explored the influence of the time-dependent in situ growing process of zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67), a typical type of MOFs, on the filtration performance of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) electrospun nanofibers. The results show that the surface morphology and chemical composition of the PAN/ZIF-67 hybrid nanofiber filters gradually changed with the reaction time. For PAN/ZIF-67 hybrid nanofiber filters with relatively low initial PM₀.₃–₀.₄ filtration efficiency, a reaction time of only 5 min was sufficient for the synthesis of the amount of ZIF-67 that maximized the PM₀.₃–₀.₄ filtration efficiency. However, for thick filters with high original PM₀.₃–₀.₄ filtration efficiency (>90%), the integration of ZIF-67 was not necessary, because the efficiency enhancement would not be significant. In addition, the enhancement of filtration efficiency for ultrafine particles was positively correlated with the amount of incorporated ZIF-67. In summary, this study shortened the synthesis time of the in situ incorporation of MOFs into electrospun nanofiber filters from more than 10 h (reported in the literature) to only 5 min.  aPublisher supplied data  a14204520cResearch Grants Council, University Grants Committeedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002920  aNAcHong Kong Centre For Logistics Roboticdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aair 3achemical composition 3acoordination polymers 3afiltration 3ananofibers 3apolyacrylonitrile 0aindoor air quality 0ametal−organic frameworks 0aparticulate matter 0aelectrospinning 0afiltration efficiency1 aXiao, Can1 aMo, Jinhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3178-65071 aZhang, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1152-89621 aChen, Chun0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 June 03, v. 14, no. 23 p.27096-27106dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c068083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01749naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010700163300001800270520056800288592002800856650001600884650002500900650002300925650001000948650001400958650001700972650001200989700002101001700002101022700002301043700001601066700001701082700002101099700002601120773013401146856007401280852000901354655001201363IND60699966020221122030123.0200624e20200623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069996602DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc01251c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRudebeck, Elley E.10aMixed alkoxy/hydroxy 1,8-naphthalimides: expanded fluorescence colour palette and in vitro bioactivity  ap. 6866-6869.  aAn efficient and functional group tolerant route to access hydroxy 1,8-naphthalimides has been used to synthesise a range of mono- and disubstituted hydroxy-1,8-naphthalimides with fluorescence emissions covering the visible spectrum.

Improving the flow field is a low-cost method for improving the power of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. This study proposed a new tapered-slope serpentine flow field and studied its performance through visualization experiments and numerical simulations. The results show that compared with conventional serpentine flow field, the tapered-slope serpentine flow field had a uniform distribution of hydrogen and oxygen concentration in the downstream, the pressure drop was reduced by 58.4%, and the maximum power density was increased by 3.75%. The visualization experiments results show that the guiding structure and slope design of U-shaped corner of the tapered-slope serpentine flow field maintained the shape of droplets, limited the splash of droplets when passing a U-shaped corner, and avoided the breakage caused by droplets colliding with the channel wall, the drainage process time is 62.3% less than conventional serpentine flow field. The experimental results of different reaction inlet flow rates found that tapered-slope serpentine flow field has good drainage performance and improves mass transfer. Increasing the flow rates can make the performance of conventional serpentine flow field close to the tapered-slope serpentine flow field.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrainage 3aenergy 3afuel cells 3ahydrogen 3amass transfer 3amathematical models 3aoxygen 3aprocessing time 0aProton exchange membrane fuel cell 0aTapered-slope serpentine flow field 0aNumerical simulation 0aVisualization experiment 0aWater management1 aLiu, Mingxin1 aLi, Xuan1 aGuo, Xiaoyu1 aWang, Tongying1 aLi, Songwei1 aLei, Han0 tEnergy.g2022 May 01, v. 246 p.123406-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1234063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
