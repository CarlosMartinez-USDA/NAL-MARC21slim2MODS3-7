Column experiments were performed to: (1) evaluate the overall NH₄⁺–N removal performance of the proposed multibarrier, (2) investigate nitrogen transformation in the three zones, (3) determine the reaction front progress, and (4) explore cleanup mechanisms for inorganic nitrogens. The results showed that NH₄⁺–N percent removal by the multibarrier increased up to 90.43 % after 21 pore volumes (PVs) at the influent dissolved oxygen of 0.68∼2.45 mg/L and pH of 6.76∼7.42. NH₄⁺–N of 4.06∼10.49 mg/L was depleted and NO ₓ ⁻–N (i.e., NO₃⁻–N + NO₂⁻–N) of 4.26∼9.63 mg/L was formed before 98 PVs in the ORC zone. NH₄⁺–N of ≤4.76 mg/L was eliminated in the clinoptilolite zone. NO ₓ ⁻–N of 10.44∼12.80 mg/L was lost before 21 PVs in the spongy iron zone. The clinoptilolite zone length should be reduced to 30 cm. Microbial nitrification played a dominant role in NH₄⁺–N removal in the ORC zone. Ion exchange was majorly responsible for NH₄⁺–N elimination in the clinoptilolite zone. Chemical reduction and hydrogenotrophic denitrification both contributed to NO ₓ ⁻–N transformation, but the chemical reduction capacity decreased after 21 PVs in the spongy iron.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3achemical reduction 3adenitrification 3adissolved oxygen 3agroundwater 3aion exchange 3airon 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3apH 3aremediation1 aLiu, Fei1 aYang, Yingzhao1 aKong, Xiangke1 aLi, Shengpin1 aZhang, Ying1 aCao, Dejun0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2015 Mar., v. 22, no. 5 p.3705-3714dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3602-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03543naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245022100195300001800416500002000434520168800454592002802142596006702170596006102237650002802298650001902326650001402345650001602359650001802375650001302393650001802406650003602424650001202460650001202472650001902484650001702503650002002520650001402540650001302554700005402567700005102621700005102672700005802723700005702781773012802838856007402966852000903040655001203049IND60792813020221120162327.0220909e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079281302DNAL7 a10.1002/tox.236132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Huijie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0661-132310aSelenium deficiency aggravates bisphenol A‐induced autophagy in chicken kidney through regulation of nitric oxide and adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway  ap. 2503-2514.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBisphenol A (BPA), a phenolic compound, is harmful to humans and animals as its residue in the water threatens multiple organs, especially the kidney. Low selenium (Se) diets are consumed in many regions of the world, and poor Se status has exacerbating effect on toxicity of several environmental chemicals. Here, we described the discovery path of Se deficiency aggravation on autophagy in BPA treated chicken kidney through regulating nitric oxide (NO) and adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways. The actual dietary Se intake for chickens was 0.30 mg/kg in control group and 0.03 mg/kg in Low‐Se group, and BPA exposure concentration for chickens was 0.05 g/kg. Chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells were used in vitro and the BPA exposure concentration for CEK cells was 150 nM. We found that BPA significantly increased levels of NO and inducible nitric oxide synthase, activated AMPK/mTOR signaling pathways, thereby triggering p62/LC3/Beclin1 signaling, resulting in formations of autophagosome and autolysosome, and finally stimulating autophagy in the chicken kidney. Additionally, Se deficiency promoted the occurrence of autophagy in BPA‐treated kidneys. Altogether, our findings showed that Se deficiency exacerbates BPA‐induced renal autophagy in chickens via regulation of NO and AMPK/mTOR signaling pathways. These findings will improve our understandings of the mechanisms of nephrotoxicity of BPA and detoxification by Se in chickens. In addition, further work is required to determine if Se status of exposed populations needs to be considered in future epidemiological assessments.  aPublisher supplied data  a20200009cJilin Agricultural Science and Technology University  cKey Subject of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Ph.D 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aautophagosomes 3aautophagy 3abisphenol A 3achick embryos 3achickens 3aecotoxicology 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3akidneys 3amammals 3anephrotoxicity 3anitric oxide 3aprotein kinases 3arapamycin 3aselenium1 aZhang, Yue1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7065-602X1 aQi, Xue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2429-95911 aShi, Xu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6549-33311 aHuang, Xiaodan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4501-76421 aXu, Shi‐Wen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3624-24100 tEnvironmental toxicology.g2022 Oct., v. 37, no. 10 p.2503-2514dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl57773x1520-40817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tox.236133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02561naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245016600164300002000330520152200350592002801872650001501900650001601915650001301931650001901944650001201963650002601975650001402001650001202015773012902027856008202156852000902238655001202247IND60579779720221120231348.0170831e20170831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057977972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b068882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuibasset, J.10aAdsorption-Induced Deformation of a Nanoporous Material: Influence of the Fluid–Adsorbent Interaction and Surface Freezing on the Pore-Load Modulus Measurement  ap. 18779-18788.  aLiquid adsorption in nanoporous materials induces their deformation due to strong capillary and disjoining forces. The linear relationship between the liquid pressure and the solid strain (pore-load modulus) provides an experimental technique to determine the mechanical properties of nanosized solids. Puzzling experimental results have often been reported, leading to a severe reconsideration of the mechanical properties of the thin walls, the introduction of surface stresses, and the suggestion of a mutual influence of fluid adsorption and matrix deformation. This work presents a molecular simulation examination of the fundamentals of the pore-load measurement technique. The pore-load protocol is reproduced as in experiments by measuring the solid deformation in the presence of the liquid (“numerical experiment”), and the result is compared with the expected mechanical response of the solid. Focusing on a single nanoplatelet mimicking silicon stiffness, we show that the pore-load protocol is valid as long as the liquid in the pores remains liquid. However, when an ordered layer can form at the solid surface, it significantly affects the pore-load measurement. It is shown that this may happen above the freezing point even for moderately strong fluid–solid interactions. This observation could help for the interpretation of experimental data, in particular, in porous silicon, where the expected presence of atomically smooth surfaces could favor the formation of highly ordered fluid layers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adeformation 3afreezing 3afreezing point 3aliquids 3amechanical properties 3ananopores 3asilicon0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Aug. 31, v. 121, no. 34 p.18779-18788dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.7b068883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002200137245009500159300001800254520176600272592002802038650001802066650002402084650002302108650001902131650001102150650001102161650002702172650001702199650002202216650001602238650001202254650001602266700002202282700002302304700001602327700001702343700002302360773010502383856004002488852000902528655001202537IND4467456820221120213315.0121002e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446745682DNAL7 a10.1111/fwb.120042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFERNANDES, ISABEL10aHigher temperature reduces the effects of litter quality on decomposition by aquatic fungi  ap. 2306-2317.  a1. We investigated the effects of riparian plant diversity (species number and identity) and temperature on microbially mediated leaf decomposition by assessing fungal biodiversity, fungal reproduction and leaf mass loss. 2. Leaves of five riparian plant species were first immersed in a stream to allow microbial colonisation and were then exposed, alone or in all possible combinations, at 16 or 24 °C in laboratory microcosms. 3. Fungal biodiversity was reduced by temperature but was not affected by litter diversity. Temperature altered fungal community composition with species of warmer climate, such as Lunulospora curvula, becoming dominant. 4. Fungal reproduction was affected by litter diversity, but not by temperature. Fungal reproduction in leaf mixtures did not differ or was lower than that expected from the weighted sum of fungal sporulation on individual leaf species. At the higher temperature, the negative effect of litter diversity on fungal reproduction decreased with the number of leaf species. 5. Leaf mass loss was affected by the identity of leaf mixtures (i.e. litter quality), but not by leaf species number. This was mainly explained by the negative correlation between leaf decomposition and initial lignin concentration of leaves. 6. At 24 °C, the negative effects of lignin on microbially mediated leaf decomposition diminished, suggesting that higher temperatures may weaken the effects of litter quality on plant litter decomposition in streams. 7. The reduction in the negative effects of lignin at the higher temperature resulted in an increased microbially mediated litter decomposition, which may favour invertebrate‐mediated litter decomposition leading to a depletion of litter stocks in streams.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic fungi 3acommunity structure 3afungal communities 3aglobal warming 3aleaves 3alignin 3amicrobial colonization 3aplant litter 3aspecies diversity 3asporulation 3astreams 3atemperature1 aPASCOAL, CLÁUDIA1 aGUIMARÃES, HELENA1 aPINTO, RUTE1 aSOUSA, INÊS1 aCássio, Fernanda,0 tFreshwater biology.g2012 Nov., v. 57, no. 11 p.2306-2317dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12004  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245011300177300001600290506011700306506007600423520118400499592002801683506003701711650002601748650001301774650001901787650001501806650001401821650000701835650001301842650001301855650001501868650001101883650001101894650001601905650001701921653002301938653004201961653002102003653002502024653000702049700003202056700001902088700002102107700001802128700001802146700003002164773018502194856008402379852000902463655001202472IND60772536820221207101056.0220719e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077253682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aiepr.2022.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParmar, Bhavani Shanker10aStudy of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals in chlorobutyl rubber-based model truck inner tube compound  ap. 171-182.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis paper describes the effects of various alkali metal and alkaline earth metal compounds, as well as walnut shell ash (WNS ash), on the cure characteristics (ts₂, tc₉₀) of a chlorobutyl rubber (CIIR)-based heat resistance truck inner tube compound. We observed that CIIR-F (KOH) has a very high scorch safety and a very slow cure. As it is a strong base with a high pH (13.84), it cures very slowly. Despite having a pH of 10.6, a ts₂ of 6.36, and a tc₉₀ of 18.84 min, CIIR-D (CaCO₃) cures faster than CIIR-A (blank). The ts₂ and tc₉₀ values for CIIR-A (blank) were 6.55 and 18.88 min, respectively. Except for CIIR-D (CaCO₃), all of the materials used to have higher scorch safety (ts₂) and optimum cure time (tc₉₀) in rheometer than CIIR-A (blank). CIIR-C (BaCO₃) performed nearly as well as a blank. This study revealed that the trend of cure characteristics (ts₂, tc₉₀) in rheometer and Mooney scorch (t₅) in Mooney viscometer not only depends on pH but also depends on ionic radius, ionization enthalpy and oxidation number of alkali metal and alkaline earth metal and the type of compound of alkali metal and alkaline earth metal.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalkaline earth metals 3aenthalpy 3aheat tolerance 3aionization 3aoxidation 3apH 3apolymers 3aresearch 3arheometers 3arubber 3ascorch 3aviscometers 3awalnut hulls 0aChlorobutyl rubber 0aAlkali metal and alkaline earth metal 0aWalnut shell ash 0aCure characteristics 0apH1 aChauhan, Narendra Pal Singh1 aJadoun, Sapana1 aDeuri, Arup Saha1 aVaidya, Dilip1 aRahdar, Abbas1 aChundawat, Narendra Singh0 tAdvanced industrial and engineering polymer research.g2022 July, v. 5, no. 3 p.171-182dElsevier B.V.aKingfa Scientific and Technological Co.

The analysis was performed using three linked data sets: the 2004–2005 Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring Survey (PRAMS); its longitudinal follow-up, 2006–2007 Oregon PRAMS-2; and 2004–2005 Oregon birth certificates. PRAMS is a surveillance programme supported by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and implemented by participating state health departments. Using mixed methods, PRAMS surveys women 2–6 months after a live birth. Oregon PRAMS-2 re-interviews respondents shortly after the index child's second birthday. Oregon PRAMS oversamples minority women. Using monthly cohorts, we randomly selected 5851 women from the 2004–2005 birth certificates. In total 1911 women completed both PRAMS and PRAMS-2. The weighted response rate of PRAMS-2 was 43·5 %. Almost half of mothers (49·9 %) reported that their child drank SSB on at least 1 d/week. Mothers whose children drank SSB at least once weekly were more likely to have low income (adjusted OR = 2·83, 95 % CI 2·09, 3·83) and to eat out on ≥2 d/week (OR = 2·11 %, 95 % CI 1·66, 2·70). Hispanic and non-Hispanic black women were most likely to report that their child drank SSB at least once weekly. Half of mothers reported that their 2-year-old children drank SSB at least once weekly. Public health interventions and policies should address childhood SSB consumption including educating health-care providers and parents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlacks 3aCenters for Disease Control and Prevention 3aHispanics 3abeverages 3achildhood 3achildren 3adata collection 3ahealth services 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3amonitoring 3amothers 3apregnancy 3apublic health 3arisk assessment 3arisk factors 3asurveys 3awomen 3aOregon 0aSoda 0aSugar-sweetened beverages 0aChild 0aPRAMS 0aOregon1 aRosenberg, Kenneth D1 aMorris, Daniel S0 tPublic health nutrition.g2013 Oct., v. 16, no. 10 p.1760-1767dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800120043993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072000900159100001600168245009500184300001800279500002400297500001500321520140200336650001001738650002301748650001001771650002301781650002601804650001401830650002201844650001201866650002501878650002201903650001101925650002801936650001101964650003801975650001402013650003702027650007002064650007102134650006802205650002802273653001302301653001902314700001602333700001902349700001402368773012302382852000902505856008002514930003302594945002502627946001302652655001202665IND4431575520221118015700.0100122e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443157552DNAL7 a199606932pmid7 a10.1603/033.046.06272doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8211 aLysyk, T.J.10aInducing Active and Passive Immunity in Sheep to Paralysis Caused by Dermacentor andersoni  ap. 1436-1441.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aArcott sheep were evaluated as a model for studying active and passive immunity to tick paralysis caused by Dermacentor andersoni (Stiles). The incidence of tick paralysis in sheep increased from 0 at doses < or = 0.33 ticks per kg to 100% at > or = 0.8 ticks per kg. The dose required for 50% paralysis was 0.42 ticks per kg. Expressing dose as a ratio of initial ticks per unit body weight removed differences in response due to sheep weight. The interval from infestation to paralysis decreased from >12 d at 0.4 ticks per kg to <8 d at 1.3 ticks per kg. After exposure to a paralyzing doses of ticks, the incidence of paralysis varied among sheep that were naive (six of six, 100% paralysis), previously paralyzed (zero of six, 0% paralysis), and passively immunized with an intravenous treatment of 300 ml of serum from immune cattle (two of six, 33% paralysis). Sheep that were actively immunized by previous exposure had antibodies to a greater number of tick salivary antigens compared with those that were not immune. Antibodies to a 43.3-kDa antigen had 72% agreement with immunity to paralysis, and a sensitivity and specificity of 0.60 and 0.88, respectively. In conclusion, previously paralyzed sheep had developed antibodies against D. andersoni and were not susceptible to subsequent paralysis, whereas passive immunization conferred protection against paralysis in only some sheep. 3aticks 3aantibody formation 3asheep 3aantibody detection 3aDermacentor andersoni 3aparalysis 3adisease incidence 2aAnimals 2aAntigensximmunology 2aBlotting, Western 2aCattle 2aDermacentorximmunology 2aFemale 2aImmunization, Passivexveterinary 2aIncidence 2aSheepximmunologyxparasitology. 2aSheep Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitologyxprevention & control. 2aTick Infestationsxepidemiologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aTick Paralysisxepidemiologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aVaccinationxveterinary 0aimmunity 0atick paralysis1 aVeira, D.M.1 aKastelic, J.P.1 aMajak, W.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2009 Nov., v. 46, no. 6 p.1436-1441dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/033.046.06273Available from publisher's Web site  a20100323b20100403c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/02/24  aOther US 7aarticle02679naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245012200172300001400294520125200308592002801560650001201588650001501600650002601615650002101641650001901662650001501681650001801696650001301714650003501727650003001762653002301792653003601815653004501851653004301896653002401939653002501963700002101988700002002009700001902029773009402048856008202142852000902224655001202233IND60553389820221121050222.0161021e20141115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055338982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2014.04.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErmini, Maria Laura10aBioanalytical approaches for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms by Surface Plasmon Resonance biosensors  ap. 28-37.  aThe mapping of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in patients׳ genome is a main goal in theranostics, aiming to the development of therapies based on personalized medicine.In this review, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and Surface Plasmon Resonance imaging (SPRi) biosensors applied to the recognition of SNPs were reviewed, since these technologies are emerging in clinical diagnosis as powerful tools thanks to their analytical features, mainly the real-time and label-free monitoring based on array format for parallel analysis.Since the literature is heterogeneous, a critical classification and a systemic comparison of the analytical performances of published methods were here reviewed on the basis of the analytical strategy and the assay design. In particular, the use of helping agents (i.e. proteins, nanoparticles (NPs), intercalating agents) or artificial DNAs, often coupled to SPR to achieve allele discrimination and/or enhanced sensitivity, were here revised and classified.Finally, the real suitability of SPR biosensors to clinical diagnostics for SNPs detection was addressed by comparing their features and performances with those of other biosensors based on other techniques (e.g. electrochemical biosensors).  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3abiosensors 3adiagnostic techniques 3aelectrochemistry 3aimage analysis 3amonitoring 3ananoparticles 3aproteins 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aOptical biosensors 0aSurface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) 0aSurface Plasmon Resonance imaging (SPRi) 0aSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 0aNanoparticles (NPs) 0aClinical diagnostics1 aMariani, Stefano1 aScarano, Simona1 aMinunni, Maria0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2014 Nov. 15, v. 61 p.28-37dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2014.04.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011600168520175200284592002802036653002402064653002002088653001102108653002102119700001602140700001202156700001502168700001702183700005502200773010902255856008602364852000902450655001202459IND60674196220221118144155.0191227e20200205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067419622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1089492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChe, Yuzhang10aEnhanced tolerance of the transgenic potato plants overexpressing Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase to low temperature  aLow temperature stress is one of the major factors for damage in plants, especially in food crops. Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase plays an important role in the processes of scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by environmental stresses. In order to study transgenic potato plants whether improved tolerance to low temperature, in this research, StSOD1 gene was overexpressed under the control of CaMV 35S promoter through Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation in potato. The results showed that after 4 °C treatment for 48 h, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity of the transgenic potato lines (OE lines) overexpressing StSOD1 was 1.38-fold enhanced compared to the non-transgenic plants (NT lines). On the other hand, the activity of the transgenic potato lines (RNAi lines) that inhibiting expression of StSOD1 decreased compared with NT lines. In addition, the effect of increased SOD activity on lipid peroxidation was determined by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in plants during cold treatment. The result showed that MDA content increased by 2.02-fold and 1.78-fold in NT lines and RNAi lines after 4 °C treatment for 48 h, respectively. In contrast, the OE lines showed only small changes and were lower than the NT lines. Meanwhile, the activity of peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) were also enhanced in OE lines compared with NT lines after cold treatment. Through observing the phenotype, importantly, this research found that the leaves of NT lines and RNAi lines have wilted severely while the OE lines were slightly affected. In all, these results indicated that genetic engineering technology could be used to regulate the antioxidant enzymes activity in plants to improve tolerance to cold stress.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAntioxidant enzymes 0aLow temperature 0aPotato 0aTransgenic plant1 aZhang, Ning1 aZhu, Xi1 aLi, Shigui1 aWang, Shulin1 aSi, Huaijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3814-02470 tScientia horticulturae.g2020 Feb. 05, v. 261 p.108949-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1089493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245009200172520114200264592002801406650001501434650001501449650003101464650002101495650002401516650001901540650000901559650001301568650002801581650000701609650003401616650002301650650001701673650001501690650001101705653003001716653001501746653003801761653002801799653002901827700001601856700001801872700001901890700002001909773013401929856008802063852000902151655001202160IND60689003220221119150125.0201216e20200720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068900322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1386262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ruiming10aAdsorption of perfluorooctane sulfonate on carbonized poly-melamine-formaldehyde sponge  aIn this study, we developed a simple carbonized poly-melamine-formaldehyde sponge (CMF) acting as an adsorbent for adsorbing perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) from the waste poly-melamine-formaldehyde (MF) sponge. The PFOS removal by the developed adsorbent was comprehensively investigated using batch adsorption, including kinetics, isotherm, ionic strength and ionic type and pH edge. PFOS adsorption kinetics followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and reached equilibrium within 3 min. The adsorption isotherm was well described by the Freundlich model, as well as by the Langmuir model at a low initial concentration. The adsorption capacity gradually decreased with the increase of pH, and it was up to 216.4 μg/g even at pH 12.1. However, the adsorption capacity increased with the increase in ionic strength. Furthermore, the co-existing ions and small organic acids also promoted the PFOS adsorption on CMF sponge to different extents. Both the hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic attraction played an important role on adsorption, as well as chemical interaction and hydrogen bonding from spectroscopic results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobic bonding 3aionic strength 3aions 3akinetics 3aorganic acids and salts 3apH 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3asorption isotherms 3aspectroscopy 3asulfonates 3awastes 0aPerfluorooctane Sulfonate 0aAdsorption 0aPoly-melamine-formaldehyde sponge 0aHydrophobic interaction 0aElectrostatic attraction1 aHu, Zhibiao1 aWei, Huanhuan1 aZhang, Shujuan1 aMeng, Xiaoguang0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 July 20, v. 727 p.138626-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1386263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245005200161500001900213520114200232592002801374650001801402650001501420650002001435650002001455650001701475650002401492650001901516651001101535651002501546653002101571653001701592653001301609653001901622653001501641653001501656653001101671653001401682653001801696700002501714700001901739700001801758773011301776856007601889852000901965655001201974IND60730310720221121072532.0210308e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073031072DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.4.e100842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGkelis, Spyros10aCyanobacteria of Greece: an annotated checklist  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe checklist of Greek Cyanobacteria was created in the framework of the Greek Taxon Information System (GTIS), an initiative of the LifeWatchGreece Research Infrastructure (ESFRI) that has resumed efforts to compile a complete checklist of species reported from Greece. This list was created from exhaustive search of the scientific literature of the last 60 years. All records of taxa known to occur in Greece were taxonomically updated. The checklist of Greek Cyanobacteria comprises 543 species, classified in 130 genera, 41 families, and 8 orders. The orders Synechococcales and Oscillatoriales have the highest number of species (158 and 153 species, respectively), whereas these two orders along with Nostocales and Chroococcales cover 93% of the known Greek cyanobacteria species. It is worth mentioning that 18 species have been initially described from Greek habitats. The marine epilithic Ammatoideaaegea described from Saronikos Gulf is considered endemic to this area. Our bibliographic review shows that Greece hosts a high diversity of cyanobacteria, suggesting that the Mediterranean area is also a hot spot for microbes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChroococcales 3aNostocales 3aOscillatoriales 3aSynechococcales 3abiodiversity 3ainformation systems 3ainfrastructure 3aGreece 3aMediterranean region 0ablue-green algae 0aCyanophyceae 0abacteria 0amicroorganisms 0aAegean Sea 0afreshwater 0amarine 0achecklist 0aMediterranean1 aOurailidis, Iordanis1 aPanou, Manthos1 aPappas, Nikos0 tBiodiversity data journal.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 4 p.e10084-dPensoft PublisherswJournal:21364x1314-28287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.4.e100843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006300155245014500218300001600363520118200379592002801561650001701589650001401606650001501620650001401635650001001649650001901659651001101678653002201689653002201711653001601733700003801749700003401787700003301821700002201854700007601876700003301952773007701985856008902062852000902151655001202160IND60556751820221120151303.0161102e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055675182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.09.1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Bianca Sung Mi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2186-376410aUse of a chemometric tool to establish the regional background and assess trace metal enrichment at Baixada Santista – southeastern Brazil  ap. 372-379.  aThe trace metals in sediments consist of two components, anthropogenic and lithogenic or natural, which can cause misinterpretations for what actually exists in sediments. Normally, to investigate trace metal background levels, indices are applied in order to normalize the values and reduce natural variability, but it is well known that using the average shale or crust content is not the best choice and vertical sediment profiles are not always available. The purpose of this study is to use a prediction interval to assess metal enrichment without a reference level and to assess a regional background level using the same tool. The levels of eight elements were submitted to a partial digestion technique and analyzed by ICP-OES. The enrichment factor results suggested that using background values from the prediction interval and using values from vertical sediment profiles yield statistically similar results. Furthermore, the background equations present more realistic data than other methods because they consider the mud content of the samples. Thus, a prediction interval can be a useful tool to establish a regional background and assess trace metal enrichment.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemometrics 3aequations 3aprediction 3asediments 3ashale 3atrace elements 3aBrazil 0aEnrichment factor 0aBackground values 0aHeavy metal1 aAngeli, José Lourenço Friedmann1 aFerreira, Paulo Alves de Lima1 aSartoretto, Juliê Rosemberg1 aMiyoshi, Carolina1 ade Mahiques, Michel Michaelovich1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5249-56101 aFigueira, Rubens Cesar Lopes0 tChemosphere.g2017 Jan., v. 166 p.372-379dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.09.1323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05036naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245012400204300001200328506007600340520300000416592002803416596005403444506003703498650001403535650001303549650001903562650001503581650001803596650001303614650002603627650001503653650001203668650002003680650001003700650001903710650001103729650002303740650001203763650001803775650001603793650001803809650001303827650001303840650001503853650001203868650002203880650001303902650002303915650001803938650001603956650002103972650001503993651001704008700001704025700001504042700001904057700001504076700001604091700001604107773011204123856008204235852000904317655001204326IND60557977920221207125412.0190220e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055797792DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-016-1854-12doi7 aPMC50940132pmcid7 a278067302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHidalgo, K.10aComparative physiological plasticity to desiccation in distinct populations of the malarial mosquito Anopheles coluzzii  ap. 565.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: In West Africa, populations of the malaria vector mosquito, Anopheles coluzzii, are seasonally exposed to strong desiccating conditions during the dry season. Their dynamics strictly follows the pace of the availability of suitable larval development sites (water collections). Accordingly, mosquitoes can reproduce all year long where permanent breeding is possible, or stop reproduction and virtually disappear at the onset of the dry season when surface water dries up, like observed in temporary habitats of dry savannah areas. This highlights the strong adaptive abilities of this mosquito species, which relies at least in part, upon physiological and molecular mechanisms of specific signatures. METHODS: Here, we analysed a range of physiological and molecular responses expressed by geographically different populations of An. coluzzii inhabiting permanent and temporary breeding sites from the north and the south-west of Burkina Faso. Four mosquito colonies, namely (i) Oursi, built from females breeding in permanent habitats of the north; (ii) Déou, from temporary northern habitats; (iii) Soumousso from south-western temporary breeding sites; and (iv) Bama, from permanent habitats of the same south-western zone, were reared in climatic chambers under contrasted environmental conditions, mimicking temperature, relative humidity and light regimen occurring in northern Burkina Faso. Female mosquitoes were analysed for the seasonal variation in their amounts of proteins, triglycerides and free-circulating metabolites. The expression level of genes coding for the adipokinetic (AKH-I) and the AKH/corazonin-related peptides (ACP) were also assessed and compared among populations and environmental conditions. RESULTS: Our analysis did not reveal an apparent pattern of physiological and molecular variations strictly correlated with either the larval ecotype or the geographical origin of the mosquitoes. However, specific distinct responses were observed among populations, suggesting that dry season survival may rely on more complex ecological parameters at a micro-habitat scale. Interestingly, the physiological and molecular data support the hypothesis that different aestivation abilities exist among populations of An. coluzzii inhabiting contrasted ecological settings. In particular, the striking metabotypes differentiation and the AKH mRNA expression level observed in females from temporary northern populations may suggest the existence of a “strong” aestivation strategy in these specimens. CONCLUSION: Our work provides insights into the physiological and molecular basis of dry and rainy season responses in An. coluzzii, and highlights the important diversity of the mechanisms involved. Such results represent key data for understanding the ecophysiological mechanisms underpinning the strong adaptive potential of this malaria vector species, which undoubtedly contributes to the spreading of mosquito distribution areas in space and time.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR-08-MIEN-006cAgence Nationale de la Recherche0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles 3abreeding 3abreeding sites 3adry season 3aecophysiology 3aecotypes 3aenvironmental factors 3aestivation 3afemales 3agene expression 3agenes 3ainsect vectors 3alarvae 3alarval development 3amalaria 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolites 3amicrohabitats 3apeptides 3aproteins 3aprovenance 3arearing 3arelative humidity 3asavannas 3aseasonal variation 3asurface water 3atemperature 3atriacylglycerols 3awet season 3aBurkina Faso1 aSiaussat, D.1 aBraman, V.1 aDabiré, K.

In this paper, the possibility of portable Raman system-based surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for a rapid detection of deoxynivalenol (DON) a mycotoxin in cereals was investigated. Under an optimized condition, SERS analysis for pure DON solution has a wide dynamic concentration range from 10−7M to 10−2M with the limit of detection (LOD) down to 100nM. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis at the level of B3LYP/6-311++G(d, p) was also preformed for vibrational assignment. For practical application, the LOD of the proposed Raman method for both DON-contaminated corns and kidney beans were validated as 10−6M and the LOD for DON-contaminated oats was 10−4M. As a perspective, the SERS-based technology could be developed into an alternatively promising assay for on-field detection of DON residues at various cereals due to it high sensitivity and selectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3adensity functional theory 3adeoxynivalenol 3adetection limit 3akidney beans 3aoats 3arapid methods 3arisk 0aAgNPs 0aSurface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) 0aDeoxynivalenol1 aSun, Chuanwen1 aGuo, Xiaoyu1 aYang, Tianxi1 aWang, Hui1 aFu, Shuyue1 aLi, Chuanchuan1 aYang, Haifeng0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 221 p.797-802dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.11.1013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002800166245011200194300001600306520143000322592002801752650002701780650001201807650001601819650002101835650001401856650001301870650001701883650001201900650002301912650001401935650003701949650001901986653002702005653002202032653002402054653002502078653002702103653003002130700002402160773011602184856008202300852000902382655001202391IND60519331020221121042653.0190730e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051933102DNAL7 a269355292pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820160002752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aALDEYARBI, HEBATALLA M.14aThe fine structure of sexual stage development and sporogony of Cryptosporidium parvum in cell-free culture  ap. 749-761.  aThe sexual stages and new oocysts development of Cryptosporidium parvum were investigated in a cell-free culture system using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Sexual development was extremely rapid after inoculation of oocysts into the medium. The process began within 1/2–12 h and was completed with new oocyst formation 120 h post-inoculation. The macrogamonts were bounded by two membranes and had amylopectin granules and two distinct types of wall-forming bodies. The microgamonts had a large nucleus showing lobe projections and condensation of chromatin, giving rise to peripherally budding microgametes. The microgametes contained a large area of granular substance containing groups of microtubules surrounding the electron-dense nucleus. In some instances, the dividing microgamy was observed in cell-free cultures with no preceding merogonic process. Fertilization was observed with the bullet-shaped microgamete penetrating an immature macrogamont at 24 and 216 h. The new thin- and thick-walled oocysts had a large residuum with polysaccharide granules and sporogony noted inside these oocysts. Novel immature four-layer walled thick oocysts with irregular knob-like protrusions on the outer layer resembling the immature Eimeria oocysts were also observed. The present study confirms the gametogony and sporogony of C. parvum in cell-free culture and describes their ultra-structure for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium parvum 3aEimeria 3aamylopectin 3acell free system 3achromatin 3agranules 3amicrotubules 3aoocysts 3asexual development 3asporogony 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure 0aHost cell-free culture 0asexual life cycle 0athin-walled oocysts 0athick-walled oocysts 0aimmature thick oocysts 0aextracellular development1 aKARANIS, PANAGIOTIS0 tParasitology.g2016 May, v. 143, no. 6 p.749-761dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820160002753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245015400158300001800312520140600330592002801736650001301764650001401777650002601791650002201817650001601839650001301855650001201868650000901880650002401889650001901913650001201932650001301944650001101957650004401968650001402012650001302026650001702039650001202056650001902068650001602087650001602103700001802119700001802137773013302155856007502288852000902363655001202372IND60537644220221120145018.0160809e20130227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053764422DNAL7 a10.1021/ie302656d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSen, Pratik K.10aEffects of Microheterogeneous Environments of SDS, TX-100, and Tween 20 on the Electron Transfer Reaction between l-Leucine and AuCl4–/AuCl3(OH)−  ap. 2803-2813.  aThe effect of an ionic (SDS) and two nonionic (TX-100 and Tween 20) surfactants on the electron transfer reaction between l-leucine and gold(III) complexes has been investigated in acetate buffer. H⁺, Cl–, and decreasing dielectric constant of the medium have inhibiting effects on the reaction rate. The reaction product has been identified as isovaleraldehyde by ¹H NMR. Two different Au(III) species and the zwitterion form of the amino acid react where Au(III) undergoes a one step two-electron transfer process. In the presence of surfactants, the postmicellar kinetics has been explained in the light of Berezin’s model where both the oxidant and the substrate are solubilized in the micellar pseudophase and then react. The leucine molecules occupy the hydrophobic core of the micelle with the polar amino and acid groups projected in the Stern/palisade layer among the surfactant head-groups and the oxidant species. The binding constants for substrate–micelle association and the corresponding enthalpy changes have been evaluated. The hydrophobic interaction of leucine with SDS micelles is greater than those with Tween 20 and TX-100 micelles. The compensation between substrate–water interaction and substrate–micelle interaction determines the enthalpy change for the substrate–micelle association. Entropy change for (Leu)W → (Leu)M controls substrate–micelle binding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3achlorides 3adielectric properties 3aelectron transfer 3aengineering 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3agold 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aleucine 3amicelles 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoctoxynol 3aoxidants 3apolysorbates 3aprotons 3asolubilization 3asurfactants 3azwitterions1 aGani, Nasimul1 aPal, Biswajit0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2013 Feb. 27, v. 52, no. 8 p.2803-2813dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie302656d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006500139245010400204300001600308500002000324520143600344592002801780596003601808596005401844596002101898596005801919596004201977596004202019650001402061650001502075650000902090650001102099650001102110650001802121700002102139700003002160700002602190700006402216700002302280700007702303773012002380856007302500852000902573655001202582IND60742143020221116185839.0210623e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074214302DNAL7 a10.1111/faf.125522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiron‐Nava, Alfredo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3433-925110aSustainable fisheries are essential but not enough to ensure well‐being for the world’s fishers  ap. 812-821.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEffective fisheries management is necessary for the long‐term sustainability of fisheries and the economic benefits that they provide, but focusing only on ecological sustainability risks disregarding ultimate goals related to well‐being that must be achieved through broader social policy. An analysis of global landings data shows that average fishing wages in 36%–67% of countries, home to 69%–95% of fishers worldwide, are likely below their nationally determined minimum living wage (which accounts for costs of food, shelter, clothing, health and education). Furthermore, even if all fisheries in every country were perfectly managed to achieve their Maximum Sustainable Yield, a common sustainability target, average incomes of fishers in up to 49 countries—70% of fishers worldwide—would still not meet minimum living wages. Access to decent work and livelihoods are fundamental human rights, including for all fisherfolk around the world, and strategies to support their well‐being must therefore integrate a much wider set of perspectives, disciplines and institutions. Key first steps for fisheries researchers are to more fully recognize and estimate fisheries benefits to households—including income from women and/or alternative employment, unreported landings, or shadow values of subsistence catch—and to help identify and learn from economic equity outcomes in rebuilt fisheries around the world.  aPublisher supplied data  cPEGASuS Program of Future Earth  cGordon and Betty Moore Foundation Science Program  cNOMIS Foundation  cAmerican Geographical Society as an EthicalGEO Fellow  cWalter Munk Foundation for the Oceans  cNippon Foundation Ocean Nexus Program 3aeducation 3aemployment 3afish 3ahumans 3aincome 3apublic policy1 aLam, Vicky W.

SRpf acclimation significantly improved combined removal of phenol and nutrients. Moreover, the Illumina high-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that the SRpf boosted bacteria diversity, which enhanced the stability of the system under phenol stress. Addition of SRpf increased the abundances of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria phyla which are involved in nutrient and phenol removal. Specifically, SRpf promoted Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira which participate in nitrification, family Comamonadaceae, genera Dechloromonas and Pseudomonas involved in denitrification, and Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and Rhodocyclus which remove phosphorus elements. Moreover, the abundances of Bacillus and Klebsiella responsible for phenol removal as well as Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter were significantly increased after SRpf acclimation. These results show that SBR combined with SRpf acclimation provide optimal nutrient and phenol removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aComamonadaceae 3aDechloromonas 3aKlebsiella 3aMicrococcus luteus 3aNitrosomonas 3aPseudomonas 3aRhodocyclus 3aacclimation 3abacteria 3abatch systems 3adenitrification 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3anitrification 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aphenol 3aphosphorus 3awastewater 0aSequencing batch reactor 0aActivated sludge 0aBacterial community 0aViable but non-culturable state1 aLiu, Yindong1 aJia, Yangyang1 aSu, Xiaomei1 aLu, Lian1 aDing, Linxian1 aShen, Chaofeng0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 July 20, v. 727 p.138627-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1386273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245007400183300001800257520120200275592002801477650002001505650002001525650001801545650001801563650000901581650001501590650001801605650000901623650000901632650001101641650001401652650001201666650001101678650001101689650000901700650001301709650001001722650001401732651001401746653001401760653003501774653000901809653001801818653001001836700001701846700002001863700002401883700001901907700002201926700001501948700002101963700003101984700002302015773012002038856008102158852000902239655001202248IND60655016820221122041839.0190729e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065501682DNAL7 a239652932pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820130008632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWANDRA, TONI10aTaeniases and cysticercosis in Indonesia: past and present situations  ap. 1608-1616.  aThe main aim of this study is to overview the past and present situations of human taeniases and cysticercosis in Indonesia and including future perspectives. Through joint projects from 1996, we have confirmed the occurrence of Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm) in Bali, of Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) mainly in Papua and sporadically in Bali, and of Taenia asiatica in North Sumatra. These taeniases were caused through eating uncooked pork and pig viscera for T. solium and T. asiatica, respectively, and beef for T. saginata. The distribution of these tapeworms in Indonesia is basically highly restricted by the traditional cultural and religious backgrounds in each island. T. saginata is relatively common in Bali although people consume pork ‘lawar’ more than beef ‘lawar’. Taeniases due to T. saginata or T. asiatica and T. solium and cysticercosis due to T. solium have also been sporadically reported in some other islands. Among these species, T. solium is exceptional since humans can be infected not only by larval stages (cysticerci) in pork but also by eggs released from human tapeworm carriers. Cysticercosis has been confirmed in Indonesia in humans, pigs and even dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaenia asiatica 3aTaenia saginata 3aTaenia solium 3aanimal organs 3abeef 3acysticerci 3acysticercosis 3adogs 3aeggs 3ahumans 3aingestion 3aislands 3alarvae 3apeople 3apork 3araw meat 3aswine 3atapeworms 3aIndonesia 0ataeniases 0acysticercosis due to T. solium 0aBali 0aNorth Sumatra 0aPapua1 aItō, Akira,1 aSWASTIKA, KADEK1 aDHARMAWAN, NYOMAN S1 aSAKO, YASUHITO1 aOKAMOTO, MUNEHIRO1 aIto, Akira1 aZhou, Xiao-nong,1 aCraig, P.

This study investigates seasonal soil respiration rates and underlying mechanisms under wetter, warmer, and more fertile conditions in a Mediterranean cork oak forest of Northern Tunisia (Africa), acknowledged as one of the most productive forests in the Mediterranean basin. We applied a soil respiration model based on soil temperature and relative water content and investigated how ecosystem functioning under these favorable conditions affected soil carbon storage through carbon inputs to the soil litter. Annual soil respiration rates varied between 1774 gC m⁻² year⁻¹ and 2227 gC m⁻² year⁻¹, which is on the highest range of observations under Mediterranean climate conditions. We attributed this high soil carbon flux as a response to favorable temperatures and soil water content, but this could be sustained only by a small carbon allocation to roots (root/shoot ratio = 0.31–0.41) leading to a large allocation to leaves with a multiannual leaf production, enhanced annual twig elongation (11.5–28.5 cm) with a reduced leaf life span (<1 year) maintaining a low LAI (1.68–1.88) and generating a high litterfall (386–636 gC m⁻² year⁻¹). Thus, the favorable climatic and edaphic conditions experienced by these Mediterranean cork oak forests drove high soil respiration fluxes which balanced the high carbon assimilation leading to a relatively small overall contribution (10.96–14.79 kgC m⁻²) to soil carbon storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aQuercus suber 3abranches 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimatic factors 3adry season 3aecological footprint 3aecosystems 3aedaphic factors 3aforests 3aglobal carbon budget 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3alongevity 3amodels 3aplant litter 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil carbon 3asoil respiration 3asoil temperature 3asoil water content 3awater content 3aMediterranean region 3aTunisia1 aMouillot, Florent1 aGharbi, Fatma1 aOurcival, Jean-Marc1 aHanchi, Belgacem0 tForests.g2015 Aug. 26, v. 6, no. 9 p.2918-2940dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f60929183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03855naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245010900210300001200319506007600331520226400407592002802671506003702699650002202736650002402758650001102782650001202793650001902805650001602824650001202840650001902852650001202871650001102883650002302894650001202917650001402929650000902943700002802952700002102980700001903001700002703020700001703047700001703064700001903081700002203100773011203122856008203234852000903316655001203325IND60557978020221207125423.0190220e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055797802DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-016-1850-52doi7 aPMC50940802pmcid7 a278067282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorretta, Daniele10aIntra-instar larval cannibalism in Anopheles gambiae (s.s.) and Anopheles stephensi (Diptera: Culicidae)  ap. 566.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Cannibalism has been observed in a wide range of animal taxa and its importance in persistence and stability of populations has been documented. In anopheline malaria vectors the inter-instar cannibalism between fourth- and first-instar larvae (L4-L1) has been shown in several species, while intra-instar cannibalism remains poorly investigated. In this study we tested the occurrence of intra-instar cannibalism within larvae of second-, third- and fourth-instar (L2, L3 and L4) of Anopheles gambiae (s.s.) and An. stephensi. Experiments were set up under laboratory conditions and the effects of larval density, duration of the contact period among larvae and the presence of an older larva (i.e. a potential cannibal of bigger size) on cannibalism rate were analysed. Cannibalism was assessed by computing the number of missing larvae after 24 and 48 h from the beginning of the experiments and further documented by records with a GoPro videocamera. RESULTS: Intra-instar cannibalism was observed in all larval instars of both species with higher frequency in An. gambiae (s.s.) than in An. stephensi. In both species the total number of cannibalistic events increased from 0–24 to 0–48 h. The density affected the cannibalism rate, but its effect was related to the larval instar and to the presence of older larvae. Interestingly, the lower cannibalism rate between L4 larvae was observed at the highest density and the cannibalism rate between L3 larvae decreased when one L4 was added. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides experimental evidence of intra-instar cannibalism in the malaria vectors An. gambiae (s.s.) and An. stephensi and highlights the possible occurrence of complex interactions between all larval instars potentially present in the breeding sites. We hypothesize that the high density and the presence of a potential cannibal of bigger size could affect the readiness to attack conspecifics, resulting into low risk larval behavior and lower cannibalism rate. The understanding of cannibalistic behavior and the factors affecting it is of utmost importance for malaria vectors, as nutrition during larval development can strongly affect the fitness of adult female mosquitoes and ultimately their vector ability.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aAnopheles stephensi 3aadults 3aanimals 3abreeding sites 3acannibalism 3afemales 3ainsect vectors 3ainstars 3alarvae 3alarval development 3amalaria 3anutrition 3arisk1 aMastrantonio, Valentina1 aCrasta, Graziano1 aBellini, Romeo1 aComandatore, Francesco1 aRossi, Paolo1 aFavia, Guido1 aBandi, Claudio1 aUrbanelli, Sandra0 tParasites & vectors.g2016 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.566-566dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-016-1850-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008300169300001600252520132600268592002801594650001501622650001001637650002301647650001701670650002101687650001301708650002001721650001801741650002101759650002001780650002401800653002401824653001301848653002701861653001601888653002101904700002201925700001601947700001701963700001801980773009601998856008202094852000902176655001202185IND60553390020221119003045.0161021e20141115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055339002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2014.04.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSirca, Donatella12aA robust, state-of-the-art amperometric microbiosensor for glutamate detection  ap. 526-531.  aScientific knowledge of glutamate (GLU) neurobiology is severely hampered by the inadequacy of the available in vivo brain sampling techniques. Due to the crucial role of GLU in central nervous system function and pathology, the development of a reliable sampling device is mandatory. GLU biosensor holds potential to address many of the known issues of in vivo GLU measurement. We report here on the development and test of a labor- and cost-effective microbiosensor, suitable to be applied for measuring brain GLU. A glycerol-based cryopreservation method was also tested. Needle type Pt biosensors were coated with a permselective Nafion–Poly(o-phenylenediamine) layer and cross-linked to l-glutamate oxidase with poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether. Tested in vitro, the device shows high sensitivity and specificity for GLU, while being poorly influenced by common interfering substances such as ascorbate, dopamine and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. Further, the cryopreservation procedure kept sensitivity unaltered for 30 days and possibly longer. We conclude that a highly efficient GLU biosensor of minimal dimensions can be consistently and affordably constructed with relative ease. Together with the possibility of cryopreservation this shall foster diffusion and exploitation of GLU biosensors technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3abrain 3acost effectiveness 3acrosslinking 3acryopreservation 3adopamine 3aethylene glycol 3aglutamic acid 3ain vitro studies 3aneurophysiology 3apolyethylene glycol 0aGlutamate biosensor 0aPlatinum 0aPermselective membrane 0aAmperometry 0aCryopreservation1 aVardeu, Antonella1 aPinna, Milo1 aDiana, Marco1 aEnrico, Paolo0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2014 Nov. 15, v. 61 p.526-531dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2014.04.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010100164300001800265520120800283592002801491650003401519650002201553650003001575650002701605650002701632650002401659650002601683650002901709650001701738650001501755650001901770650001901789650001901808650001801827650001501845650001601860650003201876650001101908650001401919700005601933700002001989773012502009856008202134852000902216655001202225IND60687793820221117013635.0200704e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068779382DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-018-0498-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRai, Sudheer10aNatural Antioxidant and Antimicrobial Agents from Agrowastes: An Emergent Need to Food Packaging  ap. 1905-1916.  aVarious bioactive agrowastes derived phenolic compounds (APCs) obtained from agrowastes lignin hydrolyzed methods and evaluated for their potential antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-quorum activities with special reference to food borne pathogens. Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC₅₀) of isolated phenolic compounds against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals have been found in the range of 53–84 µg/mL, whereas samples obtained by hydrolysis in absence of acid have shown the (IC₅₀) values of ~ 120 µg/mL. The APCs have shown significant antimicrobial activity against Gram positive (Bacillus subtilis) as compared to Gram negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. The bacterial killing as well as anti-quorum sensing activity (inhibiting the violacein production) has been observed against Chromobacterium violaceum. Flow cytometric analysis has been also confirmed the cell death occurs in Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. The present study suggests that APCs derived from agro-wastes can serve as an important source of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial agents.

Despite these potentials, the application of nanofiber web has been limited by its poor mechanical properties. To remedy these poor mechanical properties, laminating processes have been applied to its manufacture. For use in clothing, fabric should have not only adequate mechanical properties, but also the durability to withstand laundering. Hence, the purpose of this study was to measure the mechanical properties of mass-produced nanofiber web, and then to investigate the change of these mechanical properties after laundering in order to evaluate the possibility of using such fiber in a breathable fabric for outdoor wear. We concluded that the maintenance of nanofiber web morphology, despite repeated laundering, allowed for the retention of the mechanical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclothing 3adurability 3afabrics 3alaundry 3amanufacturing 3amechanical properties 3ananofibers 3aporosity 3atextile fibers 0amechanical property 0ananofiber web 0awash1 aKimura, D.1 aYokoyama, A.1 aLee, KeunHyung1 aPark, J.C.1 aKim, IckSoo0 tTextile research journal.g2009 Aug., v. 79, no. 12 p.1085-1090dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175081016223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245013300173300001600306500001500322520186500337592002802202650001802230650001102248650001002259650002602269650002402295650001202319650002202331650002002353650002302373650001102396650001202407650001602419650001502435653001602450700002202466700002202488700001702510700002202527700002102549773010202570856005502672852000902727655001202736IND4467412520221121092039.0120313e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446741252DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02730.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aARTHAUD, FLORENT10aEffect of light stress from phytoplankton on the relationship between aquatic vegetation and the propagule bank in shallow lakes  ap. 666-675.  a2019-12-06  a1. The way light stress controls the recruitment of aquatic plants (phanerogams and charophytes) is a key process controlling plant biodiversity, although still poorly understood. Our aim was to investigate how light stress induced by phytoplankton, that is, independent from the aquatic plants themselves, determines the recruitment and establishment of plant species from the propagule bank. The hypotheses were that an increase in light stress (i) decreases abundance and species richness both of established aquatic plants and of propagules in the bank and (ii) decreases the recruitment success of plants from this bank. 2. These hypotheses were tested in 25 shallow lakes representing a light stress gradient, by sampling propagule banks before the recruitment phase and when the lakes are devoid of actively growing plants (i.e. at the end of winter), established vegetation at the beginning of the summer and phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) during the recruitment and establishment phase. 3. The phytoplankton biomass was negatively correlated with the richness and abundance of established vegetation but was not correlated with the propagule bank (neither species richness nor propagule abundance). The similarity between the propagule bank and established vegetation decreased significantly with increasing phytoplankton biomass. 4. The contrast in species composition between the vegetation and the propagule bank at the highest light stress suggests poor recruitment from the propagule bank but prompts questions about its origin. It could result from dispersal of propagules from neighbouring systems. Propagules could also originate from a persistent propagule bank formerly produced in the lake, suggesting strong year‐to‐year variation in light stress and, as a consequence, in recruitment and reproductive success of plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphytoplankton 3awinter 3alakes 3apropagation materials 3aplant establishment 3abanking 3aspecies diversity 3aprocess control 3aplant reproduction 3asummer 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3avegetation 0arecruitment1 aMOUSSET, MATHILDE1 aVALLOD, DOMINIQUE1 aRobin, Joel,1 aWezel, Alexander,1 aBORNETTE, GUDRUN0 tFreshwater biology.g2012 Apr., v. 57, no. 4 p.666-675dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02730.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02053naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245011800154300001800272520091400290592002801204650002101232650001301253650002801266650002001294650001901314650001301333650001301346653001401359653001101373653001801384653002001402653002801422700002101450773012401471856007501595852000901670655001201679IND60527463720221120195152.0160715e20130710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052746372DNAL7 a10.1021/am40116222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jian10aImproving Electrical Conductivity in Polycarbonate Nanocomposites Using Highly Conductive PEDOT/PSS Coated MWCNTs  ap. 6189-6200.  aWe describe a strategy to design highly electrically conductive polycarbonate nanocomposites by using multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) coated with a thin layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate), a conductive polymer. We found that this coating method improves the electrical properties of the nanocomposites in two ways. First, the coating becomes the main electrical conductive path. Second, the coating promotes the formation of a percolation network at a low filler concentration (0.3 wt %). To tailor the electrical properties of the conductive polymer coating, we used a polar solvent ethylene glycol, and we can tune the final properties of the nanocomposite by controlling the concentrations of the elementary constituents or the intrinsic properties of the conductive polymer coating. This very flexible technique allows for tailoring the properties of the final product.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3acoatings 3aelectrical conductivity 3aethylene glycol 3ananocomposites 3apolymers 3asolvents 0aPEDOT/PSS 0aMWCNTs 0apolycarbonate 0aethylene glycol 0aelectrical conductivity1 aLubineau, Gilles0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2013 July 10, v. 5, no. 13 p.6189-6200dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam40116223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03940naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245024000168300001200408520261700420592002803037650002403065650001103089650001503100650001503115650001503130650002403145650001303169650001703182650001303199700001903212700002403231700002003255700002103275700001903296700002203315773011303337856008303450852000903533655001203542IND60701707520221120100926.0211015e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070170752DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-020-04178-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKryda, Kristina10aPreventive efficacy of four or six monthly oral doses of 24 µg/kg moxidectin compared to six monthly doses of Heartgard® Plus or Interceptor® Plus against macrocyclic lactone-resistant heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) strains in dogs  ap. 339.  aBACKGROUND: Recent reports indicated that increasing the monthly oral dosage and the number of consecutive monthly doses of moxidectin improved the efficacy against macrocyclic lactone (ML)-resistant Dirofilaria immitis. The two laboratory studies reported here evaluated the efficacy of four or six monthly oral doses of 24 µg/kg moxidectin compared to six monthly doses of either Heartgard® Plus (ivermectin/pyrantel) or Interceptor® Plus (milbemycin oxime/praziquantel) against ML-resistant D. immitis strains. METHODS: Dogs were inoculated 30 days prior to first treatment with 50 third-stage (L₃) larvae of a ML-resistant strain of D. immitis, ZoeLA or JYD-34. In each study, dogs (six per group) were randomized to treatment with six monthly doses of placebo, four or six monthly doses of 24 µg/kg moxidectin, or six monthly doses of Heartgard® Plus or Interceptor® Plus at their label dose rates. Efficacy was evaluated by adult heartworm counts approximately nine months after L₃ inoculation. RESULTS: All negative-control dogs were infected with adult heartworms (geometric mean, 35.6; range, 24–41) for ZoeLA and (geometric mean, 32.9; range, 30–37) for JYD-34. Efficacies against ZoeLA for moxidectin, Heartgard® Plus and Interceptor® Plus were ≥ 96.1%, 18.7% and 21.2%, respectively. Adult counts for both moxidectin-treated groups were significantly lower than negative control (P < 0.0001), significantly lower than Heartgard® Plus and Interceptor® Plus (P < 0.0001), but not significantly different from each other (P = 0.5876). Counts for Heartgard® Plus and Interceptor® Plus were not significantly different than negative control (P ≥ 0.2471). Efficacies against JYD-34 were ≥ 95.9%, 63.9% and 54.6% for moxidectin, Heartgard® Plus and Interceptor® Plus, respectively. Counts for all groups were significantly lower than negative control (P ≤ 0.0001). Counts for six monthly doses of moxidectin were significantly lower than those for four monthly doses (P = 0.0470), and the counts for both moxidectin-treated groups were significantly lower than Heartgard® Plus and Interceptor® Plus (P ≤ 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: Moxidectin administered orally at 24 µg/kg to dogs for four or six consecutive months was ≥ 95.9% effective in preventing the development of two ML-resistant heartworm strains and resulted in significantly fewer adult D. immitis than in dogs treated with Heartgard® Plus or Interceptor® Plus when administered for six consecutive months at their approved label dosages in two laboratory efficacy studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDirofilaria immitis 3aadults 3aheartworms 3aivermectin 3amoxidectin 3aoral administration 3aplacebos 3apraziquantel 3apyrantel1 aHolzmer, Susan1 aEverett, William R.1 aMcCall, John W.1 aMahabir, Sean P.1 aMcTier, Tom L.1 aMaeder, Steven J.0 tParasites & vectors.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.339-339dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04178-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012400163300001600287520133400303592002801637650002201665650001101687650001501698650001401713650001301727650003201740650002601772650001601798650001201814650002201826700001401848700001701862700001601879700001501895700001601910700001901926773012101945856008102066852000902147655001202156IND60557978120170118000000.0161104e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055797812DNAL7 a10.1007/s13562-016-0349-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lulu10aLipid desaturation in prokaryotic pathway abates the high-oleic phenotype of FAD2-silenced tobacco at lower temperature  ap. 375-381.  aThe stability of the high-oleic characteristic of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) transformants obtained by silencing of microsomal Ω-6 desaturase (FAD2) was investigated when grown at low temperature. Results showed that oleic acid content in total leaf lipids, individual leaf lipids and total seed lipids of transformants decreased drastically at low temperature, with a corresponding increase of polyunsaturated fatty acid contents. The decrease of oleate was caused by neither the restoration of FAD2 transcripts nor the disappearance of small interference RNA. A significant increase of hexadecadienoic acid and hexadecatrienoic acid was observed in MGDG (monogalactosyldiacylglycerol) of transformants grown at lower temperature. Hexadecadienoic and hexadecatrienoic acids, typical fatty acids in MGDG, are produced through the activity of Ω-6 desaturase in plastids (FAD6). The significant increase of Hexadecadienoic and hexadecatrienoic acids suggested the involvement of FAD6 and/or other desaturases in the lipid desaturation of transgenic plants under lower temperature, leading to a significant decrease of oleate in plant cells. These results suggested that the activities of plastidic desaturases must be, at least partially, responsible for the instability of the high-oleic characteristic of FAD2-silenced plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aleaves 3aoleic acid 3aphenotype 3aplastids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3asmall interfering RNA 3atemperature 3atobacco 3atransgenic plants1 aLu, Heshu1 aLiu, Chunmei1 aXue, Feiyan1 aYang, Jing1 aMa, Lanqing1 aYang, Mingfeng0 tJournal of plant biochemistry and biotechnology.g2016 Oct., v. 25, no. 4 p.375-381dSpringer Indiax0971-78117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13562-016-0349-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02170naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012200157300001800279520080000297592002801097650001501125650001301140650001501153650001501168650001901183650001901202650001901221650001101240650001401251650002101265653003001286653001101316653002301327653001501350653002801365653001901393700001601412700001801428700001501446700001401461700001601475773012701491856007301618852000901691655001201700IND60527463820221120195202.0160715e20130710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052746382DNAL7 a10.1021/am401167y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yucheng10aPolypyrrole-Decorated Ag-TiO2 Nanofibers Exhibiting Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity under Visible-Light Illumination  ap. 6201-6207.  aIn this work, a novel photocatalyst, polypyrrole (PPy)-decorated Ag-TiO₂ nanofibers (PPy-Ag-TiO₂) with core–shell structure, was successfully synthesized using an electrospinning technique, followed by a surfactant-directed in situ chemical polymerization method. The results show that a PPy layer was formed on the surface of Ag-TiO₂ nanofiber, which is beneficial for protecting Ag nanoparticles from being oxidized. Meanwhile, the PPy-Ag-TiO₂ system exhibits remarkable light absorption in the visible region and high photocurrent. Among them, the 1%-PPy-Ag-TiO₂ sample shows the highest photoactivity, which is far exceeds that of the single- and two-component systems. This result may be due to the synergistic effect of Ag, PPy, and TiO₂ nanostructures in the ternary system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3alighting 3ananofibers 3ananosilver 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apolymerization 3asilver 3asynergism 3atitanium dioxide 0aTiO2-based nanocomposites 0asilver 0aconducting polymer 0ananofibers 0acore−shell structures 0aphotocatalysis1 aWen, Junwei1 aWei, Jianhong1 aXiong, Rui1 aShi, Jing1 aPan, Chunxu0 tACS applied materials .g2013 July 10, v. 5, no. 13 p.6201-6207dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am401167y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01935naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245010200183300001800285520069400303592002800997650001201025650002001037650002301057650002501080650002601105650001401131650001301145653001401158653001801172653001901190653001401209700001701223700002101240700003101261700002301292773012001315856008101435852000901516655001201525IND60655017020221122061021.0190729e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065501702DNAL7 a237902472pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820130009662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aItō, Akira,10aNothing is perfect!

The information presented here is based on the author's own experiences with immunological and molecular approaches for the detection of these parasites. There are many incongruities between immunological and molecular studies due to biased work. Nothing is perfect. Indirect approaches using either immunological, or even molecular tools, are limited without confirmation from direct evidence of infection.

However, effects of order of arrival of different plant functional groups (PFGs) on root development have not yet been investigated under field conditions. We measured standing and fine root length density in the first and third year of a grassland field experiment. We wanted to know if manipulating PFG order of arrival would affect root development, and if priority effects are modulated by soil type. Sowing legumes first created a priority effect that was found in the first and third year, with a lower standing root length density in this treatment, even though the plant community composition was different in each of the studied years. Fine root length density was not affected by order of arrival, but changed according to the soil type. Synthesis. We found strong evidence that sowing legumes first created a priority effect below‐ground that was found in the first and third year of this field experiment, even though the functional group dominance was different in each of the studied years.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotanical composition 3afield experimentation 3afine roots 3agrasslands 3alegumes 3amoieties 3asoil types 3asowing1 avon Gillhaussen, Philipp1 aMax, Johannes F.

This technological revolution has led way to nanomedicine, which spurred the development of clever drug delivery designs and ingenious nanovehicles for the monitoring of cellular events in vivo. The clinical implementations of this technology are innumerable and have demonstrated utility as diagnostic tools and fortifying machineries for the mammalian immune system. Recently engineered viral vectors and multi-subunit packaging RNAs have verified stable enough for long-term existence in the physiological environment and therefore reveal unique potential as artificial immunosurveillance devices. Physiological and pathological events recorded by nanodevices could help develop “biocatalogs” of patients׳ infection history, frequency of disease, and much more. In this article, we introduce a novel design concept for a multilayer synthetic immune network parallel to the natural immune system; an artificial network of continuously patrolling nanodevices incorporated in the blood and lymphatic systems, and adapted for molecular event recording, anomaly detection, drug delivery, and gene silencing. We also aim to discuss the approaches and advances recently reported in nanomedicine, especially as it pertains to promising viral and RNA-based nanovehicles and their prospective applications for the development of a synthetic immunosurveillance system (SIS). Alternative suggestions and limitations of these technologies are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3abiosensors 3ablood 3adrugs 3agene silencing 3aimmune system 3amammals 3amonitoring 3ananomedicine 0aNanomedicine 0aNanovirology 0aTheranostics 0aDrug-delivery 0aViral vectors1 aJangiti, Rahul1 aSingh, Om V.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2014 Nov. 15, v. 61 p.152-164dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2014.04.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03383naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012000168300001800288520171400306592002802020650003402048650002502082650000802107650002202115650002302137650002402160650002602184650001802210650002202228650001602250650002902266650001202295650002202307650001702329650002102346650001802367650002102385650001802406650001302424650001902437650002102456650001302477700001802490700001702508700001702525700002402542700003002566700001702596773012502613856008202738852000902820655001202829IND60687794020221117014228.0200704e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068779402DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-018-0503-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuraiya, Sharmin10aUtilization of Saccharina japonica as a Solid-Fermented Substrate for the Production of Bioactive Ethanolic Extract  ap. 1917-1928.  aMarine biomass, Saccharina japonica was fermented as a solid-fermented substrate by Monascus spp. for the production of bioactive ethanolic extract. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-Azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), superoxide anion radical scavenging and DNA protection activities of ethanolic extracts obtained from S. japonica fermented by M. purpureus (SjMp) showed the highest activity followed by M. kaoliang fermented S. japonica (SjMk) and unfermented (SjU) extract at 10 mg/mL concentration. Kinetic analysis revealed that ethanolic extract of fermented S. japonica inhibited the α-amylase competitively but α-glucosidase displayed competitive inhibition at 10 mg/mL concentration and non-competitive inhibition at 1 mg/mL concentration. The Linewaver-Burk kinetics analysis revealed that ethanolic extract of SjMk showed significantly higher Kₘ value (4.55 mg) than SjMP (2.74 mg) followed by SjU (0.35 mg) at 10 mg/mL concentrations in α-amylase inhibition. But incase of α-glucosidase inhibition, the Kₘ value was maximum in ethanolic extract of SjMp (2.30 mg) with Vₘₐₓ (0.29 mg/min) at 10 mg/mL concentrations. Both of the fermented and unfermented samples did not show toxic effect on Caco-2 cells. The amino acid compositional analysis showed that fermentation process changed free amino acids contents in ethanolic extract. Monascus-fermented ethanolic extract showed antibacterial activity on Aeromonas hydrophila and Staphylococcus aureus. So, Monascus spp. fermented S. japonica extract played an important role in prevention of free radicals formation and hyperglycemia which can be applied in biofunctional food formulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aDNA 3aMonascus kaoliang 3aMonascus purpureus 3aSaccharina japonica 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aalpha-amylase 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aamino acids 3aantibacterial properties 3abiomass 3aenzyme inhibition 3afermentation 3afree amino acids 3afree radicals 3ahuman cell lines 3ahyperglycemia 3akinetics 3asulfonic acids 3asuperoxide anion 3atoxicity1 aPark, Hae Dae1 aJang, Won Je1 aChoi, Yu Bin1 aRafiquzzaman, S.

Four innovative systems, including intercropping, improved fallow and new pest-tolerant varieties, are proposed to a sample of 607 planters, with innovation and policy attributes calibrated from a bio-economic farm model. The model interacts technological and economic innovation attributes with farmer individual factors, and allows for a dual source of unobserved heterogeneity. We estimate a system of random coefficient Logit models, to obtain marginal values of innovation traits that can be useful for targeting farm types with appropriate innovations and designing policies for securing agricultural revenue.  aPublisher supplied data 3abananas 3acrop production 3aex ante analysis 3afallow 3afarmers 3afarms 3aincome 3aintercropping 3aissues and policy 3alogit analysis 3amodels 3apesticides 3aplanters 3aCaribbean 3aFrench West Indies1 aCarpentier, Alain1 aThomas, Alban0 tEcological economics.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 72 p.140-150dElsevier B.V.x0921-80097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.09.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245009700185300001800282520101300300592002801313650001801341650001301359650003501372650001801407650002501425650001901450650003801469650001101507650002801518650001301546650001101559650003901570650001801609651001001627651001201637653003001649653003401679653003501713653002301748700001701771700002201788700002201810700001701832700001501849700002101864700003101885700002301916773012001939856008102059852000902140655001202149IND60655017120221122052304.0190729e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065501712DNAL7 a237902682pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820130009782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSAKO, YASUHITO10aSimple and reliable preparation of immunodiagnostic antigens for Taenia solium cysticercosis  ap. 1589-1594.  aCysticercosis caused by infection with the larval stage of Taenia solium is an important cause of neurological disease worldwide and immunodiagnosis is important for the control and elimination of cysticercosis. In the present study, we established a simple and reliable preparation of immunodiagnostic low-molecular-weight antigens (LMWAgs) from T. solium cyst fluids by a cation-exchange chromatography (CEC). Banding patterns of LMWAgs on SDS-PAGE were different between isolates from Ecuador and China. All cysticercosis patient sera and some echinococcosis patient sera recognized both LMWAgs by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), but sera from healthy persons were not positive.

Cows removed three of four Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) eggs from one nest (the fourth egg was damaged), all four Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) nestlings from another, and all three Savannah Sparrow nestlings from a third. We found only two of three missing eggs (intact) and one of seven missing nestlings (dead) near two of the nests. Cows may have eaten the egg and nestlings we were unable to account for; alternatively, the egg and nestlings may have been scavenged by predators or removed from the area by the adult birds. Without videotape documentation, we would have attributed nest failure to traditional predators and cattle would not have been implicated. We may be underestimating the impact of cattle on ground nests by not considering cattle as potential predators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasserculus sandwichensis 3aadults 3abirds 3acows 3aeggs 3agrasslands 3anestlings 3anests 3apastures 3apredation 3apredators 3aWisconsin1 aRibic, Christine A.,0 tWilson bulletin.g2005 Mar., v. 117, no. 1 p.56-62dWilson Ornithological Societyx0043-56437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1676%2F04-0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011600170300001600286520126500302592002801567650002501595650002501620650002101645650001501666650002001681650001601701651001201717700002301729773008901752856008601841852000901927655001201936IND60086324520221119215621.0141101e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008632452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.09.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerg, Annukka14aThe paradox of growth critique: Narrative analysis of the Finnish sustainable consumption and production debate  ap. 151-160.  aAcademic discussion on economic growth and the environment has made a comeback under the auspices of the degrowth debate. To date, however, literature on the topic has been mainly theoretical and empirical studies of actual policy discussions have received less attention. This article contributes to the debate with a narrative policy analysis of interviews with members of Finland's Committee on sustainable consumption and production. Narrative policy analysis is suitable for complex policy cases. By tracing and comparing the different stories, non-stories and counterstories in the debate, the analysis clarifies the issue and paves the way for solutions. We found that it is common even among business and ministry representatives to criticize the current growth-bound economic system. From the perspective of narrative policy analysis, however, this critique only increases uncertainty and complexity in the policy field which, paradoxically, leads to a strengthening of the dominant growth stories. We suggest that constructing a complete degrowth story is essential for supporting democratic deliberation on sustainability. Robust institutional support for degrowth work together with research and experimentation are important milestones on the way.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aeconomic development 3aeconomic systems 3ainterviews 3apolicy analysis 3auncertainty 3aFinland1 aHukkinen, Janne I.0 tEcological economics.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 72 p.151-160dElsevier B.V.x0921-80097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.09.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008100166300001800247500000900265520140600274592002801680650002701708650001501735650002301750650003001773700002301803700002001826700001801846773014001864856008302004852000902087655001202096IND60668451220221119161941.0191228e200009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066845122DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2000.6451554x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Z.Fred10aMeasuring Hydraulic Properties Using a Line Source I. Analytical Expressions  ap. 1554-1562.  aepub  aIn situ measurement of soil hydraulic properties remains a challenge. This study presents new analytical expressions for estimation of soil hydraulic properties below a surface line source by means of multi-purpose time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes and existing quasi-analytical, steady-state solutions for infiltration from a surface line source. Inverse procedures are used to estimate the inverse macroscopic capillary length scale, α, and the hydraulic conductivity at saturation, K ₛ, from pressure head (ψ), water storage (W), and conservative ionic tracer travel time (T) measured via multi-purpose TDR probes placed at several depths below a line source with constant flux of water. Soil water content at saturation, θₛ, can also be estimated if prior information is available. The parameter and spatial sensitivities of each solution were calculated by means of sensitivity coefficients. The uniqueness of possible combinations of measurements to estimate α, K ₛ, and θₛ was tested by means of two-dimensional response surfaces. Significant correlation exists between K ₛ and θₛ, and thus it is not possible to estimate both K ₛ and θₛ by globally minimizing the objective function. Combination approaches with W (i.e., ψ and W, T and W, or ψ and W and T) give unique estimates of α and K ₛ if either θₛ is known or prior information on θₛ is available.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydraulic conductivity 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3atime domain reflectometry1 aKachanoski, R.Gary1 aParkin, Gary W.1 aSi, Bingcheng0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2000 Sept., v. 64, no. 5 p.1554-1562dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2000.6451554x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03803naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014900163300001800312520188200330592002802212650002202240650002402262650002402286650002602310650002002336650002302356650002202379650002302401650001302424650001502437650001202452650001102464650002702475650001802502650002802520650002302548650001002571650001502581650001102596650002702607650001502634650000702649650001702656650002002673650003302693650002102726650002002747650001602767651001202783700001702795700002002812700001902832700002102851700001802872700005902890773012502949856008203074852000903156655001203165IND60687794220221117014527.0200704e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068779422DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-018-0496-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouii, Amal10aCarboxymethyl Cellulase Production by Extremotolerant Bacteria in Low-Cost Media and Application in Enzymatic Saccharification of Stevia Biomass  ap. 2111-2122.  aThe aim of this study was to characterize novel cellulase-producing bacteria isolated from desertic environments in Tunisia, and then applied for cellulosic ethanol production. In the first instance, 27 alkali-thermo-halotolerant bacterial strains, belonging to Bacillaceae family, were screened on agar plates containing carboxymethyl cellulose as the sole carbon source. The selected high cellulase producing bacteria were identified as Bacillus mojavensis AG21, Bacillus vallismortis J77, Bacillus sonorensis 7.26 and Bacillus safiensis AJ49. Production of cellulolytic enzymes by selected bacteria was further tested in submerged cultures with Posidonia oceanica leaves, Peganum Harmala biomass, Stevia rebaudiana leaves (SRL), Olive cake, Spent coffee ground and peanut hulls as low-cost cellulosic substrates. Response surface methodology was applied to evaluate the effect of SRL concentration, NaCl concentration, cultivation pH and temperature on carboxymethyl cellulase production and to optimize enzyme yields by selected bacteria. Maximum cellulase production yields of about 1890, 1642, 1516 and 1455 IU/L were recorded for B. mojavensis AG21, B.vallismortis J77, B. sonorensis 7.26 and B. safiensis AJ49, respectively. Production of reducing sugars by hydrolysis of Stevia rebaudiana leaves with bacterial cellulases and commercially fungal cellulases was investigated and compared. The overall reducing sugar yields of B. mojavensis, B.vallismortis, B. sonorensis, B. safiensis, Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma reesei treated- SSR biomasses reached 3620 ± 181, 3040 ± 164, 3656 ± 164, 2654 ± 106, 2646 ± 145 and 2253 ± 123 mg/L respectively. The unique property of cellulase-producing extremotolerant bacteria, proves the potential candidature for current mainstream agricultural cellulosic biomass conversion into fuel ethanol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aBacillus mojavensis 3aBacillus sonorensis 3aBacillus vallismortis 3aPeganum harmala 3aPosidonia oceanica 3aStevia rebaudiana 3aTrichoderma reesei 3abacteria 3abioethanol 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3aculture media 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aethanol production 3afungi 3ahydrolysis 3aleaves 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aolive cake 3apH 3apeanut hulls 3areducing sugars 3aresponse surface methodology 3asaccharification 3asodium chloride 3atemperature 3aTunisia1 aGuesmi, Amel1 aOuertani, Rania1 aCherif, Hanene1 aChouchane, Habib1 aCherif, Ameur1 aNeifar, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6279-27690 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2020 May, v. 11, no. 5 p.2111-2122dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-018-0496-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01940naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245008000173520065100253592002800904650001300932650001700945650001200962650001600974650001500990650003101005650001801036650001801054650001101072650002601083650002201109653001901131653001801150653002101168700003201189700002901221700002901250700003001279773011801309856008201427852000901509655001201518IND60674196820221118144213.0191126e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067419682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2019.1039542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnhesine, Naira Buzzo10aNon-polar and polar chemical profiling of six Casearia species (Salicaceae)  aSix species of Casearia (C. decandra, C. grandiflora, C. javitensis, C. arborea, C. lasiophylla and C. ulmifolia) were chemically investigated in their non-polar and polar constituents.

We have standardized an efficient miniprep protocol for cotton genomic DNA isolation, which not only provides higher yield from 800 to 1400 µg of DNA from 200 to 300 mg of fresh leaf tissue but also provide excellent purity. The DNA is amenable to all elementary enzymatic preparations, PCR techniques, Southern blotting and to high end genomic studies. The technique does not require liquid nitrogen, needs small amount of sample, less time, fewer chemicals and one can process up to 100 samples per day. The genomic DNA extracted was good for transgenic event characterization and marker assisted selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aSouthern blotting 3acotton 3agenetically modified organisms 3agenomics 3aleaves 3amarker-assisted selection 3amolecular biology 3anitrogen 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apolyphenols 3apolysaccharides 3asecondary metabolites1 aPatil, Anita S.1 aChakrabarty, Pranjib K.0 tJournal of plant biochemistry and biotechnology.g2016 Oct., v. 25, no. 4 p.437-441dSpringer Indiax0971-78117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13562-016-0360-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01568naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100003000156245014800186300001400334506002800348520038000376592002800756506003700784650001800821650001300839650002300852650001300875650001900888650001500907650001500922700003000937773016300967856009101130852000901221655001201230IND60775019920221207065809.0170815e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077501992DNAL7 a10.21498/2518-1017.2(8).2008.628472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aКорнєєва, М.

To facilitate the detection of aromatic amines in complex environmental samples by LC-high resolution mass spectrometry, an on-line-post-column and a pre-column derivatization method to label (in an ideal case) all aromatic amines was evaluated by applying different derivatization reagents. 4-Fluoro-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (NBD-F) was found to be the most promising labeling reagent due to its high reactivity with both primary and secondary amines and its low signal in positive mode electrospray ionization (ESI+). Post-column on-line derivatization did not result in sufficient signal intensities of derivatives. With pre-column derivatization most of the selected aromatic amines resulted in a derivative that shows common fragments of diagnostic value. The selectivity of NBD-F was studied in depth with a data set of 220 compounds with different functional groups showing that also aliphatic amines and some thiols yield a derivative. The developed method was successfully applied to wastewater effluent samples and several derivatives were confirmed by diagnostic neutral losses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic amines 3acarcinogens 3adata collection 3aderivatization 3adisease diagnosis 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3amutagenicity 3asecondary amines 3athiols 3awastewater 0aAromatic amines 0aDiagnostic derivatization 0aHigh resolution mass spectrometry1 aOst, Norbert1 aKühne, Ralph,1 aSchüürmann, Gerrit,1 aBrack, Werner1 aKrauss, Martin0 tChemosphere.g2017 Jan., v. 166 p.300-310dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.09.1383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245011000187300001600297520138300313592002801696650002601724650002601750650002401776650001701800650001501817650001401832650001901846650001201865650001401877650001401891650001401905650001701919650002201936650001501958653002401973653004701997653001502044653001402059653001102073653001502084653003902099700002102138700002202159700002202181700005902203773011602262856008202378852000902460655001202469IND60519331520221121042552.0190730e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051933152DNAL7 a270032622pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820160003542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMICHAELS, LAUREN10aCalifornia mussels (Mytilus californianus) as sentinels for marine contamination with Sarcocystis neurona  ap. 762-769.  aSarcocystis neurona is a terrestrial parasite that can cause fatal encephalitis in the endangered Southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis). To date, neither risk factors associated with marine contamination nor the route of S. neurona infection to marine mammals has been described. This study evaluated coastal S. neurona contamination using California mussels (Mytilus californianus) as sentinels for pathogen pollution. A field investigation was designed to test the hypotheses that (1) mussels can serve as sentinels for S. neurona contamination, and (2) S. neurona contamination in mussels would be highest during the rainy season and in mussels collected near freshwater. Initial validation of molecular assays through sporocyst spiking experiments revealed the ITS-1₅₀₀ assay to be most sensitive for detection of S. neurona, consistently yielding parasite amplification at concentrations ⩾5 sporocysts/1 mL mussel haemolymph. Assays were then applied on 959 wild-caught mussels, with detection of S. neurona confirmed using sequence analysis in three mussels. Validated molecular assays for S. neurona detection in mussels provide a novel toolset for investigating marine contamination with this parasite, while confirmation of S. neurona in wild mussels suggests that uptake by invertebrates may serve as a route of transmission to susceptible marine animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnhydra lutris nereis 3aMytilus californianus 3aSarcocystis neurona 3aencephalitis 3afreshwater 3ahemolymph 3amarine mammals 3amussels 3aparasites 3apathogens 3apollution 3arisk factors 3asequence analysis 3awet season 0aSarcocystis neurona 0aCalifornia mussels (Mytilus californianus) 0aHaemolymph 0aDetection 0aMarine 0aSporocysts 0aSea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis)1 aREJMANEK, DANIEL1 aAguilar, Beatriz,1 aConrad, Patricia,1 aShapiro, Karen,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2678-38510 tParasitology.g2016 May, v. 143, no. 6 p.762-769dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820160003543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03344naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012200167300001600289500001100305520145400316592002801770650002301798650001401821650001101835650001901846650001901865650001401884650001301898650000901911650001801920650002601938650001401964650001201978650001101990650001002001650001302011650003102024650001402055650001102069650001702080650001502097650001602112650001502128650001002143650001402153650002402167650001602191650002302207650001702230650001602247651001102263651001802274651001802292700002202310700002002332700001702352700002202369700001802391700001802409700002002427773010902447856008102556852000902637655001202646IND60537270520221121083918.0160807e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053727052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10340-016-0756-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamby, Kelly A.10aBiotic and abiotic factors impacting development, behavior, phenology, and reproductive biology of Drosophila suzukii  ap. 605-619.  aReview  aSpotted wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii, is a devastating invasive pest of small and stone fruits in the Americas and Europe. To better understand the population dynamics of D. suzukii, we reviewed recent work on juvenile development, adult reproduction, and seasonal variation in life history parameters including the abiotic/biotic factors that influence these processes. Juvenile development is optimal at moderately warm temperatures, and larvae exhibit some immunity to parasitism. Adults use visual cues and substrate-borne vibrations for courtship and exhibit a bimodal locomotor activity pattern (except mated females). Under 20–27 °C and various conditions, development from egg to adult can take 10–17 days, females first lay eggs within 1–8 days and their lifetime fecundity varies from <100 to >400. Oviposition is consistently high in raspberry hosts and fruits with lower penetration force, and the presence of Wolbachia endosymbionts can lower fertility. Drosophila suzukii exhibit seasonal variation with a darker winter morph that is more cold tolerant. Also, D. suzukii likely undergo reproductive diapause in the fall, with colder temperatures and shorter day lengths influencing reproduction. To develop viable IPM programs for D. suzukii, knowledge of abiotic and biotic conditions that impact D. suzukii life history parameters and population dynamics is critical, and gaps in the current knowledge are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila suzukii 3aWolbachia 3aadults 3abiotic factors 3acold tolerance 3acourtship 3adiapause 3aeggs 3aendosymbionts 3aenvironmental factors 3afecundity 3afemales 3afruits 3ahosts 3aimmunity 3aintegrated pest management 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3alife history 3alocomotion 3aoviposition 3aparasitism 3apests 3aphenology 3apopulation dynamics 3araspberries 3aseasonal variation 3astone fruits 3atemperature 3aEurope 3aNorth America 3aSouth America1 aE.

Despite such potential, the application of nanofiber web has been limited on account of its poor mechanical properties. In our previous study, the mechanical properties of laminated nanofiber web were investigated, and it was found that the mechanical properties of nanofiber web are sufficient for use as cloth in outdoor wear if a laminating process is used in its production. In this study, we focus on the use of nanofiber web as a breathable fabric. The purpose of this study is to measure the functional properties of mass-produced nanofiber web, and then to investigate any change of those functional properties that may occur as a result of laundering. The measured functional properties include the water transfer properties of waterproofness and vapor permeability as well as the thermal transfer properties of warm/cool feeling and thermal conductivity. We conclude that the maintenance of nanofiber web morphology despite repeated laundering allows for the retention of the water and thermal transfer properties of the material.  aPublisher supplied data 3afabrics 3afunctional properties 3alaundry 3amechanical properties 3ananofibers 3apermeability 3aporosity 3atextile fibers 3athermal conductivity 3avapors 0ananofiber web 0abreathable fabric 0afunctional property1 aKimura, D.1 aKeun Hyung Lee, 1 aPark, J.C.1 aIck Soo Kim, 0 tTextile research journal.g2010 Jan., v. 80, no. 2 p.99-105dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175081023083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014200167520147100309592002801780650001901808650002201827650001601849651001401865653002601879653002501905653002301930653002901953653003001982653002302012700001702035700002002052700002102072700001902093700002002112700001602132700002902148700002102177700001902198773011302217856008202330852000902412655001202421IND60674196920221118144151.0200103e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067419692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2019.1050312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuentes, Riczar10aTechnological and behavioural complexity in expedient industries: The importance of use-wear analysis for understanding flake assemblages  aExpedient lithic technology has been described as unchanging and without or very limited presence of formal tool types. However, this premise seems to limit the discussion on technological and behavioural complexity when studying amorphous flake industries. To address this issue, we employed multi-stage use-wear analysis to identify features that are not detectable through macroscopic approach. Our analysis of chert tools from Leang Sarru, North Sulawesi indicated the use of both unmodified flakes and retouched tools for plant processing, and we detected evidence for the manufacture of composite tools. Microscopic wear traces on unretouched flakes show that these were attached to shafts for possible use as hafted tools, but not necessarily as projectiles. Our results suggest that simple flake assemblages can be part of complex tool production and present an alternative view on the seemingly unchanging lithic technology from the Late Pleistocene to the Holocene. Furthermore, our current understanding of expedient lithic technology should be reassessed as features that are not observable with standard morphological and technological analyses may be detected through use-wear analysis. Overall, the applied methodology and results of this study are relevant to Pleistocene and Early Holocene archaeological sites and assemblages that exhibit the dilemma of inferring technological and behavioural complexity through the analysis of simple stone tools.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3aPleistocene epoch 3aarchaeology 3aIndonesia 0aIsland Southeast Asia 0aMaritime interaction 0aPalaeoenvironments 0aLithic use-wear analysis 0aPrehistoric plant working 0aHafting technology1 aOno, Rintaro1 aNakajima, Naoki1 aNishizawa, Hiroe1 aSiswanto, Joko1 aAziz, Nasrullah1 aSriwigati, 1 aSofian, Harry Octavianus1 aMiranda, Tatiana1 aPawlik, Alfred0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2019 Dec., v. 112 p.105031-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2019.1050313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03460naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245011600167300001600283500036000299500001500659520191900674592002802593650002902621650001702650650001202667650001902679650002102698650001502719650001202734650001502746650002002761653002302781700001902804700003202823773012102855852000902976856008902985655001203074IND2324623520221119093108.0181002e200110  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232462352DNAL7 a10.1097/00010694-200110000-000022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDec, Jerzy10aDecarboxylation and demethoxylation of naturally occurring phenols during coupling reactions and polymerization  ap. 660-671.  aAffiliations: 1Laboratory of Soil Biochemistry, The Pennsylvania State University, 129 Land and Water Res.

Enzyme-mediated reactions were reported to result in the decarboxylation or demethoxylation of substrate molecules; decarboxylation was also observed with metal oxides. To obtain more information on these phenomena, several humic precursors were incubated with various phenoloxidases (peroxidase, laccase, tyrosinase) or birnessite (δ-MnO2) and monitored for CO2 evolution and methanol production. Additionally, some reaction mixtures were analyzed for methane evolution. By using the test compounds labeled with C in three different locations (carboxyl group, aromatic, or aliphatic chain), we demonstrated that CO2 evolution (ranging from 4.6 to 63.5% of the initial radioactivity) was mainly associated with the release of carboxyl groups. Minimal mineralization of C-labeled aromatic rings or aliphatic carbons occurred in ferulic or p-coumaric acids (0–5.6%). Demethoxylation ranged from 0.5 to 13.9% for 2,6-dimethoxyphenol and syringic acid, respectively. The methyl groups in 2-, 3-, and 4-methylphenol resisted release, as indicated by the lack of methane or methanol production. In previous studies, chlorophenols incubated with various phenoloxidases or birnessite were subject to dehalogenation. It appears that dehalogenation, decarboxylation, and demethoxylation of phenolic substrates are controlled by a common mechanism, in which various substituents are released if they are attached to carbon atoms involved in coupling. According to the experimental data, electron-withdrawing substituents, such as –COOH and –Cl, are more susceptible to release than electron-donating ones, such as –OCH3 and –CH3. The release of organic substituents during polymerization of humic precursors may add to CO2 production in soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3ahumification 3aphenols 3apolymerization 3acatechol oxidase 3abirnessite 3alaccase 3aperoxidase 3aenzyme activity 0achemical reactions1 aHaider, Konrad1 aBollag, J.-M.q(Jean-Marc),0 tSoil science.g2001 Oct., v. 166, no. 10 p.660-671dLippincott Williams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00010694-200110000-000023Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01546naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245006800158300001800226520039000244592002800634650001300662650001800675650001900693650001300712650002600725653003100751653001400782653002200796653003300818653001800851700002300869700001700892700002000909700002200929773012700951856007301078852000901151655001201160IND60527464220170818000000.0160715e20130710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052746422DNAL7 a10.1021/am401218e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaumann, Lukas10aLight-Responsive Caffeine Transfer through Porous Polycarbonate  ap. 5894-5897.  aLight-responsive membranes based on a porous polycarbonate (PC) matrix were developed by surface functionalization with spirobenzopyran (SP)-containing polymers.

We evaluated the efficacy of using radio-telemetry to monitor Interior Least Tern (S. a. athalassos) chicks at Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge, Oklahoma. In 1999, we attached radio transmitters to 26 Least Tern chicks and tracked them for 2––17 days. No adults abandoned their chicks after transmitters were attached. Transmitters did not appear to alter growth rates of transmittered chicks (P == 0.36) or prevent feather growth, although dermal irritation was observed on one chick. However, without frequent reattachment, transmitters generally did not remain on chicks <1 week old for more than 2 days because of feather growth and transmitter removal, presumably by adult terns. Although the presence of transmitters did not adversely affect Least Tern chicks, future assessments should investigate nonintrusive methods to improve retention of transmitters on young chicks and reduce the number of times that chicks need to be handled.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSterna 3aadults 3achicks 3aconservation areas 3afeathers 3afledglings 3anests 3aradio telemetry 3aradio transmitters 3askin irritation 3aOklahoma1 aLeslie, D.

Their structures were elucidated through 1D, 2D NMR and HR-MS. A fast, sensitive and reliable high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) method has been developed and validated to simultaneously quantitate the content of seven triterpenoid saponins in different parts of X. sorbifolia. The quantification was accomplished on a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer in the selected ion monitoring and positive ionization modes. Good chromatographic separation was achieved by gradient elution with the mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 0.05% formic acid in water during a total run time of 20 min. All of the seven compounds showed good linearity (r² > 0.998) in relatively wide concentration ranges. Satisfactory precisions (evaluated by intra- and inter-day tests) and recoveries/accuracies (98.0% to 102.0%) were obtained with RSD values less than 3.0%. The method was successfully adapted for simultaneous quantification of the seven analytes in different parts of X. sorbifolia. The results showed that triterpenoid saponin contents from different parts of the plant varied significantly and a reference for the choice of medicinal parts was accordingly provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aXanthoceras sorbifolium 3aacetonitrile 3achemical species 3aformic acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahulls 3aionization 3amonitoring 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aspectrometers 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atriterpenoid saponins1 aSun, Zheng1 aLi, Qing1 aLiu, Ran1 aZhang, Taozhen1 aWang, Tianyang1 aYang, Wenling1 aLi, Zhe1 aBi, Kaishun0 tAnalytical methods.g2016 Mar. 3, v. 8, no. 10 p.2176-2184dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ay02813b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100002700185245012200212300001600334520155300350592002801903650002301931650002501954650001001979650001701989650001002006650001702016650001202033650001102045650001002056650001602066650002002082650001002102650001202112650001602124700003602140700002302176773012402199856008102323852000902404655001202413IND60537270620221121083856.0160807e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053727062DNAL7 a10.1007/s10340-016-0764-52doi7 a10.1007/s10340-016-0764-52chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiepenbrock, Lauren M.10aOvipositional preference, fidelity, and fitness of Drosophila suzukii in a co-occurring crop and non-crop host system  ap. 761-769.  aDrosophila suzukii (Matsumura) is a devastating pest of soft-skinned fruits including blackberries and raspberries. Management of this pest is focused on preventing infestation in crops, but non-crop hosts may play an important role in enabling D. suzukiito persist in the absence of cultivated hosts. Drosophila suzukii may also infest fruits of both crop and non-crop hosts concurrently. Our goals were to determine whether (1) D. suzukiiprefers to oviposit in cultivated blackberry, Rubus L. subgenus rubus Watson, or American pokeweed, Phytolacca americana, a non-crop host commonly found along field edges, (2) D. suzukii prefers to oviposit into the same host from which it emerged, and (3) performance differs between D. suzukii progeny that develop in blackberries or pokeweed berries. Although the pest was able to infest both hosts at the same rate, we found that D. suzukii females emerging from pokeweed preferred to oviposit into blackberries, while females emerging from blackberry had no preference. Progeny that developed in blackberries were more fit than progeny that developed in pokeweed berries based on several measures. In field locations, cultivated blackberries and pokeweed berries only overlapped in availability for a short period of time, and infestation rates were variable between blackberries and pokeweed berries collected during that period. Nonetheless, these results suggest that non-crop hosts may facilitate the invasion of D. suzukii and perpetuate infestation of cultivated hosts under certain circumstances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila suzukii 3aPhytolacca americana 3aRubus 3ablackberries 3acrops 3aedge effects 3afemales 3afruits 3ahosts 3aoviposition 3apest management 3apests 3aprogeny 3araspberries1 aSwoboda-Bhattarai, Katharine A.1 aBurrack, Hannah J.0 tJournal of pest science.g2016 July, v. 89, no. 3 p.761-769dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:27242x1612-47587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10340-016-0764-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009500158300001800253520153400271592002801805650001201833650001401845650001901859650001701878650001501895650001101910650001901921650001901940650001001959650001901969650001701988653001502005653002002020653002002040653003102060700001902091700002002110700001802130700001902148700002202167773012602189856007302315852000902388655001202397IND60527442320221123014411.0160715e20130522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052744232DNAL7 a10.1021/am401428n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Chun-Yi10aGadolinium-Based CuInS2/ZnS Nanoprobe for Dual-Modality Magnetic Resonance/Optical Imaging  ap. 4389-4400.  aA new magnetic resonance/optical nanoprobe with specific cellular targeting capabilities based on nontoxic CuInS₂/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) with direct covalent attachment of a Gd(III)-complex for tumor-specific imaging is reported. We introduce amphiphilic poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) to interdigitate with hydrophobic, protective agents on the surface of CuInS₂/ZnS QDs that allows phase transfer of hydrophobic QDs from the organic into aqueous phase. Carbodiimide chemistry is used to covalently couple the Gd(III) complex on the surface of CuInS₂/ZnS QDs, and then folic acid is further utilized to functionalize this dual-modality nanoprobe for active tumor targeting based on the fact that the membrane-associated folate receptor is overexpressed in many tumor cells. The longitudinal relaxivity value is 3.72 mM–¹ s–¹ for the dual-modality nanoprobe and a clear, positive, and increasing contrast enhancement of magnetic resonance signals concurrently with increasing Gd(III) concentration is observed. The dual-modality nanoprobe exhibits negligible cytotoxicity with >80% cell viability at a concentration of up to 100 μg/mL in human cervical (HeLa), human liver carcinoma (HepG2), and human breast (MCF-7) cells after 24 h. The specificity of folic-acid-conjugated nanoprobe cellular uptake has been investigated by confocal scanning laser imaging, which revealed that HeLa cells, expressing the folate receptor, internalized a higher level of dual-modality nanoprobes than HepG2 and MCF-7 cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreasts 3acarcinoma 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3afolic acid 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3aimage analysis 3aliver 3aneoplasm cells 3aquantum dots 0aCuInS2/ZnS 0aGd(III)-complex 0aoptical imaging 0amagnetic resonance imaging1 aOu, Keng-Liang1 aHuang, Wei-Ting1 aChen, Jem-Kun1 aChang, Jia-Yaw1 aYang, Cheng-Hsien0 tACS applied materials .g2013 May 22, v. 5, no. 10 p.4389-4400dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am401428n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02295naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011000158300002000268520109000288592002801378650000801406650001401414650002101428650001301449650002401462650002101486650003001507650006201537650001201599650001001611700001901621700002201640700003001662700002001692773011301712856007501825852000901900655001201909IND60529885220170413000000.0160720e20141104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052988522DNAL7 a10.1021/ac503261b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHünniger, Tim10aJust in Time-Selection: A Rapid Semiautomated SELEX of DNA Aptamers Using Magnetic Separation and BEAMing  ap. 10940-10947.  aA semiautomated two-step method for in vitro selection of DNA aptamers using magnetic separation and solid-phase emulsion polymerase chain reaction has been developed. The application of a magnetic separator allows the simultaneous processing of up to 12 SELEXs (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) with different targets or buffer conditions. Using a magnetic separator and covalent target immobilization on magnetic beads, the selection process was simplified and the substeps of aptamer/target incubation, washing, and elution of the aptamers were merged into one automated procedure called “FISHing”. Without further processing the resulting FISHing eluates are suitable for BEAMing (beads, emulsion, amplification, and magnetics), which includes the amplification by emPCR (emulsion polymerase chain reaction) and strand separation by the implementation of covalently immobilized reverse primers on magnetic beads. The novel selection process has been proved and validated by selecting and characterization of aptamers to the wine fining agent lysozyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aemulsions 3ain vitro studies 3alysozyme 3amagnetic separation 3aoligonucleotides 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asystematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment 3awashing 3awines1 aWessels, Hauke1 aFischer, Christin1 aPaschke-Kratzin, Angelika1 aFischer, Markus0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 Nov. 04, v. 86, no. 21 p.10940-10947dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac503261b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02217naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012600157300001800283520094400301592002801245650001801273650001601291650002201307650001801329650001601347650001601363650002201379650001401401650002701415650001501442650003101457650001701488650001901505650002101524700002301545700002201568773013301590856007501723852000901798655001201807IND60537644920221120142101.0160809e20130227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053764492DNAL7 a10.1021/ie303052a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Ruiyang10aFactors Influencing Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Product Degradation in Aqueous Solution Using Pulsed Wave Ultrasound  ap. 2824-2831.  aContinuous wave (CW) and pulsed wave (PW) ultrasound were used to degrade pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin), and personal care products (propyl gallate and diethyl phthalate). These compounds, covering a range of physicochemical properties and a diversity of structures, were explored to determine if and how PW ultrasound is advantageous to CW ultrasound. Degradation rates by PW ultrasound were faster for smaller compounds and slower for larger compounds than that under CW ultrasound. The addition of a bulk solution •OH trapping agent, acetic acid, to PPCP solutions indicates that the fraction of degradation occurring in bulk solution is positively correlated with the molar volume of the compound. Overall, smaller PPCP compounds with molar volumes less than 130 mL/mol are able to more readily diffuse to bubble interfaces and are impacted most by pulsing ultrasound.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3aacetic acid 3aaqueous solutions 3aciprofloxacin 3acorrelation 3aengineering 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aibuprofen 3apersonal care products 3aphthalates 3aphysicochemical properties 3aplasticizers 3apropyl gallate 3asulfamethoxazole1 aDiaz-Rivera, David1 aWeavers, Linda K.0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2013 Feb. 27, v. 52, no. 8 p.2824-2831dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie303052a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03744naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166100001700175245012900192300001800321500002400339500001500363520169100378650001902069650002302088650001902111650002302130650001302153650001802166650002202184650002002206650002502226650001102251650001902262650001702281650001402298650003802312650001202350650003702362650002002399650001902419650002002438650004002458650003802498650002502536651001302561653002502574653002802599700001802627700001502645700001802660700001702678773012402695852000902819856008702828856010802915930003303023945002503056946001303081655001203094IND4383238320221121034000.0060831e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438323832DNAL7 a169376642pmid7 a10.1603/0022-0493-99.4.11292doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aPrater, C.A.10aMicrobial Control of Black Cutworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Turfgrass Using Agrotis ipsilon Multiple Nucleopolyhedrovirus  ap. 1129-1137.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAgrotis ipsilon multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (family Baculoviridae, genus Nucleopolyhedrovirus, AgipMNPV), a naturally occurring baculovirus, was found infecting black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), on central Kentucky golf courses. Laboratory, greenhouse, and field studies investigated the potential of AgipMNPV for managing black cutworms in turfgrass. The virus was highly active against first instars (LC50 = 73 occlusion bodies [OBs] per μl with 2-μl dose; 95% confidence intervals, 55-98). First instars that ingested a high lethal dose stopped feeding and died in 3-6 d as early second instars, whereas lethally infected fourth instars continued to feed and grow for 4-9 d until death. Sublethal doses consumed by third or fifth instars had little or no effect on subsequent developmental rate or pupal weight. Horizontal transmission of AgipMNPV in turfgrass plots was shown. Sprayed suspensions of AgipMNPV (5 x 10⁸-6 x 10⁹ OBs/m2) resulted in 75 to >93% lethal infection of third or fourth instars in field plots of fairway-height creeping bentgrass, Agrostis stolonifera (Huds.), and on a golf course putting green collar. Virus spray residues (7 x 10⁹ OBs/m2) allowed to weather on mowed and irrigated creeping bentgrass field plots significantly increased lethal infection of implanted larvae for at least 4 wk. This study, the first to evaluate a virus against a pest in turfgrass, suggests that AgipMNPV has potential as a preventive bioinsecticide targeting early instar black cutworms. Establishing a virus reservoir in the thatch and soil could suppress successive generations of that key pest on golf courses and sport fields. 3ainsect viruses 3aviral insecticides 3alethal dose 50 3avirus transmission 3acutworms 3aBaculoviridae 3agolf course soils 3aAgrotis ipsilon 3ainsecticide residues 3alarvae 3ainsect control 3aturf grasses 3amortality 2aAgrostisxparasitologyxvirology. 2aAnimals 2aDisease Transmission, Infectious 2aLarvaxvirology 2aLethal Dose 50 2aMothsxvirology 2aNucleopolyhedrovirusesxphysiology. 2aPest Control, Biologicalxmethods 2aPesticide Synergists 3aKentucky 0aNucleopolyhedrovirus 0ahorizontal transmission1 aRedmond, C.T.1 aBarney, W.1 aBonning, B.C.1 aPotter, D.A.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2006 Aug., v. 99, no. 4 p.1129-1137dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493-99.4.11293Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://puck.esa.catchword.org/vl=4081177/cl=17/nw=1/rpsv/journal/journal3_home.htm3electronic resource  a20061007b20061102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/10/05  aOther US 7aarticle03669naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245008900164300001800253520220300271592002802474650001502502650002402517650002202541650001502563650001902578650001202597650001602609650001702625650001302642650001402655650002302669650002202692650001902714650002602733650003702759650001502796653000802811653002502819653001302844653001602857653001902873653002402892700002102916700001802937773012402955856007503079852000903154655001203163IND60527464320221120184522.0160715e20130710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052746432DNAL7 a10.1021/am401229a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAthauda, Thushara J.10aTuning Physical and Optical Properties of ZnO Nanowire Arrays Grown on Cotton Fibers  ap. 6237-6246.  aThis article reports the first systematic study on the quantitative relationship between the process parameters of solution concentration ratio, structure, and physical and optical properties of ZnO nanowires grown on cotton surfaces. To develop a fundamental understanding concerning the process–structure–activity relations, we grew a series of well-defined, radially oriented, highly dense, and uniform single-crystalline ZnO nanorods and nanoneedles on cotton surfaces by a simple and inexpensive two-step optimized hydrothermal process at a relatively low temperature. This process involves seed treatment of a cotton substrate with ZnO nanocrystals that will serve as the nucleation sites for subsequent anisotropic growth of single crystalline ZnO nanowires. All of the ZnO nanowires exhibit wurtzite crystal structure oriented along the c-axis. For investigating structure-controlled properties, seed-to-growth solutions concentrations ratio ([S]/[G]) of the synthesis process was varied over six different values. Superhydrophobicity was achieved for all morphologies after 1-dodecanethiol modification, which was highly durable after prolonged UV irradiation. Durability of the ZnO materials under laundry condition was also verified. Variation of the [S]/[G] ratio resulted in a morphological transform from nanorods to needle-like structures in conjunction with a drastic change in the physical and optical properties of the ZnO modified cotton surfaces. Higher [S]/[G] ratios yielded formation of ZnO nanoneedles with high degree of crystallinity and higher aspect ratio compared to nanorods. Increasing [S]/[G] ratio resulted in the amount of ZnO grown on the cotton surface to drop significantly, which also caused a decrease in the surface hydrophobicity and UV absorption. In addition, room temperature photoluminescence measurements revealed that the band gap of ZnO widened and the structural defects were reduced as the morphology changed from nanorods to nanoneedles. A similar trend was observed in the UV–vis absorption of nanorods and nanoneedles, the onset of the latter exhibiting a blue-shift that correlates with the widening of band gap with nanoneedle formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aambient temperature 3acrystal structure 3adurability 3ahydrophobicity 3alaundry 3alint cotton 3ananocrystals 3ananorods 3ananowires 3aoptical properties 3aphotoluminescence 3aseed treatment 3aultraviolet radiation 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3azinc oxide 0aZnO 0astructure−activity 0ananorods 0ananoneedles 0ahydrophobicity 0ahydrothermal growth1 aHari, Parameswar1 aOzer, Ruya R.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2013 July 10, v. 5, no. 13 p.6237-6246dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam401229a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011800155300001800273520100100291592002801292650004401320650003701364650001401401650002301415650001601438650001201454653002801466653002201494653002401516653003101540653002501571700001401596700001901610700001701629700001401646700001701660773012701677856007301804852000901877655001201886IND60527442420221123014503.0160715e20130612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052744242DNAL7 a10.1021/am302893r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Fute10aMethyl/Allyl Monolayer on Silicon: Efficient Surface Passivation for Silicon-Conjugated Polymer Hybrid Solar Cell  ap. 4678-4684.  aWe demonstrate a hybrid Schottky junction solar cell based on methyl/allyl groups terminated silicon nanowire arrays (SiNWs) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.2%. The methyl/allyl organic monolayer on silicon can act as an excellent passivation layer for suppressing surface charge recombination, which is characterized by grazing angle attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. The transient and steady electric output characteristics measurements indicate that the density of trap states of SiNWs are dramatically suppressed by methyl/allyl surface modification. In addition, the device based on methyl/allyl passivated SiNWs exhibits improved stable electrical output over those based on either methyl or allyl passivated ones. The improved PCE and good stability of the device are ascribed to efficient functionalization of the SiNW surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3ananowires 3aphotovoltaic cells 3areflectance 3asilicon 0asilicon nanowire arrays 0aorganic monolayer 0asurface passivation 0ahybrid Schottky solar cell 0acharge recombination1 aLiu, Dong1 aZhang, Yunfang1 aWei, Huaixin1 aSong, Tao1 aSun, Baoquan0 tACS applied materials .g2013 June 12, v. 5, no. 11 p.4678-4684dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am302893r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006400147245021100211300001800422520159500440592002802035650003402063650001802097650002502115650001802140650002402158650001402182650001502196650001202211650001602223650001702239650004302256650001302299650003202312650002402344650001502368650001402383650001302397700002002410700002502430700002502455700002002480773012502500856008202625852000902707655001202716IND60687794620221117013524.0200704e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068779462DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-018-0512-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖzbek, Hatice Neval1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6543-408610aPistachio (Pistacia vera L.) Hull as a Potential Source of Phenolic Compounds: Evaluation of Ethanol–Water Binary Solvent Extraction on Antioxidant Activity and Phenolic Content of Pistachio Hull Extracts  ap. 2101-2110.  aPistachio (Pistacia vera L.) hull is the largest by-product of pistachio industry which is accumulated every year at harvest time and can lead to environmental pollution. This study investigated the microwave-assisted ethanol–water binary solvent extraction of phenolic compounds from pistachio hull. The effect of different ethanol/water ratios was investigated on the changes in extraction yield, total phenolic content and antioxidant activity. The obtained results indicated relationships between the tested parameters, i.e. ethanol concentration and extraction yield. The maximum yield was obtained with 50% ethanol (32.9 g dry extract/100 g dry matter). Total phenolic content of the extracts was found in the range of 21.3–39.3 mg/g extract as gallic acid equivalent. Antioxidant activity was determined by using three different tests. Using the DPPH test, the best antioxidant activity with the lowest IC₅₀ value (0.70 mg/mL) was obtained for 40% ethanol and the least antioxidant activity was obtained for 100% ethanol with the highest IC₅₀ value of 2.73 mg/mL. Using the β-carotene bleaching assay, the pistachio hull extracts showed antioxidant activity at 5000 mg/L in the range of 44–97%. The ORAC test showed that 50% ethanol extract had the highest antioxidant activity (260.9 µmol Trolox equivalents/g extract). Using HPLC assay, the gallic acid was the main phenolic compound of hull extracts which ranged between 1.18 and 19.83 mg/g crude extract. These findings propose that pistachio hull extracts can be a valuable source of bioactive compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aPistacia vera 3aantioxidant activity 3abeta-carotene 3abioactive compounds 3ableaching 3abyproducts 3aethanol 3agallic acid 3aharvest date 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aindustry 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amicrowave treatment 3apistachios 3apollution 3asolvents1 aHalahlih, Fares1 aGöğüş, Fahrettin1 aKoçak Yanık, Derya1 aAzaizeh, Hassan0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2020 May, v. 11, no. 5 p.2101-2110dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-018-0512-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01658naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002900136245010100165300001400266520061900280592002800899650002000927650001400947650001100961650001300972650001500985650001801000651001101018700002301029700002001052700002801072700002401100773010301124856007201227852000901299655001201308IND60131450720221118012419.0151127e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013145072DNAL7 a10.1676/04-0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZimmerman, Christian E.,10aOffshore marine observation of willow ptarmigan, including water landings, kuskokwim bay, alaska  ap. 12-14.  aWe report an observation of Willow Ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) encountered 8 to 17 km from the nearest shoreline on Kuskokwim Bay, Alaska, on 30 August 2003.

Combined with projections of population decline due to continued climate warming and the ensuing loss of sea ice habitat, those findings contributed to the 2008 decision to list the species as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Here, we used mark–recapture models to investigate the population dynamics of polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea from 2001 to 2010, years during which the spatial and temporal extent of summer sea ice generally declined. Low survival from 2004 through 2006 led to a 25–50% decline in abundance. We hypothesize that low survival during this period resulted from (1) unfavorable ice conditions that limited access to prey during multiple seasons; and possibly, (2) low prey abundance. For reasons that are not clear, survival of adults and cubs began to improve in 2007 and abundance was comparatively stable from 2008 to 2010, with ~900 bears in 2010 (90% CI 606–1212). However, survival of subadult bears declined throughout the entire period. Reduced spatial and temporal availability of sea ice is expected to increasingly force population dynamics of polar bears as the climate continues to warm. However, in the short term, our findings suggest that factors other than sea ice can influence survival. A refined understanding of the ecological mechanisms underlying polar bear population dynamics is necessary to improve projections of their future status and facilitate development of management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEndangered Species Act of 1973 3aUrsus maritimus 3aadults 3aclimate 3aglobal warming 3ahabitats 3aice 3amodels 3apopulation dynamics 3asummer 3aBeaufort Sea 3aCanada 3aUnited States1 aMcDonald, Trent L.1 aStirling, Ian1 aDerocher, Andrew E.1 aRichardson, Evan S.1 aRegehr, Eric V.1 aDouglas, David C.1 aDurner, George M.1 aAtwood, Todd1 aAmstrup, Steven C.0 tEcological applications.g2015 Apr., v. 25, no. 3 p.634-651dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/14-1129.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01772naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007400168300001400242520054800256592002800804650002300832650001300855650001600868650001300884650002700897650001500924653001500939653001300954653002100967700002700988700002601015700002501041700001901066700001901085700001801104773015801122856008501280852000901365655001201374IND60772535020221121012908.0220531e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077253502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2022.03.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFikri, Bahrul10aEffects of probiotics on immunity and iron homeostasis: A mini-review  ap. 24-27.  aIron deficiency remains a major problem in both developed and developing countries.

By using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, we investigated the metabolic fate of 15NO3− and 15NH4+ in soybean plants (Glycine max L. Merril cv. IAC-23) subjected to root hypoxia. This stress reduced the uptake of 15NO3− and 15NH4+ from the medium and decreased the overall assimilation of these nitrogen sources into amino acids in roots and leaves. Root 15NO3− assimilation was more affected by hypoxia than that of 15NH4+, resulting in enhanced nitrite and nitric oxide release in the solution. However, 15NO3− was translocated in substantial amounts by xylem sap and considerable 15NO3− assimilation into amino acids also occurred in the leaves, both under hypoxia and normoxia. By contrast, 15NH4+ assimilation occurred predominantly in roots, resulting in accumulation of mainly 15N–alanine in this tissue during hypoxia. Analysis of lactate levels suggested higher fermentation in roots from NH4+-treated plants compared to the NO3− treatment. Thus, foliar NO3− assimilation may be relevant to plant tolerance to oxygen deficiency, since it would economize energy expenditure by hypoxic roots. Additionally, the involvement of nitric oxide synthesis from nitrite in the beneficial effect of NO3− is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aamino acids 3aenergy expenditure 3afermentation 3ahypoxia 3aleaves 3anitrates 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen 3anitrogen metabolism 3anormoxia 3aroots 3asap 3asoybeans 3aspectroscopy 3axylem 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aAlaninexmetabolism 2aAmmonium Chloridexmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aBiological Transport 2aCell Hypoxia 2aCulture Mediaxmetabolism 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aNitratesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aNitric Oxidexmetabolism 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aPhloemxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxmetabolism 2aSoybeansxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aXylemxmetabolism 0aAmino acid 0aAmmonium 0aHypoxia 0aNitrate 0aNitric oxide 0aNitrite 0aNitrogen metabolism 0aEDTA 0aGABA 0aGC–MS 0aNH4+ 0aNO 0aNO2− 0aNO3− 0aNR 0aO21 aFreschi, Luciano1 aSodek, Ladaslav0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2013 May, v. 66 p.141-149dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2013.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245009700171300001400268520147700282592002801759653002301787653001101810653002001821653001501841653001201856700002101868700002001889700002501909700002401934700002001958773010301978856008302081852000902164655001202173IND60554879720221117090935.0161025e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055487972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.msard.2014.09.2112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBueno, Anna-Marie10aHealth-related quality of life in patients with longstanding ‘benign multiple sclerosis’  ap. 31-38.  aWe explored health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and psychosocial aspects in a cohort of patients with a history of longstanding benign MS (BMS).Patients with BMS (EDSS≤3 after 20 years disease duration) were re-assessed 25–30 years post-MS symptom onset for: EDSS, HRQoL (MSQoL-54), depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II), and fatigue (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale). Associations between these measures and patient characteristics (age, disease duration, ‘benign status’ [remained benign (EDSS≤3) vs no longer benign (EDSS>3)]) were examined.Of the 61 patients included, 36 (49%) remained benign and 25 (41%) progressed (EDSS>3). Overall, physical and mental HRQoL scores were positively associated with each other (r=0.63; p<0.0001) and both negatively correlated with fatigue (r=−0.76 and −0.44, respectively; p<0.0005) and depression (r=−0.55 and −0.77; p<0.0001). Patients who remained benign reported better physical HRQoL vs those no longer benign (mean (SD)=67.3±18.1 vs 50.7±19.9, p=0.001), but not mental health (mean (SD)=67.4±19.3 vs 65.0±20.6, p=0.639). Generally, neither age nor disease duration was strongly associated with HRQoL (r<0.35).Lower self-reported physical or mental HRQoL was associated with worsening fatigue and depression. However, EDSS progression was associated with the physical, but not mental aspects of HRQoL. Patient-reported HRQoL in ‘benign MS’ provides insight on the impact of MS beyond EDSS alone.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMultiple sclerosis 0aBenign 0aQuality of life 0aDepression 0aFatigue1 aSayao, Ana-Luiza1 aYousefi, Masoud1 aDevonshire, Virginia1 aTraboulsee, Anthony1 aTremlett, Helen0 tMultiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders.g2015 Jan., v. 4 p.31-38dElsevier B.V.x2211-03487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2014.09.2113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245008700185300001600272520173700288592002802025650001502053650001902068650002002087650001402107650001402121650001002135650001302145650001302158650002402171650001602195650002602211650003002237650002302267650002402290650004302314650001602357650001302373650003402386650002702420650001302447700001902460700001702479773009402496856004802590852000902638655001202647IND4482567920221118064140.0120727e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448256792DNAL7 a218504572pmid7 a10.1007/s10577-011-9230-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanicki, Mateusz10aBioinformatics and genomic analysis of transposable elements in eukaryotic genomes  ap. 787-808.  aA major portion of most eukaryotic genomes are transposable elements (TEs). During evolution, TEs have introduced profound changes to genome size, structure, and function. As integral parts of genomes, the dynamic presence of TEs will continue to be a major force in reshaping genomes. Early computational analyses of TEs in genome sequences focused on filtering out “junk” sequences to facilitate gene annotation. When the high abundance and diversity of TEs in eukaryotic genomes were recognized, these early efforts transformed into the systematic genome-wide categorization and classification of TEs. The availability of genomic sequence data reversed the classical genetic approaches to discovering new TE families and superfamilies. Curated TE databases and their accurate annotation of genome sequences in turn facilitated the studies on TEs in a number of frontiers including: (1) TE-mediated changes of genome size and structure, (2) the influence of TEs on genome and gene functions, (3) TE regulation by host, (4) the evolution of TEs and their population dynamics, and (5) genomic scale studies of TE activity. Bioinformatics and genomic approaches have become an integral part of large-scale studies on TEs to extract information with pure in silico analyses or to assist wet lab experimental studies. The current revolution in genome sequencing technology facilitates further progress in the existing frontiers of research and emergence of new initiatives. The rapid generation of large-sequence datasets at record low costs on a routine basis is challenging the computing industry on storage capacity and manipulation speed and the bioinformatics community for improvement in algorithms and their implementations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abioinformatics 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenomics 3aindustry 3apopulation dynamics 3atransposons 2aComputational Biology 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aDatabases, Genetic 2aEukaryotaxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulationxphysiology 2aGenome Size 2aGenomics 2aMolecular Sequence Annotation 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSoftware1 aRooke, Rebecca1 aYang, Guojun0 tChromosome research.g2011 Aug., v. 19, no. 6 p.787-808dSpringer-Verlagx0967-38497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10577-011-9230-7  aDNAL 7aarticle04195naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002100188245016200209300001000371506007600381520256200457592002803019596004503047596004503092506003703137650001303174650001903187650002503206650001303231650001403244650001103258650001803269650001203287650001403299650001103313650001203324650001403336650002703350650003703377700002203414700002103436700002003457700002003477773010103497856008203598852000903680655001203689IND60572361620221207045546.0200107e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057236162DNAL7 a280568012pmid7 aPMC52171962pmcid7 a10.1186/s12870-016-0957-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, Robert L.10aPolyploidy and the relationship between leaf structure and function: implications for correlated evolution of anatomy, morphology, and physiology in Brassica  ap. 3.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Polyploidy is well studied from a genetic and genomic perspective, but the morphological, anatomical, and physiological consequences of polyploidy remain relatively uncharacterized. Whether these potential changes bear on functional integration or are idiosyncratic remains an open question. Repeated allotetraploid events and multiple genomic combinations as well as overlapping targets of artificial selection make the Brassica triangle an excellent system for exploring variation in the connection between plant structure (anatomy and morphology) and function (physiology). We examine phenotypic integration among structural aspects of leaves including external morphology and internal anatomy with leaf-level physiology among several species of Brassica. We compare diploid and allotetraploid species to ascertain patterns of phenotypic correlations among structural and functional traits and test the hypothesis that allotetraploidy results in trait disintegration allowing for transgressive phenotypes and additional evolutionary and crop improvement potential. RESULTS: Among six Brassica species, we found significant effects of species and ploidy level for morphological, anatomical and physiological traits. We identified three suites of intercorrelated traits in both diploid parents and allotetraploids: Morphological traits (such as leaf area and perimeter) anatomic traits (including ab- and ad- axial epidermis) and aspects of physiology. In general, there were more correlations between structural and functional traits for allotetraploid hybrids than diploid parents. Parents and hybrids did not have any significant structure-function correlations in common. Of particular note, there were no significant correlations between morphological structure and physiological function in the diploid parents. Increased phenotypic integration in the allotetraploid hybrids may be due, in part, to increased trait ranges or simply different structure-function relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Genomic and chromosomal instability in early generation allotetraploids may allow Brassica species to explore new trait space and potentially reach higher adaptive peaks than their progenitor species could, despite temporary fitness costs associated with unstable genomes. The trait correlations that disappear after hybridization as well as the novel trait correlations observed in allotetraploid hybrids may represent relatively evolutionarily labile associations and therefore could be ideal targets for artificial selection and crop improvement.  aPublisher supplied data  aIOS-1025965cNational Science Foundation  aIOS-1025965cNational Science Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrassica 3aallopolyploidy 3aartificial selection 3adiploidy 3aevolution 3agenome 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3aparents 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic correlation 3astructure-activity relationships1 aYarkhunova, Yulia1 aVidal, Katherine1 aEwers, Brent E.1 aWeinig, Cynthia0 tBMC plant biology.g2017 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.3-3dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-016-0957-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245011000209300001400319520116900333592002801502650003801530650001701568650001301585650004301598650001201641653000801653653000901661653000801670653000901678653000801687653001001695653001201705653000801717653000801725653000901733653002501742653000901767653001601776653001501792700001401807700001701821700003001838700001701868700002501885700003001910700001701940700001601957700001801973700001901991773008602010856008302096852000902179655001202188IND60622870920221120204235.0190131e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062287092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2018.11.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiray Avci, Cigir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2748-312414aThe role of EGFR overexpression on the recurrence of basal cell carcinomas with positive surgical margins  ap. 35-38.  aEpidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression may have role on recurrence of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) with positive surgical margin(s).The aim was to investigate the role of genetic expression changes of EGFR on recurrence rates in patients in follow up with surgically excised BCC with positive surgical margin(s).Thirty-four surgical margin–positive BCC lesions that were closely followed up without an immediate reoperation were included in this study. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed from the both healthy and tumoral tissue samples.EGFR was expressed at a significantly higher rate in tumoral tissues compared to healthy tissues (p < 0,05). In patients with recurrence lesions, EGFR expression was 6,66 times higher compared to patients with non-recurrent. Also, there was statistically significant difference EGFR expression for infiltrative subtypes (p < 0,05).Our study focuses on the role of EGFR overexpression specifically and outcomes for recurrent and infiltrative subtyped lesions are significant for both clinic and pathogenesis of BCC. Similar studies have to be performed with high numbered patient groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atissues 0aBCC 0acDNA 0aDNA 0aEGFR 0aPCR 0aPTCH1 0aqRT-PCR 0aRNA 0aROC 0aSPSS 0aBasal cell carcinoma 0aEGFR 0aSkin cancer 0aRecurrence1 aKaya, Isa1 aOzturk, Arin1 aOzates Ay, Neslihan Pinar1 aSezgin, Baha1 aKurt, Cansu Caliskan1 aAkyildiz, Nurullah Serdar1 aBozan, Aykut1 aYaman, Banu1 aAkalin, Taner1 aApaydin, Fazil0 tGene.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 687 p.35-38dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2018.11.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01496naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245006700169300001400236520056300250592002800813653002600841653002300867653001800890653001800908653002900926700005600955773010301011856008301114852000901197655001201206IND60554879820221117090325.0161025e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055487982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.msard.2014.09.2122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamogawa, Kenji10aUseless hand syndrome with astereognosis in multiple sclerosis  ap. 85-87.  aWe report on a patient with multiple sclerosis (MS) who developed bilateral useless hand syndrome (UHS) and astereognosis.

Absorbability was analysed by measuring absolute moisture content of wood and by MRI. These analyses were based on the results of previous studies on resistance against decay fungi in case of wood treated with the same chemical compound. In their previous studies the authors found that AEAPTMOS exhibits enhanced hydrophobic properties and thus increased resistance to the action of specific abiotic and biotic factors. The advantageous fungicidal properties of wood treatment systems indicate that AEAPTMOS may be considered as an environmentally friendly solution, being an alternative to conventional biocidal agents. Results indicate that this method may be used in laboratory analyses assessing the relative amount of water uptake through the wood surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aantifungal properties 3abiocides 3adecay fungi 3aimage analysis 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3awater content 3awater uptake 3awood 3awood treatment1 aKowalczuk, Joanna1 aRatajczak, Izabela1 aSzentner, Kinga0 tEuropean Journal of Wood and Wood Products.g2014 Mar., v. 72, no. 2 p.243-248dSpringer-Verlagx0018-37687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00107-013-0768-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03680naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245016300187300001800350520175400368592002802122650001602150650001402166650001302180650001602193650001802209650001402227650000902241650002102250650001602271650001602287650001102303650001402314650000902328650002402337650002502361650002902386650002002415650001202435650001002447650002202457650001902479650000902498650001602507650001102523650001302534650001202547650001102559650001502570651001002585651001102595653001402606653001402620653001302634653001602647700002302663700002202686700001702708700001702725700001902742773013002761856008202891852000902973655001202982IND60517428020221119233553.0190803e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051742802DNAL7 a229319672pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800120039652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrosso, Giuseppe10aNutrition knowledge and other determinants of food intake and lifestyle habits in children and young adolescents living in a rural area of Sicily, South Italy  ap. 1827-1836.  aThe study aimed to test the reliability of a nutrition questionnaire and to assess potential associations between nutrition knowledge, food consumption and lifestyle behaviours, controlling for sociodemographic factors. Cross-sectional survey. Comprehensive school in the municipality of Butera, a rural area of Sicily, South Italy. The survey was conducted between March and May 2010 on 445 students (4–16 years). All constructs of the questionnaire had statistically significant Cronbach's α and Pearson's correlation coefficients, showing good internal consistency and temporal stability. After controlling for covariates, nutrition knowledge was positively associated with pasta/rice, fish, vegetable and fruit intakes, and negatively with sweets, snacks, fried foods and sugary drinks consumption. Moreover, students whose parents were in the highest educational and occupational categories reported eating significantly more fruits and vegetables and less meat, sweets, snacks, fried foods and sugary drinks. Students with higher nutrition knowledge scores were less likely to have two or more snacks daily and to spend more than 3 h in sedentary activities daily (OR = 0·89, 95 % CI 0·83, 0·97 and OR = 0·92, 95 % CI 0·86, 0·99, respectively). High parental education was associated with less frequent snacking and more frequent weekly physical activity, compared with lower categories, whereas high parental occupational category was associated with daily breakfast. Improving nutrition knowledge in children and young adolescents may translate into educating them in good dietary habits. Moreover, nutrition intervention programmes should also involve parents to improve dietary quality and nutritional habits of the entire family.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3abeverages 3achildren 3acorrelation 3aeating habits 3aeducation 3afish 3afood consumption 3afood intake 3afried foods 3afruits 3alifestyle 3ameat 3anutrition knowledge 3anutritional adequacy 3anutritional intervention 3anutritive value 3aparents 3apasta 3aphysical activity 3aquestionnaires 3arice 3arural areas 3asnacks 3astudents 3asurveys 3asweets 3avegetables 3aItaly 3aSicily 0aNutrition 0aLifestyle 0aChildren 0aAdolescents1 aMistretta, Antonio1 aTurconi, Giovanna1 aCena, Hellas1 aRoggi, Carla1 aGalvano, Fabio0 tPublic health nutrition.g2013 Oct., v. 16, no. 10 p.1827-1836dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800120039653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01321naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245010200155300001800257520025500275592002800530650002300558650001300581650001100594650002200605650001300627700001800640700001800658700001900676700002300695700002300718700002000741773012900761856007200890852000900962655001200971IND60657529820221120203358.0190816e20040727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065752982DNAL7 a10.1039/b404008b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtaka, Akira10aFacile synthesis of membrane-embedded peptides utilizing lipid bilayer-assisted chemical ligation  ap. 1722-1723.  aLipid bilayer-assisted chemical ligation between thiolester and N-terminal cysteine peptides has been developed with successful application to the synthesis of membrane protein segments possessing both two transmembrane and one extracellular regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3acysteine 3alipids 3amembrane proteins 3apeptides1 aUeda, Satoshi1 aTomita, Kenji1 aYano, Yoshiaki1 aTamamura, Hirokazu1 aMatsuzaki, Katsumi1 aFujii, Nobutaka0 tChemical communications.g2004 July 27, , no. 15 p.1722-1723dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b404008b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245017800161300001800339520129400357592002801651650001601679650002001695650001101715650001401726650001201740650001401752650002301766650002101789650004401810650002001854700001801874700002201892700002201914773010501936856007502041852000902116655001202125IND60578038520221122012912.0170811e20141223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057803852DNAL7 a10.1021/ma502151q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanazawa, Arihiro10aAlkoxyoxirane, a Unique Cyclic Monomer: Controlled Cationic Homopolymerization Mediated by Long-Lived Species and Copolymerization with Vinyl Ether via Alkoxy Group Transfer  ap. 8531-8540.  a1-Methoxy-2-methylpropylene oxide (MOMPO), an alkoxyoxirane that can generate a carbocation adjacent to an alkoxy group via ring-opening, was demonstrated to polymerize in a controlled manner with the use of a metal chloride as a Lewis acid catalyst. The choice of the initiating system is critical for the successful controlled homopolymerization of this alkoxyoxirane; a GaCl₃/THF system was observed to be the best combination for the initiating system. Furthermore, the copolymerization of MOMPO with isopropyl vinyl ether (IPVE) generated long-lived species when CF₃SO₃H/nBu₄NI was used as the initiating system. Surprisingly, the reaction proceeded via the transfer of the alkoxy group in the IPVE unit. More specifically, the isopropoxy group at the penultimate IPVE unit transferred to the MOMPO-derived propagating cation after the crossover reaction from the IPVE-derived carbocation to MOMPO. This type of reaction creates a side group that possesses the ring-opened MOMPO structure with the isopropoxy group. The generation of copolymers via the “alkoxy-group transfer” mechanism is unique to the copolymerization in this study and was confirmed by ¹H, ¹³C, and 2D NMR analyses and by the acid hydrolysis and subsequent reacetalization reactions of the products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aacid hydrolysis 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acations 3achlorides 3acomposite polymers 3acopolymerization 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3astable isotopes1 aKanda, Shungo1 aKanaoka, Shokyoku1 aAoshima, Sadahito0 tMacromolecules.g2014 Dec. 23, v. 47, no. 24 p.8531-8540dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma502151q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03523naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245022300182300001600405520171400421592002802135650001702163650003802180650002802218650001302246650001602259650003902275650002302314650001002337650006302347650002402410650002302434650005902457650004102516650004302557650002602600650004602626650001602672650003902688700001802727700002302745700002302768700001802791700001902809700001902828773010102847856004802948852000902996655001203005IND4481865720221118105732.0120307e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448186572DNAL7 a220524082pmid7 a10.1007/s11120-011-9701-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagy, Gergely10aDynamic properties of photosystem II membranes at physiological temperatures characterized by elastic incoherent neutron scattering. Increased flexibility associated with the inactivation of the oxygen evolving complex  ap. 113-124.  aElastic incoherent neutron scattering (EINS), a non-invasive technique which is capable of measuring the mean square displacement of atoms in the sample, has been widely used in biology for exploring the dynamics of proteins and lipid membranes but studies on photosynthetic systems are scarce. In this study we investigated the dynamic characteristics of Photosystem II (PSII) membrane fragments between 280 and 340 K, i.e., in the physiological temperature range and in the range of thermal denaturation of some of the protein complexes. The mean square displacement values revealed the presence of a hydration-sensitive transition in the sample between 310 and 320 K, suggesting that the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) plays an important role in the transition. Indeed, in samples in which the OEC had been removed by TRIS- or heat-treatments (323 and 333 K) no such transition was found. Further support on the main role of OEC in these reorganizations is provided by data obtained from differential scanning calorimetry experiments, showing marked differences between the untreated and TRIS-treated samples. In contrast, circular dichroism spectra exhibited only minor changes in the excitonic interactions below 323 K, showing that the molecular organization of the pigment-protein complexes remains essentially unaffected. Our data, along with earlier incoherent neutron scattering data on PSII membranes at cryogenic temperatures (Pieper et al., Biochemistry 46:11398–11409, 2007), demonstrate that this technique can be applied to characterize the dynamic features of PSII membranes, and can be used to investigate photosynthetic membranes under physiologically relevant experimental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3adenaturation 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aoxygen evolving complex 3aproteins 3atemperature 2aCalorimetry, Differential Scanning 2aCircular Dichroism 2aLight 2aLight-Harvesting Protein Complexesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aNeutron Diffraction 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complexxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aScattering, Radiation 2aSpinacia oleraceaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aTemperature 2aThylakoidsxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aPieper, Jörg1 aKrumova, Sashka B.1 aKovács, László,1 aTrapp, Marcus1 aGarab, Győző1 aPeters, Judith0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2012 Mar., v. 111, no. 1-2 p.113-124dSpringer-Verlagx0166-85957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-011-9701-x  aDNAL 7aarticle01233naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245011200166300001500278520035500293592002800648650002200676650001600698650001400714650001700728700001700745700001900762773010500781856004800886852000900934655001200943IND4515768220221121220756.0151006e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451576822DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348120201162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmolenkov, A.

Here, we applied a combination of karyological and molecular methods to investigate chromosomal structure, molecular organization and evolution of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in nightshade, Atropa belladonna (fam. Solanaceae), one of the oldest known allohexaploids among flowering plants. Because of their abundance and specific molecular organization (evolutionarily conserved coding regions linked to variable intergenic spacers, IGS), 45S and 5S rDNA are widely used in plant taxonomic and evolutionary studies. RESULTS: Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequencing of A. belladonna 45S rDNA repeats revealed a general structure characteristic of other Solanaceae species, and a very high sequence similarity of two length variants, with the only difference in number of short IGS subrepeats. These results combined with the detection of three pairs of 45S rDNA loci on separate chromosomes, presumably inherited from both tetraploid and diploid ancestor species, example intensive sequence homogenization that led to substitution/elimination of rDNA repeats of one parent. Chromosome silver-staining revealed that only four out of six 45S rDNA sites are frequently transcriptionally active, demonstrating nucleolar dominance. For 5S rDNA, three size variants of repeats were detected, with the major class represented by repeats containing all functional IGS elements required for transcription, the intermediate size repeats containing partially deleted IGS sequences, and the short 5S repeats containing severe defects both in the IGS and coding sequences. While shorter variants demonstrate increased rate of based substitution, probably in their transition into pseudogenes, the functional 5S rDNA variants are nearly identical at the sequence level, pointing to their origin from a single parental species. Localization of the 5S rDNA genes on two chromosome pairs further supports uniparental inheritance from the tetraploid progenitor. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained molecular, cytogenetic and phylogenetic data demonstrate complex evolutionary dynamics of rDNA loci in allohexaploid species of Atropa belladonna. The high level of sequence unification revealed in 45S and 5S rDNA loci of this ancient hybrid species have been seemingly achieved by different molecular mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAtropa belladonna 3adiploidy 3ahomogenization 3ahybrids 3aintergenic DNA 3aloci 3amolecular cloning 3aphylogeny 3aplant taxonomy 3apseudogenes 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence homology 3atetraploidy 3atranscription (genetics)1 aPanchuk, Irina I.1 aBorisjuk, Nikolai V.1 aHosiawa-Baranska, Marta1 aMaluszynska, Jolanta1 aHemleben, Vera0 tBMC plant biology.g2017 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.21-21dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-017-0978-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245012200206300001600328520163400344592002801978650002102006650001102027650001302038650001502051650001302066650001202079650001102091650001502102650003302117650001602150653001802166653002102184653001202205653002002217653002602237700001902263700001602282700001902298773010802317856008402425852000902509655001202518IND60611080720221116145910.0180830e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061108072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ruikun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5712-743810aExperimental investigation of synergistic behaviors of lignite and wasted activated sludge during their co-combustion  ap. 271-279.  aTo explore the feasibility of co-combustion of lignite and wasted activated sludge (WAS) and examine their synergistic effects, combustion of lignite–WAS blend at a mass ratio of 90:10 in a horizontal tube furnace was conducted. Results showed that the synergistic effects occurred between lignite and WAS during their co-combustion because the actual conversion ratio of combustible substances (CR) was higher than the theoretical prediction. Effects of furnace temperature and O2 concentration of inlet atmosphere on CR were also determined. High furnace temperature and O2 concentration of the inlet atmosphere resulted in high CR. In the early combustion stage, the furnace temperature played a major role. In the middle stage, the furnace temperature and O2 concentration of the inlet atmosphere exhibited a combined effect. In the late state, the O2 concentration of the combustion atmosphere played a key role. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photos indicated that the micro appearance of solid particles and their changing trends during the combustion of lignite–WAS blend were similar to those of lignite because of the high proportion of lignite (90%) in the blend. However, when compared to the case of lignite, the solid particles of the lignite–WAS blend were smaller, rougher, and looser in structure as the combustion progressed. In the solid combustion products of blend, carbon (C), oxygen (O), and chlorine (Cl) contents exhibited different evolution behaviors. The C content first increased and decreased, the O content first decreased and increased, and the Cl content continuously decreased to zero.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3acarbon 3achlorine 3acombustion 3afurnaces 3alignite 3aoxygen 3aprediction 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 0aCo-combustion 0aConversion ratio 0aLignite 0aSludge handling 0aSynergistic behaviors1 aZhao, Zhenghui1 aQiu, Lichun1 aLiu, Jianzhong0 tFuel processing technology.g2017 Feb., v. 156 p.271-279dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02184naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245010100175520103800276592002801314650002301342650001201365650001901377650002301396650001501419650002001434651001101454651000901465700001901474700002401493700002901517700002301546700001801569700002001587773010601607856008801713852000901801655001201810IND60743896820221116140945.0220205e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074389682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2021.1023152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCundill, Georgina10aToward a climate mobilities research agenda: Intersectionality, immobility, and policy responses  aMobility is a key livelihood and risk management strategy, including in the context of climate change. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced long standing concerns that migrant populations remain largely overlooked in economic development, adaptation to climate change, and spatial planning. We synthesize evidence across multiple studies that confirms the overwhelming preponderance of in-country and short distance rather than international migration in climate change hotspots in Asia and Africa. The emerging findings highlight the critical importance of addressing immobility and the intersecting social determinants that influence who can move and who cannot in development policy. This evidence suggests a more focused climate mobilities research agenda that includes understanding multiple drivers of mobility and multi-directional movement; intersecting social factors that determine mobility for some and immobility for others; and the implications for mobility and immobility under climate change and the COVID-19 recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adevelopment policy 3alivelihood 3arisk management 3aAfrica 3aAsia1 aSingh, Chandni1 aAdger, William Neil1 aSafra de Campos, Ricardo1 aVincent, Katharine1 aTebboth, Mark1 aMaharjan, Amina0 tGlobal environmental change.g2021 July, v. 69 p.102315-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2063x0959-37807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2021.1023153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01759naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008000168300001400248520079300262592002801055650001501083650002501098650002301123650001401146650001501160650002001175650001501195700001401210700001701224773010201241856008101343852000901424655001201433IND60477917120221119122952.0160108e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047791712DNAL7 a10.1007/s00271-015-0477-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStringam, Blair,10aIntegration of irrigation district personnel with canal automation projects  ap. 33-40.  aCanal companies are adapting automation equipment to assist in the management of their canal systems and provide water to users at a near constant flow rate.

These rewards include nectar and swollen thorn domatia, and their production can be inducible. Theory predicts that costly rewards should be relaxed if the risk of herbivory is reduced, although this has not been previously demonstrated. Acacia drepanolobium trees in East Africa produce two ant rewards, extrafloral nectar and swollen thorns. We compared the rewards offered by trees experimentally protected from mammalian browsing for seven years with those offered by unprotected trees. Protected trees produced 25% fewer nectaries per leaf and 25% fewer swollen thorns than did trees in browsed plots. Relaxation of indirect defenses when trees are protected from herbivores is consistent with the dual hypotheses that inducible defenses are dynamic and that plants can save costs by relaxing these defenses when they are not needed. Among trees exposed to mammalian herbivores, trees that were browsed within roughly the past year provided rewards for ants similar to those provided by trees exposed to herbivores but not browsed within the past year. This result suggests that relaxation of indirect defenses only occurs following more than one year of protection from mammalian herbivory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia drepanolobium 3aFormicidae 3abrowsing 3aherbivores 3aleaves 3amammals 3anectar 3anectaries 3aplant spines 3arisk 3atrees 3aEastern Africa1 aKarban, Richard1 aYoung, Truman P.1 aPalmer, Todd M.0 tEcology.g2004 Mar., v. 85, no. 3 p.609-614dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/03-30563Available from publisher's site 7aarticle04203naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245018100213300001600394520210500410592002802515650002102543650001902564650001502583650002302598650001202621650001002633650001402643650002302657650001002680650001402690650001002704650002502714650001002739650003002749650001702779650001002796650000902806650002602815650001702841650003102858653003102889653001402920653001502934653000802949653001002957700005802967700005803025700005903083700006203142700005903204700002603263700005803289773016003347856008503507852000903592655001203601IND60772535420221121013230.0220531e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077253542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2022.03.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLucchinetti, Eliana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3338-127910aGut microbiome and circulating bacterial DNA (“blood microbiome”) in a mouse model of total parenteral nutrition: Evidence of two distinct separate microbiotic compartments  ap. 278-288.  aTotal parenteral nutrition (TPN) causes gut atrophy, dysbiosis and leakage of the gut barrier. This study aimed to characterize the gut microbiome in response to different TPNs and tested the hypothesis whether increased gut permeability in TPN would lead to changes in the circulating bacterial DNA (“blood microbiome”). Male C57BL/6J mice were randomly allocated to the following groups for seven days (1) chow-fed control (C) without jugular vein catheter (JVC, n=6) (2) chow-fed with JVC and infusion of saline (S) (n = 6) (3) Intralipid-based TPN (n-6:n-3 ratio 7:1) (IL, n = 6) (4) Omegaven-based TPN (n-6:n-3 ratio 1:8) (OV, n = 6). Blood was collected by cardiac puncture and feces (stool pellet) were collected from the colon. Blood and stool samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. TPN administration was associated with a compositional shift in the gut microbial community that involved the expansion of Bacteroidota along with a decrease in gut bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes phylum as compared to chow-fed mice. Gram-negative Verrucomicrobiota and Proteobacteria were also increased in the gut microbiome of mice receiving TPN. Gammaproteobacteria, namely Burkholderiales, were specifically increased in Intralipid-based TPN. On the other hand, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteriota were the dominant taxa in blood samples. The families Comamonadaceae and Burkholderiaceae (both from Burkholderiales order) were increased in the “blood microbiome” of mice with indwelling JVC when compared with chow-fed mice without JVC. The increase in Burkholderiaceae was more pronounced in Intralipid-based TPN. Profound changes in the gut microbiome of mice subjected to TPN occurred, which were not reflected in the “blood microbiome” suggesting that the gut and “blood microbiome” represent two rather distinct separate microbiotic compartments. The parenteral provision of n-3 fatty acids appears to protect against proinflammatory bacteria in the gut and against the increased presence of JVC-associated bacteria as measured by circulating bacterial DNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderiaceae 3aComamonadaceae 3aFirmicutes 3aabsorption barrier 3aatrophy 3ablood 3acatheters 3aclinical nutrition 3acolon 3adysbiosis 3afeces 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3agenes 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ajugular vein 3amales 3amice 3amicrobial communities 3apermeability 3atotal parenteral nutrition 0aTotal parenteral nutrition 0aDysbiosis 0aMicrobiome 0aGut 0aBlood1 aLou, Phing-How1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2090-11321 aLemal, Philipp1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6142-94551 aBestmann, Lukas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6444-94191 aHersberger, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4472-329X1 aRogler, Gerhard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1733-91881 aKrämer, Stefanie D.,1 aZaugg, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2016-89730 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2022 June, v. 49 p.278-288dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2022.03.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03303naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100003000188245008000218300001600298506007600314520165000390592002802040506003702068650002202105650002002127650002002147650001302167650002602180650002302206650001002229650001302239650002002252650001102272650001402283650001302297650001402310650001402324650001502338650002202353650000902375650002002384650001402404653002802418653002102446653000902467653002202476653002002498773014002518856008202658852000902740655001202749IND60517511520221207054150.0190728e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051751152DNAL7 aPMC37565432pmcid7 a230957642pmid7 a10.1017/S00296651120027412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVernarelli, Jacqueline A.10aImpact of genetic risk assessment on nutrition-related lifestyle behaviours  ap. 153-159.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenetic susceptibility testing for common complex disease is a practice that is currently in clinical use. There are two types of gene mutations, and therefore, two varieties of genotype testing: deterministic and susceptibility. As the term suggests, deterministic genes determine whether or not a person will develop a given trait in Mendelian fashion, such as Huntington's disease. Genotype screening for such deterministic mutations has existed for decades, and is commonly used in routine medical practice. In recent years, the sequencing of the human genome has identified several ‘susceptibility genes’ or genes with incomplete penetrance. Mutations in these genes may increase disease susceptibility, but are not causative for disease. Genetic susceptibility testing allows unaffected individuals to obtain risk information for a variety of common complex diseases and health conditions including Alzheimer's disease (AD), CVD, cancer and diabetes. The availability of genetic susceptibility testing has increased over the past decade, and several studies are now focusing on the impact that genetic testing has on health and other lifestyle behaviours related to nutrition. The aim of this paper is to review the literature and evaluate what, if any, impact genetic risk assessment has on behaviours related to nutrition and physical activity. This paper summarises seven clinical studies that evaluated the impact of disclosing genetic risk information for disease on nutrition-related health behaviour changes. Of these seven studies, only three studies reported that health behaviour change was influenced by genotype disclosure.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlzheimer disease 3abehavior change 3aclinical trials 3adiabetes 3adiet-related diseases 3adisease resistance 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahealth behavior 3ahumans 3alifestyle 3amutation 3aneoplasms 3anutrition 3apenetrance 3aphysical activity 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3ascreening 0aGenetic risk assessment 0aBehaviour change 0aDiet 0aPhysical activity 0aGenetic testing0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2013 Feb., v. 72, no. 1 p.153-159dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45480x1475-27197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00296651120027413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04341naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001400188245009800202300001100300506007600311520229500387592002802682596005902710596008002769596005202849506003702901650003602938650001702974650002002991650001903011650002303030650002303053650001203076650001103088650001903099650002603118650001203144650001303156650001003169650001203179650001603191650001603207650001403223650001103237650001803248650001303266650001303279650001903292650001703311650001403328650001103342650001203353650001103365651001003376700001803386700003003404700001403434700001303448773010303461856008203564852000903646655001203655IND60572361920221207064909.0200107e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057236192DNAL7 a281149052pmid7 aPMC52599742pmcid7 a10.1186/s12870-017-0976-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Linli10aAppropriate NH4+: NO3− ratio improves low light tolerance of mini Chinese cabbage seedlings  ap. 22.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: In northwest of China, mini Chinese cabbage (Brassica pekinensis) is highly valued by consumers, and is widely cultivated during winter in solar-greenhouses where low light (LL) fluence (between 85 and 150 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ in day) is a major abiotic stress factor limiting plant growth and crop productivity. The mechanisms with which various NH₄⁺: NO₃⁻ ratios affected growth and photosynthesis of mini Chinese cabbage under normal (200 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹) and low (100 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹) light conditions was investigated. The four solutions with different ratios of NH₄⁺: NO₃⁻ applied were 0:100, 10:90, 15:85 and 25:75 with the set up in a glasshouse in hydroponic culture. The most appropriate NH₄⁺: NO₃⁻ ratio that improved the tolerance of mini Chinese cabbage seedlings to LL was found in our current study. RESULTS: Under low light, the application of NH₄⁺: NO₃⁻ (10:90) significantly stimulated growth compared to only NO₃⁻ by increasing leaf area, canopy spread, biomass accumulation, and net photosynthetic rate. The increase in net photosynthetic rate was associated with an increase in: 1) maximum and effective quantum yield of PSII; 2) activities of Calvin cycle enzymes; and 3) levels of mRNA relative expression of several genes involved in Calvin cycle. In addition, glucose, fructose, sucrose, starch and total carbohydrate, which are the products of CO₂ assimilation, accumulated most in the cabbage leaves that were supplied with NH₄⁺: NO₃⁻ (10:90) under LL condition. Low light reduced the carbohydrate: nitrogen (C: N) ratio while the application of NH₄⁺: NO₃⁻ (10:90) alleviated the negative effect of LL on C: N ratio mainly by increasing total carbohydrate contents. CONCLUSIONS: The application of NH₄⁺:NO₃⁻ (10:90) increased rbcL, rbcS, FBA, FBPase and TK expression and/or activities, enhanced photosynthesis, carbohydrate accumulation and improved the tolerance of mini Chinese cabbage seedlings to LL. The results of this study would provide theoretical basis and technical guidance for mini Chinese cabbage production. In practical production, the ratio of NH₄⁺:NO₃⁻ should be adjusted with respect to light fluence for successful growing of mini Chinese cabbage.  aPublisher supplied data  a31260473cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a201203001cSpecial Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest  aCARS-25-C-07cChina Agriculture Research System0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrassica rapa subsp. pekinensis 3aCalvin cycle 3aChinese cabbage 3aabiotic stress 3aammonium compounds 3abiomass production 3acabbage 3acanopy 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aenzymes 3afructose 3agenes 3aglucose 3agreenhouses 3ahydroponics 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amessenger RNA 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aphotosystem II 3aplant growth 3aseedlings 3astarch 3asucrose 3awinter 3aChina1 aLiao, Weibiao1 aDawuda, Mohammed Mujitaba1 aYu, Jihua1 aLv, Jian0 tBMC plant biology.g2017 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.22-22dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-017-0976-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02219naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245012200170300002000292520098600312592002801298650001201326650001501338650001301353650001901366650001301385650001301398650001101411650002601422650001101448650001401459650001301473700002001486700002901506700001801535700001801553700001801571773012901589856008201718852000901800655001201809IND60579778520180712000000.0170831e20170831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057977852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b060932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenghalem, M.

Their size range from 10 μm to a few nanometers. The acidity measurement (i.e number, strength and location) were carried out by so-called conventional techniques: adsorption followed by infrared spectroscopy of various basic probe molecules (CO, C₂H₄, pyridine) and model reaction (n-hexane cracking). The extreme crystal downsize lowers the acid strength. These results are confirmed also by using an innovative technique: the reversed-flow inverse chromatography (RF-IGC). The involvement of the external and internal zeolitic species depend on the adsorbed molecules and the operating conditions: (i) the high content of extra-framework aluminum enhance the n-hexane cracking activity owing to the exaltation of the Brønsted sites strength, and (ii) the RF-IGC technique show an important involvement of the silanol groups (mainly present on the nanosized zeolite) in lateral interactions with ethylene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3achromatography 3acracking 3aethylene 3ahexane 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amodels 3apyridines 3azeolites1 aPinard, Ludovic1 aComparot, Jean-Dominique1 aAstafan, Amir1 aDaou, T.

We included 45 women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment. After collecting GCs from each patient, total RNA was extracted from 12 samples. Using Illumina/deep-sequencing technology, we analyzed the small RNAs in each group. Using the R package, we identified the differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs among patients with varying levels of ovarian reserve function. We identified 20 conserved and 3 novel miRNAs that were upregulated in the poor ovarian response (POR) group and 30 conserved miRNAs and 1 novel miRNA that were upregulated in the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) group. Bioinformatics analysis revealed complementary pairing between miR-23a and the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the Sirt1 mRNA. miR-23a can regulate SIRT1 protein expression at the posttranscriptional level in GCs. Overexpressing miR-23a can inhibit the expression of SIRT1, decrease the stimulatory effect of SIRT1 on the ERK1/2 pathway, inhibit the expression of p-ERK1/2, and increase apoptosis in GCs. Previous studies confirmed that miR-23a targets SIRT1 and promotes apoptosis in GCs by inhibiting the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. This study provides a novel perspective regarding the role of miRNAs in the regulation of human GC apoptosis in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abioinformatics 3acomputer software 3afollicular fluid 3agene expression regulation 3agranulosa cells 3ahumans 3aintracytoplasmic sperm injection 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3apatients 3apolycystic ovary syndrome 3aprotein synthesis 3asignal transduction 3awomen 0aFF 0aGCs 0amiRNAs 0aDE 0aPOF 0aPCOS 0aART 0aIVF 0aICSI 0aIRB 0aAFC 0aAMH 0aCOS 0aGnRH 0aDMEM 0aFBS 0aRINs 0aGO 0aKEGG 0aRIPA 0aBCA 0aSDS-PAGE 0aPVDF 0aMAPK 0acKO 0amicroRNAs 0aGranulosa cells 0aOvarian reserve 0aDeep sequencing 0amiR-23a1 aHan, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0871-18811 aLiu, Jiao1 aZhang, Yunshan0 tGene.g2019 Feb. 20, v. 686 p.250-260dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2018.11.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01522naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245009000152300002000242520030700262592002800569650002600597650002600623650003200649650002300681650002700704650002300731650002300754650001600777650001500793650003000808650001500838700002800853700001500881700002100896773013600917856007401053852000901127655001201136IND60659974920221120231851.0190823e20131010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065997492DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc45551c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Lei10aEfficient asymmetric synthesis of lamivudine via enzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution  ap. 10376-10378.  aThe anti-HIV nucleoside lamivudine was asymmetrically synthesized in only three steps via a novel surfactant-treated subtilisin Carlsberg-catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution protocol.

The P demand for a growing pig comprises requirements for maintenance and tissue deposition. The P in feed ingredients, however, must be digested and absorbed before its ultimate partition between the 2 aforementioned requirement components. Phosphorus from various sources could behave differently during digestion and absorption, which results in their disparate bioavailability for pigs. The system of standardized total tract digestibility reflects true total tract digestibility of P and feed ingredient effects on specific endogenous P loss with relative ease of implementation, and this system guarantees satisfactory additivity in digestible P among the ingredients in a diet—the foundation for diet formulation. The basal endogenous P loss, which is much easier to measure than the specific endogenous P loss, is considered as part of the pig's maintenance requirement. With this arrangement, a digestibility framework is established both for measuring the P-providing capacity of various feed ingredients and for describing the pig's P requirement. This framework entails basic understanding of the function, digestion, absorption, excretion, and homeostasis of P as support pillars. Understanding the workings of this framework enables potential integration of factors such as environment conditions and disease status in future P requirement models. The current review discusses dietary sources, digestion, absorption, bioavailability and requirement of P for growing pigs to understand the status quo, revealing the points of consensus as well as those of debate, and to encourage further investigation to provide more clarity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3aanimal nutrition 3abioavailability 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3aexcretion 3ahomeostasis 3aphosphorus 3aswine 0aBioavailability 0aDigestibility 0aPhosphorus 0aPig 0aRequirement1 aAdeola, Olayiwola1 aLiu, Jingbo0 tAnimal nutrition.g2022 June, v. 9 p.127-137dElsevier B.V.aChinese Association of Animal Science and Veterinary MedicinewJournal:23216x2405-65457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aninu.2022.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001200144245011700156300002000273520140900293592002801702650001501730650002401745650002201769650001401791650001301805650002901818650001101847650002001858653001901878653002101897653002001918653002001938653002301958700001201981700001801993700001602011700002702027773012902054856007802183852000902261655001202270IND60570009920221119051609.0170627e20170614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057000992DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b030982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Qi10aFacile and Large-Area Preparation of Porous Ag3PO4 Photoanodes for Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation  ap. 19507-19512.  aPhotoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising approach for renewable energy, where the development of efficient photoelectrodes, especially photoanodes for water oxidation is still challenging. In this paper, we report the novel solution-processed microcrystalline Ag₃PO₄ photoanodes with tunable porosity depending on the reaction time. These porous Ag₃PO₄ films were grown on large-area (4.5 × 4.5 cm²) silver substrates via an air-exposed and room-temperature immersion reaction. Enhanced light absorption abilities were exhibited by the synthesized Ag₃PO₄ films with optimized porosity resulted from prolonged reaction times (≥20 h), due to which appreciable water splitting performance was demonstrated when they were utilized as photoanodes. Particularly, the highly porous 20 h Ag₃PO₄ photoanode presented a photocurrent density of around 4.32 mA/cm², which is nearly three times higher than that of the nonporous 1 h Ag₃PO₄ photoanode (1.48 mA/cm²) at 1 V vs Ag/AgCl. Moreover, superior stability of the 20 h Ag₃PO₄ photoanode has also been confirmed by the 5 h successive PEC water splitting experiment. Therefore, both the scalable and facile fabrication method, and considerable photoactivity and stability of these Ag₃PO₄ photoanodes together suggest their great potential for efficient solar-to-fuel energy conversion and other PEC applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aambient temperature 3aenergy conversion 3aoxidation 3aporosity 3arenewable energy sources 3asilver 3asilver chloride 0aorthophosphate 0aionic conductors 0aporous material 0awater oxidation 0ascalable synthesis1 aYu, Jun1 aYuan, Kaiping1 aZhong, Miao1 aDelaunay, Jean-Jacques0 tACS applied materials .g2017 June 14, v. 9, no. 23 p.19507-19512dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b030983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245009300213300001600306500001900322520145800341592002801799650001401827650001501841650001701856650001601873650001701889650001501906650001301921650004301934650001301977650002201990650001402012653003302026653002302059653001902082653002202101700001902123700002802142700002502170700002002195700002102215700006502236773014602301856008302447852000902530655001202539IND60707351920221120105205.0200907e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070735192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.07.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLombardo, Maria Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4685-350310a3D polymeric supports promote the growth and progression of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma  ap. 223-227.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAnaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a rare and aggressive malignancy that accounts for the majority of deaths from all thyroid cancers. ATC exhibits invasiveness and highly resistance to conventional therapies which include cytotoxic chemotherapy, the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibition and, more recently, immunotherapies, that have shown promising but still limited results. A growing knowledge on ATC tumor biology is needed for developing more effective therapies with significant better survival. Researchers have begun to utilize 3D models to culture cancer cells for in vitro studies. In this work, C643 ATC cell line was cultured on polymeric scaffolds with high-interconnected porous matrix. They exhibited distinct viability, proliferation and 3D morphology similar to an in vivo solid tumor mass. We also carried out quantitative real-time PCR experiments for monitoring Cancer Stem Cells enrichment, since they are most probably the cause of tumor resistance, reoccurrence and metastasis. The same tests were performed after cell treatment with the chemotherapic Doxorubicin. An up-regulation of the analyzed stem-cell markers confirmed the high resistance to treatment of these cell line with respect to conventional drugs. In conclusion, 3D scaffolds could be an ideal platform for studying the mechanisms that regulate ACT growth and survival and also improving novel therapeutic approaches for treatment-resistant thyroid cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinoma 3acell lines 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3ametastasis 3apolymers 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aresearch 3athyroid neoplasms 3aviability 0aAnaplastic thyroid carcinoma 0aPolymeric scaffold 0a3D tumor model 0aStem cell markers1 aZito, Giovanni1 aPavia, Francesco Carfì1 aPizzolanti, Giuseppe1 aGiordano, Carla1 aBrucato, Valerio1 aLa Carrubba, Vincenzo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3185-83980 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 531, no. 2 p.223-227dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.07.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012200166300001400288520156100302592002801863650001901891650001201910650001601922650003801938650002201976650001301998650000902011650001202020650001902032650001302051650001702064650002302081650003502104650001802139653001002157653000902167653000902176653000802185653000902193653000802202653001402210653000802224653000702232653000702239653000802246653000702254653003502261653001102296653003502307653000902342700001802351700001702369700001902386773008602405856008302491852000902574655001202583IND60622871220221120204332.0190131e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062287122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2018.11.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Pingfeng10aAssociations between HMGB1 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility and clinical outcomes in Chinese Han sepsis patients  ap. 23-29.  aHigh mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) is an important late inflammatory mediator in the body. In recent years, studies have found that it plays an important pathogenic role in various diseases such as sepsis. However, it is unclear whether the genetic variation of the HMGB1 gene is related to the susceptibility to sepsis. This study investigated the relationship between susceptibility and outcome of the HMGB1 gene rs2249825, rs1045411, and rs1360485 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Chinese Han patients with sepsis.The HMGB1 gene rs2249825, rs1045411, and rs1360485 genotypes were detected by the direct sequencing method in 345 patients with sepsis and 345 healthy controls. Serum HMGB1 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).The HMGB1 gene rs2249825 and rs1045411 site SNPs were associated with sepsis risk, but the rs1360485 site SNP was not associated with sepsis risk. Subjects with the HMGB1 gene rs2249825 and rs1045411 site mutations had higher serum HMGB1 levels, and patients with mutant genotype sepsis had higher APACHE II scores and lower 30-day survival rates. There were no correlations among the rs1360485 site SNP, sepsis risk, and patient 30-day survival.The HMGB1 gene rs2249825 and rs1045411 site SNPs are associated with susceptibility and outcomes of Chinese Han patients with sepsis. The rs2249825 locus C allele and the rs1045411 locus A allele are high risk factors for sepsis and severity in the Chinese Han population, and are associated with adverse outcomes in patients with sepsis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese people 3aalleles 3ablood serum 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3aloci 3amutants 3anucleoproteins 3apatients 3arisk factors 3asepsis (infection) 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asurvival rate 0aHMGB1 0aSNPs 0aSIRS 0aDCI 0aOSCC 0aBMI 0aAPACHE II 0aHWE 0aOR 0aCI 0aRPL 0aRA 0aHigh mobility group protein B1 0aSepsis 0aSingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aRisk1 aWang, Licheng1 aNi, Jianming1 aZhang, Yunlong0 tGene.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 687 p.23-29dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2018.11.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014100163300001800304520166000322592002801982650002002010650002502030650001202055650002002067650001602087650003602103650002302139650001102162650001702173650001802190650002102208650001902229650002502248650001302273700001602286700001702302700001602319700002002335700001702355700001402372700001602386773013502402856008102537852000902618655001202627IND60121326320221119224442.0150224e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012132632DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-014-3581-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Dafei10aEffect of exogenous nitric oxide on antioxidative system and S-nitrosylation in leaves of Boehmeria nivea (L.) Gaud under cadmium stress  ap. 3489-3497.  aCadmium (Cd)-induced growth inhibition is one of the primary factors limiting phytoremediation effect of Boehmeria nivea (L.) Gaud in contaminated soil. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a donor of nitric oxide (NO), has been evidenced to alleviate Cd toxicity in many plants. However, as an important mechanism of NO in orchestrating cellular functions, S-nitrosylation is still poorly understood in its relation with Cd tolerance of plants. In this study, higher exogenous NO levels were found to coincide with higher S-nitrosylation level expressed as content of S-nitrosothiols (SNO). The addition of low concentration (100 μM) SNP increased the SNO content, and it simultaneously induced an alleviating effect against Cd toxicity by enhancing the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione reductase (GR) and reduced the accumulation of H₂O₂as compared with Cd alone. Application of S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) inhibitors dodecanoic acid (DA) in 100 μM SNP group brought in an extra elevation in S-nitrosylation level and further reinforced the effect of SNP. While the additions of 400 μM SNP and 400 μM SNP + 50 μM DA further elevated the S-nitrosylation level, it markedly weakened the alleviating effect against Cd toxicity as compared with the addition of 100 μM SNP. This phenomenon could be owing to excess consumption of glutathione (GSH) to form SNO under high S-nitrosylation level. Therefore, the present study indicates that S-nitrosylation is involved in the ameliorating effect of SNP against Cd toxicity. This involvement exhibited a concentration-dependent property.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBoehmeria nivea 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acadmium 3adodecanoic acid 3aglutathione 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3agrowth retardation 3aleaves 3anitric oxide 3anitroprusside 3aphytoremediation 3apolluted soils 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity1 aLiu, Yunguo1 aTan, Xiaofei1 aLiu, Hongyu1 aZeng, Guangming1 aHu, Xinjiang1 aJian, Hao1 aKu, Yenlin,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2015 Mar., v. 22, no. 5 p.3489-3497dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3581-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009100167506011700258506007600375520144800451592002801899506003701927650002001964650002101984650001902005650001102024650002802035650001802063650002302081650001702104650002402121650002102145650001102166650001002177650003202187650001902219650002002238650001602258650001402274650001902288650001102307651001302318653001802331653001402349653002102363653001502384700002002399700001902419773011202438856008502550852000902635655001202644IND60772535620221207101052.0220502e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077253562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.parepi.2022.e002482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbera, Akalu10aEpidemiological status of bovine cysticercosis and human taeniasis in Eastern Ethiopia  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBovine cysticercosis and human taeniasis are among the leading cause of economic loss in Ethiopia due to organ condemnation and treatment costs. A cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2017 to July 2018 on randomly selected carcasses from Jigjiga, Babile and Dire Dawa town municipal abattoirs to estimate the prevalence of bovine cysticercosis. Besides, a questionnaire was administered to the human population of these towns to understand risk of human taeniasis. The overall prevalence of Cysticercus bovis was 27.3% (302/1108). Among the examined predilection sites, the highest prevalence was observed in the liver (9.6%), and the tongue (8.5%). From the total of 686C. bovis cysts collected, 289 (42.0%) were viable, while the other 397 (58.0%) were non-viable cysts. Three predictors, namely study location, age and body condition, were significantly associated with C. bovis (p ≤ 0.001). Among the 900 respondents interviewed, 432 had contracted Taenia saginata infection. Risk factors like occupation, sex, marital status, educational status and raw beef consumption habit were significantly associated with T. saginata infection (p ≤ 0.001). The findings of this study indicated the importance of bovine cysticercosis and taeniasis in the study areas. Therefore, attention should be given to public awareness and detailed meat inspection for the safety of the public and promotion of the country's meat industry.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTaenia saginata 3abeef consumption 3abody condition 3acattle 3across-sectional studies 3acysticercosis 3aeducational status 3aepidemiology 3afinancial economics 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3aliver 3alivestock and meat industry 3amarital status 3ameat inspection 3aoccupations 3aparasites 3aquestionnaires 3atongue 3aEthiopia 0aCysticercosis 0aTaeniasis 0aEastern Ethiopia 0aPrevalence1 aSibhat, Berhanu1 aAssefa, Ayalew0 tParasite epidemiology and control.g2022 May, v. 17 p.e00248-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23217x2405-67317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parepi.2022.e002483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245015300154300001800307520107300325592002801398650004401426650001701470650003801487650001901525650001101544650004401555650002301599650001901622650001301641650002301654650002101677700001301698700001901711773010501730856007501835852000901910655001201919IND60578038820221121022133.0170811e20141223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057803882DNAL7 a10.1021/ma502297m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Kan13aAn Ultrahigh Performance Cross-Linked Polybenzoxazole via Thermal Conversion from Poly(benzoxazine amic acid) Based on Smart o-Benzoxazine Chemistry  ap. 8674-8681.  aA main-chain-type polybenzoxazine with amic acid and benzoxazine groups as repeating units, generally termed as poly(benzoxazine amic acid) (poly(BZaa)), has been synthesized. Different from traditional main-chain polybenzoxazines, poly(BZaa) can undergo polymerization and imidization reactions to form cross-linked polyimide (cPI) after certain thermal treatment. cPI can further undergo a typical cyclization to give cross-linked polybenzoxazole (cPBO) after an additional thermal treatment. A model reaction is designed based on the reaction of 3-phenyl-2,4-dihydro-2H-benzo[e][1,3]oxazin-9-amine with a phthalic anhydride. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR) spectroscopies are used to confirm the structure of model compound. The ring-opening polymerization behavior of benzoxazine monomers and main-chain polybenzoxazine is studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Thermal properties of the cross-linked polymers are also studied by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acrosslinking 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aheat treatment 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphthalic anhydride 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry1 aLiu, Jia1 aIshida, Hatsuo0 tMacromolecules.g2014 Dec. 23, v. 47, no. 24 p.8674-8681dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma502297m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01844naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245014500166300002000311520074200331592002801073650001401101650001301115650001101128650001701139650001301156650001801169650001601187650002301203700001701226700001501243700001601258773012901274856008201403852000901485655001201494IND60579778720180712000000.0170831e20170831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057977872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b061752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKandaskalov, D.10aCatalytic Semihydrogenation of Acetylene on the (100) Surface of the o-Al13Co4 Quasicrystalline Approximant: Density Functional Theory Study  ap. 18738-18745.  aDensity functional theory calculations are used to investigate the catalytic properties of the o-Al₁₃Co₄(100) surface toward the semihydrogenation of acetylene. The dissociation of the H₂ molecule is the key process in this case, since the surface termination does not contain protruding Co atoms, according to a combination of surface science studies and ab initio calculations. However, compared to the pure Al(100) and Al(111) surfaces, H₂ dissociation on o-Al₁₃Co₄(100) proceeds much easier, due to the presence of surface Co atoms slightly below the mean position of the termination plane. A possible mechanism for the hydrogenation is presented, highlighting the selectivity of the reaction on this Al-rich surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylene 3aaluminum 3acobalt 3adissociation 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3amethodology 3aphysical chemistry1 aFournée, V.1 aLedieu, J.1 aGaudry, É.0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Aug. 31, v. 121, no. 34 p.18738-18745dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.7b061753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03576naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245020000165300001400365520166700379592002802046650001102074650001402085650001802099650002002117650001602137650001302153650001802166650001502184650002802199650001702227650001502244650001502259650002002274650001102294650002102305650000902326650001102335650001202346650001702358650001902375650001202394650001802406651001502424653002202439653001702461653001702478653003402495653002202529700002402551700001502575700002002590700002802610700002902638700001702667700001602684700002302700773011202723856008202835852000902917655001202926IND60584085320221118015636.0180905e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058408532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scp.2017.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, Areful10aInvestigation of in vitro thrombolytic and anti-helminthic activity and in vivo anxiolytic and antidepressant potentiality with phytochemical nature of methanolic extract of Leucas lavandulifolia  ap. 61-66.  aLeucas lavandulifolia, locally called ‘Halkusha or Donkolos’ is a well-known medicinal plant in Bangladesh. The crude methanolic extract of L. lavandulifolia was designed to investigate for its possible chemical groups, thrombolytic, anthelmintic, anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. Thrombolytic and anthelmintic activities were elucidated by taking human erythrocytes and earthworms as test models. The plant extract was divided into two different doses (200 and 400mg/kg body weight) for evaluating anxiolytic and CNS depressant property on swiss-albino mice by using different test models such as elevated plus maze, hole board, open field and forced Swim tests. The phytochemical analysis of the crude extract revealed the presence of alkaloids, carbohydrates, glycosides, tannins, flavonoids, phytosterols and phenols. In the thrombolytic test, the plant extract had produced dose dependent clot lysis potential in human erythrocytes at five different doses (2, 4, 6, 8, 10mg/ml), while standard streptokinase and water were used as positive and negative controls. Five different concentrations (10, 20, 30, 40 & 50mg/ml) of crude extract of L. lavandulifolia also showed marked anthelmintic property in earthworms in a dose dependent manner. Significant (p <0.01; p < 0.05) CNS depressant and anxiolytic activity were observed in case of both extract doses (200 and 400mg/kg body weight) which were comparable to the standard drug diazepam. Thus, the present study asserted the potentiality of L. lavandulifolia as thrombolytic, anthelmintic, anxiolytic and CNS depressant agents and therefore supports the traditional uses of this medicinal plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeucas 3aalkaloids 3aanthelmintics 3aantidepressants 3abody weight 3adiazepam 3adose response 3aearthworms 3aelevated plus-maze test 3aerythrocytes 3aflavonoids 3aglycosides 3agreen chemistry 3ahumans 3amedicinal plants 3amice 3amodels 3aphenols 3aphytosterols 3aplant extracts 3atannins 3atranquilizers 3aBangladesh 0aL. lavandulifolia 0aThrombolytic 0aAnthelmintic 0aAnxiolytic and CNS depressant 0aSwiss-albino mice1 aHussain, Md.

Molecular Microstructure  ap. 1155-1174.  aWe have studied the microstructure of latex suspensions formulated with hydrophobically modified ethylene (oxide) urethane (HEUR) thickener (or rheology modifier, RM) using small-angle neutron scattering under shear (rheo-SANS). Within the shear rate range studied (0–1000 s–¹), the neutron scattering profiles are consistent with a polydisperse core–shell model, with the latex particles comprising the core and an adsorbed layer of water-swollen RM on the latex surface forming the shell. The core–shell structure is isotropic under quiescent conditions but becomes anisotropic under shear (with the major axis along the vorticity direction). During shear, the solvent (D₂O/H₂O) is expelled (hydrodynamic squeezing) from the swollen polymer chains, and the shell structure becomes denser. The anisotropic shell is a result of differing degrees of compression along the flow and vorticity directions. With increasing shear rate, the shell thickness (in both the flow and vorticity direction) tends toward asymptotic values (with the shell thickness in the vorticity direction greater than the shell thickness in the flow direction) independent of the RM hydrophobe density (defined as the average number of hydrophobes per polymer chain). The RM concentration (w/w) in the adsorbed layer varies from ∼0.05–0.1 (at low shear) to ∼0.25–0.4 (high shear, ∼1000 s–¹) with higher values for the RM polymer with higher hydrophobe density. The swollen RM-water shell substantially increases the effective volume fraction of the dispersed latex particles. We find, however, that accounting for this increase within the conventional effective hard-sphere (Krieger–Dougherty) dispersion rheology model does not fully explain the higher viscosity of the formulated mixture. We hypothesize the existence of latex–latex interactions mediated by RM polymer bridges even at high shear. The large-scale structure of the particle assembly will be reported in a subsequent manuscript.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3aethylene 3aethylene oxide 3ahydrodynamics 3aisotropy 3alatex 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3aneutron diffraction 3apolymers 3arheology 3asolvents 3athickeners 3aurethane 3aviscosity1 aNakatani, Alan I.1 aVan Dyk, Antony

Further, with the obtained and processed data, we analyzed the mechanism and impact of land use change on minimum air temperature within the recent 50years in the Songnen Plain of China using climate tendency rate, Observation Minus Reanalysis (OMR) and spatial analysis methods. The analysis results can be summarized as follows. (1) The areas of agricultural land, built up, unused land, and forest land have increased and the areas of grassland and water have decreased from 1960 to 2010. In particular, the areas of unused land and built up have increased significantly with about 22 times and 9 times respectively compared with their areas in 1960.

There are different types of Miller cycle concept utilization through variation of valve timing either by early intake valve closure or late intake valve closure. In this study finite-volume method is used to analyse the performance and emission characteristics of a four-stroke 12-cylinder turbocharged Miller cycle gas engine. Therefore, experimental data are used to calibrate the results derived from 3D combustion simulation and 1D overall engine simulation. The Miller cycle application shows that about 30 CAD (crank angle degrees) advancement of IVC compared with standard cycle reduces emissions such as NOx to half its magnitude. However, a little reduction in power output seems inevitable. Also, compression ratio reduction contributes to almost 15% decrease in maximum in–cylinder pressure. Moreover, retardation of IVC simultaneously improves performance and emission characteristics. However, no significant change of in–cylinder peak pressure and temperature is seen.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3aemissions 3agas engines 3anitrogen oxides 3atemperature 0aMiller cycle 0aGas engine 0aPerformance 0aEmission1 aJazayeri, S.

Fuel sources and building services are also evolving over time as well as across regions and building types. To understand sectoral and regional difference in building energy use and how socioeconomic, physical, and technological development influence the evolution of the Chinese building sector, this study developed a building energy use model for China downscaled into four climate regions under an integrated assessment framework. Three building types (rural residential, urban residential, and commercial) were modeled specifically in each climate region. Our study finds that the Cold and Hot Summer Cold Winter regions lead in total building energy use. The impact of climate change on heating energy use is more significant than that of cooling energy use in most climate regions. Both rural and urban households will experience fuel switch from fossil fuel to cleaner fuels. Commercial buildings will experience rapid growth in electrification and energy intensity. Improved understanding of Chinese buildings with climate change highlighted in this study will help policy makers develop targeted policies and prioritize building energy efficiency measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy use and consumption 3afossil fuels 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apopulation dynamics 3aChina 0aChina 0aBuilding energy use 0aIntegrated assessment 0aDownscaled analysis 0aClimate change1 aEom, Jiyong1 aZhou, Yuyu1 aEvans, Meredydd1 aClarke, Leon0 tEnergy.g2014 Apr. 01, v. 67 p.284-297dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.12.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006500144245013500209300002000344520087900364592002801243650002601271650002901297650001701326650001301343650001601356650001701372650001701389650002101406650001101427650002601438650002901464650001801493650001501511650001301526650001901539653002401558653001601582700002501598700002101623700001901644700002401663700002501687700002801712700005901740700002701799700006401826773014201890856007902032852000902111655001202120IND60699955620200729000000.0200702e20200612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069995562DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c061632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLucío, María Isabel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7404-352X10aBactericidal Effect of 5-Mercapto-2-nitrobenzoic Acid-Coated Silver Nanoclusters against Multidrug-Resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae  ap. 27994-28003.  aNeisseria gonorrhoeae is among the most multidrug-resistant bacteria in circulation today, and new treatments are urgently needed. In this work, we demonstrate the ability of 5-mercapto-2-nitrobenzoic acid-coated silver nanoclusters (MNBA-AgNCs) to kill strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Using an in vitro bactericidal assay, MNBA-AgNCs had been found to show significantly higher anti-gonococcal bioactivity than the antibiotics ceftriaxone and azithromycin and silver nitrate. These nanoclusters were effective against both planktonic bacteria and a gonococcal infection of human cell cultures in vitro. Treatment of human cells in vitro with MNBA-AgNCs did not induce significant release of lactate dehydrogenase, suggesting minimal cytotoxicity to eukaryotic cells. Our results suggest that MNBA-AgNCs hold great potential for topical treatment of localized gonorrhoeae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeisseria gonorrhoeae 3aantibacterial properties 3aazithromycin 3abacteria 3aceftriaxone 3acell culture 3acytotoxicity 3aeukaryotic cells 3ahumans 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amultiple drug resistance 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aplankton 3asilver nitrate 0asilver nanoclusters 0ahuman cells1 aKyriazi, Maria-Eleni1 aHamilton, Joshua1 aBatista, Diego1 aSheppard, Alexander1 aSams-Dodd, Elisabeth1 aHumbert, Maria Victoria1 aHussain, Irshad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5498-12361 aChristodoulides, Myron1 aKanaras, Antonios G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9847-67060 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 June 12, v. 12, no. 25 p.27994-28003dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c061633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245016400179520105000343592002801393650001501421650001701436650000901453650001901462650002601481650001901507650001301526650001401539650002701553650000801580653002101588653003401609653004901643653001301692653001201705653000901717700003601726700003301762700002101795700002701816700003101843700002801874773010001902856008702002852000902089655001202098IND60746638820221122221633.0210918e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074663882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1307322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDourado, Camila Santos10aOptimization of a saccharin molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction procedure and evaluation by MIR hyperspectral imaging for analysis of diet tea by HPLC  aSaccharin was determined based on a new molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) procedure. The polymer was synthesized with a hybrid monomer of metacrylic acid and 3-amino propril tetraethoxysilane and saccharin as template. After the synthesis, the saccharin removal from the MIP was verified by the UV analysis of the solutions used in the template removal procedure, as well as by the direct MIP analysis using FTIR hyperspectral image and chemometrics. The residual saccharin concentrations observed in the image analysis revealed a narrow concentration distribution consistent with a homogenous material. The MISPE was performed with homemade cartridges containing 200 mg of the MIP. The results obtained with standards and diet tea samples confirmed high affinity, adsorption capacity and selectivity of the MIP. The MISPE cartridge exhibited recoveries of 100 ± 3% in six extraction cycles. The diet tea analysis showed a significant reduction of the interferences, which can considerable simplifies the HPLC-UV analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achemometrics 3adiet 3afood chemistry 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aimage analysis 3apolymers 3asaccharin 3asolid phase extraction 3atea 0aTemplate removal 0aMolecularly imprinted polymer 0aMolecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction 0aDiet tea 0aMCR-ALS 0aPLSR1 aDomingues, Izabella Fernanda F.1 ade Oliveira Magalhães, Laiz1 aCasarin, Fabiana1 aRibeiro, Millene Lopes1 aBraga, Jez Willian Batista1 aDias, Ana Cristi Basile0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 367 p.130732-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1307323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245017400173300001600347520129900363592002801662650001401690650001101704650002501715650002501740650002901765651001101794651001101805651002901816653003301845653003701878653003401915700002701949700002601976773008902002856008402091852000902175655001202184IND60600425120221119101437.0180703e20140301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060042512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2013.12.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFokaides, Paris A.10aLegislation driven scenarios based on recent construction advancements towards the achievement of nearly zero energy dwellings in the southern European country of Cyprus  ap. 588-597.  aEurope has a significant target ahead to fulfill: to achieve the goal of nearly zero energy buildings from the year 2021. This paper presents viable scenarios to achieve the achievement of nearly zero energy dwellings in the southern European country of Cyprus. The analysis is based on the documentation of the developments in the building sector after the adoption of mandatory building insulation regulations. For this purpose, data concerning the building stock of Cyprus before the adoption of the regulation of thermal insulation, as well as the construction characteristics for sixty dwellings which were built from 2010 to 2012 are compared. The ability of adoption of renewable energy in the building sector is also analyzed. Several scenarios are examined and a matrix defining the possible ranges of primary consumption of dwellings in Cyprus considered as nearly zero energy are presented. Possible scenarios examined in relation to consumption of dwellings in Cyprus by 2020 showed that this would range from 65 to −40 kWh/m² year, depending on the degree of renewable energy technologies penetration. The outcomes of this work are particularly revealing with regard to the definition of feasible consumption targets for nearly zero energy dwellings in southern Europe by 2020.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3aenergy 3ainsulating materials 3alaws and regulations 3arenewable energy sources 3aCyprus 3aEurope 3aSouthern European region 0aNearly zero energy buildings 0aEnergy performance certification 0aRenewable energy technologies1 aChristoforou, Elias A.1 aKalogirou, Soteris A.0 tEnergy.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 66 p.588-597dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.12.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245009400163500002200257520112500279592002801404653001201432653000901444653000901453653002801462653000801490700001801498700001501516700001901531700001701550700002001567700002001587700001701607700001801624700002001642700001701662700001901679700001701698700001701715700002001732700001801752773005801770856008401828852000901912655001201921IND60531168220221119091434.0160723s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053116822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.celrep.2016.06.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Xun10aID1-Cullin3 axis regulates intracellular SHH and WNT signaling in glioblastoma stem cells  aPre-press version  aInhibitor of differentiation 1 (ID1) is highly expressed in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). However, the regulatory mechanism responsible for its role in GSCs is poorly understood. Here we report that ID1 activates GSC proliferation, self-renewal, and tumorigenicity by suppressing Cullin3 ubiquitin ligase. ID1 induces cell proliferation through increase of cyclin E, a target molecule of Cullin3. ID1 overexpression or Cullin3 knockdown confers GSC features and tumorigenicity to murine Ink4a/Arf-deficient astrocytes. Proteomics analysis revealed that Cullin3 interacts with Gli2 and Dvl2, and induces their degradation via ubiquitination. Consistent with ID1 knockdown or Cullin3 overexpression in human GSCs, pharmacologically combined control of Gli2 and β-catenin effectively diminishes GSC properties. ID1-high/Cullin3-low expression signature correlates with a poor patient prognosis, thus supporting the clinical relevance of this signaling axis. Taken together, a loss of Cullin3 represents a common signaling node for controlling the activity of intracellular WNT and SHH signaling pathways mediated by ID1.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCullin3 0aDvl2 0aGli2 0aglioblastoma stem cells 0aID11 aJeon, Hye-Min1 aJin, Xiong1 aKim, Eun-jung,1 aYin, Jinlong1 aJeon, Hee-Young1 aSohn, Young-Woo1 aOh, Se-Yeong1 aKim, Jun-Kyum1 aKim, Sŭng-hak,1 aJung, Ji-Eun1 aKwak, Sungwook1 aTang, Kai-Fu1 aXu, Yunsheng1 aRich, Jeremy N.1 aKim, Hyunggee0 tCell Reports.g2016, dElsevier Inc.x2211-12477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2016.06.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245012200174520110100296592002801397650001801425650002301443650001701466650001901483650001201502653001701514653001601531653002401547653001801571653001801589653001701607653000801624653000801632653000801640653000901648653000801657653000801665653000801673653000801681653000801689653000701697653000701704653000901711653000901720653000901729653000901738653000801747653000901755653000901764653000701773653000701780653000801787653000801795653000901803653000901812653000801821700002001829700002001849700001701869700002601886773010001912856008702012852000902099655001202108IND60767166720221118044410.0220411e20220730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076716672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1323862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlrosan, Mohammad10aRecent updates on lentil and quinoa protein-based dairy protein alternatives: Nutrition, technologies, and challenges  aDue to its high nutritional value and increasing consumption trends, plant-based proteins were used in a variety of dietary products, either in their entirety or as partial substitutions. There is indeed a growing need to produce plant-based proteins as alternatives to dairy-based proteins that have good functional properties, high nutritional values, and high protein digestibility. Among the plant-based proteins, both lentil and quinoa proteins received a lot of attention in recent years as dairy-based protein alternatives. To ensure plant-based proteins a success in food applications, food industries and researchers need to have a comprehensive scientific understanding of these proteins. The demand for proteins is highly dependent on several factors, mainly functional properties, nutritional values, and protein digestibility. Fermentation and protein complexation are recognised to be suitable techniques in enhancing the functional properties, nutritional values, and protein digestibility of these plant-based proteins, making them potential alternatives for dairy-based proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3adairy protein 3adigestible protein 3afermentation 3afood chemistry 3alentils 0aFermentation 0aGermination 0aAlternative protein 0aDairy protein 0aPlant protein 0aComplexation 0aLPs 0aQPs 0aCPs 0aWPIs 0aEAI 0aESI 0aNSI 0aOAC 0aWAC 0aNE 0aNM 0aCPHs 0aABTS 0aDPPH 0aFRAP 0aIDF 0aIVPD 0aORAC 0aPA 0aRC 0aRPs 0aSDF 0aSPIs 0aSPSC 0aTDF1 aTan, Thuan-Chew1 aMat Easa, Azhar1 aGammoh, Sana1 aAlu'datt, Muhammad H.0 tFood chemistry.g2022 July 30, v. 383 p.132386-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1323863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006000153245008600213300001800299520105600317592002801373650002501401650001501426650001301441650001101454650001401465650001101479650001601490650002101506650001501527653001301542653002601555653002101581653002201602653003401624653002301658700002401681700002001705700001801725700002801743700002401771700002101795700002401816700003001840700001901870700002401889700003001913700002301943700001801966700001701984700002202001700001802023700001902041700001702060700002202077773012102099856008802220852000902308655001202317IND60580993220221123025031.0200217e20171231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058099322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.07.2582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGracia-Lor, Emma1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7256-652X10aEstimation of caffeine intake from analysis of caffeine metabolites in wastewater  ap. 1582-1588.  aCaffeine metabolites in wastewater were investigated as potential biomarkers for assessing caffeine intake in a population. The main human urinary metabolites of caffeine were measured in the urban wastewater of ten European cities and the metabolic profiles in wastewater were compared with the human urinary excretion profile. A good match was found for 1,7-dimethyluric acid, an exclusive caffeine metabolite, suggesting that might be a suitable biomarker in wastewater for assessing population-level caffeine consumption. A correction factor was developed considering the percentage of excretion of this metabolite in humans, according to published pharmacokinetic studies. Daily caffeine intake estimated from wastewater analysis was compared with the average daily intake calculated from the average amount of coffee consumed by country per capita. Good agreement was found in some cities but further information is needed to standardize this approach. Wastewater analysis proved useful to providing additional local information on caffeine use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaverage daily intake 3abiomarkers 3acaffeine 3acities 3aexcretion 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3apharmacokinetics 3awastewater 0aCaffeine 0a1,7-dimethyluric acid 0aBack-calculation 0aCorrection factor 0aWastewater-based epidemiology 0aUrinary biomarkers1 aRousis, Nikolaos I.1 aZuccato, Ettore1 aBade, Richard1 aBaz-Lomba, Jose Antonio1 aCastrignanò, Erika1 aCausanilles, Ana1 aHernández, Félix,1 aKasprzyk-Hordern, Barbara1 aKinyua, Juliet1 aMcCall, Ann-Kathrin1 avan Nuijs, Alexander L.N.1 aPlósz, Benedek G.1 aRamin, Pedram1 aRyu, Yeonsuk1 aSantos, Miguel M.1 aThomas, Kevin1 aVoogt, Pim de,1 aYang, Zhugen1 aCastiglioni, Sara0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Dec. 31, v. 609 p.1582-1588dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.07.2583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02069naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008800171300001600259520101900275592002801294650002001322650002301342650001401365650002401379650001101403650001601414653003301430653002801463653001301491653004301504773009001547856008501637852000901722655001201731IND60591858020221117201657.0180830e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059185802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.04.1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzoplik, Jolanta10aImproving the natural gas transporting based on the steady state simulation results  ap. 105-116.  aThe work presents an example of practical application of gas flow modeling results in the network, that was obtained for the existing gas network and for real data about network load depending on the time of day and air temperature. The gas network load in network connections was estimated based on real data concerning gas consumption by customers and weather data in 2010, based on two-parametric model based on the number of degree-days of heating. The aim of this study was to elaborate a relationship between pressure and gas stream introduced into the gas network. It was demonstrated that practical application of elaborated relationship in gas reduction station allows for the automatic adjustment of gas pressure in the network to the volume of network load and maintenance of gas pressure in the whole network at possibly the lowest level. It was concluded based on the results obtained that such an approach allows to reduce the amount of gas supplied to the network by 0.4% of the annual network load.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aconsumers (people) 3aheat sums 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3anatural gas 0aNatural gas pipeline network 0aSteady-state simulation 0aSteering 0aImproving the natural gas transporting0 tEnergy.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 109 p.105-116dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.04.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001400171245007900185300001600264520109700280592002801377650004401405650001501449650002001464650002601484650001201510650001501522650001301537650001101550650002001561650001001581650001501591650003001606650002501636650002801661650002101689650003601710650003801746650002101784650001301805650004501818650001001863650001601873653001201889653001501901653002301916653002101939653002501960700001301985700001201998773010502010856008702115852000902202655001202211IND50066068620221118055605.0190409e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006606862DNAL7 a235676802pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2013.02.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShu, Tong10aMercury adsorption of modified mulberry twig chars in a simulated flue gas  ap. 182-187.  aMulberry twig chars were prepared by pyrolysis, steam activation and impregnation with H2O2, ZnCl2 and NaCl. Textural characteristics and surface functional groups were performed using nitrogen adsorption and FTIR, respectively. Mercury adsorption of different modified MT chars was investigated in a quartz fixed-bed absorber. The results indicated that steam activation and H2O2-impregnation can improve pore structure significantly and H2O2-impregnation and chloride-impregnation promote surface functional groups. However, chloride-impregnation has adverse effect on pore structure. Mercury adsorption capacities of impregnated MT chars with 10% or 30% H2O2 are 2.02 and 1.77 times of steam activated MT char, respectively. Mercury adsorption capacity of ZnCl2-impregnated MT char increase with increasing ZnCl2 content and is better than that of NaCl-impregnated MT char at the same chloride content. The modified MT char (MT873-A-Z5) prepared by steam activation following impregnation with 5% ZnCl2 exhibits a higher mercury adsorption capacity (29.55μgg−1) than any other MT chars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aadverse effects 3afunctional properties 3amercury 3amulberries 3anitrogen 3aquartz 3asodium chloride 3asteam 2aAdsorption 2aAir Pollutantsxchemistry 2aCharcoalxmetabolism 2aChloridesxpharmacology 2aGasesxchemistry 2aHydrogen Peroxidexpharmacology 2aMercuryxisolation & purification 2aMorusxchemistry 2aPorosity 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aSteam 2aTemperature 0aMercury 0aAdsorption 0aMulberry twig char 0aSteam activation 0aSurface modification1 aLu, Ping1 aHe, Nan0 tBioresource technology.g2013 May, v. 136 p.182-187dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2013.02.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004200113040001800155100001800173245006500191300001600256520134400272592002801616650001201644650001601656650001201672650001401684650001601698650001601714650001201730650001201742650001401754650001401768650002401782650002201806650002401828650002201852650001601874650001701890651001601907651001101923700001701934700002101951700001901972700001801991700002002009700002102029700002002050700001702070700001502087773010002102856008802202961001202290852000902302655001202311IND50089194920221116165329.0150206e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008919492DNAL7 a193830932pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02825.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBüntgen, Ulf10aThree centuries of insect outbreaks across the European Alps  ap. 929-941.  a• Knowledge of the persistence of regular larch budmoth outbreaks is limited in space and time. Although dendrochronological methods have been used to reconstruct insect outbreaks, their presence may be obscured by climatic influences. • More than 5000 tree‐ring series from 70 larch host and 73 spruce nonhost sites within the European Alps and Tatra Mountains were compiled. Site‐specific assessment of growth–climate responses and the application of six larch budmoth detection methods considering host, nonhost and instrumental time‐series revealed spatiotemporal patterns of insect defoliation across the Alpine arc. • Annual maps of reconstructed defoliation showed historical persistence of cyclic outbreaks at the site level, recurring c. every 8–9 yr. Larch budmoth outbreaks occurred independently of rising temperatures from the Little Ice Age until recent warmth. Although no collapse in outbreak periodicity was recorded at the local scale, synchronized Alpine‐wide defoliation has ceased during recent decades. • Our study demonstrates the persistence of recurring insect outbreaks during ad 1700–2000 and emphasizes that a widely distributed tree‐ring network and novel analysis methods can contribute towards an understanding of the changes in outbreak amplitude, synchrony and climate dependence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adefoliation 3ainsects 3amountains 3aperiodicity 3atemperature 2aAnimals 2aClimate 2aEcosystem 2aGeography 2aLarixxparasitology 2aMothsxphysiology 2aPiceaxparasitology 2aSpectrum Analysis 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 3aAlps region 0aEurope1 aFrank, David1 aLiebhold, Andrew1 aJohnson, Derek1 aCarrer, Marco1 aUrbinati, Carlo1 aGrabner, Michael1 aNicolussi, Kurt1 aLevanic, Tom1 aEsper, Jan0 tnew phytologist.g2009 June, v. 182, no. 4 p.929-941dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02825.x3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011500165300001600280520133800296592002801634650001501662650001101677650002801688650002101716650001801737653004201755653001901797653002501816653002001841653001801861653001601879700001801895700001301913700001601926700001601942700002301958773009001981856008502071852000902156655001202165IND60591858220221117201701.0180830e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059185822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.04.1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jian10aComparative studies on control systems for a two-blade variable-speed wind turbine with a speed exclusion zone  ap. 294-309.  aTo avoid the coincidence between the tower nature frequency and rotational excitation frequency, a SEZ (speed exclusion zone) must be built for a two-blade wind turbine with a full rated converter. According to the literature, two methods of SEZ-crossing could be adopted. However, none of them have been studied in industrial applications, and their performance remains unclear. Moreover, strategies on power regulation operation are not covered. To fully investigate them, this paper develops two control systems for a two-blade WT (wind turbines) with a SEZ. Because control systems play vital roles in determining the performance of the WT, this paper focuses on comparative studies on their operation strategies and performance. In these strategies, optimal designs are introduced to improve existing SEZ algorithms. Moreover, to perform power regulation outside the SEZ, two operation modes are divided in the proposed down power regulation solutions. The developed control systems’ performance is confirmed by simulations and field tests. Two control systems present similar capabilities of power production and SEZ-bridging. Nevertheless, at the cost of significantly increased tower loads, one captures 1% more energy than the other. Overall consideration must be made for the control system selection for a WT with a SEZ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenergy 3aindustrial applications 3apower generation 3awind turbines 0aTwo-blade variable speed wind turbine 0aControl system 0aSpeed exclusion zone 0aTower resonance 0aPower capture 0aTower loads1 aSong, Dongran1 aDong, Mi1 aChen, Sifan1 aZou, Libing1 aGuerrero, Josep M.0 tEnergy.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 109 p.294-309dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.04.1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03641naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002100142245011200163300001600275520230000291592002802591650002602619650001402645650002002659650001002679650001602689650001702705650001402722650004302736650001702779650002102796650001702817650002502834650001802859650001402877650001002891700002202901700001802923700002202941700002002963700001702983773012903000856004503129852000903174655001203183IND4468859520221118055739.0120517e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446885952DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2011003002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsikin, Yonathan10aWax, policosanol, and longâchain aldehydes of different sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) cultivars  ap. 583-591.  aSugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) wax that contains policosanol (a mixture of longâchain alcohols), is widely known to have beneficial effects on human health. In order to investigate differences in the composition and content of sugarcane wax in different sugarcane cultivars, the wax, policosanol, and longâchain aldehyde composition of eight sugarcane cultivars were examined. The wax composition of sugarcane was analyzed using HPLC coupled with an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD). Sugarcane waxes were comprised of 55â60% aldehyde and sterol esters, 32â40% alcohol, and small amounts of TAG, acid, and plant sterols. Additionally, the composition of policosanol and longâchain aldehydes was determined using GCâFID and their mass fragment compounds were identified using GCâMS. The highest content of policosanol and longâchain aldehyde compounds (500âmg and 600âmg/100âg rind, respectively), was found in the handâpeeled rind of the Ni 22 sugarcane cultivar. The content of these compounds increased up to 72% during sugarcane maturation from October to January. This study indicated that the composition and content of wax, policosanol, and longâchain aldehydes may vary depending on the cultivar of the sugarcane and the specific part of the sugarcane analyzed, as well as on the degree of sugarcane maturity. Practical applications: Different sugarcane cultivars have been evaluated in terms of their usefulness as a source of policosanol, which is a valuable wax component that may have beneficial effects on human health. Policosanol is the common name that refers to a group of longâchain (C20âC30) aliphatic primary alcohols that are of great interest since their effects include reduction of platelet aggregation, reduction of lowâdensity lipoprotein levels in blood, inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, and prevention of atherosclerosis development, and which also display ergogenic properties. The present study detailed the wax composition, including that of policosanol and longâchain aldehydes, of sugarcanes of different cultivars. The results of this study could provide a basis for selection of sugarcane cultivars in agricultural areas for wax or policosanol production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharum officinarum 3aaldehydes 3aatherosclerosis 3ablood 3acholesterol 3acommon names 3acultivars 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahuman health 3alight scattering 3aphytosterols 3aplatelet aggregation 3asterol esters 3asugarcane 3awaxes1 aTakahashi, Makoto1 aHirose, Naoto1 aHou, DeâXing1 aTakara, Kensaku1 aWada, Kōji,0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2012 May, v. 114, no. 5 p.583-591dWILEYâVCH Verlagx1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.201100300  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245012300170500001900293520190500312592002802217650001902245650001102264650001602275650002202291650002202313650002802335651001002363653002902373653003002402653002602432653003502458653003202493700001702525700001702542700001802559700001702577773012002594856008802714852000902802655001202811IND60695351820221120132105.0201025e20200910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069535182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1394402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lihui10aMulti-scale evaluation and multi-scenario simulation analysis of regional energy carrying capacity—Case study: China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe analysis of energy carrying capacity (ECC) is an important basis for measuring the sustainable development level of regional energy carrying systems (ECS) and the selection of regional development models. This study establishes a regional ECS structure model from four subsystems: energy resources, economic development, social development, and ecological environment. The synergistic development relationship between subsystems and the feedback relationship between key elements are analyzed. Using a system dynamics model, the catastrophe progression method and the coupling coordination model are applied to rate the ECC and the coupling coordination degree (CCD) of China's ECS from 2004 to 2018. Furthermore, the status continuation scenario (SCS), policy planning scenario (PPS), strengthen policy scenario (SPS), and policy comparison scenario (PCS) are set up to carry out the multi-scenario simulation of China's ECC, and ECC and CCD in four scenarios from 2019 to 2050 are analyzed. The results reveal that from 2004 to 2018, the socioeconomic, the energy resources, and the energy environment carrying capacities to varying degrees, and the level of China's ECC and CCD increased year by year. It entered a comparably weak carrying level in 2010 and optimized from the uncoordinated stage to the primary coordinated stage in 2008. From 2019 to 2050, the ECC will reach the platform period in 2036 under PPS, and under SPS and PCS it will reach the platform period in 2030; the ECC stages and development coordination optimization nodes are both manifested as that SPS is the earliest, PCS is second, and PPS is the latest. In the future development process, it is recommended that take PPS as the bottom line and SPS as the goal, with high carrying capacity and superior coordinated stages as the guide, and the sustainable development capacity supported by ECS should be strengthened.  aPublisher supplied data 3adynamic models 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3aissues and policy 3asimulation models 3asustainable development 3aChina 0aEnergy carrying capacity 0aMulti-scenario simulation 0aSystem dynamics model 0aCatastrophe progression method 0aCoupling coordination model1 aNie, Qingyun1 aChen, Biying1 aChai, Jianxue1 aZhao, Zhenyu0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Sept. 10, v. 734 p.139440-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1394403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03543naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245010700170300001600277500000900293520205000302592002802352650001802380650001102398650002802409650002102437650002102458650001902479650001402498650002502512650001902537650002102556650001902577650000902596650002402605650002102629650002102650650002902671651001302700651001102713700002302724700002002747773021702767856008002984852000903064655001203073IND60666369720221121022158.0191028e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066636972DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2014.05.02232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcMullen, Richard L.10aSoil Respiration as Affected by Long-Term Broiler Litter Application to a Udult in the Ozark Highlands  ap. 115-126.  aepub  aThe United States produced 8.4 billion broiler chickens (Gallus gallus) and an estimated 10.1 to 14.3 million Mg of broiler litter (BL) in 2012. Arkansas’ production of 1 billion broilers in 2012 produced an estimated 1.2 to 1.7 million Mg of BL, most of which was concentrated in the Ozark Highlands region of northwest Arkansas. Increased CO₂ release from soils associated with agricultural practices has generated concerns regarding the contribution of certain agricultural management practices to global warming. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of long-term (>6 yr) BL application to a Udult on soil respiration and annual C emissions and to determine the predictability of soil respiration based on soil temperature and moisture in the Ozark Highlands region of northwest Arkansas. Soil respiration was measured routinely between May 2009 and May 2012 in response to annual BL application rates of 0, 5.6, and 11.2 Mg dry litter ha⁻¹ that began in 2003. Soil respiration varied (P < 0.01) with BL rate, measurement date, and year. Additions of BL stimulated respiration after application, and rainfall events after dry-soil conditions stimulated respiration in all years. Soil temperature at the 10-cm depth, 0- to 6-cm soil volumetric water content (VWC), and annual CO₂–C emissions were unaffected (P > 0.05) by BL application rate but differed (P < 0.01) among study years. Multiple regression indicated that soil respiration could be reasonably predicted using 2-cm-depth soil temperature (T₂cₘ) and the product of T₂cₘ and VWC as predictors (R² = 0.52; P < 0.01). Results indicate that organic amendments, such as BL, can stimulate release of CO₂ from the soil to the atmosphere, potentially negatively affecting atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations; thus, there may be application rates above which the benefits of organic amendments may be diminished by adverse environmental effects. Improved BL management strategies are needed to lessen the loss of CO₂ from BL-amended soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGallus gallus 3aUdults 3aagricultural management 3aapplication rate 3abroiler chickens 3acarbon dioxide 3aemissions 3aenvironmental impact 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gases 3apoultry manure 3arain 3aregression analysis 3asoil respiration 3asoil temperature 3avolumetric water content 3aArkansas 3aOzarks1 aBrye, Kristofor R.1 aGbur, Edward E.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2015 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.115-126dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2014.05.02233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009600169300001600265520148700281592002801768650002201796650002401818650002501842650002201867650001001889650000901899650001301908650001801921650002401939650000901963650001901972650001401991653002902005653002002034653001902054653001702073700001502090700001802105700001902123700001302142700001202155773009002167856008502257852000902342655001202351IND60591858420221117201218.0180830e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059185842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.04.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Huairong10aModeling and techno-economic analysis of shale-to-liquid and coal-to-liquid fuels processes  ap. 201-210.  aTo alleviate the conflict between oil supply and demand, Chinese government has accelerated exploration and exploitation of alternative oil productions. STL (Shale-to-liquid) processes and CTL (coal-to-liquid) processes are promising choices to supply oil. However, few analyses have been made on their energy efficiency and economic performance. This paper conducts a detailed analysis of a STL process and a CTL process based on mathematical modeling and simulation.Analysis shows that low efficiency of the STL process is due to low oil yield of the Fushun-type retorting technology. For the CTL process, the utility system provides near to 34% energy consumption of the total. This is because that CTL technologies are in early development and no heat integration between units is implemented. Economic analysis reveals that the total capital investment of the CTL process is higher than that of the STL process. The production cost of the CTL process is right on the same level as that of the STL process.For better techno-economic performance, it is suggested to develop a new retorting technology of high oil yield for the STL process. The remaining retorting gas should be converted to hydrogen and then used for shale oil hydrogenation. For the CTL process, developing an appropriate heat network is an efficient way to apply heat integration. In addition, the CTL process is intended to be integrated with hydrogen rich gas to adjust H2/CO for better resource utilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aearly development 3aeconomic investment 3aeconomic performance 3aenergy efficiency 3afuels 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3amathematical models 3aoils 3asupply balance 3autilities 0aTechno-economic analysis 0aShale-to-liquid 0aCoal-to-liquid 0aHeat network1 aYang, Siyu1 aXiao, Honghua1 aYang, Qingchun1 aQian, Yu1 aGao, Li0 tEnergy.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 109 p.201-210dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.04.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03637naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009100172520226500263592002802528650001302556650002002569650002802589650002202617650002702639650002102666650002302687650003402710650001602744650002602760650003602786650002402822650002502846650002202871650001802893650001202911650001102923700002102934700002002955773013402975856008503109852000903194655001203203IND60672847820221119090354.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067284782DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz050.P16-031-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlshaikh, Latifa10aDiet Quality and Physical Activity Patterns of Musical Theatre Performers (P16-031-19)  aMusical theatre performers are considered “athletes of the arts”, requiring excellent physical and vocal stamina to complete long rehearsals and meet performance expectations. These demands create emphasis on the importance of good nutritional intake. The purpose of this study was to assess dietary and physical activity patterns of professional musical theatre performers (MTPs) in comparison with non-performers (NPs). The study was cross-sectional and used an online survey via Qualtrics. The survey included the 2010 National Cancer Institute (NCI) Diet History Questionnaire II (DHQ II) and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-short form. The DHQ II Diet*Calc software was used to generate estimates of nutrient and food group intake. NCI SAS macros calculated Healthy Eating Index (HEI) 2015 component and total scores. Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25. Descriptive statistics were generated for both groups. Chi-square tests were used to assess categorical data and independent sample t-tests were used to compare continuous data between the two groups. A total of 134 participants were included in the final analysis, of which 58 were MTPs and 76 were NPs. Participants had an average age of 27.5 ± 8.5 years and average BMI of 23.3 ±5.5 kg/m² with no significant differences between the two groups. There were no significant associations between the two groups for sex, ethnicity, race, or educational level. MTPs obtained higher HEI scores (69.3 ± 8.5) in comparison with NPs (65.2 ± 8.6) (P = 0.007). MTPs engaged in vigorous and moderate physical activity more frequently than NPs (P < 0.001). Of the MTPs, approximately 70% reported experiencing injuries throughout their career, 44% reported following a special diet, and 10.5% reported previous eating disorder diagnosis. This study found that the MTPs had higher diet quality compared to non-performers. However, the MTPs were more physically active than non-performers, and that prevalence of injuries among MTPs was high. Further research is needed to identify dietary needs of MTPs and develop appropriate nutrition education interventions for this unique population of “athletes in the arts”.

We report here a complete dataset including the distribution and speciation of Hg in soil, sediment, and water in pristine and ASGM impacted sites of the Gambia River ecosystem (Kedougou region - eastern Senegal). Selective extraction showed that soils surrounding ASGM activities were contaminated with elemental Hg [Hg(0)] at concentrations up to 3.9 mg kg−1. In the Gambia River, high total Hg (THg: 1.16 ± 0.80 mg kg−1) and methylmercury (MeHg: 3.2 ± 2.3 ng g−1) were also measured in sediment samples collected at ASGM sites. Along the stream, THg concentrations in sediment decrease with distance from the ASGM sites, while those of methylmercury increase downstream. The study of THg and MeHg partitioning between filtered surface water and suspended particles demonstrate that particulate transport is responsible for the downstream dissemination of the Hg contamination from ASGM sites. Sedimentation of fine particles enriched in Hg downstream ASGM sites likely favors MeHg production and accumulation in sediment. Although elemental Hg is weakly labile, surface soil erosion may also provide important and long-term Hg inputs to downstream aquatic ecosystems, where it can be oxidized and methylated. Finally, the dissemination of THg and MeHg downstream from the ASGM sites in the Gambia River may constitute a long-term source of contamination and can have a large scale impact on the aquatic ecosystem through biomagnification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abioaccumulation 3adata collection 3aenvironmental impact 3agold 3amercury 3amethylation 3amethylmercury compounds 3amining 3asediments 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3astreams 3asurface water 3atraditional technology 3aGambia River 3aSenegal 0aSoil 0aKedougou region 0aArtisanal small-scale gold mining 0aMercury 0aMethylmercury1 aGuédron, Stéphane1 aFeder, Frédéric1 aLegros, Samuel1 aNgom, Papa Malick1 aMoritz, R.q(Robert),0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 June 15, v. 669 p.185-193dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02147naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024003900130040001800169100002800187245006200215300001400277506002800291506003600319506007600355506003100431520080400462592002801266596004401294596004501338506003701383650002101420650001701441650002301458650001201481650001201493700002001505773010801525856008301633903002401716852000901740655001201749IND60531168720221207051012.0190417e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053116872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cofs.2016.06.0032doi7 a10.1016/j.cofs.2016.06.0032chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinyard, Christopher J.10aUsing electromyography as a research tool in food science  ap. 50-55.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe jaw muscles play key functional roles during feeding. During contraction, a bioelectrical signal propagates along the muscle cell helping to coordinate muscle contraction. This signal can be measured via electromyography (EMG). Food scientists have increasingly adopted EMG as a tool for studying the relationships among food textures and oral processing. Specifically, food scientists have used EMG from the feeding muscles as (1) a general measure of food texture, (2) a measure of oral physiology, (3) an estimate of absolute force and (4) a measure of muscle work. Unfortunately, physiological research indicates that estimates of absolute force and mechanical work are not reliably indicated from EMG as it is best considered an indicator of muscle activity and relative recruitment levels.  aPublisher supplied data  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aelectromyography 3afood science 3amuscle contraction 3amuscles 3atexture1 aFiszman, Susana0 tCurrent opinion in food science.g2016 June, v. 9 p.50-55dElsevier LtdwJournal:23210x2214-79937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cofs.2016.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001600159245005700175300001600232500000900248520102500257592002801282650002201310650001101332650001601343650001501359650001501374650001301389650001501402650001801417650001401435650001501449650001801464650002301482650000901505651001701514700001701531700001701548773020601565856009401771852000901865655001201874IND60666369820221121022310.0191028e197710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066636982DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1977.00472425000600040019x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoty, W.

While the composition varied significantly over time for every component and every plant, the standard deviation, expressed as a percentage of the mean for each treatment plant, indicated that two-thirds of the values would be within the range of the true average value plus or minus 20 to 50%. Analyses for all samples collected in Pennsylvania, including those analyzed as a part of a service program, indicated that without chemical analysis the composition with respect to N, P, and K varied too much to establish an accurate prediction of the fertilizer value of unanalyzed sludge. In addition, the concentrations of the essential but phytotoxic elements, especially Zn and Cu, as well as trace elements harmful to the food chain, varied greatly among the treatment plants studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical analysis 3acopper 3afertilizers 3afood chain 3amonitoring 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aphytotoxicity 3apotassium 3aprediction 3asewage sludge 3astandard deviation 3azinc 3aPennsylvania1 aBaker, D.

The temperature at the heat plant is 46 °C and around 40 °C at the substations. To avoid the proliferation of Legionella in the DHW (domestic hot water) and assure the comfortable temperature, all substations were installed with supplementary heating devices. Detailed measurements were taken in the substations, including the electricity demand of the supplementary heating devices. To compare the energy and economic performance of the substations, separate models were built based on standard assumptions. The relative heat and electricity delivered for preparing DHW were calculated. The results showed that substations with storage tanks and heat pumps have high relative electricity demand, which leads to higher integrated costs considering both heat and electricity for DHW preparation. The substations with in-line electric heaters have low relative electricity usage because very little heat is lost due to the instantaneous DHW preparation. Accordingly, the substations with in-line electric heaters would have the lowest energy cost for DHW preparation. To achieve optimal design and operation for the ULTDH substation, the electricity peak loads of the in-line electric heaters were analysed according to different DHW-heating strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLegionella 3aeconomic performance 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aheat 3aheat pumps 3aheaters 3amodels 3atanks 3atemperature 0aUltra-low-temperature district heating 0aDomestic hot water 0aLegionella 0aElectric heating 0aReturn temperature 0aPeak load1 aLi, Hongwei1 aSvendsen, Svend0 tEnergy.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 109 p.248-259dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.04.1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245015500159520183900314592002802153650001702181650001102198650002202209650001502231650001302246650001502259650002602274650001402300650001902314650001602333650001902349650001602368650001702384651001002401700001502411700001202426773012602438856007302564852000902637655001202646IND60651845320221121154331.0190712e20160827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065184532DNAL7 a10.3390/su80908622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhonghao10aQuantifying the Spatiotemporal Patterns of Urbanization along Urban-Rural Gradient with a Roadscape Transect Approach: A Case Study in Shanghai, China  aQuantifying the landscape pattern change can effectively demonstrate the ecological progresses and the consequences of urbanization. Based on remotely sensed land cover data in 1994, 2000, 2006 and a gradient analysis with landscape metrics at landscape- and class- level, we attempted to characterize the individual and entire landscape patterns of Shanghai metropolitan during the rapid urbanization. We highlighted that a roadscape transect approach that combined the buffer zone method and the transect-based approach was introduced to describe the urban-rural patterns of agricultural, residential, green, industrial, and public facilities land along the railway route. Our results of landscape metrics showed significant spatiotemporal patterns and gradient variations along the transect. The urban growth pattern in two time spans conform to the hypothesis for diffusion–coalescence processes, implying that the railway is adaptive as a gradient element to analyze the landscape patterns with urbanization. As the natural landscape was replaced by urban landscape gradually, the desakota region expanded its extent widely. Suburb areas witnessed the continual transformation from the predominantly rural landscape to peri-urban landscape. Furthermore, the gap between urban and rural areas remained large especially in public service. More reasonable urban plans and land use policies should push to make more efforts to transition from the urban-rural separation to coordinated urban-rural development. This study is a meaningful trial in demonstrating a new form of urban–rural transects to study the landscape change of large cities. By combining gradient analysis with landscape metrics, we addressed the process of urbanization both spatially and temporally, and provided a more quantitative approach to urban studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acities 3aissues and policy 3aland cover 3aland use 3alandscapes 3aquantitative analysis 3arailroads 3aremote sensing 3arural areas 3asuburban areas 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aTu, Yaojen1 aLi, Xin0 tSustainability.g2016 Aug. 27, v. 8, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80908623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001600190245016200206300001600368506007600384520133800460592002801798506003701826650001801863650001601881650001601897650001001913650002801923650001001951650001401961650000901975650001801984650001002002650001602012650002302028650001802051650002102069650001002090650001702100650002902117650002102146653001902167653002302186653002102209653001402230653003002244700001802274700001702292700001702309700001702326700001902343700001802362700001802380773016702398856008302565852000902648655001202657IND60531169020221207051037.0190426e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053116902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aninu.2016.06.0042doi7 aPMC59410412pmcid7 a297670152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Haoyue10aEffects of dietary nanocrystalline cellulose supplementation on growth performance, carcass traits, intestinal development and lipid metabolism of meat ducks  ap. 192-197.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe influence of nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) supplementation on growth performance, carcass traits, intestinal development, and lipid metabolism was assessed in 600 one-day-old male meat ducks (Cherry Valley ducks) from 1 to 35 d of age. Diets were supplemented with 0, 200, 500, 800 and 1,500 mg/kg NCC during both the starter (1–14 d) and grower (15–35 d) phases. Each dietary treatment consisted of 8 replicate cages of 15 birds. Supplementation of NCC was associated with dose dependent increases in BW gain and feed intake (P < 0.01) during 1–14 d of age and in BW at 35 d of age. As NCC content increased, the percentage of breast meat weight (P < 0.05) and leg (with bone) weight (P < 0.05) linearly increased, while the percentage of abdominal fat weight (P < 0.01) linearly decreased in ducks at 35 d of age. Supplementation of NCC resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the weight (P < 0.05) and density (P < 0.01) of the cecum. The percentage of total hepatic lipid content (P < 0.01) at 14 d of age and serum triglyceride (TG) concentration (P = 0.052) at 35 d of age linearly decreased with increasing of dietary NCC addition. In conclusion, inclusion of 1,500 mg/kg NCC in feed resulted in the greatest improvements in duck performance, intestinal development and lipid deposition.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabdominal fat 3ablood serum 3abreast meat 3acages 3acarcass characteristics 3acecum 3acellulose 3adiet 3adose response 3aducks 3afeed intake 3agrowth performance 3alipid content 3alipid metabolism 3amales 3ananocrystals 3anutritional intervention 3atriacylglycerols 0aCarcass traits 0aGrowth performance 0aLipid metabolism 0aMeat duck 0aNanocrystalline cellulose1 aZhang, Keying1 aDing, Xuemei1 aBai, Shiping1 aLuo, Yueheng1 aWang, Jianping1 aPeng, Huanwei1 aZeng, Qiufeng0 tAnimal nutrition.g2016 Sept., v. 2, no. 3 p.192-197dElsevier B.V.aChinese Association of Animal Science and Veterinary MedicinewJournal:23216x2405-63837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aninu.2016.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04417naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245018100205300001200386506007600398520258400474592002803058596007303086596006303159596006303222596009203285506003703377650001503414650001003429650001303439650001703452650002503469650001403494650001803508650002803526650001303554650001703567700001503584700001603599700001403615700001303629700002003642700001603662700001703678773011303695856008203808852000903890655001203899IND60625671820221207111849.0191016e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062567182DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-018-3162-42doi7 aPMC62873652pmcid7 a305266512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHua, Cong J.10aBasal position of two new complete mitochondrial genomes of parasitic Cymothoida (Crustacea: Isopoda) challenges the monophyly of the suborder and phylogeny of the entire order  ap. 628.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Isopoda is a highly diverse order of crustaceans with more than 10,300 species, many of which are parasitic. Taxonomy and phylogeny within the order, especially those of the suborder Cymothoida Wägele, 1989, are still debated. Mitochondrial (mt) genomes are a useful tool for phylogenetic studies, but their availability for isopods is very limited. To explore these phylogenetic controversies on the mt genomic level and study the mt genome evolution in Isopoda, we sequenced mt genomes of two parasitic isopods, Tachaea chinensis Thielemann, 1910 and Ichthyoxenos japonensis Richardson, 1913, belonging to the suborder Cymothoida, and conducted comparative and phylogenetic mt genomic analyses across Isopoda. RESULTS: The complete mt genomes of T. chinensis and I. japonensis were 14,616 bp and 15,440 bp in size, respectively, with the A+T content higher than in other isopods (72.7 and 72.8%, respectively). Both genomes code for 13 protein-coding genes, 21 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), 2 ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs), and possess a control region (CR). Both are missing a gene from the complete tRNA set: T. chinensis lacks trnS1 and I. japonensis lacks trnI. Both possess unique gene orders among isopods. Within the CR of I. japonensis (284 bp), we identified a repetitive region with four tandem repeats. Phylogenetic analysis based on concatenated nucleotide sequences of 13 protein-coding genes showed that the two parasitic cymothoids clustered together and formed a basal clade within Isopoda. However, another parasitic cymothoid, Gyge ovalis Shiino, 1939, formed a sister group with the suborder Limnoriidea Brandt & Poore in Poore, 2002, whereas two free-living cymothoid species were located in the derived part of the phylogram: Bathynomus sp. formed a sister group with the suborder Sphaeromatidea Wägele, 1989, and Eurydice pulchra Leach, 1815 with a clade including Bathynomus sp., Sphaeromatidea and Valvifera G. O. Sars, 1883. CONCLUSIONS: Our results did not recover the suborders Cymothoida and Oniscidea Latreille, 1802 as monophyletic, with parasitic and free-living cymothoidans forming separate clades. Furthermore, two parasitic cymothoidans formed the sister-clade to all other isopods, separated from Epicaridea Latreille, 1825, which challenges currently prevalent isopod phylogeny. Additional mt genomes of parasitic and free-living isopods might confer a sufficient phylogenetic resolution to enable us to resolve their relationships, and ultimately allow us to better understand the evolutionary history of the entire isopod order.  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS-45-15cthe Earmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System  a31572658cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a31872604cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a2015ABA045cthe Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Project of Hubei Province0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBathynomus 3agenes 3agenomics 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genome 3amonophyly 3aribosomal RNA 3atandem repeat sequences 3ataxonomy 3atransfer RNA1 aLi, Wen X.1 aZhang, Dong1 aZou, Hong1 aLi, Ming1 aJakovlić, Ivan1 aWu, Shan G.1 aWang, Gui T.0 tParasites & vectors.g2018 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.628-628dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-3162-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010100171300001500272500001900287520144100306592002801747650001101775650001401786650001901800650002201819650000901841650002301850650001901873650001501892650001601907650001901923650002101942650001101963653003501974653002502009653003402034653002502068653002402093700003002117700001902147700001902166700002802185700002702213700001902240773009502259856008502354852000902439655001202448IND60709480920221119205427.0201025e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070948092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2020.08.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzalez, Ruben,10aPerformance evaluation of a small-scale digester for achieving decentralised management of waste  ap. 99-109.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe performance of a small-scale prototype digestion plant (7.2 m³ working volume) intended for decentralised operation was evaluated considering energy efficiency and technical suitability for biogas valorisation in producing electrical and thermal energy. The digester operated in recirculation mode to enhance organic matter conversion and improve volatile solid degradation. An energy assessment of the process assumed the incorporation of a combined heat and power (CHP) unit. The coefficient of overall performance of the plant for electrical energy (COPₑₗ) was 0.95 — this values was estimated at an electrical efficiency of 22.5% and represents the ratio between energy production and consumption — for a methane yield of 360 L/kg VS and an organic loading rate (OLR) of 1.06 g VS/L d. This parameter was slightly lower than the unit thus indicating that the micro-plant was close to attaining self-sufficiency regarding electrical energy use. The temperature increase of the feed to process conditions supposed a significant amount of thermal energy which highly compromised the efficiency when operating at low organic load, thus accounting for more than 80% of the total energy demand of the installation. When the energy assessment of the process was performed at higher OLR of 2.7 g VS/ L d, the resulting COPₑₗ value was1.68, demonstrating the feasibility of this configuration for decentralised digestion.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogas 3adigestion 3aelectric power 3aenergy efficiency 3aheat 3amethane production 3aorganic matter 3aprototypes 3atemperature 3athermal energy 3awaste management 3awastes 0aMicro-plant energy performance 0aFood waste digestion 0aDecentralised waste treatment 0aPrototype evaluation 0aAnaerobic digestion1 aHernández, Jesus Ernesto1 aGómez, Xiomar1 aSmith, Richard1 aGonzález Arias, Judith1 aMartínez, Elia Judith1 aBlanco, Daniel0 tWaste management.g2020 Dec., v. 118 p.99-109dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2020.08.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01771naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245010900207300001600316520066900332592002801001650001401029650001101043650001501054650001801069653001701087653002701104653001701131653002801148700001701176700002301193700002101216773009001237856008501327852000901412655001201421IND60591858920221117201646.0180830e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059185892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.04.1132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHcini, Cherif1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8095-396510aNumerical prediction for the aerodynamic performance of Turbosail type wind turbine using a vortex model  ap. 287-293.  aOne of attracting concepts has been the use of Turbosail principle to produce lift from aspirated cylinders with flap in various engineering applications.

For this reason, the focus of current study was emphasized on respondent's willingness to pay through implementation of Random Parameter Logit model using data collected through choice experiment technique, in which the preferences of sampled respondent's in urban, rural and pooled data was evaluated for different abiotic and biotic ecosystem services across the entire Heihe River Basin. The estimated results revealed that average urban households are willing to pay more for the restoration of ecosystem services compared to rural residents. In abiotic ecosystem services, the maximum willingness to pay in all three geographical splitted regions was recorded for river water quality, while lowest was recorded for Lake Area in urban and pooled data and for Leisure and entertainment in rural area. Similarly, for biotic ecosystem services, the maximum willingness to pay was recorded for Greenhouse gases effect in urban and for Agricultural product quality in rural and pooled data while lowest was recorded for Oasis in all three regions. The study also recommends that the government of China should act appropriately to make improvements in level of water quality and restoration of ecosystem services. Similarly, water should be made available to the consumers in its best possible state. Furthermore, in case of any disorder in water quality in some regions, inhabitants need to be informed on time. Moreover, to fulfil the requirements for water, water programs and policies should be planned on the basis of demand. While making any policy there should be diverse actions, keeping in view the residents of urban and rural areas as the results approved the heterogeneity in their preferences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3aenvironment 3agreenhouses 3aissues and policy 3alakes 3alogit analysis 3aoases 3aproduct quality 3ariver water 3arivers 3arural areas 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3awillingness to pay 3aChina 0aRanking of ecosystem services 0aSpatial heterogeneity 0aValuation 0aBiotic and abiotic ecosystem services 0aChoice experiment 0aRandom parameter logit1 aKhan, Sufyan Ullah1 aKhan, Aftab1 aKhan, Arshad Ahmad1 aZhao, Minjuan0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Sept. 10, v. 734 p.139447-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1394473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245017900175520134000354592002801694650002501722650001401747650001701761650001501778650002001793650001501813650001101828650001901839650001501858650001601873650001601889650001201905650001501917650001501932653001401947653001401961653002301975653002601998700002202024700001902046700002602065700002202091773010002113856008702213852000902300655001202309IND60746639520221122221604.0210918e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074663952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1307392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHegazi, Nesrine M.10aAuthentication of saffron spice accessions from its common substitutes via a multiplex approach of UV/VIS fingerprints and UPLC/MS using molecular networking and chemometrics  aSaffron is a spice revered for its unique flavor and health attributes often subjected to fraudulence. In this study, molecular networking as a visualization tool for UPLC/MS dataset of saffron and its common substitutes i.e. safflower and calendula (n = 21) was employed for determining genuineness of saffron and detecting its common substitutes i.e. safflower and calendula. Saffron was abundant in flavonol-O-glycosides and crocetin esters versus richness of flavanones/chalcones glycosides in safflower and cinnamates/terpenes in calendula. OPLS-DA identified differences in UPLC/MS profiles of different saffron accessions where oxo-hydroxy-undecenoic acid-O-hexoside was posed as saffron authentication marker and aided in discrimination between Spanish saffron of high quality from its inferior grade i.e. Iranian saffron along with crocetin di-O-gentiobiosyl ester and kaempferol-O-sophoroside. Kaempferol-O-neohesperidoside and N,N,N,-p-coumaroyl spermidine were characteristic safflower metabolites, whereas, calendulaglycoside C and di-O-caffeoyl quinic acid were unique to calendula. UV/VIS fingerprint spectral regions of picrocrocin (230–260 nm) and crocin derivatives (400–470 nm) were posed as being discriminatory of saffron authenticity and suggestive it can replace UPLC/MS in saffrom quality determination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarthamus tinctorius 3achalcones 3achemometrics 3acinnamates 3adata collection 3aflavanones 3aflavor 3afood chemistry 3aglycosides 3ametabolites 3aquinic acid 3asaffron 3aspermidine 3aterpenoids 0aCalendula 0aSafflower 0aMolecular networks 0aUV/VIS fingerprinting1 aKhattab, Amira R.1 aFrolov, Andrej1 aWessjohann, Ludger A.1 aFarag, Mohamed A.0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 367 p.130739-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1307393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03229naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002600113040001800139100002100157245014500178300001800323500001500341520160400356592002801960650001401988650001302002650002002015650001702035650001402052650002202066650000802088650002702096650002002123650001702143650001602160650002102176650001802197650003102215650002902246650003002275650002702305650001802332650007402350650001802424653002702442700002002469700001802489700002102507773012302528856003902651852000902690655001202699IND50059078420221118055248.0121011e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005907842DNAL7 a225115272pmid7 a10.1002/etc.18482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHancock, Dawn E.10aEffects of C60 on the Salmonella typhimurium TA100 transcriptome expression: Insights into C60‐mediated growth inhibition and mutagenicity  ap. 1438-1444.  a2019-12-06  aRapid advances are being made in the creation and use of nanomaterials, but little is known about the impact these materials might have on key microbial functions if introduced into the environment. Previous studies have generated conflicting results with respect to the impact of fullerenes on microbial activity. In the present study, Salmonella typhimurium TA100 was selected as a model microbial system with which to investigate further the impact of C60 aggregates on microbial growth, mutagenicity, and global transcript expression. Aggregates of C60 predominantly less than 100 nm significantly impacted Salmonella growth at concentrations of ≥0.5 mg/L. In addition, C60 aggregates also displayed mutagenic potential at concentrations ≥0.1 mg/L. Transcript expression analysis of S. typhimurium TA100 exposed to C60 for 24 h indicated that 271 transcripts had significant differential expression relative to controls with twofold or more change. Of particular interest was the increased expression of transcripts coding for proteins involved in energy metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, transcription, and DNA metabolism, and the decreased expression of transcripts coding for proteins involved in protein fate, transport, and binding and bacterial secretion systems. Collectively, these data indicate that C60 interacts with the outer membrane of S. typhimurium TA100, resulting in delayed growth and mutagenicity, most likely by interfering with key transport functions and inducing a stress response, respectively.

In this study, we explored the feasibility of microbial selenite reduction using methane by DAMO culture. Isotopic 13CH4 and long-term experiments showed that selenite reduction was coupled to methane oxidation, and selenite was ultimately reduced to Se (0) by the analyses of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The introduction of nitrate, the original electron acceptor in the DAMO culture, inhibited selenite reduction. Meanwhile, the microbial community of DAMO culture was significantly changed when the electron acceptor was changed from nitrate to selenite after long-term selenite reduction. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that Methylococcus (26%) became the predominant microbe performing selenite reduction and methane oxidation and the possible pathways of AOM accompanied with selenite reduction were proposed. This study revealed more potential relation during the biogeochemical cycle of carbon, nitrogen, and selenium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethylococcus 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3adenitrification 3along term experiments 3amethane 3amicrobial communities 3aniches 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aribosomal RNA 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aselenites 3aselenium 3asequence analysis 0aDAMO 0aMethane oxidation 0aSelenite reduction 0aNitrate 0aMicrobial community1 aWang, Xiu-Ning1 aLu, Yong-Ze1 aFu, Ling1 aZhang, Fang1 aLau, Tai-Chu1 aZeng, Raymond J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3060-588X0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 June 15, v. 669 p.168-174dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.1193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01305naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245031000167300001600477520021400493592002800707650001100735650002500746650001200771700001700783773015200800856007800952852000901030655001201039IND60521451120221117091203.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052145112DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1975-1-2342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAppel, R.q(Rolf),10aNotizen: Neue Synthese von N-Phosphoranyliden-schwefelsäureamiden, -schwefelsäurealkylesteramiden, -fluorschwefelsäureamid und -methansulfonsäureamid, II / New Synthesis of N-phosphoranylidene-sulfuric Acid Amides, -sulfuric Acid Alkylester Amides, -fluorosulfuric Acid Amide and -alkylsulfonamide, II  ap. 134-135.  aBy reaction of triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrachloride with methane sulfonamide (1 a) and the sulfamic acid derivatives (1 b-g) N-triphenylphosphoranylidene compounds of these substances could be obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamides 3acarbon tetrachloride 3amethane1 aEinig, Heinz0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 30, no. 1-2 p.134-135dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:16822x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1975-1-2343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04079naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245014400213300001100357506007600368520227000444592002802714596006802742506003702810650001202847650001802859650001602877650001002893650001902903650001202922650001602934650002102950650001002971650001102981650001702992650001003009650002003019650001603039650002303055650002203078650001203100651001003112651001003122651001303132651001203145700002803157700002803185700003003213700002303243700001603266773011603282856008203398852000903480655001203489IND60625672120221207111904.0191213e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062567212DNAL7 a10.1186/s40529-018-0243-92doi7 aPMC62881032pmcid7 a305357262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrần, Hữu Đăng10aIdentification, sexual dimorphism and aspects of the natural history of Sapria himalayana (Rafflesiaceae) on Vietnam’s Lang Biang Plateau  ap. 29.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Sapria is a distinctive and narrowly host-specific holoparasitic genus belonging to the Rafflesiaceae. Sapria himalayana, rare throughout its range from NE India, SW China, Thailand to Vietnam, is a little-understood species first recorded for Vietnam in 1959, and only recollected there over half a century later in February 2017. This has facilitated an assessment of its taxonomic identity and our understanding of its morphology and natural history aspects. RESULTS: Six populations of Sapria at Vietnam’s Tuyền Lâm Lake, and another two populations at the Nam Ban Protection Forest and the Cam Ly area were found, in an area of about 20 km in radius. Previously documented size attributes, morphological details and colour patterns allowed clear identification of the Vietnamese taxon as Sapria himalayana f. albovinosa. A full description of the species for Vietnam is provided. Past authors have distinguished the sexes by column form and structure, colour of the upper disk, details of the inner surface of the perigone tube, and presence of ovarial chambers below the column in the female. We present additional observations that male flowers consistently have more steeply held perigone lobes than females, in which the lobes were more spread out at wider angles in fully open flowers, and that males have a much lower cupule than females. The latter difference, especially, appears to be useful for quick determination of the sex even in the advanced floral bud stage. The host plant was the lianescent Tetrastigma laoticum (Vitaceae), but superficially it was not possible to ascertain the clonal relationship of neighbouring host lianas. Male and female flowers were found mixed together in the same cluster from one individual liana. Potential pollinators included Calliphorid and Stratiomyid flies observed visiting open flowers. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations have added to an increased understanding of the morphology of this highly specialized parasitic life form. More than this, we have ascertained its occurrence in Vietnam, with information made available to authorities of the Lâm Đồng Province where our studies were conducted, for the sites to be specially demarcated for conservation and carefully managed tourism use.  aPublisher supplied data  aĐTĐL.XH.11/15cVietnam’s Ministry of Science and Technology0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDiptera 3aRafflesiaceae 3aTetrastigma 3acolor 3afemale flowers 3afemales 3ahost plants 3ahost specificity 3alakes 3alianas 3amale flowers 3amales 3anatural history 3apollinators 3aprotection forests 3asexual dimorphism 3atourism 3aChina 3aIndia 3aThailand 3aVietnam1 aLưu, Hồng Trường,1 aNguyễn, Quốc Đạt1 aNguyễn, Hiếu Cường1 aAthen, Parusuraman1 aWong, K.

Chloroplast rps4 and nuclear ITS sequences were invariable within the studied specimens of the species, suggesting a low genetic variability, and the phylogenetic position is rather isolated with only obscure affinities to the group of closely related taxa around T. tortuosa and to T. fasciculata. The new species, seemingly a rather rare plant, was collected from dry and sunny to shaded limestone rocks.

To design, optimize, and manage landfills with a life span of several decades, a deeper understanding of long-term MSW behaviors is necessary and worthwhile. These behaviors should be modeled using approaches that account for coupled processes so as to capture the evolutionary mechanisms that are mainly dominated by biochemical, mechanical, hydraulic, and thermal processes, as well as the complex interactions among them. Many mathematical models have been developed over the past three decades to address this issue. However, most of them only emphasize some of these processes, with only few models accounting for all the processes. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the mathematical and numerical formulations of this coupled problem. Each process occurring in landfills is interpreted in detail using different sub-models and the corresponding parameter values. Then, the existing coupled models for MSW are reviewed, and the challenges and perspectives related to the modeling of the long-term behaviors of MSW are highlighted. We conclude that more reliable constitutive formulations based not only on well-designed laboratory tests but also on field tests are necessary to improve the modeling of MSW behaviors in future.  aPublisher supplied data 3alandfills 3alongevity 3amunicipal solid waste 3awaste management 0aCoupled processes 0aAnaerobic/aerobic landfill 0aBiodegradation 0aPhase transport 0aMSW deformation 0aNumerical modeling1 aFeng, Shi-Jin0 tWaste management.g2020 Dec., v. 118 p.161-179dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2020.08.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02918naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007500170300001400245500001900259520173700278592002802015650001902043650001402062650002902076650001302105650000902118650001402127650002302141650001202164650001602176650002102192651001202213653002602225653002502251700001702276700002702293773009402320856008502414852000902499655001202508IND60709481720221119205430.0201025e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070948172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2020.08.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReinhart, Debra10aCharacterization of Florida, U.S. landfills with elevated temperatures  ap. 55-61.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe occurrence of elevated temperatures within landfills is a challenging issue for landfill operators to detect and correct. Little is known regarding the causes of elevated temperatures (ETs) or the number of landfills currently operating under such conditions. Therefore, the goal of this research was to determine which landfills within Florida have been impacted by ETs, and to develop a more complete understanding of the factors that may lead to these landfills becoming elevated temperature landfills (ETLFs). Historical landfill gas wellhead data, waste deposition reports, and landfill site geometry were collected for 27 landfill cells through the Florida Department of Environmental Protection electronic document management system, OCULUS database and from landfill operators and owners. These data were evaluated to quantify the characteristics that result in landfills having ‘elevated’ temperatures. Gas data included landfill gas temperatures and methane, carbon dioxide, and balance gas content. Furthermore, landfill maps were created in ArcGIS to observe spatial distribution of ETs in landfills over time. Upon analysis of the landfill gas wellhead data, it was discovered that 74% of studied landfill cells had ET readings; regulatory limits specify a maximum allowable gas temperature of 55 °C (131 °F). It was discovered that 37% of landfill cells contained MSW ash; of these cells, 90% of them are considered ETLFs. ETLF cells are on-average double the site area and approximately 6 m deeper than the average non-ETLF cell. Furthermore, results suggest that heat propagation in most landfills is limited; however, heat propagation is possible if gas wells are turned off for an extended time period.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3adatabases 3aenvironmental protection 3ageometry 3aheat 3alandfills 3amanagement systems 3amethane 3atemperature 3awaste management 3aFlorida 0aElevated temperatures 0aGas extraction wells1 aJoslyn, Ryan1 aEmrich, Christopher T.0 tWaste management.g2020 Dec., v. 118 p.55-61dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2020.08.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02986naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011100167300001300278520160300291592002801894650001601922650001101938650001501949650001101964650001501975650002501990650003502015650001602050650002202066650002402088650001102112650001102123650001102134650001102145651001202156700002302168700001802191700002102209700002202230700002102252700001602273700001702289773010402306856008502410852000902495655001202504IND60531169720221119091341.0190215e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053116972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2016.03.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKojola, Ilpo10aWolf visitations close to human residences in Finland: The role of age, residence density, and time of day  ap. 9-14.  aLarge carnivorous mammals, such as the gray wolf (Canis lupus) have been recently expanding to human-dominated landscapes in many regions. Although wolves tend to avoid human infrastructure, visitations close to human residences might be unavoidable in territories that are highly fragmented by residential areas. House yard visits are of particular concern: according to the Finnish legislation, wolves that repeatedly approach within 150m from the nearest residential building can legally be killed for human safety. We analyzed the average distance from house yards and probability of house yard visitations by wolves against sex, age class, time of the day, season and house density for 25 territorial GPS-tracked wolves in Finland. Generally, wolves avoid houses — with mean distances higher than from random locations in the territory. This difference became higher with decreasing house density for sub-adults while for adults this difference decreased slightly with decreasing house density. Probability of visitation in house-yards increased with increasing house densities, was far higher at night than in the daytime, a difference that was greater with increasing house density. Sub-adults visited house-yards more often than adult wolves in the first summer after spring dispersal from the natal pack to a territory, but there was no difference in winter. The indication that wolves learn within a season to avoid moving to near residential buildings in human-dominated territories is when the territory becomes more familiar to wolves which is a noteworthy result for the management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis lupus 3aadults 3acarnivores 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3alaws and regulations 3anatural resources conservation 3aprobability 3aresidential areas 3aresidential housing 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter 3awolves 3aFinland1 aHallikainen, Ville1 aMikkola, Kari1 aGurarie, Eliezer1 aHeikkinen, Samuli1 aKaartinen, Salla1 aNikula, Ari1 aNivala, Vesa0 tBiological conservation.g2016 June, v. 198 p.9-14dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2016.03.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245017800174520107300352592002801425650001701453650002501470650001601495650001401511650001501525650001401540650001901554650001801573650001101591650001601602650002001618650001701638653001501655653001401670653001501684653002201699700002101721700002201742700002201764700001701786700002201803700001901825700001901844700002301863773010001886856008701986852000902073655001202082IND60746639920221122221534.0210918e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074663992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1307432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMustafa, Ahmed M.12aA new HPLC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of 36 polyphenols in blueberry, strawberry and their commercial products and determination of antioxidant activity  aBerry fruits consumption has increased in recent years because they are rich sources of polyphenols with reported health benefits. The aim of the present work was to develop a new comprehensive and fast HPLC-MS/MS method for simultaneous determination of 36 phenolic compounds (7 anthocyanins, 9 flavonols, 4 flavan-3-ols, 2 dihydrochalcones, 2 flavanones and 12 phenolic acids) present in blueberry, strawberry, and their fruit jam. Blueberry fruits showed higher contents of anthocyanins, flavonols and phenolic acids, while strawberry fruits exhibited higher contents of flavan-3-ols, dihydrochalcones and flavanones. Anthocyanins were the main phenolic constituents in both berries. Furthermore, the higher total phenolic content in the blueberry fruit and jam justified their greater antioxidant capacity measured by DPPH free radical assay, compared to strawberry. In conclusion, this new HPLC-MS/MS method is useful and reliable for quality control and authentication analyses of blueberry and strawberry fruits and their commercial food products, such as jams.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3ablueberries 3aflavanols 3aflavanones 3aflavonols 3afood chemistry 3afree radicals 3afruits 3apolyphenols 3aquality control 3astrawberries 0aHPLC-MS/MS 0aBlueberry 0aStrawberry 0aPhenolic compound1 aAngeloni, Simone1 aAbouelenein, Doaa1 aAcquaticci, Laura1 aXiao, Jianbo1 aSagratini, Gianni1 aMaggi, Filippo1 aVittori, Sauro1 aCaprioli, Giovanni0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 367 p.130743-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1307433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245014000173300001600313520139200329592002801721650002501749650002501774650001101799650001401810653001001824653001001834653001001844653001001854653002701864653002401891653003301915653002301948653002301971700003201994700002002026700002002046773010002066856008602166852000902252655001202261IND60524889120221118085827.0190412e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052488912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.04.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBondarchik, Julia10aImproving the objectivity of sustainability indices by a novel approach for combining contrasting effects: Happy Planet Index revisited  ap. 400-406.  aMeasuring complex and rather intuitive qualities such as sustainability requires combining many different measures together. These measures often quantify contrasting effects. The resulting composite index then also depends not only on the component indices but also on the way that these have been combined together. An example of such a measure is the Happy Planet Index (HPI) that aggregates information on positive qualities like life-expectancy and human well-being with negative ones like ecological footprint to rank countries according to their sustainability. However, since component indices are often mutually correlated and feature quite different distributions of entities ranked, elaborate rules are used in the process of combination. As a result, the resulting composite index may look somewhat contrived and its rankings may depend heavily on subjective parameters in the combination process. We propose a geometrically motivated parameter-free method for combining indices with contrasting effects together. The method is independent of the number of contrasting indices to be combined and eliminates mutual correlation between component indices by using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analysis. As an example of its use, we revisit the Happy Planet Index and demonstrate the impact of adding new component indices to HPI on ranking nations by their sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological footprint 3aenvironmental impact 3ahumans 3alongevity 0a15Axx 0a15A18 0a65Fxx 0a65F15 0aSustainability indices 0aComposite indicator 0aSingular value decomposition 0aHappy Planet Index 0aGlobal Peace Index1 aJabłońska-Sabuka, Matylda1 aLinnanen, Lassi1 aKauranne, Tuomo0 tEcological indicators.g2016 Oct., v. 69 p.400-406dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.04.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012100165520117800286592002801464650001401492650001201506650001001518650000901528650001801537650001501555653001801570653001501588653002101603653001001624653002201634653002001656700001601676700002001692773009301712856008601805852000901891655001201900IND60735577620221120173738.0220207e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073557762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e068882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOjo, J.S.10aDynamical evolution of vertical profile of rain structures observed using ground-based radar over a tropical station  aIn this study, measurements of vertical profiles of rain parameters have been made using vertically pointing micro rain radar (VPMRR) at Akure (7.30° N, 5.13° E). Rain parameter data collected over seven-month rainfall episodes during the intense rainy season (April to October) have been analyzed for a dynamical evolutionary trend over the site. Nearly all the episodes observed followed a similar pattern, hence, a single continuous rainfall episode occurring between 20:45:00 h and 21:14:00 h Greenwich Meridian Time (GMT) local time on 6ᵗʰ August 2018 is presented in this report. The results show no significant changes to the rain parameters (such as rain rate and liquid water content) nor contributed to the raindrop size distribution, based on average fall velocity of 6.55 m s⁻¹ and rain rates within 1.3 and 2.6 mm h⁻¹. This is to enable a stable fall for the dominant drops during the period. Further, the results revealed the transformation and collision of smaller drops to enhance a stable fall of larger drops during the rain event. The information from the study will be useful for radar meteorologists and microwave engineers in their designs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevolution 3aliquids 3aradar 3arain 3awater content 3awet season 0aRaindrop size 0aRain types 0aVertical profile 0aVPMRR 0aTropical location 0aDynamical trend1 aAkoma, D.B.1 aOlurotimi, E.O.0 tHeliyon.g2021 Apr., v. 7, no. 4 p.e06888-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e068883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01679naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002100161245007800182300001800260500000900278520061700287592002800904650001600932650001300948650000900961650001800970650001300988650002101001650001001022650001101032650001001043700002001053773015101073856009601224852000901320655001201329IND60667834520221118164900.0191125e198509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066783452DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1985.03615995004900050048x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaManna, John M.12aA Suction Apparatus for Orienting Clay Minerals Onto Porous Ceramic Tiles  ap. 1318-1319.  aepub  aA new design is presented for an apparatus that makes oriented mounts for the x-ray study of clay minerals.

RESULTS: Rabbit bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells proliferated well on electrospun SF mat. The autologous Achilles tendon wrapped with electrospun SF mat was transplanted into the bone tunnel (experimental group) in a rabbit extra-articular model, while the unwrapped tendon was transplanted as control group. The electrospun SF mat wrapping could enhance tendon-bone healing of autologous tendon evaluated by micro-computed tomography scanning, histological examination and mechanical testing. At 6 and 12 weeks post-operatively, the failure loads of experimental group were both significantly higher than those of control group (40.5 ± 6.3 vs. 31.8 ± 4.6 N, P = 0.039 at 6 weeks; 67.1 ± 9. vs. 52.2 ± 4.7 N, P = 0.012 at 12 weeks).

Seasonal variations in the time series, identified using spectral analysis, were incorporated into the model which was used to determine transfer kinetic parameters and to predict ¹³⁷Cs and ⁹⁹Tc concentrations in seaweed, as influenced by levels in ambient seawater. An optimisation method combining evolutionary and grid search minimisation techniques was adopted to determine the best values for the model parameters, from which concentration factors (CF) and biological half-lives (tb₁/₂) for ¹³⁷Cs and ⁹⁹Tc in F. vesiculosus were calculated. CF values of 170–179 and 1.1×105lkg⁻¹ (dry weight) were obtained for ¹³⁷Cs and ⁹⁹Tc, respectively, while the corresponding tb₁/₂ values were 39–47 and 32days, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFucus vesiculosus 3acoasts 3ahalf life 3amacroalgae 3amodels 3aseasonal variation 3aseawater 3aspectral analysis 3asystem optimization 3atime series analysis 3awater pollution1 aLeón Vintró, L.1 aMitchell, P.I.1 aMcMahon, C.A.1 aSmith, K.1 aLong, S.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2011 Nov., v. 62, no. 11 p.2337-2344dElsevier Ltdx0025-326X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2011.08.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03591naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245016400175520187900339592002802218650002202246650002502268650001502293650001402308650001002322650002202332650003002354650001502384650002702399650001702426650001402443650001902457650002502476650002602501650002002527650001702547651001002564651001002574653003502584653001602619653002402635700002502659700002902684700002502713700002002738700003202758700002102790700002802811773011802839856008302957852000903040655001203049IND60666033620221120033931.0191126e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066603362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2019.1015122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThangaraj, Sonai Rajan10aGenetic diversity and its geographic structure in Sitophilus oryzae (Coleoptera; Curculionidae) across India – implications for managing phosphine resistance  aThe rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae, is a serious global pest of stored grains. Fumigation with phosphine gas is the primary control method for S. oryzae, but the indiscriminate and prolonged use of phosphine gas has led to the development of heritable resistance. Developing and implementing an effective phosphine resistance management strategy for S. oryzae relies on an understanding of its genetic diversity and any structuring of that diversity geographically. We therefore sequenced the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene from 143 S. oryzae specimens collected from 37 locations across India, and from that assessed the genetic diversity of the species and its phylogeographic structuring. In addition, we compared the genetic diversity in Indian S. oryzae populations (the hypothesised origin of this beetle) to global populations. Genetic diversity was low in Indian S. oryzae, with only eight haplotypes (including two very common haplotypes) identified. The low level of mitochondrial diversity observed in this species appears typical of stored product pests, perhaps suggesting that low mitochondrial diversity is associated with repeated phosphine fumigations, which may eliminate low frequency haplotypes. The genetic diversity of S. oryzae in India is, however, higher than in many other countries, though comparable levels were identified in China. There was no evidence of population genetic structure across India, with most haplotypes found in three of the broad biogeographic regions. This lack of phylogeographic structuring indicates significant gene-flow across India, most likely through the incidental anthropogenic transport of this relatively poor (or reluctant) flyer. The major practical implication is that phosphine resistance management for S. oryzae needs to be dealt with country wide, as populations are not isolated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSitophilus oryzae 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3afumigation 3agene flow 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ageographical distribution 3ahaplotypes 3ainsecticide resistance 3amitochondria 3aphosphine 3aphylogeography 3apopulation structure 3aresistance management 3astorage insects 3astored grain 3aChina 3aIndia 0aCytochrome c oxidase subunit I 0aRice weevil 0aStored product pest1 aMcCulloch, Graham A.1 aSubtharishi, Subramanian1 aChandel, Rahul Kumar1 aDebnath, Sadhan1 aSubramaniam, Chandrasekaran1 aWalter, Gimme H.1 aSubbarayalu, Mohankumar0 tJournal of stored products research.g2019 Dec., v. 84 p.101512-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2019.1015123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245012500181300001400306520144400320592002801764650004101792650000901833650001801842650001201860650001501872650003501887650001301922650001301935650001101948650001901959650001401978650001501992650001602007650003302023650001002056650002402066651001602090700002102106700002902127700001602156700001402172773009702186856004802283852000902331655001202340IND50061629220221121053317.0130319e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006162922DNAL7 a227911402pmid7 a10.1007/s00267-012-9903-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Yang10aAssessing Sediment Yield for Selected Watersheds in the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin Under Future Agricultural Scenarios  ap. 59-69.  aIn the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin (GLB), corn acreage has been expanding since 2005 in response to high demand for corn as an ethanol feedstock. This study integrated remote sensing-derived products and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) within a geographic information system (GIS) modeling environment to assess the impacts of cropland change on sediment yield within four selected watersheds in the GLB. The SWAT models were calibrated during a 6 year period (2000–2005), and predicted stream flows were validated. The R ² values were 0.76, 0.80, 0.72, and 0.81 for the St. Joseph River, the St. Mary River, the Peshtigo River, and the Cattaraugus Creek watersheds, respectively. The corresponding E (Nash and Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient) values ranged from 0.24 to 0.79. The average annual sediment yields (tons/ha/year) ranged from 0.12 to 4.44 for the baseline (2000 to 2008) condition. Sediment yields were predicted to increase for possible future cropland change scenarios. The first scenario was to convert all “other” agricultural row crop types (i.e., sorghum) to corn fields and switch the current/baseline crop rotation into continuous corn. The average annual sediment yields increased 7–42 % for different watersheds. The second scenario was to further expand the corn planting to hay/pasture fields. The average annual sediment yields increased 33–127 % compared with baseline conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3acorn 3acrop rotation 3aethanol 3afeedstocks 3ageographic information systems 3apastures 3aplanting 3arivers 3asediment yield 3asediments 3awatersheds 2aAgriculture 2aGeologic Sedimentsxanalysis 2aLakes 2aModels, Theoretical 3aGreat Lakes1 aLunetta, Ross S.1 aMacpherson, Alexander J.1 aLuo, Junyan1 aChen, Guo0 tEnvironmental management.g2013 Jan., v. 51, no. 1 p.59-69dSpringer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-012-9903-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001400189245014000203300001600343506007600359520094200435592002801377506003701405650002201442650001201464650001201476650001501488650002301503650000901526650001501535650002701550650001101577650001201588650001201600650001401612650001101626650002001637650001701657653001901674653000901693653002201702653002101724653001101745653001801756700001701774700001601791700001301807700001401820700001801834700001601852773011001868856008301978852000902061655001202070IND60527261720221207072217.0190415e20160307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052726172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molp.2015.09.0172doi7 aPMC47914082pmcid7 a264554612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBöhm, J.10aVenus Flytrap HKT1-Type Channel Provides for Prey Sodium Uptake into Carnivorous Plant Without Conflicting with Electrical Excitability  ap. 428-436.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe animal diet of the carnivorous Venus flytrap, Dionaea muscipula, contains a sodium load that enters the capture organ via an HKT1-type sodium channel, expressed in special epithelia cells on the inner trap lobe surface. DmHKT1 expression and sodium uptake activity is induced upon prey contact. Here, we analyzed the HKT1 properties required for prey sodium osmolyte management of carnivorous Dionaea. Analyses were based on homology modeling, generation of model-derived point mutants, and their functional testing in Xenopus oocytes. We showed that the wild-type HKT1 and its Na+- and K+-permeable mutants function as ion channels rather than K+ transporters driven by proton or sodium gradients. These structural and biophysical features of a high-capacity, Na+-selective ion channel enable Dionaea glands to manage prey-derived sodium loads without confounding the action potential-based information management of the flytrap.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDionaea muscipula 3aXenopus 3aanimals 3acarnivores 3acarnivorous plants 3adiet 3aepithelium 3ainformation management 3amodels 3amutants 3aoocytes 3apotassium 3asodium 3asodium channels 3atransporters 0asodium channel 0aHKT1 0aDionaea muscipula 0aaction potential 0aglands 0asodium uptake1 aScherzer, S.1 aShabala, S.1 aKrol, E.1 aNeher, E.1 aMueller, T.D.1 aHedrich, R.0 tMolecular plant.g2016 Mar. 07, v. 9, no. 3 p.428-436dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2015.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02357naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245009700161300001600258520079700274592002801071650001501099650002001114650001401134650002301148650002101171650001501192650001001207650001201217650000901229650001301238650001301251650001401264650001101278650001701289650001801306653003101324653002901355653002301384653002201407653001901429653001101448700001701459700001501476700001701491700001601508700001701524700005701541773012501598856008301723852000901806655001201815IND60699626420221118011524.0201023e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069962642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.06.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ge10aControllable syngas production on gold nanowires/nickel foam electrode in non-aqueous system  ap. 290-296.  aA hierarchical electrode is prepared with Au nanowires grown on nickel foam. With large specific active surface area, it is used for producing syngas (H₂/CO) with controllable ratio, through electrochemical process in DMF. The synthetic innovation lies in the use of 3-cyanopropyltriethoxysilane, to achieve the adsorption of appropriate amount of Au seeds for the one-dimensional growth of ultrathin Au nanowires (d ≈ 5 nm). With the nanowires forest on the three-dimensional porous nickel foam substrate, syngas is produced by electro-catalysis with high overall Faradic efficiency and tunable H₂/CO ratios. This synthetic strategy opens a facile way to synthesize the hierarchical nanostructured materials, and broaden the choice of the catalysts for electrochemical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3afoams 3aforests 3agold 3ahydrogen 3ananogold 3ananowires 3anickel 3asurface area 3asynthesis gas 0aHierarchical nanostructure 0aUltrathin gold nanowires 0aPorous nickel foam 0aElectro-reduction 0aCarbon dioxide 0aSyngas1 aXu, Weichang1 aTian, Keyi1 aSu, Dongmeng1 aXu, Jiafang1 aChen, Hongyu1 aZhang, Yanhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5969-08490 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 579 p.290-296dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.06.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245014800171300001800319520135900337592002801696650002201724650002501746650001701771650001501788650002101803650001101824650001101835650002301846650001401869650002601883650001301909653001401922653001801936653002201954653002301976653001201999653001902011700002202030700001702052700001702069773013402086856008702220852000902307655001202316IND60586190220221119070930.0220726e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058619022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.11.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJadhav, Aparna10aSequence and structure insights of kazal type thrombin inhibitor protein: Studied with phylogeny, homology modeling and dynamic MM/GBSA studies  ap. 1045-1052.  aDespite the wide medical importance of serine protease inhibitors, many of kazal type proteins are still to be explored. These thrombin inhibiting proteins are found in the digestive system of hematophagous organisms mainly Arthropods. We studied one of such protein i.e. Kazal type-1 protein from sand-fly Phlebotomus papatasi as its structure and interaction with thrombin is unclear. Initially, Dipetalin a kazal-follistasin domain protein was run through PSI-BLAST to retrieve related sequences. Using this set of sequence a phylogenetic tree was constructed, which identified a distantly related kazal type-1 protein. A three-dimensional structure was predicted for this protein and was aligned with Rhodniin for further evaluation. To have a comparative understanding of it’s binding at the thrombin active site, the aligned kazal model-thrombin and rhodniin-thrombin complexes were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations. Dynamics analysis with reference to main chain RMSD, H-chain residue RMSF and total energy showed rhodniin-thrombin complex as a more stable system. Further, the MM/GBSA method was applied that calculated the binding free energy (ΔGbᵢₙdᵢₙg) for rhodniin and kazal model as −220.32kcal/Mol and −90.70kcal/Mol, respectively. Thus, it shows that kazal model has weaker bonding with thrombin, unlike rhodniin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aPhlebotomus papatasi 3aactive sites 3aarthropods 3adigestive system 3aenergy 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aphylogeny 3aproteinase inhibitors 3athrombin 0aPhylogeny 0aKazal protein 0aHomology modeling 0aMolecular dynamics 0aMM/GBSA 0aBinding energy1 aDash, RadhaCharan1 aHirwani, Raj1 aAbdin, Malik0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Mar., v. 108 p.1045-1052dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.11.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03635naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011200167300001800279520150600297592002801803650001601831650001601847650002201863650001701885650002701902650002501929650001401954650002301968650002201991650002002013650001402033650002102047650001102068650002102079650001302100650002402113650001302137650004902150650002002199650002402219650001302243653000802256653001102264653001302275653001002288653000802298653001202306653002002318653004402338653001802382653001602400653003802416700001802454700001802472700002002490700006402510700002302574700002402597700002102621700001902642700001802661700002102679773012202700856008202822852000902904655001202913IND60619085120221118015236.0181207e20181207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061908512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2018.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShibazaki, Chie10aHydration Structures of the Human Protein Kinase CK2α Clarified by Joint Neutron and X-ray Crystallography  ap. 5094-5104.  aCasein kinase 2 (CK2) has broad phosphorylation activity against various regulatory proteins, which are important survival factors in eukaryotic cells. To clarify the hydration structure and catalytic mechanism of CK2, we determined the crystal structure of the alpha subunit of human CK2 containing hydrogen and deuterium atoms using joint neutron (1.9 Å resolution) and X-ray (1.1 Å resolution) crystallography. The analysis revealed the structure of conserved water molecules at the active site and a long potential hydrogen bonding network originating from the catalytic Asp156 that is well known to enhance the nucleophilicity of the substrate OH group to the γ-phospho group of ATP by proton elimination. His148 and Asp214 conserved in the protein kinase family are located in the middle of the network. The water molecule forming a hydrogen bond with Asp214 appears to be deformed. In addition, mutational analysis of His148 in CK2 showed significant reductions by 40%–75% in the catalytic efficiency with similar affinity for ATP. Likewise, remarkable reductions to less than 5% were shown by corresponding mutations on His131 in death-associated protein kinase 1, which belongs to a group different from that of CK2. These findings shed new light on the catalytic mechanism of protein kinases in which the hydrogen bond network through the C-terminal domain may assist the general base catalyst to extract a proton with a link to the bulk solvent via intermediates of a pair of residues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactive sites 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aamino acid sequences 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acrystal structure 3acrystallography 3adeuterium 3aeukaryotic cells 3ahumans 3ahydrogen bonding 3amutation 3amutational analysis 3aneutrons 3anon-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aregulatory proteins 3asolvents 0aCK2 0ahCK2α 0ahcaCK2α 0aDAPK1 0aDTT 0aPEG MME 0acasein kinase 2 0ajoint neutron and X-ray crystallography 0ahydrogen atom 0aproton wire 0adeath-associated protein kinase 11 aArai, Shigeki1 aShimizu, Rumi1 aSaeki, Morihisa1 aKinoshita, Takayoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2850-54091 aOstermann, Andreas1 aSchrader, Tobias E.1 aKurosaki, Yuzuru1 aSunami, Tomoko1 aKuroki, Ryota1 aAdachi, Motoyasu0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2018 Dec. 07, v. 430, no. 24 p.5094-5104dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2018.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245013300175300001600308520114300324592002801467650001601495650001301511650001401524650001201538650001601550650001201566650001401578650001401592700001901606700002001625700002201645700002201667773010501689856005501794852000901849655001201858IND4476409320221118215722.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447640932DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2311.2011.01314.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWHITE, JENNIFER A.10aParasitoid bacterial symbionts as markers of withinâhost competitive outcomes: superparasitoid advantage and sex ratio bias  ap. 786-789.  a1. Bacterial symbionts have the potential to alter insect fitness, which could influence insect competitive ability. To investigate this possibility, withinâhost competitions were staged between individuals of the parasitoid, Encarsia inaron Walker, that were differentially infected with the bacterial symbionts Cardinium and Wolbachia. 2. When parasitoids of different infection status parasitised the same whitefly host, there was no evidence that symbiont infection influenced the outcome of competition. 3. Using symbionts as markers, a significant advantage for the second (superparasitising) wasp was detected when eggs were deposited within 4 h of one another, probably as a result of ovicidal behaviour by the superparasitoid, but not when eggs were deposited 1 day apart. Additionally, the emerged sex ratio of superparasitoid offspring was male biased when eggs were deposited 4 h after the initial eggs, but had an even sex ratio when deposited 1 day later. 4. The present study demonstrates the potential utility of symbiont infection as a marking system for investigating withinâhost competition among parasitoids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAleyrodidae 3aEncarsia 3aWolbachia 3ainsects 3aparasitoids 3aprogeny 3asex ratio 3asymbionts1 aHURAK, CHRISTA1 aWULFF, JASON A.1 aHUNTER, MARTHA S.1 aKELLY, SUZANNE E.0 tEcological entomology.g2011 Dec., v. 36, no. 6 p.786-789dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2011.01314.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245016500170300001800335520130000353592002801653650004401681650002201725650001501747650001501762650001201777650001901789650001901808650001101827650001301838650000701851650001901858650002701877650003301904650002001937650002001957650002301977650001602000650003702016650001502053653001502068653003102083653002802114700001902142700002102161700001802182773013402200856008702334852000902421655001202430IND60586190320221119070849.0220726e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058619032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.11.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohamed, S.K.10aCoupled adsorption-photocatalytic degradation of crystal violet under sunlight using chemically synthesized grafted sodium alginate/ZnO/graphene oxide composite  ap. 1185-1198.  aThis research aimed to synthesize natural polymer nanocomposite and employ it for coupled adsorption- photocatalytic degradation of crystal violet. Sodium alginate-g-poly (acrylic acid-co-cinnamic acid) and its composites with ZnO nanorods and graphene oxide sheets were synthesized and characterized using FT-IR, XRD, SEM, HR-TEM and DR/UV–vis spectroscopy. The adsorption efficiency of samples for crystal violet has been studied in the dark. The effect of different parameters as pH, initial dye concentration, contact time and temperature on the adsorption efficiency of the synthesized sample has been examined. Kinetics studies showed that the adsorption of all samples was well described by the pseudo-second-order model and the equilibrium adsorption results fitted Freundlich model. The maximum adsorption capacity achieved at pH 5.0 was 13.85 mg g⁻¹. Thermodynamic studies exhibited that the adsorption is spontaneous, endothermic in nature and leads to higher entropy. Coupled adsorption-photocatalytic degradation studies under sunlight showed an enhancement in the removal efficiency by 10%. In the case of sodium alginate-g-poly (acrylic acid-co-cinnamic acid)/ZnO/graphene oxide composite, the removal efficiency after 5 h under sunlight was 94% versus 84% in the dark.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3aendothermy 3aentropy 3agentian violet 3agraphene oxide 3amodels 3ananorods 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3apolymer nanocomposites 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium alginate 3asolar radiation 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azinc oxide 0aAdsorption 0aPhotocatalytic degradation 0aGrafted sodium alginate1 aHegazy, Sh.

However, many of these models are black boxes that are difficult for humans to understand, which may cause severe consequences such as unexplained decisions and failure in accountability. To develop interpretable predictive models for beach water quality, we evaluate five tree-based models, namely classification tree, random forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM, and employ a state-of-the-art explanation method SHAP to explain the models. When tested on the Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentration data collected from three beach sites along Lake Erie shores, LightGBM, followed by XGBoost, achieves the highest averaged precision and recall scores. For all three sites, both models suggest lake turbidity as the most important predictor, and elucidate the crucial role of accurate local data of wave height and rainfall in the model development. Local SHAP values further reveal the robustness of the importance of lake turbidity as its SHAP value increases nearly monotonically with its value and is minimally affected by other environmental factors. Moreover, we found an intriguing interaction between lake turbidity and day-of-year. This work suggests that the combination of LightGBM and SHAP has a promising potential to develop interpretable models for predicting microbial water quality in freshwater lakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aaccountability 3afreshwater 3amodels 3arain 3aresearch 3arisk 3aturbidity 3awater quality 3aLake Erie 0aBeach water quality 0aMachine learning 0aFecal indicator bacteria 0aLake turbidity 0aSHAP 0aLightGBM1 aQiao, Jundong1 aYu, Guan1 aWang, Leizhi1 aLi, Hong-Yi1 aLiao, Zhen,1 aZhu, Zhenduo0 tWater research.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 211 p.118078-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.1180783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02336naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245015200177300001800329520087600347592002801223650001601251650001701267650001401284650001401298650002101312650002301333650002301356653001701379653001501396653002001411653003101431653002001462653001701482653002001499700001801519700002301537700002601560700001701586700002501603700002001628773013401648856008701782852000901869655001201878IND60586190520221119070825.0220726e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058619052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.11.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDekamin, Mohammad G.10aAlginic acid: A mild and renewable bifunctional heterogeneous biopolymeric organocatalyst for efficient and facile synthesis of polyhydroquinolines  ap. 1273-1280.  aAlginic acid, a widely used naturally occurring carbohydrate which is generally derived from brown seaweeds, can be considered as a bifunctional heterogeneous and green biopolymeric organocatalyst. Alginic acid, without any post-modification with active Bronsted or Lewis acid centers, was found to be a highly active, cost-effective, commercially-available, renewable and recoverable heterogeneous biopolymeric organocatalyst for the expeditious synthesis of polyhydroquinolines (PHQs). Polyhydroquinolines were synthesized from the four-component Hantzsch reaction of ethyl acetoacetate, different aldehydes, ammonium acetate and cyclic 1,3-diones under mild conditions in high to quantitative yields, 75–97%, using alginic acid. Furthermore, alginic acid was found to be reusable for at least 6 consecutive cycles without considerable loss of its catalytic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aPhaeophyceae 3aaldehydes 3aalginates 3aammonium acetate 3acatalytic activity 3acost effectiveness 0aAlginic acid 0aBiopolymer 0aOrganocatalysis 0aPolyhydroquinolines (PHQs) 0aHantzsch esters 0aHeterocycles 0aGreen chemistry1 aKarimi, Zahra1 aLatifidoost, Zahra1 aIlkhanizadeh, Siamand1 aDaemi, Hamed1 aNaimi-Jamal, M.

In brief, mice are anesthetized using injectable drugs and are made to lay in the dorsal position. Urine is vacated from the bladder and 50 µL of poly-L-lysine (PLL) is slowly instilled at a rate of 10 µL/20 s using a 24 G IV catheter. It is left in the bladder for 20 min by stoppering the catheter. The catheter is removed and PLL is vacated by gentle pressure on the bladder. This is followed by instillation of the murine bladder cancer cell line (1 x 105 cells/50 µL) at a rate of 10 µL/20 s. The catheter is stoppered to prevent premature evacuation. After 1 h, the mice are revived with a reversal drug, and the bladder is vacated. The slow instillation rate is important, as it reduces vesico-ureteral reflux, which can cause tumors to occur in the upper urinary tract and in the kidneys. The cell line should be well re-suspended to reduce clumping of cells, as this can lead to uneven tumor sizes after implantation. This technique induces tumors with high efficiency. Tumor growth is monitored by urinary PSA secretion. PSA marker monitoring is more reliable than ultrasound or fluorescence imaging for the detection of the presence of tumors in the bladder. Tumors in mice generally reach a maximum size that negatively impacts health by about 3 - 4 weeks if left untreated. By monitoring tumor growth, it is possible to differentiate mice that were cured from those that were not successfully implanted with tumors. With only end-point analysis, the latter may be mistakenly assumed to have been cured by therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abladder 3acatheters 3acell lines 3afemales 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3akidneys 3amice 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aneoplasm cells 3aprostate-specific antigen 3asecretion 3atherapeutics 3aurinary bladder neoplasms 3aurine1 aKesavan, Esuvaranathan1 aMahendran, Ratha0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Jan. 12, , no. 119 p.e55078-e55078dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/550783Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/55078/a-murine-orthotopic-bladder-tumor-model-and-tumor-detection-system  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03992naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245013100163520233800294592002802632650002102660650001902681650001302700650002002713650001502733650001702748650001002765650002002775650001102795650001302806650001802819650002002837650002102857650002402878650002002902653002502922653000902947653000902956653001702965653003102982653000703013653000803020653000703028653000803035653001303043653000703056653000803063653000703071653000703078653001003085653000803095653000703103653000903110653000803119653000803127700001403135700001403149773008703163856008303250852000903333655001203342IND60767864120221121043014.0220706e20220505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076786412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2022.1462952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Guotao10aTorR/TorS Two-Component system resists extreme acid environment by regulating the key response factor RpoS in Escherichia coli  aResponse to acid stress is critical for Escherichia coli to successfully complete its life-cycle. Acid resistance is an indispensable mechanism that allows neutralophilic bacteria, such as E. coli, to survive in the gastrointestinal tract. Escherichia coli acid tolerance has been extensively studied over the past decades, and most studies have focused on mechanisms of gene regulation. Bacterial two-component signal transduction systems sense and respond to external environmental changes through regulating genes expression. However, there has been little research on the mechanism of the TorR/TorS system in acid resistance, and how TorR/TorS regulate the expression ofacid-resistantgenes is still unclear. We found that TorR/TorS deletion in E. coli cells led to a growth defect in extreme acid conditions,andthis defectmightdepend on the nutritional conditionsand growth phase.TorS/TorR sensed an extremely acidic environment, and this TorR phosphorylation process might not be entirely dependent on TorS.RNA-seqand RT-qPCR results suggested that TorR regulated expressions of gadB, gadC, hdeA, gadE, mdtE, mdtF, gadX, and slp acid-resistant genes. Compared with wild-type cells, the stress response factor RpoSlevels and itsexpressions were significantly decreased in Δ torR cellsstimulated by extreme acid. And under these circumstances, the expression of iraM was significantly reduced to 0.6-fold inΔ torR cells. Electrophoreticmobility shift assay showed that TorR-His₆ could interact with the rpoS promoter sequence in vitro. β-galactosidase activity assayresultsapprovedthat TorR might bind the rpoS promoter region in vivo. After the mutation of the TorR-box in the rpoS promoter region, these interactions were no longer observed. Taken together, we propose thatTorS and potential Hanks model Ser/Thr kinase received an external acid stress signal and then phosphorylated TorR, which guided the expressions of a variety of acid resistance genes. Moreover,TorRcoped with extreme acid environmentsthroughRpoS, levels of which might be maintained byIraM. Finally,TorR may confer E. coli with the abilityto resist gastric acid, allowing the bacterium to reach the surface of the terminal ileum and large intestine mucosal epithelial cells through the gastric acid barrier, andestablishcolonization and pathogenicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aacid tolerance 3abacteria 3adigestive tract 3aepithelium 3agastric acid 3aileum 3alarge intestine 3amodels 3amutation 3apathogenicity 3aphosphorylation 3apromoter regions 3asignal transduction 3astress response 0aTwo-component system 0aTorR 0aRpoS 0aExtream acid 0aEnvironmental adaptability 0aAR 0aamp 0aBP 0aCam 0aCasa/CAA 0aCC 0aKan 0aMF 0aOD 0ar.p.m 0aTCS 0aTE 0aTMAO 0aTSS 0aTTS1 aMorigen, 1 aYao, Yuan0 tGene.g2022 May 05, v. 821 p.146295-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2022.1462953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245016000172520109900332592002801431650002201459650001001481650001801491650002101509650001901530650001201549650001601561650001601577650001401593650001301607650001801620650002001638650000901658650001701667650001501684650001401699653001901713653002801732653002701760653002701787653001101814700001901825700002001844700001901864773011101883856008401994852000902078655001202087IND60735578520221120173731.0211003e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073557852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biteb.2021.1007052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalita, Naba Kumar10aBiodegradation of biopolymeric composites and blends under different environmental conditions: Approach towards end-of-life panacea for crop sustainability  aThis study reports the biodegradation behaviour of polylactic acid (PLA) based biocomposites under three different types of compost.

For outdoor (uncontrolled) degradation, natural soil available was selected for the test and samples were buried 20 cm deep. After bioplastic biodegradation under composting condition the final biomass formed was used to evaluate its ecotoxicological impact on crop (Solanum tuberosum L) growth following OECD 2006 test guidelines. This study revealed current understanding to spot the data gaps and future analysis priorities related to final biomass of bioplastic biodegradation as well as biopolymer's tremendous role in “nature-to-nature” sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aalgae 3abiocomposites 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3abiomass 3abioplastics 3abiopolymers 3acellulose 3acomposts 3aecotoxicology 3apolylactic acid 3asoil 3asoil quality 3atechnology 3awood dust 0aBiodegradation 0aPoly(lactic acid) (PLA) 0aPolycaprolactone (PCL) 0aNatural soil condition 0aPotato1 aHazarika, Doli1 aKalamdhad, Ajay1 aKatiyar, Vimal0 tBioresource technology reports.g2021 Sept., v. 15 p.100705-dElsevier LtdwJournal:26760x2589-014X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biteb.2021.1007053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03397naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245013700169520166900306592002801975650002802003650002902031650001202060650001602072650001202088650001402100650002202114650001002136650001502146650001402161650001402175650003102189650001402220650003002234650002002264650001402284650001402298651001002312653002202322653002902344653001902373653002502392653002002417700001802437700001802455700001402473700001702487700001702504700001402521700001602535700001402551700001502565700001702580773009902597856009002696852000902786655001202795IND60762972720221120124044.0220228e20220330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076297272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7378852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi, Zihao10aNatural outbreaks and molecular characteristics of Streptococcus agalactiae infection in farmed American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana)  aBetween June and September 2019, a disease outbreak resulted in high mortality rates on four American bullfrog farms in Wenchang, Hainan Province, China. The main clinical signs included congestion and hemorrhage of the skin on the abdomen and hind limbs, ascites, hepatomegaly and internal organ hyperemia. Gram-positive cocci were isolated from the primary organs and tissues of 149 of 160 collected dead and moribund bullfrogs. The isolates were identified as Streptococcus agalactiae based on their morphology, biochemical characteristics and 16S rDNA sequencing analysis. S. agalactiae was isolated from diseased bullfrogs from all farms, and strain WH914 was selected for experimental infection of bullfrogs. Similar lesions were observed in the experimental bullfrogs, and 17.0%, 33.3% and 100.0% mortality occurred 14 days after administering 8.3 × 10⁴ CFU/ml, 8.3 × 10⁶ CFU/ml and 8.3 × 10⁸ CFU/ml of the bacteria, respectively. Molecular serotyping of the capsular polysaccharide gene clusters revealed that the S. agalactiae isolates were serotype Ib. The sequence type (ST) of 30 isolates randomly selected from each bullfrog farm was determined by multilocus sequence typing as ST261. Virulence gene profiles for 14 virulence-related genes were constructed via multiplex PCR. All strains contained pavA, sip, iagA, cfb, hylB, bibA, cspA and fbsA but lacked cylE, bac, imb, scpB, rib and bca. S. agalactiae serotype Ib ST261 was isolated from sick or deceased farmed bullfrogs and is recognized as a pathogen of bullfrogs. Natural infections of S. agalactiae serotype Ib ST261 have not been previously reported in American bullfrogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLithobates catesbeianus 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3aabdomen 3aaquaculture 3aascites 3abullfrogs 3adisease outbreaks 3afarms 3ahemorrhage 3ahyperemia 3amortality 3amultilocus sequence typing 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apolysaccharides 3aserotypes 3avirulence 3aChina 0aAmerican bullfrog 0aStreptococcus agalactiae 0aVirulence gene 0aMolecular serotyping 0aSequence typing1 aZheng, Jiping1 aZhang, Haiwen1 aWang, Xin1 aGuo, Guiying1 aLin, Youquan1 aHan, Qian1 aLi, Roushan1 aYang, Nuo1 aFan, Lixia1 aZeng, Jifeng0 tAquaculture.g2022 Mar. 30, v. 551 p.737885-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7378853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03864naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245020800158300001800366520151000384592002801894596006901922596009801991596009802089596009802187596009802285596009202383596007002475596011102545650001502656650001602671650001602687650001402703650002602717650001302743650001102756650001702767650001502784650001302799650002402812700001602836700001602852700001702868700001602885700001802901700005702919700005602976700005803032773014603090856007703236852000903313655001203322IND60779511020221118053940.0220609e20220526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077951102DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.2c018572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Yu-Ting10aHomeostasis inside Single Activated Phagolysosomes: Quantitative and Selective Measurements of Submillisecond Dynamics of Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species Production with a Nanoelectrochemical Sensor  ap. 9723-9733.  aReactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) are generated by macrophages inside their phagolysosomes. This production is essential for phagocytosis of damaged cells and pathogens, i.e., protecting the organism and maintaining immune homeostasis. The ability to quantitatively and individually monitor the four primary ROS/RNS (ONOO–, H₂O₂, NO, and NO₂–) with submillisecond resolution is clearly warranted to elucidate the still unclear mechanisms of their rapid generation and to track their concentration variations over time inside phagolysosomes, in particular, to document the origin of ROS/RNS homeostasis during phagocytosis. A novel nanowire electrode has been specifically developed for this purpose. It consisted of wrapping a SiC nanowire with a mat of 3 nm platinum nanoparticles whose high electrocatalytic performances allow the characterization and individual measurements of each of the four primary ROS/RNS. This allowed, for the first time, a quantitative, selective, and statistically robust determination of the individual amounts of ROS/RNS present in single dormant phagolysosomes. Additionally, the submillisecond resolution of the nanosensor allowed confirmation and measurement of the rapid ability of phagolysosomes to differentially mobilize their enzyme pools of NADPH oxidases and inducible nitric oxide synthases to finely regulate their homeostasis. This reveals an essential key to immune responses and immunotherapies and rationalizes its biomolecular origin.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAc?cole Normale Sup?rieuredhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007649  a21721005cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a21725504cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22090050cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22090051cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aNAcCentre National de la Recherche Scientifiquedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004794  aUMRc, Sorbonne Universit?dhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100019125  aNAcState Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, University of Xiamendhttps://doi.org/NA 3aelectrodes 3ahomeostasis 3amacrophages 3ananowires 3anitric oxide synthase 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aphagocytosis 3aphagosomes 3aplatinum 3asensors (equipment)1 aJiang, Hong1 aWu, Wen-Tao1 aZhang, Fu-Li1 aTian, Si-Yu1 aFan, Wen-Ting1 aLiu, Yan-Ling1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7386-354X1 aAmatore, C.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2561-11371 aHuang, Wei-Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8951-075X0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2022 May 26, v. 144, no. 22 p.9723-9733dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c018573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03883naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002200158245016400180300001400344500001900358520214100377592002802518650001602546650000802562650001002570650001502580650001602595650001102611650001202622650002202634650001402656650001802670650001402688650002002702650001902722650001202741650001402753650001202767650002002779650001802799650001302817653002802830653001102858653002102869653002002890700002502910700001702935700002102952700005902973700001903032700002603051773009903077856009303176961001503269852000903284655001203293IND60716028920221120083418.0201223e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071602892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.10.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenham, Hayley M.10aProduction of embryos and a live offspring using post mortem reproductive material from bison (Bison bison bison) originating in Yellowstone National Park, USA  ap. 33-39.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBison from Yellowstone National Park (YNP) have an important genetic history. As one of the few wild herds of bison with no evidence of cattle DNA introgression and a large enough population to maintain genetic diversity, they are considered a conservation priority for the species. Unfortunately, there is a high prevalence of the zoonotic disease brucellosis in the herd. Part of the management strategy for controlling the disease and herd size in YNP is to remove bison from the population during the winter migration out of the park. This interagency management cull provides an opportunity to collect a large number of oocytes from a wild bison population for genetic banking and research purposes. During the winters of 2014–2018, which is the nonbreeding season for bison, oocytes were collected post mortem and used to determine the effects of donor reproductive maturity and pregnancy status on oocyte quality and in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes, and to demonstrate the feasibility of producing healthy offspring. Cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were placed into an in vitro embryo production (IVP) system, and on days 7, 7.5, and 8 of in vitro culture (Day 0 = day of in vitro fertilization) embryos were assessed for developmental stage and quality prior to vitrification. Embryos were then stored in liquid nitrogen until the breeding season when a subset were warmed, cultured for 6 h, evaluated for survival, and transferred to healthy bison recipients. There were no significant differences in the ability of recovered COCs to support blastocyst development based on female reproductive maturity or pregnancy status (juvenile 79/959 (8.2%) vs sexually mature 547/6544 (8.4%); non-pregnant 188/2302 (8.2%) vs pregnant 556/6122 (9.1%)). Following the transfer of 15 embryos to 10 recipients, one healthy female calf was born. This work demonstrates that live offspring can be generated from COCs collected from YNP bison post mortem in the non-breeding season, and that gamete recovery can be a valuable tool for conservation of valuable genetics for this species while mitigating diseases like brucellosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBison bison 3aDNA 3abison 3ablastocyst 3abrucellosis 3acalves 3afemales 3agenetic variation 3aherd size 3aintrogression 3ajuveniles 3aliquid nitrogen 3anational parks 3aoocytes 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3asexual maturity 3avitrification 3azoonoses 0aIn vitro fertilization 0aEmbryo 0aCryopreservation 0aEmbryo transfer1 aMcCollum, Matthew P.1 aNol, Pauline1 aFrey, Rebecca K.1 aClarke, P.

Recent studies reveal an emerging relationship between the function of phytohormones and epigenetic modifications. In particular, evidence suggests that auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signal transduction is modulated by microRNAs and epigenetic factors such as histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and DNA methylation. Furthermore, some phytohormones have been shown to affect epigenetic modifications. These findings are shedding light on the mode of action of phytohormones and are opening up a new avenue of research on phytohormones as well as on the mechanisms regulating epigenetic modifications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA methylation 3aauxins 3abiosynthesis 3achromatin 3aepigenetics 3ahistones 3amechanism of action 3amicroRNA 3aplant hormones 3asignal transduction 0aepigenetics 0aauxin 0aplant hormones 0agene expression 0achromatin regulation 0aDNA methylation1 aZhu, Jian-Kang1 aYang, Zhenbiao0 tMolecular plant.g2016 Jan. 04, v. 9, no. 1 p.57-70dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2015.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03752naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245010200197300001800299520161900317592002801936596006701964596008102031650003502112650001402147650001502161650002102176650001502197650001402212650001102226650001302237700005902250700006002309700002102369700005802390700005802448700006202506700005902568700006102627700002302688700005902711700006502770700005702835700006202892700006002954773014603014856007703160852000903237655001203246IND60779511320220609000000.0220609e20220524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077951132DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.2c020882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKu, Yu-Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4234-313510aOxygen Reduction Reaction in Alkaline Media Causes Iron Leaching from Fe–N–C Electrocatalysts  ap. 9753-9763.  aThe electrochemical activity of modern Fe–N–C electrocatalysts in alkaline media is on par with that of platinum. For successful application in fuel cells (FCs), however, also high durability and longevity must be demonstrated. Currently, a limited understanding of degradation pathways, especially under operando conditions, hinders the design and synthesis of simultaneously active and stable Fe–N–C electrocatalysts. In this work, using a gas diffusion electrode half-cell coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry setup, Fe dissolution is studied under conditions close to those in FCs, that is, with a porous catalyst layer (CL) and at current densities up to −125 mA·cm–². Varying the rate of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), we show a remarkable linear correlation between the Faradaic charge passed through the electrode and the amount of Fe dissolved from the electrode. This finding is rationalized assuming that oxygen reduction and Fe dissolution reactions are interlinked, likely through a common intermediate formed during the Fe redox transitions in Fe species involved in the ORR, such as FeNₓCy and Fe₃C@N–C. Moreover, such a linear correlation allows the application of a simple metric─S-number─to report the material’s stability. Hence, in the current work, a powerful tool for a more applied stability screening of different electrocatalysts is introduced, which allows on the one hand fast performance investigations under more realistic conditions, and on the other hand a more advanced mechanistic understanding of Fe–N–C degradation in CLs.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcHeinrich B?ll Stiftungdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009379  a721065cHorizon 2020 Framework Programmedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100010661 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acatalysts 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3alongevity 3aoxygen 3aplatinum1 aEhelebe, Konrad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9441-56421 aHutzler, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5484-707X1 aBierling, Markus1 aBöhm, Thomas,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2036-21591 aZitolo, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2187-66991 aVorokhta, Mykhailo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8382-70271 aBibent, Nicolas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8700-00081 aSpeck, Florian D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7649-92611 aSeeberger, Dominik1 aKhalakhan, Ivan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2929-41481 aMayrhofer, Karl J.

Aerial parts of sweet potato (SP) are rich in dietary fiber and phytochemicals. The SP powder (cv. Simon No.1) was used to substitute 5%, 10%, and 15% (w/w) of flour to produce breads. Crude protein, fat, ash and dietary fiber of SP powder were higher than those of flour. Total phenols, caffeoylquinic acid derivatives and antioxidant properties of SP were higher than those of flour. Crude protein, fat, ash, h, ΔE values, hardness, gumminess, chewiness, total phenols, and antioxidant properties of baked breads increased with increased SP powder level, while volume, specific volume, water activity, crust L*, a* values, crumb L*, WI values, cohesiveness, springiness, and resilience showed a reverse trend. The hedonic sensory results of control and 5–10% substituted breads were comparable. Overall, SP bread could be developed as a novel food with more functional components and effective antioxidant activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerial parts 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abreads 3achewiness 3achlorogenic acid 3acohesion 3acrude protein 3adietary fiber 3aflour 3ahardness 3anovel foods 3aphenols 3aphytochemicals 3asensory properties 3asweet potatoes 3awater activity 0aSweet potato 0aBread 0aCaffeoylquinic acid derivatives 0aAntioxidant property 0aSensory evaluation1 aLee, Ching-Ching1 aYang, Jason,1 aChen, Ru-Wei1 aZhang, Qi-Fang1 aLin, Sheng-Dun0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Jan., v. 117dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1086023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03830naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245005400173300001600227520206400243592002802307650002002335650002202355650002502377650001002402650001102412650000902423650002102432650001402453650001102467650002102478650001502499650001102514650001502525650001102540650001902551650001502570650002102585650002302606650001202629650002802641650001902669650001202688650002702700651001002727651001802737651001002755651001002765651001202775651001202787651001202799651001702811651001302828651001102841653001102852653000902863653001302872653001202885653001602897700001902913773011802932856008503050852000903135655001203144IND60517717020221118044157.0160405e20160702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051771702DNAL7 a10.1080/15428052.2015.11027852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdeyeye, S. A. O.13aAn Overview of Traditional Fish Smoking In Africa  ap. 198-215.  aThis study was carried out to have a critical overview of traditional fish smoking in Africa. Fish is highly susceptible to deterioration without any preservative or processing measure, and due to its chemical composition, fish is a perishable food material, and its flavor and texture change rapidly during storage after death. Fish harvesting, handling, processing, and distribution provide livelihood for millions of people, as well as providing foreign exchange to many African countries. In many rural fishing communities, the infrastructures for post-harvest processing and preservation of fish are inadequate. As a result, losses reach up to 40% of the total catch by weight. The fishing industry, despite its importance, suffers from enormous post-harvest losses which are estimated at 35–40% of landed weight, and it is estimated that post-harvest losses remain about 25% of the total world catch annually. These losses have a profound adverse impact on fishing communities whose status and income often depend on post-harvest activities. Such losses also have a detrimental impact on the socio-economic life of the fishing communities and reduce the amount of animal protein available to a large segment of the population. In Africa, some 5% of the population, about 35 million people, depend wholly or partly on the fisheries sector, mostly artisanal fisheries, for their livelihood. Various traditional methods are employed to preserve and process fish for consumption and storage. These include smoking, drying, salting, frying, and fermenting and various combinations of these. In most countries in Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, Togo, Benin, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, etc., smoking is the most widely practiced method: Practically all species of fish caught can be smoked, and it has been estimated that 70–80% of the domestic marine and freshwater catch is consumed in smoked form. However, different smoking methods are used in processing and preservation of fish by artisanal fishermen in Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal proteins 3aartisanal fishing 3achemical composition 3adeath 3adrying 3afish 3afish consumption 3afishermen 3aflavor 3aforeign exchange 3afreshwater 3afrying 3aharvesting 3aincome 3ainfrastructure 3alivelihood 3aperishable foods 3apostharvest losses 3asalting 3asmoking (food products) 3asocioeconomics 3atexture 3atraditional technology 3aBenin 3aCote d'Ivoire 3aGhana 3aKenya 3aLiberia 3aNigeria 3aSenegal 3aSierra Leone 3aTanzania 3aUganda 0aAfrica 0afish 0aoverview 0asmoking 0atraditional1 aOyewole, O.

The particle size of microcapsules and the vitality of probiotics were investigated. Moreover, the antifungal effects of the bioactive films and their effect on chemical characteristics of white brined cheese were studied during 45 days of storage. SA stabilized microcapsules had lower particle size and also exhibited higher viability of probiotics in comparison to pectin microencapsulated bacteria. The results showed that the L. acidophilus encapsulated in SA had the highest effect on the inhibitory growth of Aspergillus niger in cheese after 45 days of storage. Chemical properties of cheese including moisture, salt and pH were not affected by the type of bacterium and type of microcapsule. According to the results, the BCF containing microcapsules of L. acidophilus in SA was selected as the best bioactive film. SEM images showed the dispersed and embedded microcapsules in the porous network of cellulose. The XRD results approved the change in the crystalline structure of BCF after incorporation of microcapsules. This study confirmed the potential of bioactive BCF for inhibition of fungal growth in white brined cheese.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aBifidobacterium animalis 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantifungal properties 3abacteria 3acellulose 3acheeses 3acrystal structure 3afilms (materials) 3afungal growth 3amicroencapsulation 3apH 3aparticle size 3apectins 3aprobiotics 3aresponse surface methodology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium alginate 3astorage time 3aviability 0aBacterial cellulose 0aFungal inhibition 0aWhite brined cheese 0aCalcium chloride dihydrate 0aPubChem CID 0a21584554 0aSodium citrate 0aPubChem CID 0a6224 0al-cysteine hydrochloride 0aPubChem CID 0a60960 0aSodium hydroxide 0aPubChem CID 0a14798 0aSodium chloride 0aPubChem CID 0a5234 0aPhenolphthalein 0aPubChem CID 0a4764 0aHydrochloric acid 0aPubChem CID 0a313 0aNitric acid 0aPubChem CID 0a944 0aSulphuric acid 0aPubChem CID 0a1118 0aSilver nitrate 0aPubChem CID 0a24470 0aAmmonium ferric sulfate 0aPubChem CID 0a197097 0aPubChem CID 0a510288 0a2barium chloride 0aPubChem CID 0a25204 0aPotassium thiocyanate 0aPubChem CID 0a516872 0apectin 0aPubChem CID 0a4414761 aBari, Mahmoud Rezazadeh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9455-99771 aKhaledabad, Mohammad Alizadeh1 aAlmasi, Hadi1 aAmiri, Saber1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1176-45700 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2019 Sept. 07, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1086033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02104naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003800147245006400185300001800249520062200267592002800889650001500917650001600932650002000948650002600968650001600994650001401010650002601024650001501050650001901065653000901084653000801093653000601101653000701107653000601114653000601120653000901126653000701135653000701142653000701149653000901156653000901165653000901174653002101183653002701204653002801231653002901259653002501288700002501313773012201338856008101460852000901541655001201550IND60619086020221118015238.0181030e20181102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061908602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2018.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBergeron-Sandoval, Louis-Philippe10aMechanics, Structure and Function of Biopolymer Condensates  ap. 4754-4761.  aThe spontaneous nature of biopolymer phase separation in cells entails that the resulting condensates can be thermodynamic machines, which, in the process of condensing, can take on distinct forms themselves and deform neighboring cellular structures.

The synthesized conjugates were analyzed by UV-vis, FT-IR, XRD and SEM analysis. UV–vis spectra of conjugates showed the shifting of spectral peak at UV to visible region revealed the enhanced conjugation due to formation of linkage. The XRD peaks of conjugates found broader and indicating the amorphous phase of conjugating materials in compared to free components. The SEM images showed that the conjugated materials having numerous pores on its surface, which proved its porous nature. The amount of phenolic compounds conjugated with (dex-ald-pc) and (BSA-pc) were found to be 65.4 and 73.91mg/g of conjugates, respectively.

Zinc deficiency impairs growth, reproduction, metabolism and immunity in both human and animals. Thus, zinc supplementation is recommended in daily life. However, the effect of long-term chronic zinc supplementation on adipose homeostasis has not been well elucidated. In the current study, mice were supplemented with zinc sulfate in the drinking water for 20 weeks. The results suggested that chronic zinc supplementation impaired systemic glucose clearance after exogenous insulin or glucose challenges, as compared to the control mice. Further study revealed that chronic zinc supplementation made no difference to body weight, but increased visceral adipose tissue weight and adipocyte size. In addition, gene expression of leptin and IL6 in the visceral adipose tissue of zinc-supplemented mice were higher than those of control mice. Moreover, serum level of leptin of the zinc-supplemented mice was twice as high as that of the control mice. Besides, phosphorylation level of AKT T308 was attenuated in the perirenal adipose tissue of zinc-supplemented mice. In comparison, the expression of macrophage marker genes and lipogenic genes were not affected by chronic zinc supplementation, but the protein levels of FAS and SCD1 decreased or tended to decrease in the perirenal adipose tissue of zinc-supplemented mice, as compared to the control mice. Our findings suggest that chronic high dose zinc supplementation induces visceral adipose tissue hypertrophy and impairs AKT signaling in perirenal adipose tissue.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadipocytes 3aadipose tissue 3ablood serum 3adietary mineral supplements 3adrinking water 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ahypertrophy 3aimmunity 3ainsulin 3ainterleukin-6 3aleptin 3amacrophages 3ametabolism 3amice 3anutrient deficiencies 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein content 3areproduction 3atissue weight 3azinc 3azinc sulfate1 aJiang, Dandan1 aZhu, Yingguo1 aFang, Zhengfeng1 aChe, Lianqiang1 aLin, Yan1 aXu, Shengyu1 aLi, Jian1 aHuang, Chao1 aZou, Yuanfeng1 aLi, Lixia1 aWu, De1 aFeng, Bin0 tNutrients.g2017 Oct. 18, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu91011383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01649naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245006100177300001600238520049500254592002800749650001100777650001100788650002500799650001900824650001000843650001100853650001200864650001200876653001100888653001900899653001000918653001100928653001100939700002000950700003500970700002201005773011801027856008501145852000901230655001201239IND60517717120221118044233.0160405e20160702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051771712DNAL7 a10.1080/15428052.2015.11027862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBordi, Peter Lawrence10aAdult Acceptance of Chocolate Milk Sweetened with Stevia  ap. 216-221.  aThe purpose of this study was to compare acceptance of chocolate milk sweetened with sucrose; two formulations of sucrose and stevia; and stevia only; in adults 25–60 years old.

In this study, we assessed the potential use of leaf decomposition and associated decomposer communities to predict stream eutrophication. Because leaf quality is expected to affect leaf decomposition, we used five leaf species, differing in their initial nitrogen concentration. Leaves of alder, chestnut, plane, oak and eucalyptus were placed in coarse-mesh bags and immersed in six streams along an eutrophication gradient to assess leaf decomposition and the structure of associated decomposer communities. A hump-shaped relationship was established between leaf decomposition and the eutrophication gradient for all leaf species, except for eucalyptus. Invertebrate biomass and density as well as fungal biomass and sporulation were lowest at the extremes of the gradient. Leaf-associated invertebrate and fungal assemblages were mainly structured by stream eutrophication. The percentage of shredders on leaves decreased, whereas the percentage of oligochaeta increased along the eutrophication gradient. The Iberian Biological Monitoring Working Party Index (IBMWP) applied to benthic invertebrates increased from oligotrophic to moderately eutrophic streams and then dropped sharply at highly and hypertrophic streams. Overall, leaf decomposition was a valuable tool to assess changes in stream water quality, and it allowed the discrimination of sites classified by the IBMWP within class I and class IV. Moreover, decomposition of most leaf species responded in a similar way to eutrophication when decomposition was normalized by the quality of leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanea 3aEucalyptus 3aOligochaeta 3abags 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater ecosystems 3afungi 3ainvertebrates 3aleaves 3amicrobial biomass 3amonitoring 3anitrogen content 3asporulation 3astreams 3awater quality 0aLeaf decomposition 0aFungi 0aInvertebrates 0aLeaf quality 0aStream eutrophication1 aGeraldes, Paulo1 aLima-Fernandes, Eva1 aFernandes, Isabel1 aCássio, Fernanda,1 aPascoal, Cláudia0 tEcological indicators.g2016 Oct., v. 69 p.648-656dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.05.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03378naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011000169300001800279520168800297592002801985650002502013650001902038650002302057650002502080650001302105650001502118650000702133650002102140650001302161650001302174650002502187650001602212653004602228653004202274653004002316653004002356653003702396653001002433653001002443653000902453653000902462653000902471653000902480653000902489653001102498653000902509700003902518700002302557700002002580773012202600856008102722852000902803655001202812IND60619086120221118015249.0181030e20181102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061908612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2018.06.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuff, Kiersten M.10aAdvances in Understanding Stimulus-Responsive Phase Behavior of Intrinsically Disordered Protein Polymers  ap. 4619-4635.  aProteins and synthetic polymers can undergo phase transitions in response to changes to intensive solution parameters such as temperature, proton chemical potentials (pH), and hydrostatic pressure. For proteins and protein-based polymers, the information required for stimulus-responsive phase transitions is encoded in their amino acid sequence. Here, we review some of the key physical principles that govern the phase transitions of archetypal intrinsically disordered protein polymers (IDPPs). These are disordered proteins with repetitive amino acid sequences. Advances in recombinant technologies have enabled the design and synthesis of protein sequences of a variety of sequence complexities and lengths. We summarize insights that have been gleaned from the design and characterization of IDPPs that undergo thermo-responsive phase transitions and build on these insights to present a general framework for IDPPs with pH and pressure responsive phase behavior. In doing so, we connect the stimulus-responsive phase behavior of IDPPs with repetitive sequences to the coil-to-globule transitions that these sequences undergo at the single-chain level in response to changes in stimuli. The proposed framework and ongoing studies of stimulus-responsive phase behavior of designed IDPPs have direct implications in bioengineering, where designing sequences with bespoke material properties broadens the spectrum of applications, and in biology and medicine for understanding the sequence-specific driving forces for the formation of protein-based membraneless organelles as well as biological matrices that act as scaffolds for cells and mediators of cell-to-cell communication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3abioengineering 3acell communication 3ahydrostatic pressure 3amedicine 3aorganelles 3apH 3aphase transition 3apolymers 3aproteins 3arepetitive sequences 3atemperature 0aintrinsically disordered protein polymers 0astimulus-responsive phase transitions 0aupper critical solution temperature 0alower critical solution temperature 0acollapse transitions of polymers 0aIDPPs 0aSLiMs 0aIDRs 0aIDPs 0aELPs 0aUCST 0aLCST 0aPNIPAM 0aLCDs1 aRoberts, S.

PPO activity showed a dramatic loss at 4–25MPa and 37°C. At the lower pressure (4–15MPa), the experimental data of inactivation followed the first-order reaction kinetic model, the pressure sensitivity (ZP) of the kinetic parameters was 49.02MPa and the activation volume (△V≠) was −120.88cm³/mol. At the higher pressure (20 and 25MPa), the experimental data of inactivation followed the biexponential kinetic model. The kinetic rate constant kF and kS of fast and stable fractions were 2.45 and 0.08min⁻ ¹, respectively. The decimal reduction time DF and DS were 0.94 and 29.43min at 25MPa and 37°C, respectively. After DPCD treatment, the loss activity of PPO had no restoration storing for 6days at 4°C. The results of SDS-PAGE and activity staining also showed that DPCD treatment had the obvious inhibitory effect on PPO from Pacific white shrimp. The PPO activity in vivo was easier to be inactivated than that in crude PPO extracts under the same DPCD treatment conditions. INDUSTRIAL RELEVANCE: There is a growing interest in non-thermal pasteurization methods, which could retain food's freshlike physical, nutritional, and sensory qualities. Pacific white shrimp accounts for 90% of the global aquaculture shrimp production, they are becoming increasingly popular. However, enzymatic browning of shrimp has been of great concern to food scientists and food processors. Dense phase carbon dioxide (DPCD) may be an adequate tool to obtain high quality since PPO activity could not be inactivated totally by high pressure under 400MPa yet. The present work deals with the inactivation of PPO from Pacific white shrimp exposed to DPCD treatment in order to explore the feasibility of shrimp by DPCD process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3acarbon dioxide 3acatechol oxidase 3acold pasteurization 3aenzymatic browning 3aenzyme inactivation 3afood industry 3afood processing quality 3afoods 3afreshness 3amodels 3anutrient content 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3areaction kinetics 3ascientists 3asensory properties 3ashrimp 3ashrimp culture1 aLiu, Shucheng1 aJi, Hongwu1 aZhang, Chaohua1 aDeng, Chujin1 aCao, Wenhong1 aMao, Weijie1 aGao, Jialong0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2011 Oct., v. 12, no. 4 p.635-641dElsevier Ltdx1466-85647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2011.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245008700168300001400255520190900269592002802178650002102206650001202227650002502239650002102264650001902285650001502304650002402319650001802343650002002361650002702381653001202408653002602420653001202446653002502458700002502483700001702508700001502525700001902540773010602559856008402665852000902749655001202758IND60617891620221122083754.0210114e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061789162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2018.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Xinliang10aBiochar increased field soil inorganic carbon content five years after application  ap. 36-41.  aSoil inorganic carbon (SIC) plays an important role in terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycling, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. Biochar has becoming a great of interest as a mean for carbon sequestration, resulting from its high content of carbon and long-term persistence in soil. Moreover, there is abundance of information about the effect of biochar on the turnover of soil organic carbon; however, up to date, no study has been done on the impact of biochar on soil inorganic carbon pool despite biochar contains inorganic carbon. This study was conducted in a long-term field condition to investigate the effect of different biochar application rates (0, 30, 60 and 90 t ha⁻¹) on soil inorganic carbon content and composition in the soil profile (0–100 cm). Using stable δ¹³C isotope signatures, the SIC was distinguished into lithogenic and pedogenic inorganic carbon. The results showed that long-term biochar application, at 30, 60 and 90 t ha⁻¹, increased soil total inorganic carbon by 18.8, 42.4 and 62.3% and native soil inorganic carbon by 7.8, 20.2 and 28.3%, respectively, in the 0–20 cm soil layer. Biochar application at these rates also increased total inorganic carbon in the 20–40 cm soil layer by 13.4, 22.8 and 30.5%, respectively, but did not influence the total inorganic carbon content below the 40 cm soil depth. Moreover, as biochar application rate increased, δ¹³C of native soil inorganic carbon decreased, which indicated that pedogenic inorganic carbon was formed. Biochar application rates were positively related to the pedogenic inorganic carbon contents, however, it did not influence the lithogenic inorganic carbon contents. This is the first study about the effect of biochar application on native inorganic carbon content and its composition, which strengthens the understanding about the role of biochar in soil C sequestration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplication rate 3abiochar 3acarbon sequestration 3ainorganic carbon 3asemiarid zones 3asoil depth 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil profiles 3astable isotopes 3aterrestrial ecosystems 0aBiochar 0aSoil inorganic carbon 0aIsotope 0aCarbon sequestration1 aSingh, Bhupinder Pal1 aGuitong, Li,1 aLin, Qimei1 aZhao, Xiaorong0 tSoil & tillage research.g2019 Mar., v. 186 p.36-41dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2018.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245010900202520105100311592002801362650003401390650003101424650002501455650001701480650002101497650001501518650002001533650001701553650002101570650001601591650001301607650001501620650001401635650001301649653001201662653001501674700001601689700001701705700001901722700001401741700001401755700005301769700001301822773011201835856008101947852000902028655001202037IND60666034920221120040909.0190913e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066603492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1086052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Xianli1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8274-113310aEffects of sonication during moromi fermentation on antioxidant activities of compounds in raw soy sauce  aTo elucidate the effects of sonication on the antioxidant activities of compounds in soy sauce, sonication at 68 kHz (60 W/L/10 min/8 circles) was employed during moromi fermentation. Sonication enhanced four antioxidant indices of soy sauce from 5.29% to 24.29%, which were attributed to the significantly higher levels of free amino acids (FAAs, 12.45%), total phenolics (26.71%) and 1–3 kDa peptides (12.28%) in sonicated moromi. Amongst them, FAAs contributed 65.88% and 53.45% to the enhanced metal ion chelating activity and DPPH radical scavenging activity (p < 0.05), respectively. However, Maillard reaction products and isoflavones contributed little to the enhanced antioxidant activities, because sonication slightly affected Maillard reaction products, isoflavones and β-glucosidase activities during moromi fermentation. It was concluded that cell wall of soybean was destroyed by sonication, facilitating the release of antioxidant compounds, which significantly enhanced the antioxidant activities in raw soy sauce.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aMaillard reaction products 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abeta-glucosidase 3acell walls 3aenzyme activity 3afermentation 3afree amino acids 3aisoflavones 3apeptides 3asonication 3asoy sauce 3asoybeans 0aSoybean 0aAmino acid1 aLiu, Ermeng1 aZhang, Junke1 aYang, Mingquan1 aChen, Sui1 aLiu, Zhan1 aMa, Haile1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7783-499X1 aHu, Feng0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2019 Dec., v. 116dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1086053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005300149245017900202500001900381520166900400592002802069650002302097650001102120650001102131650001902142650001502161650001802176650001902194650002102213650002002234650001802254650001502272651001002287651001802297653002402315653001302339653001502352653002002367653002902387700006502416700001202481700002002493700001802513700002002531700001302551700001402564773012402578856008402702852000902786655001202795IND60735579420221120143241.0210610e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073557942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indic.2021.1001182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Xue1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7412-509010aSurface water quality in the upstream-most megacity of the Yangtze River Basin (Chengdu): 2000–2019 trends, the COVID-19 lockdown effects, and water governance implications  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWater is essential for a sustainable economic prosperity, but rapid economic growth and intensive agricultural activities usually cause water pollution. The middle and lower reaches of China’s Yangtze River Basin were urbanized and industrialized much earlier than the upper reach and have been suffering from water pollution. In the past two decades, economic growth accelerated in the upper reach due to several national economic initiatives. Based on analyzing water quality changes from 2000 to 2019 and during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 for Chengdu in the upper reach, we hope to provide some water governance suggestions. In 2019, water at 66% of 93 sites in Chengdu did not achieve the national III standards using measurements of 23 water quality parameters. The top two pollutants were total nitrogen (TN) and fecal coliform (FC). From 2000 to 2019, water quality was not significantly improved at the non-background sites of Chengdu's Min Basin, and the pollution in this basin was mainly from local pollutants release. During the same period, water quality deteriorated in Chengdu’s Tuo Basin, where pollution was the result of pollutant discharges in Chengdu in addition to inter-city pollutant transport. During the COVID-19 lockdown, water quality generally improved in the Min Basin but not in the Tuo Basin. A further investigation on which pollution sources were shut down or not during the lockdown can help make pollution reduction targets. Based on the results, we provide suggestions to strengthen inter-jurisdictional and inter-institutional cooperation, water quality monitoring and evaluation, and ecological engineering application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3abasins 3acities 3afecal bacteria 3apollutants 3asurface water 3atotal nitrogen 3awater management 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aWater quality index 0aNitrogen 0aPhosphorus 0aFecal coliforms 0aWater quality management1 aSchmidt, Amanda Henck1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2658-53481 aXu, Yue1 aZhang, Hongming1 aChen, Xiaolan1 aXiang, Rongting1 aTang, Ya1 aWang, Wei0 tEnvironmental and sustainability indicators.g2021 June, v. 10 p.100118-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:27272x2665-97277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indic.2021.1001183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011200173300001600285520178300301592002802084650001802112650002602130650002202156650002402178650001802202650001202220650001502232650002602247650001402273650000902287650001502296650001702311650001102328650001302339650001102352650001302363650001602376651001402392653001802406653000902424653001202433653001202445653003002457700002302487700002502510700002202535700001902557700002202576700001502598700002702613773011402640856008602754852000902840655001202849IND60524891020221118085545.0190412e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052489102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIzzo, Christopher10aMulti-species response to rapid environmental change in a large estuary system: A biochronological approach  ap. 739-748.  aThe sensitivity of species to environmental change is dependent on their ecological requirements (i.e. specialist v. generalist), and hence likely to be species-specific. Identifying species level variation in environmental sensitivity informs assessments of community vulnerability and assists in developing adaptive management strategies. We investigated species-specific sensitivity in fish to understand the vulnerability of differing life histories and ecological requirements to rapid environmental alteration (i.e. drought). Biochronologies of fish growth, based on increment widths in otoliths, were analysed using a mixed modelling approach. We assessed multi-decadal responses in fish growth to environmental variation in the terminal system of Australia’s largest river, for three long-lived fish species with differing life histories and ecological requirements: a freshwater specialist and two estuarine generalists. Biochronologies were between 20 and 38 years long, spanned a decade of severe drought and showed considerable inter-annual variation in growth. Precipitation influenced the growth of the obligate freshwater specialist, Macquaria ambigua ambigua. Temperature and salinity influenced the growth of the two estuarine generalists: Argyrosomus japonicus (estuarine opportunist) and Acanthopagrus butcheri (estuarine dependent), respectively. These results suggest that generalisations about how species respond to environmental change may mask species-specific responses to dependent on the constraints of their ecological requirements (i.e. specialist v. generalist). These findings also highlight the importance of considering the diversity of life history strategies that inhabit an ecosystem when developing conservation and management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthopagrus 3aArgyrosomus japonicus 3aMacquaria ambigua 3aadaptive management 3aanimal growth 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aestuaries 3afish 3afreshwater 3alife history 3amodels 3aotoliths 3arivers 3asalinity 3atemperature 3aAustralia 0aBiochronology 0aFish 0aDrought 0aEstuary 0aEnvironmental sensitivity1 aDoubleday, Zoë A.1 aGrammer, Gretchen L.1 aBarnes, Thomas C.1 aDelean, Steven1 aFerguson, Greg J.1 aYe, Qifeng1 aGillanders, Bronwyn M.0 tEcological indicators.g2016 Oct., v. 69 p.739-748dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245008500214300001600299520116000315592002801475650001701503650001901520650003101539650001401570650001801584650001701602650001301619650001501632650001501647653001601662653002601678653001601704653001801720653002201738700002301760700002001783700002301803700002101826773009001847856008501937852000902022655001202031IND60591856020221117201357.0180830e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059185602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.04.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrlandini, Valentina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0293-512010aDynamic performance of a novel offshore power system integrated with a wind farm  ap. 236-247.  aOffshore wind technology is rapidly developing and a wind farm can be integrated with offshore power stations. This paper considers as case study a futuristic platform powered by a wind farm and three combined cycle units consisting of a gas turbine and an ORC (organic Rankine cycle) module. The first aim of this paper is to identify the maximum amount of wind power that can be integrated into the system, without compromising the electric grid balance. The stability of the grid is tested using a dynamic model of the power system based on first principles. Additionally, the dynamics of the system is compared with a simplified plant consisting of three gas turbines and a wind farm, in order to identify benefits of the installation of the ORC system. The maximum allowable wind power is 10 MW for a nominal platform load of 30 MW. The results show that the presence of the ORC system allows decreasing frequency oscillations and fuel consumptions of the platform, with respect to the simplified configuration. On the other hand, the dynamic response of the combined cycle units is slower due to the thermal inertia of the heat transfer equipment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adynamic models 3aenergy use and consumption 3aequipment 3aheat transfer 3apower plants 3aturbines 3awind farms 3awind power 0aOil and gas 0aOrganic Rankine cycle 0aGas turbine 0aOffshore wind 0aIntegrated system1 aPierobon, Leonardo1 aSchløer, Signe1 aDe Pascale, Andrea1 aHaglind, Fredrik0 tEnergy.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 109 p.236-247dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.04.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03404naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011300169520203800282592002802320650001302348650001502361650001702376650001202393650001902405650000902424650001202433650001602445650001102461650001302472650001402485650002402499650001702523650001202540650002802552650001502580651001102595653003402606653001602640653002002656700002202676700004102698773010302739856008302842852000902925655001202934IND60746637520221122170945.0210904e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074663752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2021.1032302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmadu, Festus O.10aSoil health and grain yield impacts of climate resilient agriculture projects: Evidence from southern Malawi  aClimate resilient agriculture (CRA) projects like watershed restoration efforts can enhance agricultural systems' resilience to climate change and extreme weather shocks by improving soil health and grain yields in vulnerable communities. One such project, Wellness and Agriculture for Life Advancement (WALA) implemented watershed restoration across eight districts in southern Malawi from 2009 to 2014 to improve degraded soils and boost grain yields. Yet, rigorous analyses of soil health and grain yield impacts of CRA projects remain limited in southern Malawi, other dryland areas of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and elsewhere.Using the watershed restoration context of the WALA project as a case study, we estimated the core determinants of CRA program participation and the impacts of participation on soil health and grain yields among smallholder farmers in southern Malawi in 2016.We applied an endogenous switching regression with a control function approach to primary survey data from a sample of 808 agricultural households from five WALA districts to estimate the determinants of participation in the CRA project, and the impacts on soil health parameters and grain yields, accounting for endogeneity and selectivity bias.We found that participation in the project improved grain yields in terms of maize (Zea mays) by 61% in 2016 – a drought year, and soil health parameters including nitrogen, potassium, soil organic matter, and soil organic carbon by 41%, 31%, 57%, and 44% respectively. Results suggest that CRA projects are essential devices for improving soil health and grain yields in dryland areas such as southern Malawi, elsewhere in SSA, and beyond.This research shows that CRA projects can enhance sustainable agriculture by improving soil health parameters, increasing grain yields, and building agricultural systems' resilience to climate change and extreme weather shocks, thereby contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals on hunger and climate action in dryland areas of developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aarid lands 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acorn 3adrought 3agrain yield 3ahunger 3anitrogen 3apotassium 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil quality 3asurveys 3asustainable agriculture 3awatersheds 3aMalawi 0aClimate resilient agriculture 0aSoil health 0aSouthern Malawi1 aMcNamara, Paul E.1 aDavis, Kristinq(Kristin Elizabeth),0 tAgricultural systems.g2021 Oct., v. 193 p.103230-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2021.1032303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001700159245010600176300001600282500000900298520134400307592002801651650001501679650001701694650004301711650001401754650002501768650002401793650001101817650001801828650001501846650000901861650003001870700002101900773020701921856009402128852000902222655001202231IND60666367020221122055451.0191028e198501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066636702DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1985.00472425001400010022x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStott, D.

This method involves extraction of the phospholipids from soils or sewage sludges with a chloroform-methanol mixture and analysis of an aliquot of the extract (10 µL) with a high-performance liquid chromatograph coupled with a normal-phase silica-gel analytical column. The eluent used was a mixture of acetonitrile-methanol-phosphoric acid (vol/vol/vol, 260:12:3). Absorbance at 205 nm was used as a means of detection. The following phospholipids were identified in soil and sewage sludge samples: phosphatidyl choline (PC), phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE), phosphatidyl inositol (PI), and phosphatidyl serine (PS). The identities of the peaks were verified by standard additions technique and by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. The concentration of lipid P in soils and sewage sludges ranged from 0.50 to 2.38 and from 38.2 to 330 mg kg⁻¹, respectively. The amounts of PE and PC present in six soils ranged from 5.4 to 16 µg P kg⁻¹ (avg = 10.1) and from 3.6 to 48 (avg = 20.9), respectively.

One alternative source to supplement natural waters is oilfield produced water (OPW) generated from oilfields adjacent to agricultural areas. For over 25 years, OPW has been blended with surface water and used for irrigation in the Cawelo Water District of Kern County, as permitted by California Water Board policy. This study aims to evaluate the potential environmental impact, soil quality, and crop health risks of this policy. We examined a large spectrum of salts, metals, radionuclides (²²⁶Ra and ²²⁸Ra), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in OPW, blended OPW used for irrigation, groundwater, and soils irrigated by the three different water sources. We found that all studied water quality parameters in the blended OPW were below current California irrigation quality guidelines. Yet, soils irrigated by blended OPW showed higher salts and boron relative to soils irrigated by groundwater, implying long-term salts and boron accumulation. We did not, however, find systematic differences in ²²⁶Ra and ²²⁸Ra activities and DOC in soils irrigated by blended or unblended OPW relative to groundwater-irrigated soils. Based on a comparison of measured parameters, we conclude that the blended low-saline OPW used in the Cawelo Water District of California is of comparable quality to the local groundwater in the region. Nonetheless, the salt and boron soil accumulation can pose long-term risks to soil sodification, groundwater salinization, and plant health; as such, the use of low-saline OPW for irrigation use in California will require continual blending with fresh water and planting of boron-tolerant crops to avoid boron toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural industry 3aboron 3adrought 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental impact 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3aissues and policy 3aoil fields 3aplant health 3asoil 3asoil quality 3asurface water 3atoxicity 3awater quality 3awater salinization 3aCalifornia 0aOilfield produced water 0aReuse 0aSustainability1 aRedmon, Jennifer Hoponick1 aLambertini, Elisabetta1 aFeinstein, Laura1 aWeinthal, Erika1 aCabrales, Luis1 aVengosh, Avner1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8928-01570 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 733 p.139392-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1393923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01820naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245017700162300001400339520082200353592002801175650002201203650001201225650001101237650001801248700001301266700001401279773015001293856007801443852000901521655001201530IND60521448220221117092409.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052144822DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1975-1-2052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMergehenn, R.14aDie Kristall- und Molekülstruktur von β -Bromo(2-diäthylaminoäthanolato)kupfer(ll) / The Crystal and Molecular Structure of β-Bromo(2-diethylaminoethanolato)copper(II)  ap. 14-18.  aThe crystal and molecular structure of β-bromo(diethylaminoethanolato)copper(II) has been determined from three dimensional X-ray diffractometer data. The compound crystallizes in the triclinic space group Pï with one dimer in a unit cell of dimensions α=10.180(II), b=7.999(9), c=6.227(7) Å and a=110.69(4), β=103.12(4), γ=73.82(4)[°]. The structure was refined by least-squares methods using 1944 independent reflexions to give a final R-index of 0,05. The molecule consists of dimeric Cu₂O₂-units with Cu—O distances of 1.900(4) Å and 1.914(4) A, respectively. The dimers are additional bridged by bromines, so that a “polymeric” structure results; Cu—Br distances are 2.357(2) and 3.660(2) A, respectively.

These sperm had contact to epididymal secretion products but not to seminal fluid components. Notably, products of accessory sex glands have been shown in domestic animals to condition sperm for fertilization, in particular by mediating sperm–oviduct interaction. We report for the first time that motile epididymal sperm from domestic cats are able to bind to fresh oviduct epithelial cell explants from preovulatory females (median [min, max] of 10 [8, 16] and 10 [8, 17] sperm per 0.01 mm2 explant surface from both isthmic and ampullar regions, respectively). More sperm attach to the explants when epididymal sperm were preincubated for 30 minutes with seminal fluid separated from electroejaculates of mature tomcats (median [min, max] of 17 [13, 25] and 16 [12, 21] sperm per 0.01 mm2 explant surface from isthmus and ampulla, respectively). The proportion of bound sperm increased from a median of 54% to 62% by seminal fluid treatment. Sperm–oviduct binding could be facilitated by the decelerated sperm motion which was observed in seminal fluid–treated samples or supported by seminal fluid proteins newly attached to the sperm surface. Seminal fluid had no effect on the proportion of sperm with active mitochondria. Extent and pattern of sperm interaction in vitro were independent of explant origin from isthmus or ampulla. Sperm were attached to both cilia and microvilli of the main epithelial cell types present in all explants. In contrast to published sperm-binding studies with porcine and bovine oviduct explants where predominantly the anterior head region of sperm was attached to ciliated cells, the tails of some cat sperm were firmly stuck to the oviduct cell surfaces, whereas the heads were wobbling. Whether this response is a preliminary step toward phagocytosis or a precondition to capacitation and fertilization remains to be determined. In conclusion, treatment of epididymal sperm with seminal fluid or particular protein components should be considered in future investigations for its potential to improve the outcome of artificial insemination in felids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFelidae 3aaccessory sex glands 3aartificial insemination 3acats 3acattle 3acilia 3aepididymis 3aepithelial cells 3aexplants 3afemales 3amales 3amicrovilli 3amitochondria 3aoviducts 3aphagocytosis 3aproteins 3asecretion 3aspermatozoa 3aswine 3athreatened species 0aCat sperm 0aOviduct 0aSeminal fluid 0aSperm binding1 aEder, S.1 aReynaud, K.1 aSchön, J.1 aWibbelt, G.1 aFontbonne, A.1 aMüller, K.0 tTheriogenology.g2015 May, v. 83, no. 8 p.1373-1380dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.01.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03582naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245009300170500001900263520198500282592002802267650001202295650001602307650002002323650001502343650002602358650001502384650001302399650001502412650001402427650001502441650001602456650001702472650001702489650001602506653001902522653002302541653001602564653002002580653002202600653002102622700002102643700002002664700002002684700001802704700005902722700002502781700001702806773012002823856008802943852000903031655001203040IND60695348920221122192013.0201216e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069534892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1393932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Xiaona10aCombined biochar and nitrogen application stimulates enzyme activity and root plasticity  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBiochar (BC) and nitrogen (N) fertilizers are frequently applied to improve soil properties and increase crop productivity. Nonetheless, our mechanistic understanding of plant-soil interactions under single or combined application of BC and N remains incomplete. For the first time, we applied a split-root system to evaluate how BC or N contributes to the changes in soil enzyme activities, N and phosphorus (P) cycling as well as root plasticity. Left and right parts of rhizoboxes were filled with silty-clay loamy soil amended with BC (15 g kg⁻¹ soil, from wheat straw, 300 °C), N (0.05 g KNO₃-N kg⁻¹ soil) or a control (no amendments), resulting in the following combinations: BC/Control, N/Control, BC/N. Soil enzyme activities, available N and P, root morphology and plant biomass were analyzed after plant harvest.Plant biomass (shoot + root) ranged from 0.56 g pot⁻¹ (BC/Control) to 0.91 g pot⁻¹(BC/N). The decreased soil bulk density and increased P availability in the BC compartment (BC/Control and BC/N) stimulated root length by 1.4–1.8 times – an effect that was independent of N availability in the same rhizobox. Biochar stimulated activities of β-glucosidase and leucine aminopeptidase (by 33–39%) compared to N due to the coupling of C, N and P cycles in BC/N treated soil. Nitrogen fertilization also increased β-glucosidase activity compared to the unfertilized control, whereas root elongation remained unaffected. Thus, the combined application of BC/N had more efficient benefits for plant growth than BC or N alone. This is linked with i) the stimulation of enzyme activities at the BC locations to reduce N limitation for both microorganisms and plants, and ii) an increase of fine root production to improve N uptake efficiency. Thus, combined BC/N application is potentially especially sustainable to overcome nutrient limitation as well as to maintain crop productivity because it accelerates root-microbial interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3aenvironment 3aenzyme activity 3afine roots 3aleucyl aminopeptidase 3aloam soils 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aphytomass 3aplasticity 3aroot growth 3asoil density 3asoil enzymes 3awheat straw 0aMicroorganisms 0aMineral fertilizer 0aPyrogenic C 0aRoot morphology 0aSplit-root system 0aNutrient cycling1 aRazavi, Bahar S.1 aLudwig, Bernard1 aZamanian, Kazem1 aZang, Huadong1 aKuzyakov, Yakov1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9863-84611 aDippold, Michaela A.1 aGunina, Anna0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 735 p.139393-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1393933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03639naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245012900163520224900292592002802541650001902569650001602588650002002604650000902624650001302633650002102646650001402667650001802681650001302699650001102712650001002723650001102733650002502744650002202769650001202791650001102803650002302814650001702837651001002854700001702864700001602881700001402897700001802911773013402929856008503063852000903148655001203157IND60672845720221119090453.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067284572DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz050.P16-010-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMo, Zhe10aPhysical Activity and Sedentary Behaviors on Risk of Overweight and Obesity in Chinese Children and Adolescents (P16-010-19)  aThe prevalence of overweight among Chinese children and adolescent increased steadily in the past two decades. Few studies exist even on long-term trends in physical activity in children or adolescents and very few long-term longitudinal studies have examined the association between physical activity or sedentary activity and the risk of overweight and obesity globally. We used longitudinal data of the China Health and Nutrition Survey from 2004 to 2015 to examine the relationship among 4520 children and adolescents aged 6–18 years old. We collected detailed seven-day data on physical activity and sedentary activity, including sports and exercise, commute mode, household chores, screen time, homework, and other activities and converted them into metabolic equivalents (MET) values. We used the hybrid approach on the random-effects models to estimate the association between physical activity, sedentary activity and the risk of overweight and obesity. The child and adolescent prevalence of overweight and obesity increased from 5.8% in 2004 to 16.5% in 2015, while physical activity decreased from 60.9 to 49.1 METs hour/week and sedentary activity increased from 26.9 to 22.9 hours/week during the same period. Controlled for age, gender, urbanization index, income, energy intake, mother's BMI and education, and survey year, the results showed that physical activity significantly decreased the risk of overweight and obesity among girls [for 6–11 years old girls, OR = 0.37(95% CI 0.20 – 0.67); for 12–18 years old girls, OR = 0.46 (95% CI: 0.25 – 0.85)]. Sedentary activity significantly increased the risk of overweight and obesity among older girls only [OR = 1.96 (95% CI: 1.09 – 3.54)]. The association was not significant among boys. Low physical activity and high sedentary activity increased the risk of overweight and obesity among Chinese girls, particularly teenage girls. More studies are needed among boys.

The recovered gas is used to feed refinery processes, granting advantages in terms of fuel economy and flare stress. This paper presents the results obtained by a feasibility study of a flare gas recovery system in a real refinery; the work focused on: i) the choice and the design of the flare gas recovery system; ii) the gas treatment and reuse; iii) the economic feasibility, and the payback period. An experimental campaign has been performed to evaluate both the composition and the flow rate of the flare gas. Results showed that the flare gas had a strongly variable flow rate and composition due to the different gas species processed in refinery. A methodology for the system selection is presented: a 400 kg/h liquid ring compression device is chosen; its basic design is described as well as the chemical treatments of inert gases and hydrogen sulphide (H2S). The yearly energy recovery was estimated to be 2900 TOE, corresponding to 6600 tons of CDE (Carbon Dioxide Equivalent). Finally, an economic evaluation was carried out, showing a payback period of about 2.5 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical treatment 3aeconomic evaluation 3aeconomic feasibility 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy recovery 3afeasibility studies 3afuels 3agases 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahydrogen sulfide 3aliquids 3aoils 0aRefinery 0aFlare gas recovery system 0aLiquid ring compressor 0aEmission trading system1 aRenzi, Massimiliano1 aRossi, Mosè1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2926-75800 tEnergy.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 109 p.1-12dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.04.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01760naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009700164300001400261520078500275592002801060650002001088650001101108650001101119650001101130650001501141650001201156700002001168700001901188700001701207773012001224856008101344852000901425655001201434IND60625669920221119114944.0181211e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062566992DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078180602462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGusev, E.

Input data including meteorological forcings and land surface parameters were prepared on the basis of the WATCH and ECOCLIMAP global data sets, respectively. Long-term variations of the water balance components of the Lena, Ganges, and Darling river basins were simulated by the SWAP model. The results of simulations were compared with observations. In addition, the natural variability of river runoff caused by the weather noise of atmospheric characteristics was estimated.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3amodels 3arivers 3arunoff 3awatersheds 3aweather1 aNasonova, O.

Disclosed here is a design and synthesis of a series of novel quinoxaline derivatives containing dithioacetal moieties as well as their antiviral activities against potato virus Y (PVY). The compound D30 was developed on the basis of the three-dimensional quantitative structure–activity relationship. The anti-PVY activity test showed that the half maximal effective concentration of the anti-PVY protective activity of compound D30 is 197 μg/mL, which was better than the control agents ningnanmycin (423 μg/mL) and xiangcaoliusuobingmi (281 μg/mL). Significantly, compound D30 can increase defense enzyme activity and chlorophyll content, promote photosynthesis by accelerating carbon fixation in tobacco, and further improve plant disease resistance. All of these results suggest that compound D30 could be employed as a lead compound for novel PVY inhibitor discovery.  aPublisher supplied data  a21867002cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aPotato virus Y 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3achlorophyll 3aenzyme activity 3afood chemistry 3amedian effective concentration 3amoieties 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant disease resistance 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3atobacco 3aviruses 0aquinoxaline derivative 0adithioacetal moiety 0aantiviral activity 0a3D-QSAR 0acarbon fixation1 aWei, Chunle1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3288-03321 aWu, Sikai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2118-78661 aZhang, Wenbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5721-42271 aSong, Runjiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2502-778X1 aHu, Deyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7843-371X0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2022 June 01, v. 70, no. 23 p.7029-7038dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.2c018983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245007500169300001600244520112700260592002801387650001901415650001201434650001801446650001201464650001401476650001401490650002201504650001701526651001301543653002801556653002401584653001701608653001001625700001501635700002101650773012201671856009001793852000901883655001201892IND50060425820221118055750.0190403e20130130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006042582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2012.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayor, P.10aOvarian functionality in Poeppig's woolly monkey (Lagothrix poeppigii)  ap. 310-316.  aThis study examined ovarian features of 60 Poeppig's woolly monkey females in different reproductive stages, collected from wild animals hunted by rural communities in the North-eastern Peruvian Amazon, to provide knowledge on the reproductive physiology of this species. The observed mean ovulation rate was 1.73 follicles, reaching a maximum diameter of 1.0cm. After ovulation, the matured follicle luteinizes resulting in functional corpora lutea (CL). In case of oocyte fertilization, the “pregnancy” CL grow to a maximum of 2cm in diameter, and luteal volume decreases related to the advance of pregnancy. Pregnant females have waves of follicular activity until late pregnancy, but dominant follicles do not attain the maximum diameter of pre-ovulatory follicles. Some non-ovulated follicles of 1mm maximum diameter do not undergo atretic processes and transform to accessory CL by luteinization of the membrane granulosa, resulting in a contribution of up to 7% of the total luteal volume. All pregnant females delivered at term only 1.00 foetus, resulting in a rate of reproductive wastage of 33.3% of embryos.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal ovaries 3afemales 3aluteinization 3amonkeys 3aovulation 3apregnancy 3arural communities 3awild animals 3aAmazonia 0aPoeppig's woolly monkey 0aLagothrix poeppigii 0aReproduction 0aOvary1 aBowler, M.1 aLópez-Plana, C.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2013 Jan. 30, v. 136, no. 4 p.310-316dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2012.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01968naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245012700153520096700280592002801247650002601275650002601301650001401327650001801341650002301359650001201382650001101394650002001405700002001425773012701445856007301572852000901645655001201654IND60651843520221121221817.0190712e20160920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065184352DNAL7 a10.3390/su80909532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPu, Xujin10aVoluntary Certification of Agricultural Products in Competitive Markets: The Consideration of Boundedly Rational Consumers  aMarket competition creates strategic incentives for firms to communicate private information about their own product quality through certification. Although voluntary certification has recently gained importance in the agricultural industry, information asymmetry is not always completely addressed. This study analyzes how the relative proportion of boundedly rational consumers in the market influences the effectiveness of voluntary certification mechanisms by using a duopoly game model of high- and low-quality firms. The presented results show that a change in the proportion of boundedly rational consumers leads to different certification behaviors and a different market equilibrium. We also find that the existence of boundedly rational consumers is an important factor in the failure of voluntary certification. Indeed, when the relative proportion of such consumers is very high, voluntary certification is ineffective at improving market efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aagricultural products 3aasymmetry 3acertification 3amarket competition 3amarkets 3amodels 3aproduct quality1 aZhang, Huanzhen0 tSustainability.g2016 Sept. 20, v. 8, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80909533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03752naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011300167520231100280592002802591650001202619650001902631650001302650650002302663650001502686650001802701650001302719650002202732650001502754650001702769650002102786650000802807650001502815650000902830650001902839650001202858650002402870650003502894650001002929700002402939700001902963700002002982700001903002773013403021856008503155961000903240852000903249655001203258IND60672846020221119090345.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067284602DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz050.P16-013-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlack, Kyle10aGenetic Variations in the Dopaminergic Reward System Are Associated with Exercise Reinforcement (P16-013-19)  aThis study tested whether genotypes previously identified as moderators of other reinforcing behaviors, such as eating and drug abuse, also influence exercise reinforcement and the choice to exercise, measured as the reinforcing value of exercise relative to sedentary activities (screen time, reading, etc.). Linking specific genetic signatures of central mechanisms of reinforcement with an individual's exercise reinforcement has yet to be investigated and may uncover central mechanisms that underlie individual differences in exercise motivation, usual exercise behavior and long-term exercise adherence. Since preference and tolerance for exercise intensity influences exercise reinforcement, genetic contributions of these individual characteristics were also evaluated. Men (n = 51) and women (n = 127) were measured for the reinforcing value of exercise relative to sedentary activities (RRVₑₓₑᵣcᵢₛₑ), minutes of usual moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and completed the Preference for and Tolerance of the Intensity of Exercise Questionnaire. Participants provided a blood sample for genotyping of 23 SNPs previously identified to influence central dopamine release/uptake, reinforcement, or physical activity behaviors. ANOVA analysis determined differences in RRVₑₓₑᵣcᵢₛₑ, preference, and tolerance among genotypes and linear regression analysis controlling for age, sex, and MVPA determined if genotype predicted RRVₑₓₑᵣcᵢₛₑ, and preference/tolerance for exercise intensity. Having at least one copy of the G allele for the DRD2/ANKK1 polymorphism (rs1800497) confers greater RRVₑₓₑᵣcᵢₛₑ by increasing receptor binding or expression of the dopamine D2 receptor. Greater tolerance for exercise intensity was observed among those homozygous for the T allele for the CNR1 polymorphism (rs6454672), had at least one copy of the G allele for the GABRG3 polymorphism (rs8036270) and had at least one copy of the T allele for the LPR polymorphism (rs12405556) by influencing pain neurotransmission and leptin receptor binding. Similar to other reinforcing behaviors, there is a genetic contribution to exercise reinforcement and tolerance for exercise intensity.

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, considerable research focused on phytoplankton colony attached and free-living bacteria has revealed the close relationship between them, and indicated that the entire bacterial community mediates crucial biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems. However, our understanding of their distribution patterns and response to environmental factors remains poor. Besides, picocyanobacteria, which were omitted from attached bacteria analysis, were reported to be important in cyanobacterial blooms. To explore the spatiotemporal variation of the entire bacterial community with their driving environmental factors and detect the relationships among them, we collected 61 water samples spanning one year and the entire Lake Taihu regions for surveying the entire bacterial community. Our results indicated: 1) seasonal variation of the bacterial community composition was stronger than spatial variation due to the clearly seasonal variation of Microcystis, Synechococcus (pico-cyanobacteria) and other bacteria (Actinomycetales, Pirellulaceae and Sphingobacteriaceae); 2) the spatial distribution of the bacterial community showed that different phyla were dominant in different regions; 3) the bacterial co-occurrence networks varied seasonally and were dominated by Microcystis, ACK-M1, Chthoniobacteraceae, Synechococcus, Pirellulaceae and Pelagibacteraceae; 4) phytoplankton density, chlorophyll a, water temperature and total nitrogen were the major factors that drove the spatiotemporal variation of bacterial community composition. This study revealed the seasonal succession and spatial distribution of the entire bacterial community in Lake Taihu, providing new insights into the relationship between water bloom-forming cyanobacterial species and other bacteria, and their response to environmental factors in eutrophic freshwater ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinomycetales 3aMicrocystis 3aSphingobacteriaceae 3aSynechococcus 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiogeochemistry 3achlorophyll 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental factors 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater ecosystems 3afreshwater lakes 3aphytoplankton 3aribosomal RNA 3aseasonal variation 3asequence analysis 3aspatial variation 3asurveys 3atotal nitrogen 3awater temperature 0aCyanobacterial blooms 0aBacterial community 0a16S rRNA gene 0aSeasonal succession 0aSpatial distribution 0aDriving factors1 aZhang, Junyi1 aNawaz, Muhammad Zohaib1 aMahboob, Shahid1 aAl-Ghanim, Khalid A.1 aKhan, Iqrar A.q(Iqrar Ahmad),1 aLu, Zuhong1 aChen, Ting0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 June 15, v. 669 p.29-40dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245009100170500001900261520138200280592002801662650001601690650002201706650002601728650001801754650001801772650001101790650001401801650001701815650003201832650001301864650002101877651001001898653001701908653001901925653002401944653003101968700001501999700001702014700005402031700002002085700005902105773012002164856008802284852000902372655001202381IND60695349520221117180603.0200726e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069534952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1394002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jingjing10aAre bacterial communities associated with microplastics influenced by marine habitats?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study investigates the influence of marine habitats (i.e., the intertidal zone, supralittoral zone, and seawater), and polymer types (i.e., polyethylene, PE; polyethylene terephthalate, PET) on the diversity and structure of bacterial communities in marine microplastics. A three-month exposure experiment was conducted in Zhairuoshan Island, Zhoushan, China, a typical caldera volcanic island with minor anthropogenic disturbances. At the end of the exposure period, the transition for peaks corresponding to oxidized groups was observed using micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Damages, including pits and cracks, and microorganisms were observed on the surfaces of the PE and PET pellets using scanning electron microscopy. Next-generation amplicon sequencing of the bacterial communities that had colonized the microplastics revealed that bacterial composition significantly varied depending on marine habitats and exposure times, rather than polymer type. Plastic debris in the intertidal zone exhibited the highest bacterial richness and diversity, and Bacillus was considered a potential degrader of plastic debris. The findings demonstrate that bacterial communities that colonize on microplastics are more potentially shaped by marine habitat and exposure time, and this would deepen our understanding of the ecological niche of microplastics surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironment 3aexposure duration 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3alittoral zone 3amicroplastics 3aniches 3aoxidation 3apolyethylene 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3aseawater 3avolcanic islands 3aChina 0aMicroplastic 0aMarine habitat 0aBacterial community 0aPolyethylene terephthalate1 aHuang, Wei1 aJiang, Rijin1 aHan, Xibin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6235-91481 aZhang, Dongdong1 aZhang, Chunfang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1329-96300 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 733 p.139400-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1394003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02105naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245020800162300001400370520079700384592002801181650001601209650001201225650001201237650001201249650001301261650001101274650002601285650001101311650001401322650000901336650001201345650001401357650001401371650001101385650002201396650000901418700001901427773015001446856007801596852000901674655001201683IND60521448720221117092353.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052144872DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1975-1-2102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiebert, Hans10aÜber die Koordinationspolymeren M(II) [Pt(CN)6], I Darstellung, Kristallgitter und Lichtabsorptionsspektren / Coordination Polymers M(II) [Pt(CN)6], I Preparation, Crystal Lattice and Absorption Spectra  ap. 33-39.  aHexacyanoplatinates(IV) M(II) [Pt(CN)₆] · x H₂O (M(II) = Mg, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd; 0 ≦ x ≦ 2) have been prepared.

The distillation energy efficiency is strongly associated with the alcoholic fermentation performance in the process. The final ethanol concentration in the alcoholic wines has a direct impact on consumption of thermal energy in ethanol separation. In this paper, ethanol production with a H-SBMF (Hybrid-Simple Batch Membrane Fermenter) using PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) pervaporation membrane was modelled and simulated, in order to determine its influence on energy consumption in distillation. Steam in distillation and electrical energy needs in permeate recovery were mainly influenced by membrane adaptation. The H-SBMF achieved a higher ethanol production in the range of 10–13% compared to the conventional batch fermenter, and an increase in productivity of 150%. The distillation system consisted of two sets of columns: the ethanol recovery column and the rectification column. The permeate recovery system (i.e. vacuum and compression) was regarded in order to evaluate the electrical energy requirement, and the thermal energy demand was evaluated. A decrease in steam consumption was evidenced by the adaptation of the membrane to the fermenter. Higher energy efficiencies were achieved in distillation with larger membrane areas, achieving almost 17% steam reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcoholic fermentation 3adistillation 3aelectric power 3aenergy efficiency 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermenters 3amolasses 3apervaporation 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3asteam 3asugarcane 3athermal energy 3awines 0aHybrid-fermentation 0aMembrane 0aPervaporation 0aDistillation 0aEnergy efficiency1 aPalacios-Bereche, Reynaldo1 aNebra, Silvia A.0 tEnergy.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 109 p.77-91dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.04.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245013300181300001800314520134600332592002801678650002501706650001501731650001801746650001101764650001501775650002601790650001501816650002501831650001301856650001101869650001801880650002201898650001101920651001801931651001801949653002701967653002301994653004102017653001602058653002102074700007102095700003102166700007702197773013702274856008502411852000902496655001202505IND60531166920221119091305.0190416e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053116692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2016.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamargo, Franciele Pereira12aA comparison between cactophilic yeast communities isolated from Cereus hildmannianus and Praecereus euchlorus necrotic cladodes  ap. 1175-1183.  aIn the cactus-yeast-Drosophila model system, the necrotic cladode is used as substrate by a diverse and specific microbiota, which is utilized as food source by Drosophila. Although this association has been the focus of many studies in arid regions of North America, little is known of its composition in South America. This study analysed yeast communities isolated from two South American cacti species: Cereus hildmannianus and Praecereus euchlorus. Fourteen yeast species were isolated and identified by their morpho-physiological character and partial rRNA gene sequencing. Arthropods hatched from the analysed cladodes were identified. There was little similarity between the isolated yeast communities either in terms of cacti species (S = 0.286) or collection sites (S = 0.214–0.335). To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that Metschnikowia koreensis and Hannaella sinensis have been described in association with cacti. Also, Drosophila buzzatti has not been described in association with Praecereus. The similarity between cactophilic arthropod communities found in the different cacti was low (S = 0.266) and zero when only Drosophila was considered. These results suggest that exploration by Drosophila species is the main factor that drives low yeast community similarity between cacti species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCereus hildmannianus 3aDrosophila 3aMetschnikowia 3aadults 3aarid zones 3aarthropod communities 3aarthropods 3acacti and succulents 3acladodes 3alarvae 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3ayeasts 3aNorth America 3aSouth America 0aCactophilic arthropods 0aCactophilic yeasts 0aCactus-yeast-Drosophila model system 0aD. buzzatti 0aYeast dispersion1 aAraujo, Ana Carolina Vieira1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1689-72651 aMoraes, Evandro Marsola de1 aDos Santos, André Cordeiro Alves1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6323-52000 tFungal biology.g2016 Oct., v. 120, no. 10 p.1175-1183dElsevier LtdaBritish Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2016.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01866naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015700167300001400324520086200338592002801200650001401228650002101242650002401263650000901287650001601296700002101312700002101333773012001354856008101474852000901555655001201564IND60625670020221119191628.0181211e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062567002DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078180602582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedovar, Yu.

Assessment of the barrage effect should take into account not only the magnitude of the groundwater flow but its level position relative to the earth’s surface. If the groundwater level (GWL) is located at a considerable depth, even deep-laid foundations of a building under construction and, accordingly, a substantial rise in groundwater table will not result in a critical situation whereby the foundations of neighboring buildings are submerged and the bearing capacity of the soil under the foundations is changed.

In men, the mTOR/4E-BP1/eIF4E pathway was described as altered in different tumours, including prostate cancer (PC). Apart from humans, the dog is the only species that develops PC with high frequency and is considered a good model for comparative oncology initiatives. Due to limited information on this pathway in canine tumours, this study aimed to investigate mTOR, 4E-BP1 and eIF4E gene and protein expression in canine PC, as well as in metastatic and normal prostatic tissues, and to evaluate the correlations between gene/protein expression and Gleason score (GS) in PC. A total of 35 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, including 13 of normal prostatic tissue, 17 PC samples and 5 metastasis samples, were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and qPCR. mTOR gene mutation in the kinase domain was also investigated. We identified higher p-mTOR and eIF4E protein levels in canine PC with higher GS values (≥ 8) and a significant positive correlation in expression between these proteins. eIF4E overexpression was observed in metastasis relative to expression in normal samples. Our data suggest that p-mTOR and eIF4E expression is positively correlated with GS in canine PC, similar to the pattern in humans. More studies of the mTOR/4EBP1/eIF4E pathway should be performed to identify possible correlations of the proteins involved with clinical and pathologic findings in canine PC and the roles of these proteins as therapeutic targets for the treatment of canine PC.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3aenzymes 3agenes 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amen 3ametastasis 3amodels 3amutation 3aprostate gland 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aprotein content 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atherapeutics 0aDog 0amTOR pathway 0aProstate cancer 0aOncology 0aGleason score1 aFonseca-Alves, Carlos E.1 aKobayashi, Priscila E.1 aCarvalho, Márcio,1 aVasconcelos, Rosemeri O.1 aLaufer-Amorim, Renée0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2019 Feb., v. 122 p.86-92dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2018.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002200158245015900180300001800339520143600357592002801793650002001821650001501841650002101856650001301877650001301890650001301903650001001916650002001926650001901946650001601965650001101981653001301992653001502005653002002020653002702040653001802067653001602085700002502101700002002126700002202146773010602168856009302274852000902367655001202376IND60540562620221117183959.0190318e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054056262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖğretmen, Fatih10aEffect of semen extender supplementation with cysteine on postthaw sperm quality, DNA damage, and fertilizing ability in the common carp (Cyprinus carpio)  ap. 1548-1552.  aAmino acids have an important biological role for prevention of cell damage during cryopreservation. The objective of this study is to determine the effects of cysteine on postthaw sperm motility, duration of sperm motility, DNA damage, and fertility in the common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Sperm collected from 10 individuals was cryopreserved in extenders containing different cysteine concentrations (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mM). Semen samples diluted at the ratio of 1:9 by the extenders were subjected to cryopreservation. After dilution, the semen was aspirated into 0.25-mL straws; the straws were placed on the tray, frozen in nitrogen vapor, and plunged into liquid nitrogen. DNA damage was evaluated by comet assay after cryopreservation. Our results indicated that an increase in the concentration of cysteine caused a significant increase in the motility rate and duration of sperm in the common carp (C carpio; P < 0.05). Comparing all concentrations of cysteine, the best concentration of cysteine was 20 mM. Higher postthaw motility (76.00 ± 1.00%) and fertilization (97.00 ± 1.73%) rates were obtained with the extender at the concentration of 20 mM. Supplementation of the extender with cysteine was increased the fertilization and hatching rate and decreased DNA damage. Consequently, cysteine affected the motility, fertilization, and DNA damage positively, and extenders could be supplemented with cysteine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3aDNA damage 3acryopreservation 3acysteine 3ahatching 3anitrogen 3asemen 3asemen extenders 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3avapors 0aCysteine 0aAmino acid 0aCyprinus carpio 0aSperm cryopreservation 0aDNA integrity 0aComet assay1 aİnanan, Burak Evren1 aKutluyer, Filiz1 aKayım, Murathan,0 tTheriogenology.g2015 June, v. 83, no. 9 p.1548-1552dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02350naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245008000174520110500254592002801359650002201387650002401409650001901433650001501452650001401467650001001481651001001491653001401501653002501515653002401540653001001564653005101574700002501625700002501650700002501675700002201700700002201722773010001744856008701844852000901931655001201940IND60767165820221118044538.0220328e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076716582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1323772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimonetti, Giulia10aProfile of free and conjugated quercetin content in different Italian wines  aQuercetin and its structural derivatives are natural compounds belonging to the flavonoid class, widely distributed in plants. Beneficial physiological activities have been attributed to them, but some require deeper investigation. In this paper the content of quercetin and five analogues (quercetin-3-glucoside, quercetin-3-rutinoside, quercetin-3-ramnoside, quercetin-3-arabinoglucoside, 4′-O-methylquercetin) were determined by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS in wines made of different varieties of red and white vines. The aim was a comparative study focusing on quercetin and on the contribution of related compounds in twenty wines coming from different part of Italy. Wines produced from Sangiovese and Nero d’Avola, monovarietal grapes, were richest in quercetin compounds and our results were compared to our previous study and to other investigations. The proposed method resulted simple, fast, economical, and suitable for the analysis of quercetin analogues without the need of hydrolysis and falls in the optic of a 360° characterization of active wine compounds, with nutraceutical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomparative study 3adietary supplements 3afood chemistry 3ahydrolysis 3aquercetin 3awines 3aItaly 0aQuercetin 0aQuercetin glycosides 0aQuercetin analogues 0aWines 0aLiquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry1 aBuiarelli, Francesca1 aBernardini, Flaminia1 aFilippo, Patrizia Di1 aRiccardi, Carmela1 aPomata, Donatella0 tFood chemistry.g2022 July 15, v. 382 p.132377-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1323773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01753naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007300128300001600201500001500217520084500232650001101077650002601088650001501114650001301129650002301142650001201165650001101177653002101188653004001209653001701249773006901266852000901335930003301344945001301377946001301390655001201403IND2045003420221118212843.0950310e199207  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204500342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamadro, E.L.10aCytologicla mechanism of 2n microspore formation in garden asparagus  ap. 831-832.  a2019-12-05  aMicrosporogenesis was studied in 42 randomly chosen F2 plants of garden asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L. cv. UC 157) (2n = 2x = 20) that had been previously screened for production of pollen of heterogeneous size. At the tetrad stage, the average frequencies of tetrads, triads, and dyads were 58.9%, 15.4%, and 25.9%, respectively. Dyads and triads originated from the lack of chromosome migration toward opposite poles at anaphase II in either one or both cells of a microsporocyte, followed by the absence of cytokinesis in telophase II. The resulting 2n microspores were, therefore, genetically equivalent to second meiotic division restitution products. The observation that all plants examined produced 2n microspores in high frequencies is taken as an indication that the modified meiosis in these plants is under genetic control. 3aspores 3aAsparagus officinalis 3agerm cells 3adiploidy 3achromosome pairing 3ameiosis 3apollen 0amicrosporogensis 0asecond meiotic division restitution 0acytogenetics0 tHortScience.g1992 July, v. 27, no. 7 p.831-832x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdLJS  aOther US 7aarticle02922naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002300179245011900202300001800321506007600339520135100415506003701766650002701803650001501830650001501845650001801860650001801878650001001896650003001906650000901936650001801945650001201963650002201975650000901997650002302006650002202029650002902051650002602080700001802106700002202124700002302146773008102169852000902250856007802259930003302337946001102370990002302381655001202404IND4437398420221207110306.0100522e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443739842DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkq0032doi7 aPMC28750312pmcid7 a201008002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSleumer, Monica C.10aConserved elements associated with ribosomal genes and their trans-splice acceptor sites in Caenorhabditis elegans  ap. 2990-3004.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe recent publication of the Caenorhabditis elegans cisRED database has provided an extensive catalog of upstream elements that are conserved between nematode genomes. We have performed a secondary analysis to determine which subsequences of the cisRED motifs are found in multiple locations throughout the C. elegans genome. We used the word-counting motif discovery algorithm DME to form the motifs into groups based on sequence similarity. We then examined the genes associated with each motif group using DAVID and Ontologizer to determine which groups are associated with genes that also have significant functional associations in the Gene Ontology and other gene annotation sources. Of the 3265 motif groups formed, 612 (19%) had significant functional associations with respect to GO terms. Eight of the first 20 motif groups based on frequent dodecamers among the cisRED motif sequences were specifically associated with ribosomal protein genes; two of these were similar to mouse EBP-45, rat HNF3-family and Drosophila Zeste transcription factor binding sites. Additionally, seven motif groups were extensions of the canonical C. elegans trans-splice acceptor site. One motif group was tested for regulatory function in a series of green fluorescent protein expression experiments and was shown to be involved in pharyngeal expression.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aDrosophila 3aalgorithms 3abinding sites 3agene ontology 3agenes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3amice 3anucleic acids 3apharynx 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3aribosomal proteins 3asequence homology 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aMah, Allan K.1 aBaillie, David L.1 aJones, Steven J.M.0 tNucleic acids research.g2010 May, v. 38, no. 9 p.2990-3004x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02634naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245010600200300001800306506007600324520120100400506003701601650002201638650002001660650001701680650002101697650001101718650001201729650002701741650002401768700002101792700002001813700001801833700002001851700002401871700001601895700001701911773008101928852000902009856007902018930003302097946001102130990002302141655001202164IND4437397820221207110228.0100522e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443739782DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkp12492doi7 aPMC28750082pmcid7 a200812072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrimme, Jill M.10aHuman Rad52 binds and wraps single-stranded DNA and mediates annealing via two hRad52-ssDNA complexes  ap. 2917-2930.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRad52 promotes the annealing of complementary strands of DNA bound by replication protein A (RPA) during discrete repair pathways. Here, we used a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between two fluorescent dyes incorporated into DNA substrates to probe the mechanism by which human Rad52 (hRad52) interacts with and mediates annealing of ssDNA-hRPA complexes. Human Rad52 bound ssDNA or ssDNA-hRPA complex in two, concentration-dependent modes. At low hRad52 concentrations, ssDNA was wrapped around the circumference of the protein ring, while at higher protein concentrations, ssDNA was stretched between multiple hRad52 rings. Annealing by hRad52 occurred most efficiently when each complementary DNA strand or each ssDNA-hRPA complex was bound by hRad52 in a wrapped configuration, suggesting homology search and annealing occur via two hRad52-ssDNA complexes. In contrast to the wild type protein, hRad52RQK/AAA and hRad52¹⁻²¹² mutants with impaired ability to bind hRPA protein competed with hRPA for binding to ssDNA and failed to counteract hRPA-mediated duplex destabilization highlighting the importance of hRad52-hRPA interactions in promoting efficient DNA annealing.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomplementary DNA 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahumans 3amutants 3anucleic acid annealing 3asingle-stranded DNA1 aHonda, Masayoshi1 aWright, Rebecca1 aOkuno, Yusuke1 aRothenberg, Eli1 aMazin, Alexander V.1 aHa, Taekjip1 aSpies, Maria0 tNucleic acids research.g2010 May, v. 38, no. 9 p.2917-2930x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp12493Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03372naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001700161245013500178500001500313520195500328650002402283650001502307650001402322650001102336650001302347650002602360650002802386650002602414650002202440650002502462650002202487650001102509650002202520653002602542700001702568700001502585700001602600773008502616852000902701856008602710930003302796945002502829946001302854990002302867655001202890IND4377126220221118212531.0060110s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437712622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

An understanding of the basic biology of resistant biotypes, including their growth and development relative to susceptible biotypes, may yield information helpful in the management of resistant biotypes. Greenhouse and growth chamber experiments were conducted to compare growth characteristics of biotypes of common cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium L.) that are resistant or susceptible to acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibiting herbicides. Averaged over two temperature regimes (24/18 °C and 34/24 °C day/night) under noncompetitive conditions, an ALS herbicide-susceptible (S) biotype produced more leaves, greater leaf area, and greater shoot dry biomass at 20 and 30 d after planting (DAP) than an ALS herbicide-resistant (R) biotype. By 40 DAP, leaf number, leaf area, leaf area ratio (LAR), leaf dry biomass, and shoot dry biomass were similar for R and S biotypes. Susceptible plants produced a greater root biomass, but R plants were taller at 40 DAP under noncompetitive conditions. Averaged across biotypes, relative growth rate (RGR) and photosynthetic net assimilation rate (NAR) were greater at the 24/18 °C temperature regime. Averaged across temperature regimes, RGR and NAR were 11 and 17% greater for the R biotype than the S biotype under noncompetitive conditions. Under intertypic competitive conditions, the biotypes were similar in height, but the S biotype had a greater leaf number per plant. Evaluation of replacement series diagrams and relative crowding coefficient (RCC) estimates suggest that the two biotypes did not differ competitively in leaf production or plant height. The R biotype demonstrated a statistically significant, but probably trivial, competitive disadvantage in leaf dry biomass (t(lof) = -4.55, P = 0.01; RCC(R:S) = 0.73 ± 0.07) and shoot dry biomass production (t(lof) = -3.73, P = 0.02; RCC(R:S) = 0.73 ± 0.08). 3aXanthium strumarium 3aherbicides 3aleaf area 3aheight 3abiotypes 3aacetolactate synthase 3adry matter accumulation 3anet assimilation rate 3aplant competition 3aherbicide resistance 3aenzyme inhibition 3aleaves 3avegetative growth 0aplant characteristics1 aBurton, M.G.1 aYork, A.C.1 aBrownie, C.0 tJournal of cotton science.g2005, v. 9, no. 4wJournal:jnl57674x1524-33037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.cotton.org/journal/2005-09/4/upload/jcs09-229.pdf3electronic resource  a20060112b20060202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/01/11  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02763naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245013200128300001600260500002400276520139400300650001601694650001301710650001401723650002001737650001301757650002101770650001101791650001401802650002101816650001801837650001901855650001701874650001801891650001701909650001501926653001101941700001401952700002101966700001401987700001802001773012602019852000902145856007002154930003302224945001302257946001102270655001202281IND2324920220221118212216.0020118e20010903ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232492022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuzuki, M.Y.10aPhysiological responses during stress and subsequent recovery at different salinities in adult pejerrey Odontesthes bonariensis  ap. 349-362.  aIncludes references  aMortality and physiological responses (plasma cortisol, glucose, osmolality, ions Na(+) and Cl(-) and hematocrit values) were examined in adult pejerrey Odontesthes bonariensis subjected to transport or crowding and subsequent recovery for 1 week at 0, 5 and 20 ppt NaCl. Two experiments were conducted using fish from different hatcheries; the following responses were consistent for both stocks. Mortality was observed only during post-stress recovery at 0 and 20 ppt NaCl but not at 5 ppt. During recovery, blood cortisol and glucose were generally higher, whereas osmolality and blood electrolytes (Na(+) and Cl(-)) were lower at 0 ppt than at the other salinities. A salinity of 5 ppt NaCl could not prevent the rise in cortisol and glucose levels caused by the stress of transport, but during recovery, it prevented further increases in these features and/or accelerated their return to basal levels. This salinity also helped maintain stable blood electrolyte levels. During recovery at 20 ppt NaCl, osmolality and blood ions increased, whereas plasma cortisol and glucose generally decreased. Hematocrit values were lower at 20 ppt than at the other salinities. These results suggest that freshwater is not an adequate medium for post-stress recovery and that the presence of NaCl in the water either decreases the secretion of cortisol or promotes its clearance in O. bonariensis. 3aAtherinidae 3asalinity 3amortality 3ablood chemistry 3acortisol 3aosmotic pressure 3asodium 3achlorides 3aanimal transport 3astocking rate 3abrackish water 3aelectrolytes 3awater quality 3asaline water 3ahematocrit 0astress1 aOgawa, K.1 aStrussmann, C.A.1 aMaita, M.1 aTakashima, F.0 tAquaculture.g2001 Sept. 3, , no. 3/4 p.349-362dElsevier Pub.

  1 aPegg, R.B.10aNutritional characteristics of emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) meat and its value-added products  ap. 193-202.  a2019-12-05  aThe objectives of the present study were to ascertain the nutritional value (i.e., macro and microconstituents) of emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae, Latham) meat and a value-added product derived therefrom. The contents of creatine, creatinine and phosphocreatine in fresh emu meat and the impact of processing on these bioactives during the production of jerky were of particular interest. For comparative purposes, a beef counterpart was prepared. The proximate compositional data indicated that the macroconstituents of emu meat and the fabricated jerky product were not so different from their beef analogues. Analysis of the microconstituents in emu samples revealed that the levels of a number of nutritionally important oil- and water-soluble vitamins and minerals were typical of those for red meat species. The creatine content in emu meat (29.3 mg/g dry matter) was similar to that of beef; slightly higher creatine levels were detected, however, in the emu jerky (22.8 mg/g dry matter) compared to its beef counterpart, and these were significant (P < 0.01) when the data was analysed on a dry weight basis. This demonstrates a potential for the emu meat snack to be considered as a functional food for athletes looking for performance enhancement, and who are interested in consuming greater quantities of creatine from a natural food source. 3adried meat 3afunctional foods 3ameat composition 3aergogenic aids 3afood analysis 3acreatine 3ameat processing 3avitamin content 3ameat quality 3aemus 3acreatinine 3aphosphocreatine 3avalue-added products 3aproximate composition 3amineral content 3apoultry meat 0ajerky1 aAmarowicz, R.1 aCode, W.E.0 tFood chemistry.g2006 July, v. 97, no. 2 p.193-202x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20060726b20060804c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/05/19  aNon-US 7aarticle03310naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001700150245020900167300001600376500002400392500001500416506007600431520142100507506003701928650002301965650002501988650001202013650001102025650001002036650002402046650001702070650002202087650004302109650002602152650002402178650002502202650004602227650001902273650006202292650001902354653002302373653001402396653001202410700001602422700001602438700001702454773015102471852000902622856005402631930003302685945001302718946001302731655001202744IND2324961920221207104552.0020123e200107  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232496192DNAL7 a114579462pmid7 aPMC1164522pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolosova, N.10aCellular and subcellular localization of S-adenosyl-L-methionine:benzoic acid carboxyl methyltransferase, the enzyme responsible for biosynthesis of the volatile ester methylbenzoate in snapdragon flowers  ap. 956-964.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe benzenoid ester, methylbenzoate is one of the most abundant scent compounds detected in the majority of snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) varieties. It is produced in upper and lower lobes of petals by enzymatic methylation of benzoic acid in the reaction catalyzed by S-adenosyl-L-methionine:benzoic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (BAMT). To identify the location of methylbenzoate biosynthesis, we conducted an extensive immunolocalization study by light and electron microscopy at cellular and subcellular levels using antibodies against BAMT protein. BAMT was immunolocalized predominantly in the conical cells of the inner epidermal layer and, to a much lesser extent, in the cells of the outer epidermis of snapdragon flower petal lobes. It was also located in the inner epidermis of the corolla tube with little BAMT protein detected in the outer epidermis and in the yellow hairs within the tube on the bee's way to the nectar. These results strongly suggest that scent biosynthetic genes are expressed almost exclusively in the epidermal cells of floral organs. Immunogold labeling studies reveal that BAMT is a cytosolic enzyme, suggesting cytosolic location of methylbenzoate biosynthesis. The concentration of scent production on flower surfaces that face the pollinators during landing may increase pollination efficiency and also help to minimize the biosynthetic cost of advertising for pollinators.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3avolatile compounds 3aimmunohistochemistry 3acorolla 3aesters 3aodors 3aimmunocytochemistry 3atransferases 3aAntirrhinum majus 2aMagnoliopsidaxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aBenzoatesxmetabolism 2aCytosolxenzymology 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMethyltransferasesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteins 2aPlant Structuresxenzymologyxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aVolatilization 0abenzoates (esters) 0aepidermis 0aflowers1 aSherman, D.1 aKarlson, D.1 aDudareva, N.0 tPlant physiology.g2001 July, v. 126, no. 3 p.956-964dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle01928naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009800126300001600224500002400240520085300264650002201117650001601139650001301155650002401168650001901192650001401211650002201225650001001247653002001257653002701277773012601304852000901430856007001439930003301509945001301542946001101555655001201566IND2324919920221118211748.0020118e20010903ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232491992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJerry, D.R.10aElectrical stimulation of spermatophore extrusion in the freshwater yabby (Cherax destructor)  ap. 317-322.  aIncludes references  aA technique for collecting spermatophores from male yabbies (Cherax destructor) is described. This technique consists of applying an electrical stimulus of between 5 and 10 mA and 40-50 Hz around the coxa of the fifth walking leg, and was found to have a success rate of 76% in 100 males tested. Furthermore, this approach enabled the collection of spermatophores from intersex individuals, indicating that intersex animals have the ability to function as males. Using this technique, it was shown that spermatophore development is correlated with water temperature and that it is possible to elicit spermatophores from males in the non-reproductive season simply by raising water temperatures. The ability to non-invasively collect spermatophores from yabbies will facilitate the development of artificial fertilization techniques in this species. 3aCherax destructor 3aspermatozoa 3aspawning 3asexual reproduction 3aintersexuality 3afecundity 3awater temperature 3amales 0aspawning season 0aelectrical stimulation0 tAquaculture.g2001 Sept. 3, , no. 3/4 p.317-322dElsevier Pub.

The results support the notion that structural change partly explains the observed U.S. meat consumption patterns. Structural change is biased against beef, neutral for pork, in favor of chicken and fish, and it does not affect estimated elasticities. The estimated path of structural change implies a rapid transition to a new regime in the mid-1970s, although a smooth path cannot be ruled out. 3aestimation 3apork 3aconsumer behavior 3amathematical models 3achicken meat 3autility functions 3aregression analysis 3aveal 3aelasticities 3atime series analysis 3aproduction functions 3afish 3acomputer software 3aUnited States 0aproduction structure 0aalmost ideal demand system model 0amaximum likelihood 0aadjustment of production 0astructural change 0aflexibility 0aconsumption patterns 0aseparability 0ashazam (computer software) 0afish consumption 0abeef1 aMeilke, K.D.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1989 May, v. 71, no. 2 p.253-261x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03056naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001300144245011000157300001600267500001500283520197000298650002102268650002102289650002202310650001902332650002002351650002302371650002302394650002502417650001702442650001702459653001602476700001602492773007202508852000902580930003302589945002502622946001102647655001202658IND4379206720221118210936.0060331e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437920672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aShui, G.10aResidue from star fruit as valuable source for functional food ingredients and antioxidant nutraceuticals  ap. 277-284.  a2019-12-05  aOur previous study has indicated that star fruit (Averrhoa carambola L.) is a good source of natural antioxidants and that polyphenolics are its major antioxidants. In this study, the residue of star fruit, which is normally discarded during juice drink processing, was found to contain much higher antioxidant activity than the extracted juice using several methods for assessing antioxidant activity. Under optimized extraction conditions, the residue accounted for around 70% of total antioxidant activity (TAA) and total polyphenolic contents, however only contributed 15% of the weight of whole fruit. Freeze-dried residue powder, which accounted for around 5% of total weight, had total polyphenolic content of 33.2 +/- 3.6 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g sample and total antioxidant activity of 3490 +/- 310 and 3412 +/- 290 mg L-ascorbic acid equivalent antioxidant capacity (AEAC) or 5270 +/- 468 and 5152 +/- 706 mg trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) per 100 g sample obtained by 2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) free radical (ABTS(+.)) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH(.)) scavenging assays, respectively. It was also found to have 510.3 +/- 68.1 mol ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) per gram sample. The residue extract also shows strong antioxidant activity in delaying oxidative rancidity of soya bean oil at 110 degrees C. Antioxidant activity and polyphenolic profile of residue extracts were compared with extracts of standardized pyconogenol. High performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) shows that major proanthocyanidins in star fruit were different from their isomers in pyconogenol. The high content of phenolics and strong antioxidant activity of residue extracts indicate that residue powder may impart health benefits when used in functional food products and that residue extracts should also be regarded as potential nutraceutical resources in future. 3afunctional foods 3aplant byproducts 3aproanthocyanidins 3aplant residues 3afood processing 3aAverrhoa carambola 3aactive ingredients 3aantioxidant activity 3afruit juices 3aantioxidants 0apolyphenols1 aLeong, L.P.0 tFood chemistry.g2006 July, v. 97, no. 2 p.277-284x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20060726b20060804c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/05/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02893naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100001400215245012400229300001600353520111300369650000901482650002301491650002801514650002701542650002001569650001501589650003301604650003301637650002601670650002401696650001801720650001201738650004501750650001101795650002301806650002201829650003801851650002401889650002201913700001401935700001801949700001401967773007601981852000902057856010702066856008502173930003302258945002502291946001102316655001202327IND4423766120221118210934.0090727e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442376612DNAL7 a196809572pmid7 a10.1080/026520309027517042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHajeb, P.10aOptimizing conditions for methylmercury extraction from fish samples for GC analysis using response surface methodology  ap. 829-838.  aResponse surface methodology (RSM) was used to determine the optimum experimental conditions to extract methylmercury from fish samples for GC analysis. The influence of four variables -- acid concentration (3-12 M), cysteine concentration (0.5-2% w/v), solvent volume (3-9 ml) and extraction time (10-30 min) -- on recovery of methylmercury was evaluated. The detection limit for methylmercury analysis using a microelectron capture detector was 7 ng g-1 in fish samples. The mean recovery under optimum conditions was 94%. Experimental data were adequately fitted into a second-order polynomial model with multiple regression coefficients (r2) of 0.977. The four variables had a significant effect (p < 0.05) on the recovery of methylmercury from a reference material (BCR-463). Optimum conditions for methylmercury extraction were found using an acid concentration of 12.2 M, cysteine concentration of 2.4%, solvent volume of 1.5 ml and extraction time of 35 min. The validation of the developed method to analyze methylmercury in fish samples exhibited good agreement with mercury content in the samples. 3afish 3afood contamination 3amethylmercury compounds 3aenvironmental exposure 3awater pollution 3aextraction 3aresponse surface methodology 3acapillary gas chromatography 3aquantitative analysis 3adynamic programming 3aleast squares 2aAnimals 2aChromatography, Gasxmethodsxstandards. 2aFishes 2aLimit of Detection 2aMercuryxanalysis 2aMethylmercury Compoundsxanalysis 2aReference Standards 2aSeafoodxanalysis1 aJinap, S.1 aBakar, F.

Added fat in diets was supplied by oilseeds, either soybeans or sunflowers, in previously reported studies. Milk yield during wk 4 through 16 postpartum was 2.8% higher for cows fed added fat. Total lactational yield was increased 3.6% for cows fed additional fat in early lactation; 71% of the additional milk production occurred after discontinuing the feeding of additional fat. Percentages of milk fat and protein were lower when cows were fed added fat and remained lower for the remainder of the lactation. Days to first breeding, days open, and services per conception were not reduced by feeding added fat during early lactation. Milk production and persistency for the entire lactation were increased by feeding additional fat during early lactation, but changes in reproductive efficiency were not detected. 3adairy cows 3adietary fat 3afeed supplements 3alactation stage 3alactation curve 3amilk yield 3amilk composition 3afemale fertility 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMilkxanalysisxsecretion. 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aReproduction1 aCasper, D.P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1991 Aug., v. 74, no. 8 p.2617-2622x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01911naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245005500125300001800180520099600198650004301194650003701237650001401274650001601288650002001304650002701324653004001351653001301391700001601404700001401420773007101434852000901505930003301514945001301547946001301560655001201573IND2044387720221118211228.0950201e199108  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204438772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElkind, Y.10aGenetics of semideterminate growth habit in tomato  ap. 1074-1075.  aThe objective of this study was to elucidate the genetic control of the semideterminate growth habit in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). A semideterminate tomato line was crossed with determinate and indeterminate lines; their F1, F2, and backcrosses were grown; and the growth babit recorded and analyzed. Plants with six or more inflorescences on the main stem were defined as semideterminate, while those with fewer were defined as determinate. The F2 and backcross to determinate were bimodal, indicating a single recessive gene for semideterminate, which denoted as sdt. The goodness-of-fit chi square for a single recessive gene model was 88% and 69% for F2 and backcross generations, respectively. In the cross between semideterminate and indeterminate types, the results indicated control by two genes, sp and sdt, with the sp+ indeterminate type epistatic over semideterminate. The goodness-of-fit to this model was 70% and 82% for F2 and backcross generations, respectively. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aepistasis 3amajor genes 3arecessive genes 3ainheritance (genetics) 0adeterminate and indeterminate habit 0asdt gene1 aGurnick, A.1 aKedar, N.0 tHortScience.g1991 Aug., v. 26, no. 8 p.1074-1075x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdLJS  aOther US 7aarticle02150naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245008300122300001800205500001500223520102600238650002101264650001801285650001801303650001401321650002001335650001501355650001301370650001001383650001701393650001901410653001201429653002001441653001301461653001501474700001801489700002501507700001601532700001701548773007101565852000901636930003301645945001301678946001301691655001201704IND2044387820221118211307.0950201e199108  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204438782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, N.10aGenetic factors and in vitro manipulations influence seed dormancy in cucumber  ap. 1076-1077.  a2019-12-05  aSeed lots with the genetic background of 'Baroda' and 'Marketer' cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) containing all possible combinations (DF Df, Dfdf, dfdf) of df (which increases dormancy) and Df (wild type) were used. Dormancy was not solely due to the genotype dfdf and clear effects of genetic background were apparent. The df allele in the homozygous state induced a strong dormancy in 'Baroda', but the Df gene could not restore normal germination. However, Df did reduce the dormancy period to 85 days. In 'Marketer', df did not delay germination. Any treatment (puncturing, removal, cutting) that damaged the inner integument allowed 'Baroda' dfdf to germinate, indicating an intact integument was essential for maintaining dormancy in this cultivar. All 'Baroda' dfdf embryonic axes without the cotyledons germinated in 5 days. 'Baroda' dfdf seeds with intact integuments imbibed adequate water to germinate but remained dormant, suggesting that the effect of the integument on dormancy was not related to imbibition. 3aseed germination 3aseed dormancy 3aplant tissues 3aflowering 3aCucumis sativus 3acotyledons 3aallelism 3agenes 3ahomozygosity 3aseed treatment 0adf gene 0aseed integument 0agenotype 0ainhibition1 aSkirvin, R.M.1 aSplittstoesser, W.E.1 aHarry, D.E.1 aGeorge, W.L.0 tHortScience.g1991 Aug., v. 26, no. 8 p.1076-1077x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdLJS  aOther US 7aarticle03345naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002200149245008100171300001800252500002400270500001500294520180000309650001002109650002102119650001902140650002102159650002302180650001602203650001802219650001902237650002302256650002102279650001702300650002002317650002202337650001502359650002402374650001602398650002202414650001102436650001202447650002002459650001502479650002002494650002202514651001802536653003302554653001602587700002502603773010202628852000902730856005202739655001202791IND4463223120221118211503.0120515e200306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446322312DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-521X(02)00027-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeller, Martin C.10aAssessing the sustainability of the US food system: a life cycle perspective  ap. 1007-1041.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe US food system, from field to table, is at a crossroads for change. Improving the sustainability of this complex system requires a thorough understanding of the relationships between food consumption behaviors, processing and distribution activities, and agricultural production practices. A product life cycle approach provides a useful framework for studying the links between societal needs, the natural and economic processes involved in meeting these needs, and the associated environmental consequences. The ultimate goal is to guide the development of system-based solutions. This paper presents a broad set of indicators covering the life cycle stages of the food system. Indicators address economic, social, and environmental aspects of each life cycle stage: origin of (genetic) resource; agricultural growing and production; food processing, packaging and distribution; preparation and consumption; and end of life. The paper then offers an initial critical review of the condition of the US food system by considering trends in the various indicators. Current trends in a number of indicators threaten the long-term economic, social, and environmental sustainability of the US food system. Key trends include: rates of agricultural land conversion, income and profitability from farming, degree of food industry consolidation, fraction of edible food wasted, diet related health costs, legal status of farmworkers, age distribution of farmers, genetic diversity, rate of soil loss and groundwater withdrawal, and fossil fuel use intensity. We suggest that effective opportunities to enhance the sustainability of the food system exist in changing consumption behavior, which will have compounding benefits across agricultural production, distribution and food disposition stages. 3afoods 3asoil degradation 3afood packaging 3afood preparation 3afarm profitability 3agroundwater 3aeating habits 3afood transport 3aproduct life cycle 3afood consumption 3afossil fuels 3aland use change 3aagricultural land 3afood waste 3aeconomic indicators 3afood intake 3ahealth care costs 3aincome 3afarmers 3afood processing 3afarm labor 3afood production 3agenetic variation 3aUnited States 0aenvironmental sustainability 0afood wastes1 aKeoleian, Gregory A.0 tAgricultural systems.g2003 June, v. 76, no. 3 p.1007-1041dElsevier Science Ltdx0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-521X(02)00027-6 7aarticle02946naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245006400166300001800230500001500248520142600263650001401689650003601703650003301739650002001772650002101792650002101813650003201834650004001866650002001906650004801926650002001974650002301994650003002017650005902047650004702106650003802153650002802191653001602219653002902235700001602264700001702280700001802297773007202315852000902387939003302396946001102429655001202440IND9201478320221118211514.0920316e199108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920147832DNAL7 a20656542pmid7 aPMC4528892pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarter, P.J.10aCircadian rhythms in the activity of a plant protein kinase  ap. 2063-2068.  a2019-12-04  aBryophyllum fedtschenkoi is a Crassulacean acid metabolism plant whose phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase is regulated by reversible phosphorylation in response to a circadian rhythm. A partially, purified protein kinase phosphorylated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase in vitro with a stoichiometry approaching one per subunit and caused a concomitant 5- to 10-fold decrease in the sensitivity of the carboxylase to inhibition by malate. The sites phosphorylated in vitro were identical to those phosphorylated in intact tissue. The activity of the protein kinase was controlled in a circadian fashion. During normal diurnal cycles, kinase activity appeared between 4 and 5 h after the onset of darkness and disappeared 2-3 h before the end of darkness. Kinase activity displayed circadian oscillations in constant environmental conditions. The activity of protein phosphatase 2A, which dephosphorylates phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, did not oscillate. Treatment of detached leaves with the protein synthesis inhibitors puromycin and cycloheximide blocked the nocturnal appearance of the protein kinase activity, maintained phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase in the dephosphorylated state and blocked the circadian rhythms of CO2 output that is observed in constant darkness and CO2-free air. The simplest explanation of the data is that there is a circadian rhythm in the synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase. 3aKalanchoe 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 3aCrassulacean acid metabolism 3aphosphorylation 3acircadian rhythm 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aCycloheximidexpharmacology 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aPeptide Mapping 2aPhosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylasexmetabolism 2aPhosphorylation 2aPlantsxenzymology 2aProtein Kinase Inhibitors 2aProtein Kinasesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aProtein Synthesis Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinases. 2aPuromycinxpharmacology 0aBryophyllum 0abryophyllum fedtschenkoi1 aNimmo, H.G.1 aFewson, C.A.1 aWilkins, M.B.0 tEMBO journal.g1991 Aug., v. 10, no. 8 p.2063-2068x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03162naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245015600126300001600282500001500298520199500313650001902308650001602327650001702343650002502360650001602385650002602401650002202427650001302449650001902462650001502481650001202496650002102508653001402529653001402543653001102557700001402568700001502582773009002597852000902687930003302696946001102729655001202740IND8905167420221118211504.0890919e198906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890516742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraus, J.L.14aThe effect of changing sowing date on leaf structure and gas exchange characteristics of wheat flag leaves grown under Mediterranean climate conditions  ap. 639-646.  a2019-12-04  aComparisons of leaf structure and gas exchange characteristics have been made flag leaves of four old genotypes of cultivated tetraploid wheats and three current varieties of hexaploid Triticum aestivum grown under Mediterranean climate conditions.

In the hexaploid wheat Kolibri the effect of sowing date on leaf structure and gas exchange of the penultimate leaf was also studied. Flag leaves differed significantly in photosynthetic capacity and leaf structure characteristics between genotypes, within each ploidy level. When the mean values for each ploidy level were considered, there were no significant differences in values for photosynthesis per unit leaf area, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration, residual CO2 conductance and water-use efficiency between the tetraploid and hexaploid wheats sown on the same date. When comparisons were made of leaf structure the only significant differences observed were in adaxial and abaxial stomatal frequencies and leaf area: mean values of these parameters were higher in tetraploid than in hexaploid wheats. The changes in leaf structure in response to varying sowing date were significant and followed the same pattern in all the genotypes studied: a xeromorphic adaptation was observed in later sowings in response to warmer climate. Such structural changes affected some gas exchange characteristics. For example, the area of flag leaves decreased by 60% in the hexaploid wheat Kolibri from first to last sowing, which led to a transpirative loss of 49% per single leaf, in spite of the fact that transpiration rate per unit leaf area inceased by 26%. Penultimate leaves of cv. Kolibri followed a fairly similar adaptive pattern in later sowings as compared with flag leaves. The adaptive significance of changes in leaf structure and gas exchange characteristics with varying sowing date under Mediterranean climate conditions is discussed. 3acarbon dioxide 3asowing date 3agas exchange 3awater use efficiency 3atetraploidy 3aMediterranean climate 3aTriticum aestivum 3agenotype 3aphotosynthesis 3ahexaploidy 3astomata 3aleaf conductance 0astructure 0aflag leaf 0aleaves1 aTapia, L.1 aAlegre, L.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1989 June, v. 40, no. 215 p.639-646x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03183naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002400111040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171100001800180245012100198300001600319500002400335500001500359520127400374650002501648650002301673650002301696650003401719650002601753650001901779650002701798650002001825650003701845650001201882650002601894650001101920650002801931650002701959650002701986650000902013650003702022650003102059650003502090650001602125653001402141700001502155700001802170700002002188773011002208852000902318856007402327856011102401930003302512945001302545946001102558655001202569IND2324917420221118211336.0020118e200109  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232491742DNAL7 a115614092pmid7 a10.1002/ps.3682doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL600 0aL0011 aDe Lame, F.M.10aSex-related differences in the tolerance of Oriental fruit moth (Grapholita molesta) to organophosphate insecticides  ap. 827-832.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn vivo toxicity assays have shown that organophosphate insecticides are less toxic to male than to female Oriental fruit moths Grapholita molesta. While male moths have higher levels of acetylcholinesterase and general esterase activities, female moth acetylcholinesterase enzymes are less sensitive to aromatic and aliphatic organophosphates than male enzymes. Elevated esterase and acetylcholinesterase activities in male moths explain their greater tolerance to aromatic and aliphatic organophosphates. Male and female acetylcholinesterase enzymes are equally tolerant to heteroaromatic organophosphates, the most widely used of this class of insecticides in G molesta control. This observation, in contrast to the greater sensitivity of male acetylcholinesterases to aromatic and aliphatic organophosphates, shows the potential for the evolution of insensitive target sites in male moths, which would increase male G molesta tolerance to these insecticides. Significant sex-linked differences in insecticide tolerance have not been reported previously in lepidopterans. The practical implications of the observed differences in tolerance in male and female G molesta question the practice of using pheromone traps to monitor populations of these moths in orchards. 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aGrapholita molesta 3agender differences 3aorganophosphorus insecticides 3aresistance management 3ainsect control 3ainsecticide resistance 3aenzyme activity 2aAcetylcholinesterasexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aEsterasesxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aInsect Controlxmethods 2aInsecticide Resistance 2aInsecticidesxtoxicity 2aMale 2aMothsxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aOrganophosphorus Compounds 2aOrganothiophosphorus Compounds 2aSex Factors 0aesterases1 aHong, J.J.1 aShearer, P.W.1 aBrattsten, L.B.0 tPest management science.g2001 Sept., v. 57, no. 9 p.827-832dPublished for SCI by Wileyx1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.3683Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1526-4998/issues3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02308naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245013600147300001800283520100300301650001001304650001701314650002101331650002401352650002001376650001801396650001101414650002501425650001201450650002801462650000901490650002201499650003001521650001601551650008801567650004401655653002201699700001401721773008401735852000901819939003301828946001301861655001201874IND9201476520221118211317.0920316e199108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920147652DNAL7 a19185452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHidiroglou, M.10aPlasma alpha-tocopherol profiles in sheep after oral administration of dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate and d-alpha-tocopheryl succinate  ap. 2718-2723.  aThe purpose of this study was to compare the bioavailability of dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate and d-alpha-tocopheryl succinate when administered to sheep in a single oral dose weekly. The sheep, five per treatment, were given a basal diet without vitamin E supplement (control) or basal diet with weekly administration of 2225 IU of dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate, 2225 IU of d-alpha-tocopheryl succinate, or 6675 IU of d-alpha-tocopheryl succinate. Increases in plasma alpha-tocopherol concentration levels over the 3-wk period of study were determined and compared. The greater availability of dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate was indicated by the significantly higher peak plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrations and the greater area under the curve produced by administration of the acetate than the succinate esters at the same dosage. Reported data on plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrations suggest that bioavailability in sheep of d-alpha-tocopheryl succinate versus dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate is 3:1. 3asheep 3ablood plasma 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aoral administration 3abioavailability 3asuccinic acid 3aesters 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aBiological Availability 2aMale 2aRandom Allocation 2aSheepxbloodxmetabolism. 2aTocopherols 2aVitamin Exadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivativesxbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aalpha-Tocopherolxanalogs & derivatives 0aacetates (esters)1 aSingh, K.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1991 Aug., v. 74, no. 8 p.2718-2723x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02353naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245008900145300001800234520104200252650001901294650001501313650001201328650001601340650002601356650002401382650001701406650002401423650001401447650001201461650003201473650001801505650002101523650002901544650001101573650002601584650005001610650004101660650003901701700001601740773008401756852000901840939003301849946001301882655001201895IND9201477520221118211445.0920316e199108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920147752DNAL7 a18334242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurner, J.D.10aRole of tissue remodeling in mammary epithelial cell proliferation and morphogenesis  ap. 2801-2807.  aLactation is a physiological process characterized by the secretion of large quantities of protein, carbohydrate, and lipid. To achieve the production, the mammary gland must grow and then differentiate; both processes require extensive tissue remodeling. Remodeling begins with a carefully controlled proteolysis of the extracellular matrix and cell-cell adhesion proteins. Plasmin is a serine protease that has been implicated in the tissue remodeling associated with the declining phase of lactation and mammary involution. As lactation progresses, the quantity of plasmin activity increases within the mammary tissue and milk. This has led to the hypothesis that gradual involution results from progressive tissue remodeling. Hormonal attenuation of gradual involution by bST would slow tissue remodeling and would be permissive for lactation. In vitro results indicate that insulin-like growth factor-I impairs the secretion of plasminogen activator by bovine mammary epithelial cells. As such, a mechanism of action for bST exists. 3amammary glands 3aepithelium 3aplasmin 3aplasminogen 3aplasminogen activator 3ahormonal regulation 3asomatotropin 3amechanism of action 3alactation 2aAnimals 2aBreast Neoplasmsxpathology 2aCell Division 2aEpithelial Cells 2aFibrinolysinxphysiology 2aHumans 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMammary Glands, Animalxcytologyxphysiology. 2aMammary Neoplasms, Animalxpathology 2aPlasminogen Activatorsxphysiology1 aHuynh, H.T.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1991 Aug., v. 74, no. 8 p.2801-2807x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02312naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009600128300001800224520146800242650001501710650001301725650000901738650000901747650000901756650002101765651001101786651001501797653001701812700001801829773008401847852000901931939003301940946001301973655001201986IND9201477120221118212205.0920316e199108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920147712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShapiro, L.S.10aRelationships among rump and rear leg type traits and reproductive performance in Holsteins  ap. 2767-2773.  aRelationships between rump angle; rump width; rear legs, side view; rear legs, position; rear legs, rear view; and foot angle with days open and services per conception were investigated in Holstein cows to develop indices to predict reproductive performance. Registered and grade cows (n = 8155) were analyzed separately to determine whether differences in management style affected those relationships. Evaluator, parity, season, geographic location, and the interaction of evaluator and parity had significant effects on most of the type traits examined. Correlations between body characteristics and reproductive efficiency were very low to nonexistent. Milk yield had the highest correlation with both days open and times bred. Stepwise regression eliminated all body traits except rump width and foot angle. Only 5.3% of the variability in days open and 4.7% of the variability in times bred in registered cows were accounted for by the type traits, foot angle, and rump width when the effects of season calved, geographic locations, parity, and mature equivalent milk were included in the model. For the grade cows, only 3.5% of the variability in days open was accounted for by the type trait, foot angle, when the environmental effects were included in the model. There was no significant effect of any of the type traits on times bred in grade cows.

The presence of concentrations up to 25 mM progressively stimulated the fungal growth rate, which was negligible in media lacking reduced nitrogen. However, glyphosate utilization never exceeded 1 mmol g-1 mycelial dry mass, and below a threshold concentration both herbicide uptake and fungal growth were subject to a lag phase, suggesting that the herbicide may enter the cell by either simple passive diffusion or inducible carriers. Amino acids, possible products of glyphosate breakdown, as well as ammonia, were found to replace the herbicide in restoring mycelial growth. Cells were devoid of detectable nitrate reductase activity, thus the isolate seems to be impaired in its ability to convert nitrate to ammonium. In vitro activity of 5-enol-pyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase, the target site of glyphosate action, was highly sensitive to the herbicide. Fungal growth rate was considerably lower when the herbicide was also the only phosphorus source, whereas glyphosate utilization was substantially unaffected, suggesting an unusual route for its degradation. Herbicide metabolism was strongly reduced when other sources of organic nitrogen were made available. 3aglyphosate 3ametabolism 3aenzyme activity 3aPenicillium chrysogenum 2a3-Phosphoshikimate 1-Carboxyvinyltransferase 2aAlkyl and Aryl Transferasesxmetabolism 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aGlycinexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aHerbicidesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aMyceliumxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aNitrate Reductase 2aNitrate Reductasesxmetabolism 2aNitratesxmetabolism 2aNitrogen Compoundsxmetabolism 2aPenicillium chrysogenumxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPhosphorus Compoundsxmetabolism 2aTime Factors 0agrowth rate 0auptake1 aLejczak, B.1 aKafarski, P.1 aForlani, G.0 tPest management science.g2001 Sept., v. 57, no. 9 p.815-821dPublished for SCI by Wileyx1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.3663Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1526-4998/issues3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02508naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245005900158300001600217520122900233650001401462650001801476650001701494650002101511650001601532650002001548650001701568650002101585650001701606650001401623650002201637650001701659650001601676651001501692653001701707653001301724700001601737700001501753700001501768700001401783700001201797700002001809700001101829773007201840852000901912930003301921945002501954946001101979655001201990IND4377877020221118212138.0060214e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437787702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aYao, L.H.10aPhenolic compounds in tea from Australian supermarkets  ap. 614-620.  aPhenolic compounds constitute 50-70% of tea water extract and are the main quality parameters for teas. Theaflavins (TF), thearubigins (TR) and theabrownins (TB) are the major polyphenols that determine the quality of black tea. These compounds were measured in 56 leaf teas and teabags sampled from Australian supermarkets in Queensland. The various quantities of TF, ranging from 0.29% to 1.25%, indicate a quality difference that exists among the teas studied. Low TF content in black tea may be due to over-fermenting and/or long periods of storage. The solubility of TR and TB from teabags ranged from 82% to 92%, indicating that the permeability of teabags was variable. Variable quantities of TF in Australian teas show instability and a tendency of TF to oxidize during storage. Total polyphenols in green teas ranged from 14% to 34%, indicating a large variation, which was not reflected in price. The solubility of total polyphenols from teabags has been proposed as a useful quality index of the filtering paper used for the teabags. This chemical analysis of phenolic compounds in commercial teas may be a potential tool for the quality control of Australian manufactured and imported teas in Australian markets. 3ablack tea 3afood analysis 3afood quality 3afood composition 3atheaflavins 3astorage quality 3afermentation 3awater solubility 3apermeability 3agreen tea 3achemical analysis 3asupermarkets 3athearubigen 3aQueensland 0atheabrownins 0atea bags1 aJiang, Y.M.1 aCaffin, N.1 aD'Arcy, B.1 aDatta, N.1 aLiu, X.1 aSinganusong, R.1 aXu, Y.0 tFood chemistry.g2006 June, v. 96, no. 4 p.614-620x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20060622b20060702c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/05/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03834naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002400111040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171100002200180245019200202300001600394500002400410520160300434650003402037650002802071650001302099650002002112650002902132650001102161650001002172650002102182650001202203650001802215650002402233650004102257650005102298650005202349650002702401650001702428650001302445650004502458650003702503650002102540650002402561650001302585650004402598650003102642650004802673700002302721700001802744700001902762700003102781773010902812852000902921856007402930856011103004930003303115945001303148946001103161655001203172IND2324915120221118211100.0020118e200106  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232491512DNAL7 a114070252pmid7 a10.1002/ps.3232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aH000 0aL810 0aL0011 aKostaropoulos, I.14aThe role of glutathione S-transferases in the detoxification of some organophosphorus insecticides in larvae and pupae of the yellow mealworm, Tenebrio molitor (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae)  ap. 501-508.  aIncludes references  aThe correlation between the natural levels of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the tolerance to the organophosphorus insecticides parathion-methyl and paraoxon-methyl, as well as the interaction of affinity-purified enzyme and the insecticides were investigated in order to collect further information on the role of the glutathione S-transferase system as a mechanism of defence against insecticides in insects. The studies were carried out on the larvae and pupae of the coleopteran Tenebrio molitor L, which exhibit varying natural levels of GST activity. Stage-dependent susceptibility of the insect against insecticides was observed during the first 24 h. However, 48 h after treatment, the KD50 value increased significantly due to the recovery of some individuals. Simultaneous injection of insecticide with compounds which inhibit GST activity in vitro caused an alteration in susceptibility of insects 24 or 48 h post-treatment, depending on stage and insecticide used. Inhibition studies combined with competitive fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the insecticides probably bind to the active site of the enzyme, thus inhibiting its activity towards 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene in a competitive manner. High-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography revealed that T molitor GST catalyses the conjugation of the insecticides studied to a reduced form of glutathione (GSH). From the above experimental results, it is considered that GST offers a protection against the organophosphorus insecticides studied by active site binding and subsequent conjugation with GSH. 3aorganophosphorus insecticides 3aglutathione transferase 3aisozymes 3aenzyme activity 3ametabolic detoxification 3alarvae 3apupae 3aTenebrio molitor 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites 2aChromatography, Gas 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDinitrochlorobenzenexantagonists & inhibitors 2aGlutathione Transferasexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aInsecticide Resistance 2aInsecticides 2aKinetics 2aLarvaxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aMalathionxanalogs & derivatives 2aMethyl Parathion 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aParaoxon 2aPupaxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 2aTenebrioxenzymologyxgrowth & development.1 aPapadopoulos, A.I.1 aMetaxakis, A.1 aBoukouvala, E.1 aPapadopoulou-Mourkidou, E.0 tPest management science.g2001 June, v. 57, no. 6 p.501-508dPublished for SCI by Wileyx1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.3233Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1526-4998/issues3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle03223naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245010000147300001400247520147500261650000801736650001301744650001701757650002801774650002601802650001701828650002801845650001601873650002901889650002501918650002701943650002801970650002101998650002302019650002802042650002802070650002302098650002402121650002502145650003802170650002502208650001102233650001902244650000902263650002102272650002502293651001602318653001102334700001602345700001702361700001802378700002202396700001902418773009402437852000902531930003302540945001302573946001102586655001202597IND2328691420221118211850.0020827e200201  uk |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232869142DNAL7 a118401822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoppitt, S.D.10aLipid-lowering effects of a modified butter-fat: a controlled intervention trial in healthy men  ap. 64-71.  aObjective: To investigate the lipid-lowering potential of a butter-fat modified through manipulations in bovine feeding to increase the unsaturated:saturated fatty acid ratio. Design: Double-blind, randomised, cross-over intervention trial. Setting: University of Auckland Human Nutrition Unit, New Zealand. Subjects: Twenty healthy, male subjects. Intervention: A residential trial in which all foods and beverages were provided during two intervention periods, comprising 3 weeks of high unsaturated 'modified' vs 3 weeks of saturated 'control' butter feeding separated by a 4 week washout. Diets were of typical composition of 39 percentage energy (en%) fat (20 en% butter-fat), 48 en% CHO, 13 en% protein. Results: There was a significant decrease in both total (P < 0.05, -7.9%) and LDL-cholesterol (P < 0.01, -9.5%) during modified butter feeding. There was no significant effect of treatment on a range of other risk factors including HDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, apolipoprotein A or B, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), haemostatic clotting factor VII and fibrinogen or glucose (P > 0.05). Subjects were maintained in energy balance and there was no significant change in body weight during intervention. Butter-fat composition alone differed between treatments. Conclusions: A significant improvement in cardiovascular risk can be achieved by moderate changes in dietary fatty acid profile, achieved through a common and well accepted food source, butter-fat. 3amen 3amilk fat 3ablood lipids 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3asaturated fatty acids 3arisk factors 3alow density lipoprotein 3acholesterol 3ahigh density lipoprotein 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aApolipoproteinsxblood 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aButterxanalysis 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFactor VIIxanalysis 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFibrinogenxanalysis 2aHumans 2aInsulinxblood 2aMale 2aReference Values 2aTriglyceridesxblood 3aNew Zealand 0aratios1 aKeogh, G.F.1 aMulvey, T.B.1 aMcArdle, B.H.1 aMacGibbon, A.K.H.1 aCooper, G.J.S.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2002 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.64-71x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01821naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245008700173300001800260520069000278650002000968650002700988650001201015650001601027650001901043650000901062650002701071650001401098651001301112700002601125700002201151700002401173773012101197852000901318856007601327930003301403946001101436655001201447IND4385466020221118211053.0061126e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438546602DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-8286.2006.01496.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aALVES, RAFAEL M.10aMicrosatellite loci transferability from Theobroma cacao to Theobroma grandiflorum  ap. 1219-1221.  aTheobroma grandiflorum (cupuassu) is an important fruit tree native to the Brazilian Amazon. Forty-eight microsatellite loci developed for the congener Theobroma cacao were tested in cupuassu, and 29 (60.4%) produced robust alleles. The analyses of 216 cupuassu accessions using the 21 polymorphic microsatellite loci revealed a total of 113 alleles. The number of alleles per polymorphic locus ranged from two to 11, with an average of 5.38 alleles per locus. The average observed heterozygosity was 0.343, while the mean expected heterozygosity was 0.614. The successful transferability of T. cacao microsatellite primers to cupuassu was consistent with currently accepted phylogeny. 3aTheobroma cacao 3aTheobroma grandiflorum 3aalleles 3afruit trees 3aheterozygosity 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphylogeny 3aAmazonia1 aSEBBENN, ALEXANDRE M.1 aARTERO, ANGELA S.1 aFigueira, António.0 tMolecular ecology notes.g2006 Dec., v. 6, no. 4 p.1219-1221dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1471-82787nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-8286.2006.01496.x3electronic resource  a20061126b20061202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02579naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100001700185245011600202300001600318500002400334500001500358520070300373650002001076650002401096650002001120650002701140650002101167650001401188650001101202650001201213650003201225650001501257650003201272650002601304650001501330650002501345650002801370650003001398650003901428650003001467650008201497650002701579650002201606653001301628653001701641653001801658700002101676773011401697852000901811856008801820930003301908945002501941946001101966655001201977IND4434841720221118210947.0100402e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443484172DNAL7 a201497922pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2010.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL822 0aL8101 aBeckmann, S.10aImatinib has a fatal impact on morphology, pairing stability and survival of adult Schistosoma mansoni in vitro  ap. 521-526.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSchistosomes cause bilharzia (schistosomiasis), one of the most prevalent parasitic diseases for human and animals worldwide.

Since a vaccine is not yet available, and in light of emerging resistance against PZQ, the search for alternatives has high priority. Here we present that Imatinib, a compound used in human cancer therapy (Gleevec; STI-571), significantly affected schistosome morphology and physiology in vitro. Besides its negative effect on gonad development and pairing stability, Imatinib led to pathological alterations of the gastrodermis, which finally caused the death of the parasite. 3aschistosomiasis 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3adrug evaluation 3aanatomy and morphology 3ain vitro studies 3amortality 3aadults 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxpharmacology 2aBenzamides 2aHelminth Proteinsxgenetics 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aMicroscopy 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPiperazinesxpharmacology 2aProtein-Tyrosine Kinasesxgenetics 2aPyrimidinesxpharmacology 2aSchistosoma mansonixanatomy & histologyxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSurvival Analysis 0aImatinib 0agastrodermis 0aadult animals1 aGrevelding, C.G.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2010 Apr., v. 40, no. 5 p.521-526dElsevier Sciencex0020-75197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2010.01.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100607b20100703c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/05/12  aNon-US 7aarticle01413naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245008800176300001800264520049000282650002800772650001200800650002700812650001200839700002200851773012100873852000900994856007601003930003301079946001101112655001201123IND4385466620221118210912.0061126e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438546662DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-8286.2006.01502.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSKALSKI, GARRICK T.10aCharacterization of microsatellite loci in the creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus)  ap. 1240-1242.  aThirty-two polymorphic microsatellite loci (29 novel, 3 cross-species) are characterized in the creek chub, Semotilus atromaculatus, a widespread and abundant North American minnow.

The blends were crystallized under the same isothermal conditions and the crystallized systems evaluated by DSC, SFC, polarized light microscopy, and rheology under low [i.e., G' and yield stress (σ*)] and high (i.e., creep and recovery profiles) stress forces. Overall, all trans-free blends showed lower SFC and heat of crystallization than the ones obtained with PH-SBO blends. These results showed that trans-fatty acids decrease the level of structural order of the crystals, and probably also the organization of the crystal network. As a result, most of the crystallized blends with PH-SBO showed lower σ* values and higher creep profiles (i.e., softer texture) than trans-free blends, particularly in systems crystallized at high supercooling and blends with saturated medium chain TAG. Nevertheless, at particular crystallization temperatures some trans-free formulations provided crystallized systems with rheological properties that would result in softer textures than the ones obtained with PH-SBO blends.

However, its use is limited primarily to container candles because of its inherent physical properties, such as brittleness when a hard material is produced, and greasiness when it is soft by low degree of hydrogenation. Such material lacks the most desired cohesiveness and elasticity compared to the commercial petroleum paraffin and beeswax. To improve the cohesiveness and thermal properties of PHVO, epoxidation, ring-opening reaction, and esterification were conducted to introduce new functional groups into the fatty acyl chain of PHVO. These newly synthesized derivatives or waxes were also mixed with the fully hydrogenated soybean oil (FHSO) or PHVO base materials. Hardness and cohesiveness of the new waxes and the mixtures were measured with a texture analyzer. Their thermal properties were analyzed with a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). It was found that the introduction of hydroxyl (OH) group significantly improved the cohesiveness of PHVO. The melting range of PHVO also increased after the reactions. However, the hardness of the new wax was lower than those of commercial paraffin wax or beeswax. For wax mixtures, the hardness of dihydroxy wax was significantly improved by the addition of FHSO, however, the cohesiveness was negatively affected by the amount of FHSO added. Both the melting and the crystallization ranges were widened by mixing the derivatives with the base materials. 3asoybean oil 3avegetable oil 3acohesion 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3amelting point 3ahydrogenation 3awaxes 3athermal properties 0aplant products1 aWang, Tong0 tjournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2007 Dec., v. 84, no. 12 p.1149-1159dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-007-1147-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20080114b20080202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/01/14  aOther US 7aarticle02430naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092024002200118024001900140040001800159100001800177245008900195300001600284506007600300520100400376506003701380650001701417650001701434650001901451650002101470650002101491650001801512650002301530650006601553650002701619650002101646650001301667650001601680700002301696700002501719773011101744852000901855856007601864939003301940946001101973655001201984IND4450616820221207095414.0110311e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445061682DNAL7 a10.1002/jms.18902doi7 aPMC39036542pmcid7 a213948452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Xiaoxia12aA mass spectrometric analysis of 4-hydroxy-2-(E)-nonenal modificationof cytochrome c  ap. 290-297.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCytochrome c is a key mitochondrial respiratory protein that is particularly susceptible to modification during oxidative stress. The nature of this susceptibility is linked to the mitochondrial membrane being rich in esterified linoleic acid, which predisposes this organelle to the formation of lipid peroxidation products such as 4-hydroxy-2-(E)-nonenal (4-HNE). To better understand the nature of cytochrome c modification by 4-HNE, we initiated an in vitro study utilizing a combination of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, LC-ESI-MS/MS and isotope labeling to monitor 4-HNE modification of cytochrome c under various conditions. The overwhelming reaction observed is Michael addition by Lys side-chains in addition to the modification of His 33. While the Lys-4-HNE adducts were generally observed to be reversible, the 4-HNE-His 33 was observed to be stable with half of the formed adduct surviving the denaturation and proteolysis protocols used to generate proteolytic peptides for LC-ESI-MS/MS.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acytochrome c 3adenaturation 3aesterification 3ain vitro studies 3aisotope labeling 3alinoleic acid 3alipid peroxidation 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3amitochondrial membrane 3aoxidative stress 3apeptides 3aproteolysis1 aSayre, Lawrence M.1 aTochtrop, Gregory P.0 tJournal of mass spectrometry.g2011 Mar., v. 46, no. 3 p.290-297dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1076-51747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jms.18903Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01538naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245005900176300001600235520067100251650002300922650002200945650002700967650001800994773011901012852000901131856007601140930003301216946001101249655001201260IND4385468320221118212416.0061126e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438546832DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-8286.2006.01419.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFAIRCLOTH, BRANT C.10aGMCONVERT: file conversion for genemapper output files  ap. 968-970.  aGMCONVERT is a platform-independent program provided in GUI (for Apple OS X and Windows XP) and command-line versions (for other platforms).

Similar evolution of physicochemical parameters and microbial population was observed in both uninoculated and inoculated sausages. The tested biotypes modified the volatile compound profile of sausages specially in esters, branched alcohols and aldehydes. The biotype of D. hansenii with the E mtDNA restriction pattern is the most suitable to be used as starter culture since it produced volatile compounds involved in flavour development of dry-cured meat products such as 3-methylbutanol, 3-methylbutanal and 2-propanone. Moreover, the use of D. hansenii strains with the B, C2 and E mtDNA restriction patterns, as a mixed starter culture, should be also considered to generate low amount of sulphur compounds in dry-cured meat products. 3asausages 3adried meat 3afermented foods 3atraditional foods 3astarter cultures 3aDebaryomyces hansenii 3ameat quality 3asensory evaluation 3avolatile compounds 3abiotypes 3ayeasts 3awater activity 3apH 3amicrobial growth 3aplate count 3ameat aging 3aselection criteria 2aAnimals 2aDNA, Fungal 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aFermentation 2aFood Handling 2aMeat Productsxanalysisxmicrobiology. 2aSwine 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aYeastsxgeneticsxphysiology. 3aSpain1 aCórdoba, Juan José1 aCasado, Eva Ma1 aCórdoba, María G.1 aRodríguez, Mar0 tMeat science.g2010 June, v. 85, no. 2 p.256-264dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2010.01.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20100423b20100501c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/04/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02947naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177100001600186245008000202300001600282500002400298500001500322520111800337650002601455650002601481650001601507650001201523650001301535650001901548650001301567650001001580650002301590650001901613650002001632650001701652650001201669650001301681650002101694650002001715650001301735650005601748650004601804651001801850651001001868651001001878651001801888653002801906653001801934700001501952700001401967700001701981700001501998700001702013773008802030852000902118856008902127930003302216945002502249946001102274655001202285IND4434853020221118212325.0100402e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443485302DNAL7 a203749002pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2010.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aE7001 aSuekawa, Y.10aDevelopment of breed identification markers based on a bovine 50K SNP array  ap. 285-288.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn Japan, Japanese Black and Holstein cattle are appreciated as popular sources of meat, and imported beef from Australia and the United States is also in demand in the meat industry. Since the BSE outbreak, the problem of false sales has arisen: imported beef has sometimes been mislabeled as domestic beef due to consumer concerns. A method is needed to correctly discriminate between Japanese and imported cattle for food safety. The objective of this study was to develop breed discrimination markers between Japanese and US cattle using a 50K SNP array. As a result, five US-specific markers (BISNP7, BISNP15, BISNP21, BISNP23, and BISNP26) were developed with allelic frequencies that ranged from 0.102 (BISNP15) to 0.250 (BISNP7) and averaged 0.184. The combined use of the five markers would permit discrimination between Japanese and US cattle with a probability of identification of 0.858. This result indicates the potential of the bovine 50K SNP array as a powerful tool for developing breed identification markers. These markers would contribute to the prevention of falsified beef displays in Japan. 3adiscriminant analysis 3amicroarray technology 3abeef cattle 3aimports 3aHolstein 3agene frequency 3agenotype 3aWagyu 3aselection criteria 3abreeding lines 3agenetic markers 3atraceability 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCattlexgenetics 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenotype 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysisxveterinary 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotidexgenetics 3aUnited States 3aJapan 0aJapan 0aUnited States 0amolecular sequence data 0acattle breeds1 aAihara, H.1 aAraki, M.1 aHosokawa, D.1 aMannen, H.1 aSasazaki, S.0 tMeat science.g2010 June, v. 85, no. 2 p.285-288dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2010.01.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20100423b20100501c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/04/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02323naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100001700154245010600171300001400277500002400291520124500315650001801560650001401578650002201592650001501614650001501629650003101644700001501675773011801690852000901808856008501817930003301902945002501935946001301960655001201973IND4399392420221118212959.0071226e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439939242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-007-1159-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aYao, Linxing10aMelting Points and Viscosities of Fatty Acid Esters that are Potential Targets for Engineered Oilseed  ap. 77-82.  aIncludes references  aOur previous isolation of branched-chain fatty acid (BCFA) methyl esters from lanolin was improved and scaled up. Also, oleate esters of isopropanol, oleyl alcohol and normal alcohols of 1-12 carbons chain lengths were prepared. Esters were made by interesterification with sodium alcoholates and by esterification with Candida antarctica lipase. It proved easier to obtain pure esters by the enzymatic synthesis. Melting points and viscosities over the range of 0-70 °C were determined in order to better identify potential lubricant targets that might be produced by genetically modified oilseed crops. Isopropyl and butyl oleate have melting points of -33 and -32 °C, respectively and viscosities that range from ~17 cp (0 °C) to ~2.5 cp (70 °C). They should have suitable stability for lubricants. BCFA esters had viscosities similar to their straight chain analogs. Viscosities increased with alcohol chain length and decreased with temperature. The dependence of viscosity on temperature was fit with an equation based on Erying's rate equation. Some esters with branched acid or branched alcohol moieties, and some oleate esters might be utilized as biolubricants or biofuels on the basis of their melting points and viscosities. 3amelting point 3aviscosity 3afatty acid esters 3aoleic acid 3alubricants 3abranched chain fatty acids1 aWang, Tong0 tjournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2008 Jan., v. 85, no. 1 p.77-82dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-007-1159-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20080410b20080502c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/04/10  aOther US 7aarticle03053naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176072000900185072000900194100003100203245009900234300001600333500002400349500001500373520134400388650000901732650001001741650001501751650001901766650002101785650001301806650001401819650001901833650002301852650003401875650001701909650002101926650001201947650001601959650001901975650002501994650002202019650001502041650002302056650001602079650001702095650001002112653002802122700002202150773008802172852000902260856008902269930003302358945002502391946001102416655001202427IND4434852920221118213456.0100402e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443485292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2010.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ112 0aQ302 0aQ202 0aQ402 0aQ502 0aQ1021 aSchirmer, Bjørn Christian12aA dissolving CO₂ headspace combined with organic acids prolongs the shelf-life of fresh pork  ap. 280-284.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this paper was to evaluate the effect of a novel CO₂ packaging method in combination with organic acids on the microbial growth in fresh pork meat. Fresh pork fillet was packed with a small amount of 100% CO₂ (initial gas/product ratio 0.2/1.0) and a brine solution containing citric acid (3% w/w, pH 5), acetic acid (1% w/w, pH 5) or a combination of both. Microbial counts and composition in the product were determined. CO₂, citric acid and acetic acid each reduced total growth after four weeks of storage and delayed the onset of microbial growth. Combinations of treatments increased the effects and microbial growth in samples packed with a combination of CO₂ and both acids was negligible even after 35days. However, the addition of citric acid to the packages led to significant precipitation in the brine. Analysis of the bacterial flora showed that lactic-acid bacteria dominated the flora in samples packed with CO₂ while vacuum-packed samples contained high numbers of Pseudomonas sp. and yeast. As all CO₂ dissolved in the product within hours after packaging, the outer appearance of the package was that of a vacuum-package. As a result, this novel packaging method combined the advantages of modified atmosphere packaging (antimicrobial effect of CO₂) and vacuum packaging (low space requirement). 3apork 3agases 3ashelf life 3afood packaging 3amicrobial growth 3araw meat 3ameat cuts 3acarbon dioxide 3asensory evaluation 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3afood storage 3avacuum packaging 3abrining 3acitric acid 3amicrobial load 3aappearance (quality) 3afood preservation 3amarinating 3afood preservatives 3aacetic acid 3ameat quality 3acolor 0aorganic acids and salts1 aLangsrud, Solveig0 tMeat science.g2010 June, v. 85, no. 2 p.280-284dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2010.01.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20100423b20100501c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/04/23  aNon-US 7aarticle01848naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245012000177300001800297520071200315650003001027650001201057650004301069650002001112650002201132650001901154650000901173650002701182650001401209650002501223773012101248852000901369856007601378930003301454946001101487655001201498IND4385464820221118213501.0061126e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438546482DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-8286.2006.01483.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGRAPPUTO, ALESSANDRO10aDevelopment and characterization of microsatellite markers in the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata  ap. 1177-1179.  aThe characterization of 11 Leptinotarsa decemlineata microsatellite loci isolated using the fast isolation by AFLP of sequences containing repeats (FIASCO) protocol is reported.

Cellulose triacetate was used as the matrix for entrapping the mixed microbial cells. The EMMC process was tested with various oxygen supply conditions (ratios of aeration to non-aeration times) and two types of carrier sizes (large and medium). Also, various pre-treatments with chemical coagulation, screen separation and ammonium crystallization prior to the EMMC process, and post-treatment after the EMMC process were investigated. It was found that at a hydraulic retention time of 30 h and one hour of aeration and one hour of non-aeration, the EMMC process packed with medium carriers after the pre-treatment of ammonium crystallization, exhibited the best total nitrogen removal efficiency of 95.1 +/- 1.0% when compared to the other two pre-treatment methods. The total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) and soluble chemical oxygen demand removal efficiencies were 83.5 +/- 2.2% and 84.1 +/- 1.1%, respectively. Lime post-treatment provided TCOD and total phosphorus removal efficiencies of 59.6 +/- 2.7% and 98.0 +/- 0.5%, respectively. Thus, a cost analysis for ammonium crystallization pre-treatment, EMMC process, and post-treatment with lime was conducted. The unit cost for a 2000 pig operation is approximately equal to $4.91/pig/year. For the application of the EMMC process with the proposed pre- and post-treatments, a suitable farm size needs to be greater than a 2000 pig operation. Because of the high efficiency and the simple operation of simultaneous carbon and nitrogen removal, the EMMC process has the potential for treatment of dilute swine wastewater in a land-limited area and can be manufactured as pre-fabricated wastewater treatment units. 3aaeration 3acarbon 3acellulose 3achemical oxygen demand 3acoagulation 3acost analysis 3acrystallization 3afarm size 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3aswine 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 2aAnimals 2aBacteria 2aBioreactors 2aCarbonxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aCosts and Cost Analysis 2aNitrogenxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aOxygen 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxchemistry 2aSwine 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxeconomicsxmethods. 0apiggery effluent1 aChen, H.J.1 aKim, S.J.0 tBioresource technology.g2003 Feb., v. 86, no. 3 p.245-252x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02774naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245016700143300001600310520132900326650002001655650002301675650002001698650001901718650001301737650001501750650001801765650001901783650001201802650002101814650000901835650002901844650001301873650002801886650000901914650000901923650002101932650002801953650001601981650002301997650004402020650000902064650002102073700001602094773008002110852000902190930003302199945001302232946001102245655001202256IND2331926820221118212946.0030411e200302  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233192682DNAL7 a126884702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiran, U.10aMedicinal and aromatic plant materials as nitrification inhibitors for augmenting yield and nitrogen uptake of Japanese mint (Mentha arvensis L. var.

Their effect on the efficiencies of use of N by Japanese mint (Mentha arvensis cv. Hy 77) was tested. Urea was coated with these materials viz., Mentha spicata, Artemisia annua or DCD at the rate of 5% (w/w) of fertilizer urea using an appropriate coating technique. Nimin (tetranortriterpenoids, an ethanol extract of neem (Azadirachta indica Juss) coating was done at the rate of 1% w/w of urea. Fertilizer nitrogen was applied at 100 and 200 mg kg(-1) soil. These natural coating materials significantly increased the herb and essential oil yields of the crop at both rates of fertilizer nitrogen compared to urea alone and were found to be as effective as DCD in retarding NO3(-) formation in soil. Herb yield increased by 6-81% when compared to uncoated urea. The increase in essential oil yield ranged between 3% and 68% due to coating. The effectiveness of the nitrification-inhibitor-coated urea, however, varied with the soils used and the rate of fertilizer nitrogen applied. The results suggest that the natural products could be potential nitrification inhibitors for increasing fertilizer N use efficiency. 3aArtemisia annua 3aAzadirachta indica 3aMentha arvensis 3aMentha spicata 3acoatings 3acrop yield 3adicyandiamide 3aessential oils 3aethanol 3afertilizer rates 3amint 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3asoil 3aurea 3aurea fertilizers 2aBiological Availability 2aFertilizers 2aMenthaxphysiology 2aNitrogenxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aSoil 2aUreaxmetabolism1 aPatra, D.D.0 tBioresource technology.g2003 Feb., v. 86, no. 3 p.267-276x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02826naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245008900148300001600237520126300253650002201516650002101538650002801559650001201587650002501599650001101624650002301635650002201658650002001680650001301700650002101713650001101734650001101745650002001756650002601776650001201802650001101814650001601825650001201841650003501853650001601888650002201904650001801926650002301944650002801967650002701995650001302022700001902035700001802054700001802072773008002090852000902170930003302179945001302212946001102225655001202236IND2331927220221118212312.0030411e200302  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233192722DNAL7 a126884712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEruvbetine, D.10aCassava (Manihot esculenta) leaf and tuber concentrate in diets for broiler chickens  ap. 277-281.  aExperiment 1 was conducted to determine the nutritive quality of cassava tuber leaf concentrate prepared either by mixing cassava tubers and leaves together before grinding or grinding them separately before mixing. Three mixing proportions of 50:50, 60:40 and 80:20 were used. Samples were subjected to either sundrying or oven drying. Physical examination of samples, proximate analysis and cyanide content of each of the samples were determined. In experiment 2 the sample of highest nutritive value was selected for inclusion in four diets at levels of 0%, 10%, 20% and 30% respectively. A total of 120 day-old broilers were divided into four groups and each group further into three subgroups. The four experimental diets were fed to each of the groups for a period of 9 weeks. Growth parameters, carcass characteristics and haematological parameters were also determined. Results showed that in experiment 1 the grinding together of cassava tubers and leaves in the proportion of 50:50 before sun-drying gave the best texture, highest CP content with low HCN content. Inclusion of 10% cassava concentrate gave good performance in terms of growth and feed conversion, with no detrimental effects on haematological parameters and carcass characteristics. 3aManihot esculenta 3abroiler chickens 3acarcass characteristics 3acassava 3aclinical examination 3adrying 3aexperimental diets 3afeed concentrates 3afeed conversion 3agrinding 3ahydrogen cyanide 3aleaves 3amixing 3anutritive value 3aproximate composition 3atexture 3atubers 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aChickensxgrowth & development 2aDesiccation 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFood Handling 2aManihotxchemistry 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aPlant Rootsxchemistry 2aSunlight1 aTajudeen, I.D.1 aAdeosun, A.T.1 aOlojede, A.A.0 tBioresource technology.g2003 Feb., v. 86, no. 3 p.277-281x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03363naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001600150245011200166300001800278500002400296500001500320506007600335520134800411506003701759650002501796650001201821650001501833650001301848650002501861650002001886650002501906650001201931650001701943650001601960650002501976650003802001650001902039650001702058650005602075650003502131650001302166650001402179650005302193650003202246650002502278650003702303650002302340650002402363653001702387653001002404700001602414700002002430773015302450852000902603856005402612930003302666945001302699946001302712655001202725IND2324973820221207113636.0020123e200107  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232497382DNAL7 a114579752pmid7 aPMC1164812pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTseng, T.S.10aEctopic expression of the tetratricopeptide repeat domain of SPINDLY causes defects in gibberellin response  ap. 1250-1258.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe SPINDLY (SPY) protein of Arabidopsis is a negative regulator of gibberellin (GA) response. The SPY protein has 10 copies of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) at the N terminus. TPR motifs function as protein-protein interaction domains. Several spy alleles are affected only in the TPR region suggesting that protein-protein interactions mediated by this domain are important for proper GA signaling. We have used a reverse genetics approach to further investigate the role of the TPR domain. The TPR domain of SPY was overexpressed in wild-type, gai, and spy plants. Expression of the TPR domain alone is not sufficient to rescue spy mutants. Expression of the TPR domain in a wild-type background produces phenotypes similar to those caused by loss-of-function spy mutants including resistance to GA biosynthesis inhibitors, short hypocotyl length, and early flowering. The dwarfing of the floral shoot internodes caused by the gai mutation was suppressed by expression of the TRP domain. Expression of the TPR domain had no effect on the abundance of endogenous SPY mRNA. The TPR domain was found to interact with SPY both in vitro and in yeast two-hybrid assays. These data indicate that the TPR domain of SPY can participate in protein-protein interactions and that these interactions are important for the proper functioning of SPY.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aalleles 3ahypocotyls 3apeptides 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3abiochemical pathways 3amutants 3agibberellins 2aArabidopsis 2aArabidopsis Proteins 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Silencing 2aGenes, Plant 2aGibberellinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aHypocotylxanatomy & histology 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aRecombinant Proteins 2aRepetitive Sequences, Amino Acid 2aRepressor Proteins 2aSignal Transduction 0ainteractions 0agenes1 aSwain, S.M.1 aOlszewski, N.E.0 tPlant physiology.g2001 July, v. 126, no. 3 p.1250-1258dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02326naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001800136245011900154300001600273520101700289650001601306650001501322650003101337650001001368650001901378650001501397650002201412650001801434650002801452650003301480650001301513700002201526700002101548700001601569700002701585700001901612700002101631773011101652852000901763856007601772939003301848946001101881655001201892IND4450616420221120134246.0110311e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445061642DNAL7 a10.1002/jms.18882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaftan, Filip10aScanning electron microscopic imaging of surface effects in desorption and nano-desorption electrospray ionization  ap. 256-261.  aScanning electron microscopy was used to investigate rivulets that are formed on the analyzed surface during desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) experiment. Ferromagnetic nanoparticles added to the spray solvent in a form of colloid solution functioned as an additional surface probe. The existence of the rivulets was confirmed on glass and newly demonstrated on two different types of porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The results show that in standard DESI set-up the rivulets are arranged into very regular shapes. Same rivulets were obtained in DESI experiments without high voltage on the sprayer. However, no such rivulets or any other regular patterns were found on a surface in nano-DESI (nanospray DESI without the carrier nebulizing gas) experiments. This indicates that symmetrical rivulets are created by the hydrodynamical rather than electrostatic forces. It was also demonstrated that blocking the rivulets by a simple physical barrier did not influence known surface charging effects. 3aatomization 3adesorption 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aglass 3aimage analysis 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3ananoparticles 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents1 aKofroňová, Olga1 aBenada, Oldřich1 aLemr, Karel1 aHavlíček, Vladimír.1 aCvačka, Josef1 aVolný, Michael.0 tJournal of mass spectrometry.g2011 Mar., v. 46, no. 3 p.256-261dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1076-51747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jms.18883Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03120naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001900136245007800155300001600233520164100249650003001890650001201920650001301932650001501945650002001960650001901980650001901999650001502018650006602033650001802099650002102117650001802138650002002156650001302176650001402189700002902203700001902232700001902251700001702270700001802287700001802305700002202323700002902345773011102374852000902485856007602494939003302570946001102603655001202614IND4450616320221120134350.0110311e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445061632DNAL7 a10.1002/jms.18872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yuling.10aTagging saccharides for signal enhancement in mass spectrometric analysis  ap. 247-255.  aMALDI-MS provides a rapid and sensitive analysis of large biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. However, oligo- and polysaccharides are less sensitive in MS analysis partly due to their neutral and hydrophilic nature to cause low ionization efficiency. In this study, four types of oligosaccharides including aldoses, aminoaldoses, alduronic acids and α-keto acids were modified by appropriate tags at the reducing termini to improve their ionization efficiency. Bradykinin (BK), a vasoactive nonapeptide (RPPGFSPFR), containing two arginine and two phenylalanine residues turned out to be an excellent MS signal enhancer for maltoheptaose, GlcNAc oligomers and oligogalacturonic acids. In the MALDI-TOF-MS analysis using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHB) as the matrix, the GalA4-BK and GalA5-BK conjugates prepared by reductive amination showed the detection limit at 0.1 fmol, i.e. ∼800-fold enhancement over the unmodified pentagalacturonic acids. The remarkable MS enhancement was attributable to the synergistic effect of the basic arginine residues for high proton affinity and the hydrophobic property phenylalanine residues for facile ionization. A tetrapeptide GFGR(OMe) and an arginine linked phenylenediamine (H₂N)₂Ph-R(OMe) were thus designed to act as potent tags of oligosaccharides in MS analysis. Interestingly, concurrent condensation and lactonization of α2,8-linked tetrasialic acid (SA4) was carried out with (H₂N)₂Ph-R(OMe) to obtain a quinoxalinone derivative, which showed > 200-fold enhancement over unmodified SA4 in the MALDI-TOF-MS analysis.

Here we explore an alternative: DNA-based identification. We obtained a plastid rbcL sequence from a sterile gametophyte of unknown origin (cultivated for more than 30 years) and employed [smallcapital blast] to determine its affinities. Using this approach, we identified the gametophyte as Osmunda regalis. To evaluate the robustness of this determination, and the usefulness of rbcL in differentiating among species, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of osmundaceous fern sequences. Based on our results, it is evident that DNA-based identification has considerable potential in exploring the ecology of fern gametophytes. 3aDNA 3aOsmunda regalis 3aecology 3aferns and fern allies 3agametophytes 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase1 aSCHUETTPELZ, ERIC0 tMolecular ecology notes.g2006 Dec., v. 6, no. 4 p.989-991dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1471-82787nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-8286.2006.01424.x3electronic resource  a20061126b20061202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03034naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245011500191300001600306520145600322650002001778650001801798650002701816650002201843650003301865650002301898650001801921650003001939650002401969650004101993650002302034650003502057650005202092653002402144653001002168653001602178700002202194700002502216700002202241700002802263773012102291852000902412856008502421930003302506946001302539655001202552IND4430383820221120113911.0091225e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443038382DNAL7 a187046652pmid7 a10.1007/s10863-008-9159-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Graciele A. 10aIncreased aerobic metabolism is essential for the beneficial effects of caloric restriction on yeast life span  ap. 381-388.  aCalorie restriction is a dietary regimen capable of extending life span in a variety of multicellular organisms. A yeast model of calorie restriction has been developed in which limiting the concentration of glucose in the growth media of Saccharomyces cerevisiae leads to enhanced replicative and chronological longevity. Since S. cerevisiae are Crabtree-positive cells that present repression of aerobic catabolism when grown in high glucose concentrations, we investigated if this phenomenon participates in life span regulation in yeast. S. cerevisiae only exhibited an increase in chronological life span when incubated in limited concentrations of glucose. Limitation of galactose, raffinose or glycerol plus ethanol as substrates did not enhance life span. Furthermore, in Kluyveromyces lactis, a Crabtree-negative yeast, glucose limitation did not promote an enhancement of respiratory capacity nor a decrease in reactive oxygen species formation, as is characteristic of conditions of caloric restriction in S. cerevisiae. In addition, K. lactis did not present an increase in longevity when incubated in lower glucose concentrations. Altogether, our results indicate that release from repression of aerobic catabolism is essential for the beneficial effects of glucose limitation in the yeast calorie restriction model. Potential parallels between these changes in yeast and hormonal regulation of respiratory rates in animals are discussed. 3aCrabtree effect 3afree radicals 2aAerobiosisxphysiology 2aAgingxphysiology 2aCaloric Restrictionxmethods 2aCell Proliferation 2aCell Survival 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aKluyveromycesxcytologyxphysiology. 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aOxygen Consumptionxphysiology 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexcytologyxphysiology. 0aCalorie restriction 0aAging 0aRespiration1 aTahara, Erich B. 1 aGombert, Andreas K. 1 aBarros, Mario H. 1 aKowaltowski, Alicia J. 0 tJournal of bioenergetics and biomembranes.g2008 Aug., v. 40, no. 4 p.381-388dBoston : Springer USx0145-479X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10863-008-9159-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20091225b20100101c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03105naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180100002200189245012500211300001600336500002400352500001500376520150400391650001201895650001901907650001001926650001101936650002001947650002101967650002301988650002402011650000902035650001902044650002702063650002602090650001902116650002402135650002302159650002002182653000902202653001902211700002002230700002402250773010602274852000902380856009302389930003302482945002502515946001102540655001202551IND4434858420221120114020.0100402e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443485842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2010.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL200 0aL500 0aL6001 aNieminen, Petteri10aIncreased reproductive success in the white American mink (Neovison vison) with chronic dietary β-sitosterol supplement  ap. 287-292.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aβ-Sitosterol is a weakly estrogenic phytosterol used in functional foods to lower elevated serum cholesterol concentrations. It has been reported to cause reproductive disturbances in fish and lower the sperm count of rodents but, in contrast, there were indications of enhanced reproduction in a preliminary study on the brown American mink (Neovison vison). In the present experiment the effects of chronic dietary β-sitosterol exposure on the reproduction of the American mink were evaluated with a large number of experimental animals. Male and female finnwhite mink (n =200) - a previously uninvestigated color type with lower reproductive success compared to brown mink - were exposed to 50mgβ-sitosterolkg⁻¹ d⁻¹ for 10 months and compared with 200 control animals. After 3 months in November, 15 males per group were sacrificed and their biochemical variables determined. The serum glucose and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were lower in the β-sitosterol-exposed group, while other effects were minor. The females were mated with the top-rated males (4-5:1) in March and their reproductive performance was determined. The reproductive success increased in the β-sitosterol group with significantly fewer barren females and a higher number of successfully reproducing females than in the control group, which supports previous studies on brown mink and voles indicating that β-sitosterol could be used to enhance the reproductive performance of these mammals. 3afemales 3aNeovison vison 3amales 3adosage 3abeta-sitosterol 3afemale fertility 3agender differences 3ahormonal regulation 3amink 3amale fertility 3aphysiological response 3afarmed animal species 3aanimal feeding 3adietary supplements 3aanimal performance 3aplant estrogens 0adiet 0afinnwhite mink1 aPölönen, Ilpo1 aMustonen, Anne-Mari0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2010 June, v. 119, no. 3-4 p.287-292dElsevier Sciencex0378-43207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2010.01.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20100607b20100703c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/05/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03958naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154072000900172072000900181100001600190245009200206300001600298500002400314500001500338520187500353650001402228650001502242650002902257650001902286650001402305650003302319650002502352650001902377650001302396650001802409650002802427650001602455650001502471650001002486650002502496650001202521650001802533650001402551650002502565650002402590650000902614650002602623650002102649650001902670650006002689650001002749653002602759653003102785653002702816653001602843700001602859700002202875700002002897700001902917700002302936773010602959852000903065856009303074930003303167945002503200946001103225655001203236IND4434858120221120104610.0100402e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443485812DNAL7 a202272042pmid7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2010.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL2001 aYeste, Marc14aThe osmotic tolerance of boar spermatozoa and its usefulness as sperm quality parameter  ap. 265-274.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPredicting the fertility outcome of ejaculates is very important in the field of porcine reproduction. The aims of this study were to determine the effects of different osmotic treatments on boar spermatozoa and to correlate them with fertility and prolificacy, assessed as non-return rates within 60 days (NRR₆₀d) of the first inseminations, and litter size (LS), respectively. Sperm samples (n =100) from one hundred healthy Piétrain boars were used to assess 48 treatments combining different osmolalities (ranged between 100 and 4000mOsmkg⁻¹), different compounds used to prepare anisotonic solutions, and two different modalities: return and non-return to isotonic conditions. Sperm quality was evaluated before and after applying the treatments on the basis of analyses of sperm viability, motility, morphology and percentages of acrosome-intact spermatozoa. Statistical analyses were performed using a one-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey's test, linear regression analyses (Pearson correlation and multiple regression) and Jackknife cross-validation. Although three conventional parameters: sperm viability, sperm morphology and the percentages of acrosome-intact spermatozoa were significantly correlated with NRR₆₀d and with LS, their respective osmotic tolerance parameters (defined for each parameter and treatment regarding with negative control) presented a higher Pearson coefficient with both fertility and prolificacy in three treatments (150mOsmkg⁻¹ with non-return to isotonic conditions, 200mOsmkg⁻¹ with return and 500mOsmkg⁻¹ using sodium citrate and non-return to isotonic conditions). We conclude that osmotic resistance in sperm viability, sperm morphology and acrosome-intactness in the treatments mentioned above could be assessed along with classical parameters to better predict the fertilising ability of a given ejaculate. 3aviability 3abiomarkers 3amale reproductive system 3asperm motility 3abioassays 3afertilization (reproduction) 3aprobability analysis 3amale fertility 3aacrosome 3aosmotolerance 3aartificial insemination 3alitter size 3aosmolarity 3aswine 2aAcrosomexphysiology 2aAnimals 2aCell Survival 2aFertility 2aHypertonic Solutions 2aHypotonic Solutions 2aMale 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aOsmotic Pressure 2aSperm Motility 2aSpermatozoaxabnormalitiesxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aSwine 0alaboratory techniques 0aphysicochemical properties 0aanatomy and morphology 0aspermatozoa1 aBriz, Mailo1 aPinart, Elisabeth1 aSancho, Sílvia1 aBussalleu, Eva1 aBonet, S.q(Sergi)0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2010 June, v. 119, no. 3-4 p.265-274dElsevier Sciencex0378-43207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2010.02.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20100607b20100703c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/05/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02351naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002000136245013600156300001600292520128700308650002001595650002101615650001801636650002601654650001401680650001601694650001301710650002901723700002101752773011101773852000901884856007601893939003301969946001102002655001202013IND4450616620221120093122.0110311e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445061662DNAL7 a10.1002/jms.18892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaiswal, Rakesh10aHow to identify and discriminate between the methyl quinates of chlorogenic acids by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 269-281.  aThe methyl esters of chlorogenic acids, methyl quinates, are widely distributed in plant materials and frequently appear as extraction artifacts in plant samples. This is the first time when liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods have been used for the identification and characterization of the methyl quinates. For this purpose, methyl quinates of mono caffeoylquinic acids and mono feruloylquinic acids were synthesized as authentic standards. The methyl quinates of mono and diacyl chlorogenic acids have shown characteristic fragmentation pattern in their tandem mass spectra. MSn ⁺ ¹ spectra of the methyl quinates of diacyl chlorogenic acids were identical to MSn spectra of mono acyl derivatives. These quinates do not produce any methyl quinate peak at m/z 205 if compared with quinic acid peak at m/z 191 in negative ion mode.

Derivatization by silylation of the samples prior to their injection into a medium polar column enabled a peak resolution of the different components, which led to unambiguous identification of the majority of the components of the samples. The identification and quantification of the fatty acids and sterols in soapstocks and of the fatty acids and tocopherols in deodorizer distillate were successfully achieved. The system has been sensitive enough to characterize 87.5% (mass basis) of the flax soapstock, 95.4% (mass basis) of the soybean soapstock and 83.8% (mass basis) of the soybean deodorizer distillates composition. The method can be safely used for the identification and quantification of most of the components of any type of soapstock and deodorizer distillates. 3aLinum usitatissimum 3aflax 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3asoapstock 3adeodorization 3adistillates 3achemical composition 3achemical analysis 3aquantitative analysis 3asterols 3afatty acids 3atocopherols 3agas chromatography 0aflame ionization detector1 aNarine, Suresh S.0 tjournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2007 Dec., v. 84, no. 12 p.1101-1105dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-007-1154-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20080114b20080202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/01/14  aOther US 7aarticle02056naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010700165300001600272520093800288653003501226653002101261653002801282653001301310653001801323700002001341700002401361700001901385700002001404700002101424773012101445852000901566856008501575930003301660946001301693655001201706IND4430382620221120093119.0091225e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443038262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10863-008-9183-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBisetto, Elena 10aFunctional and stoichiometric analysis of subunit e in bovine heart mitochondrial F₀F₁ATP synthase  ap. 257-267.  aThe role of the integral inner membrane subunit e in self-association of F₀F₁ATP synthase from bovine heart mitochondria was analyzed by in situ limited proteolysis, blue native PAGE/iterative SDS-PAGE, and LC-MS/MS. Selective degradation of subunit e, without disrupting membrane integrity or ATPase capacity, altered the oligomeric distribution of F₀F₁ATP synthase, by eliminating oligomers and reducing dimers in favor of monomers. The stoichiometry of subunit e was determined by a quantitative MS-based proteomics approach, using synthetic isotope-labelled reference peptides IAQL*EEVK, VYGVGSL*ALYEK, and ELAEAQEDTIL*K to quantify the b, γ and e subunits, respectively. Accuracy of the method was demonstrated by confirming the 1:1 stoichiometry of subunits γ and b. Altogether, the results indicate that the integrity of a unique copy of subunit e is essential for self-association of mammalian F₀F₁ATP synthase. 0aMammalian F₀F₁ATP synthase 0aSelf-association 0aSubunit e stoichiometry 0aLC-MS/MS 0aAQUA peptides1 aPicotti, Paola 1 aGiorgio, Valentina 1 aAlverdi, Vera 1 aMavelli, Irene 1 aLippe, Giovanna 0 tJournal of bioenergetics and biomembranes.g2008 Aug., v. 40, no. 4 p.257-267dBoston : Springer USx0145-479X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10863-008-9183-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20091225b20100101c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03242naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245011800144300001600262520197400278650001302252650001902265650001502284650001802299650001002317650000902327650002802336650002202364650001102386650002602397650001602423650003202439650002402471650003302495651001002528653002402538653001102562700002202573700001802595700001402613773007902627852000902706930003302715945001302748946001102761655001202772IND2331834920221120083028.0030408e200305  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233183492DNAL7 a125078682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRupa, T.R.10aEffects of farmyard manure and phosphorus on zinc transformations and phyto-availability in two alfisols of India  ap. 279-288.  aLaboratory pot experiments were run to study the effects of added zinc (Zn) with and without farmyard manure (FYM) and phosphorus (P) on Zn transformations in two Alfisols, together with Zn uptake by wheat plants grown up to 60 days. In the first experiment the treatments included four levels of Zn (0, 3.75, 7.5 and 15 mg kg-1 soil) and two levels of FYM (0 and 10 t ha-1), and in the second experiment five levels of P (0, 20, 40, 80 and 160 mg kg-1 soil) and one level of Zn (7.5 mg kg-1 soil). The soils were sequentially fractionated into water-soluble plus exchangeable (CA-Zn), inorganically bound (AAC-Zn), organically bound (PYR-Zn), oxide bound (OX-Zn) and residual (RES-Zn) forms. The effect of added FYM was more evident on the OX-Zn fraction and the percentage utilization of Zn by wheat was the greatest with the addition of FYM alone at the rate of 10 t ha-1 (1.95-2.38%) in comparison to other treatment combinations. Among the levels, application of 7.5 mg Zn kg-1 soil showed the maximum increase in different fractions of soil Zn and significantly increased the Zn utilization by wheat (0.87-1.17%) as compared to other Zn levels (0.58-0.88%). On an average, about 85% of the added Zn was recovered in different fractions in Zn treated pots. However, the recovery per cent of the added Zn was significantly higher at Zn level 7.5 (95%) mg kg-1 soil than at 3.75 (87%) and 15 (73%) mg Zn kg-1 soil levels. Phosphorus additions up to 40 mg kg-1 soil increased the plant-available Zn in soils whereas at higher P levels plant-available forms decreased with a concominant increase in the inert forms. At 160 mg P kg-1 soil, the P effect was more pronounced in the shoot than in the root, suggesting that a higher P level inhibits Zn translocation from root to upper plant parts. Path analysis showed that the organically (PYR-Zn) and inorganically bound (AAC-Zn) Zn fractions were the predominant fractions that influenced the Zn availability to plants. 3aAlfisols 3aanimal manures 3aphosphorus 3aplant anatomy 3awheat 3azinc 2aBiological Availability 2aBiotransformation 2aManure 2aPhosphorusxchemistry 2aPlant Roots 2aSoil Pollutantsxmetabolism 2aTriticumxchemistry 2aZincxchemistryxmetabolism. 3aIndia 0apot experimentation 0auptake1 aSrinivasa Rao, C.1 aSubba Rao, A.1 aSingh, M.0 tBioresource technology.g2003 May, v. 87, no. 3 p.279-288x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02327naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245009000208300001800298506007600316520088700392506003701279650002001316650001601336650000901352650001101361650002601372650001801398650001401416650001701430650001701447700002001464700002701484700003001511700001801541700002501559700002101584773012601605852000901731856008301740930003301823946001301856655001201869IND4437388020221207083544.0100522e20100521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443738802DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11830572doi7 aPMC28816922pmcid7 a203787722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugahara, Kazuki N.10aCoadministration of a Tumor-Penetrating Peptide Enhances the Efficacy of Cancer Drugs  ap. 1031-1035.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPoor penetration of anticancer drugs into tumors can be an important factor limiting their efficacy. We studied mouse tumor models to show that a previously characterized tumor-penetrating peptide, iRGD, increased vascular and tissue permeability in a tumor-specific and neuropilin-1-dependent manner, allowing coadministered drugs to penetrate into extravascular tumor tissue. Importantly, this effect did not require the drugs to be chemically conjugated to the peptide. Systemic injection with iRGD improved the therapeutic index of drugs of various compositions, including a small molecule (doxorubicin), nanoparticles (nab-paclitaxel and doxorubicin liposomes), and a monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab). Thus, coadministration of iRGD may be a valuable way to enhance the efficacy of anticancer drugs while reducing their side effects, a primary goal of cancer therapy research.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3adoxorubicin 3amice 3amodels 3amonoclonal antibodies 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3apermeability 3atherapeutics1 aTeesalu, Tambet1 aKarmali, Priya Prakash1 aKotamraju, Venkata Ramana1 aAgemy, Lilach1 aGreenwald, Daniel R.1 aRuoslahti, Erkki0 tScience.g2010 May 21, v. 328, no. 5981 p.1031-1035dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11830573Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02768naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245015200181300001600333500004500349520146300394650002101857650001101878650002901889650002401918650001701942650001301959650001901972653001001991653001302001653001602014653002802030700001902058700001702077700001602094773007302110852000902183856008502192930003302277945001302310946001102323655001202334IND2058157920221120042523.0970702e199703  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205815792DNAL7 a184838992pmid7 a10.1080/030794597084192032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorrow, C.J.14aThe development of lameness and bone deformity in the broiler following experimental infection with Mycoplasma gallisepticum or Mycoplasma synoviae  ap. 169-187.  aSummaries in French, German, and Spanish  aGroups of eight 7-day-old Mycoplasma-free broiler chicks were inoculated with one of two strains of M. gallisepticum (MG/S6, MG/B31/85) or one of two strains of M. synoviae (MS/B31/88 and MS/B94/91) into the left hock joint. Controls were similarly inoculated with sterile mycoplasma broth. The birds were assessed at 2, 3, 4 and 5 weeks of age (1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks post-injection) for lameness and joint and limb lesions. At 5 weeks of age they were killed and examined for gross skeletal abnormalities and microscopic lesions of both hock joints. The in-contact controls showed no joint swelling or lameness. The mycoplasma did not apparently spread to cause gross pathology in the joints of in-contact control birds, or to other joints in a bird injected with mycoplasma. Each mycoplasma strain caused specific pathologies manifest as varying degrees of lameness, left hock joint swelling, bone deformity and differences in the severity of articular cartilage and chondrodystrophic growth plate pathology. Shortening and bowing of the right tibiotarsus in the birds injected with mycoplasma indicated unilateral increased limb loading contributing to bone deformity. Chondrodystrophy seen with three mycoplasmal strains may have contributed to bone deformity in these birds. Lameness appeared to be a consequence of either joint swelling and/or bone deformity resulting in mechanical dysfunction. The role of joint pain in the lameness was not determined. 3abroiler chickens 3achicks 3aMycoplasma gallisepticum 3aMycoplasma synoviae 3apathogenesis 3alameness 3ahistopathology 0ahocks 0aswelling 0adeformities 0aexperimental infections1 aBradbury, J.M.1 aGentle, M.J.1 aThorp, B.H.0 tAvian pathology.g1997 Mar., v. 26, no. 1 p.169-187x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794597084192033Available from publisher's Web site  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle01931naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001800142245011400160300001800274520091300292650002601205650001901231650001501250650002001265650001701285650001201302650001101314700002301325700001601348773009401364852000901458856008201467939003301549946001101582655001201593IND4459375120221120033930.0110625e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445937512DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2010006752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalomon, Sven12aA dielectrophoretic continuous flow sorter using integrated microelectrodes coupled to a channel constriction  ap. 1508-1514.  aIn this article, we propose a novel dielectrophoretic continuous flow sorter using planar micro electrodes coupled to a channel constriction. This design enables a high particle sorting efficiency at low voltages while relying on a simple fabrication and integration process. We have numerically simulated the AC electrokinetic effects and the fluid behavior to predict particle trajectories. Simulation results are in accordance with experimental data: 10 and 5 μm polystyrene beads were continuously sorted with <2% errors at flow speeds of 100 μm/s. We were also able to change the particle buffer while sorting beads. Finally, to demonstrate the interest of our device for cell sorting, we also sorted dead and living yeast cells according to their different dielectric properties. Living cell concentration was enriched by a factor of 4 versus dead cell concentration after passing the sorting device. 3adielectric properties 3aelectric power 3aelectrodes 3aelectrophoresis 3apolystyrenes 3asorting 3ayeasts1 aLeichlé, Thierry.1 aNicu, Liviu0 tElectrophoresis.g2011 June, v. 32, no. 12 p.1508-1514dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2010006753Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110625  aNon-US 7aarticle02389naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002400142245007300166300001800239520145100257650003001708650001901738650001901757650000901776650002401785650001601809700002101825773009401846852000901940856008201949939003302031946001102064655001202075IND4459375420221120030427.0110625e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445937542DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2010005872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCianciulli, Claudia10aInfrared-based temperature measurements in capillary electrophoresis  ap. 1530-1536.  aIn capillary electrophoresis (CE), the temperature inside the capillary is one of the most important parameters. In a concept for Analytical Instrument Qualification (AIQ) of CE systems, the temperature accuracy and stability have to be included. This fact requires an accurate look at the measurement of temperature which is generated by the applied electrical power. The generation of Joule heating is measured on the outside of the capillary using an infrared (IR) thermometer. The thermometer linearity is demonstrated over a wide range of various electrical field strength, buffer systems, and different capillary inner diameters. A slope of 6.3°C m/W was found for the optimal thermometer capillary distance of 8 mm. Furthermore, the temperature measurements are highly precise, depending almost solely on the current variability. The proposed method is compared with three methods calculating the temperature from the conductance, the electroosmotic velocity, or the current. These indirect methods estimate slopes ranging from 7 to 10°C m/W. In addition, the maximal suitable electrical power per unit length is estimated. Joule heating can often be tolerated up to 4 W/m. However, sensitive analytes can already be affected by using more than 1 W/m. In conclusion, the consideration of the temperature is essential for not only Analytical Instrument Qualification, but also certainly useful for method optimisation and method transfer. 3acapillary electrophoresis 3aelectric field 3aelectric power 3aheat 3asystem optimization 3atemperature1 aWätzig, Hermann0 tElectrophoresis.g2011 June, v. 32, no. 12 p.1530-1536dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2010005873Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110625  aNon-US 7aarticle01768naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245010500144300001600249520055200265650001700817650002300834650002000857650001300877650001100890650001400901650001300915650000700928650001600935650001800951650001800969650003900987650003101026650001301057650002901070650001601099700001701115700001901132700001401151773007901165852000901244930003301253945001301286946001101299655001201310IND2331838120221117175645.0030408e200305  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233183812DNAL7 a125078802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGill, P.K.10aEffect of media supplements and culture conditions on inulinase production by an actinomycete strain  ap. 359-362.  aStreptomyces sp.

Inhibition analysis indicated a binding preference for larger (i.e. degrees of polymerization = 8) N-acetylated chitin molecules with a 50% inhibition of initial activity value of approximately 50 nM. N-Acetyl-glucosamine and chitobiose showed no inhibitory effects at concentrations as high as 250 micromolar. It is noteworthy that the major lipo-chitin oligosaccharide Nod signal produced by Bradyrhizobium japonicum was also shown to be a competitive inhibitor of ligand binding. However, the binding site appeared to recognize the chitin portion of the Nod signal, and it is unlikely that this binding activity represents a specific Nod signal receptor. Chitooligosaccharide specificity for induction of medium alkalinization and the generation of reactive oxygen in suspension-cultured cells paralleled the binding activity. Taken together, the presence of the chitin binding protein in the plasma membrane fraction and the specificity and induction of a biological response upon ligand binding suggest a role for the protein as an initial response mechanism for chitin perception in soybean (Glycine max).0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asoybeans 3aoligosaccharides 3achitin 3abinding proteins 3amolecular weight 3acell suspension culture 3aroots 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3anodulation 3aplasma membrane 3aapplication rate 3abinding sites 2aBinding Sites 2aBinding, Competitive 2aCarbohydrate Sequence 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aCells, Cultured 2aChitinxmetabolism 2aLipopolysaccharidesxmetabolism 2aMembrane Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSignal Transduction 2aSoybeansxmetabolism 0ainhibition1 aOkada, M.1 aIto, Y.1 aTsukada, K.1 aZaghouani, H.1 aShibuya, N.1 aStacey, G.0 tPlant physiology.g2001 July, v. 126, no. 3 p.1162-1173dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03786naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001400150245014300164300001800307500002400325500001500349506007600364520163700440506003702077650002502114650001802139650003302157650002002190650001102210650001202221650001502233650003602248650002602284650002602310650001902336650002302355650004402378650005802422650002702480650004402507650003802551650002002589650001702609650002402626650001402650650003102664650002702695650003402722650002102756653001402777653001402791653001902805653001202824700001302836773015302849852000903002856005403011930003303065945001303098946001303111655001203124IND2324970720221207112446.0020123e200107  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232497072DNAL7 a114579612pmid7 aPMC1164672pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBieza, K.13aAn Arabidopsis mutant tolerant to lethal ultraviolet-B levels shows constitutively elevated accumulation of flavonoids and other phenolics  ap. 1105-1115.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe isolation and characterization of mutants hypersensitive to ultraviolet (UV) radiation has been a powerful tool to learn about the mechanisms that protect plants against UV-induced damage. To increase our understanding of the various mechanisms of defense against UVB radiation, we searched for mutations that would increase the level of tolerance of Arabidopsis plants to UV radiation. We describe a single gene dominant mutation (uvt1) that leads to a remarkable tolerance to UVB radiation conditions that would kill wild-type plants. Pigment analyses show a constitutive increase in accumulation of UV-absorbing compounds in uvt1 that increases the capacity of the leaves to block UVB radiation and therefore is likely to be responsible for the elevated resistance of this mutant to UVB radiation. These increases in absorption in the UV region are due, at least in part, to increases in flavonoid and sinapate accumulation. Expression of chalcone synthase (CHS) mRNA was shown to be constitutively elevated in uvt1 plants, suggesting that the increases in absorption may be a consequence of changes in gene expression. Expression of CHS in uvt1 was shown to be still inducible by UV, indicating that the uvt1 lesion may not affect the UV-mediated regulation of CHS gene expression. Our data support an important role for UV screens in the overall protection of plants to UVB radiation. The uvt1 mutant could prove to be an important tool to elucidate further the exact role of UV-absorbing pigments in UV protection as well as the relative contribution of other mechanisms to the overall tolerance of plants to UV radiation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amessenger RNA 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 3agene expression 3aleaves 3amutants 3aflavonoids 3achemical constituents of plants 3abiological resistance 3aultraviolet radiation 3aabiotic stress 3aphenolic compounds 2aAcyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aFlavonoidsxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Dominant 2aGenes, Plant 2aPhenolsxmetabolism 2aPhenotype 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRNA, Plantxmetabolism 2aRadiation Tolerancexgenetics 2aUltraviolet Rays 0atolerance 0adominance 0aplant pigments 0alesions1 aLois, R.0 tPlant physiology.g2001 July, v. 126, no. 3 p.1105-1115dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02795naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245009500205300001800300506007600318520106800394506003701462650000801499650001401507650002001521650001001541650004201551650001001593650002501603650002101628650002901649650002601678650001601704700002301720700002201743700002301765700002101788700002101809700002001830700001801850700003101868700001801899700002301917700001701940700002001957773012601977852000902103856008302112930003302195946001302228655001202241IND4437388120221207113629.0100522e20100521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443738812DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11861762doi7 aPMC30087662pmcid7 a203787742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Dominic10aFive-Vertebrate ChIP-seq Reveals the Evolutionary Dynamics of Transcription Factor Binding  ap. 1036-1040.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTranscription factors (TFs) direct gene expression by binding to DNA regulatory regions. To explore the evolution of gene regulation, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to determine experimentally the genome-wide occupancy of two TFs, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha, in the livers of five vertebrates. Although each TF displays highly conserved DNA binding preferences, most binding is species-specific, and aligned binding events present in all five species are rare. Regions near genes with expression levels that are dependent on a TF are often bound by the TF in multiple species yet show no enhanced DNA sequence constraint. Binding divergence between species can be largely explained by sequence changes to the bound motifs. Among the binding events lost in one lineage, only half are recovered by another binding event within 10 kilobases. Our results reveal large interspecies differences in transcriptional regulation and provide insight into regulatory evolution.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3achromatin 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aliver 3anucleotide sequences 3aprecipitin tests 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3avertebrates1 aWilson, Michael D.1 aBallester, Benoit1 aSchwalie, Petra C.1 aBrown, Gordon D.1 aMarshall, Aileen1 aKutter, Claudia1 aWatt, Stephen1 aMartinez-Jimenez, Celia P.1 aMackay, Sarah1 aTalianidis, Iannis1 aFlicek, Paul1 aOdom, Duncan T.0 tScience.g2010 May 21, v. 328, no. 5981 p.1036-1040dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11861763Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02509naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245011900147300001600266520079400282650001401076650001301090650002101103650001601124650003801140650002201178650002801200650002101228650001101249650002401260650002901284650001601313650002301329650001801352650001601370650003001386650001801416650002701434650001601461650002801477650001701505650003901522650002401561650001601585650001301601653002801614653001901642700001701661700001601678700002401694700001401718700001701732773008001749852000901829930003301838945001301871946001101884655001201895IND2331924920221123033452.0030411e200302  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233192492DNAL7 a126884612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalogeris, E.10aPerformance of an intermittent agitation rotating drum type bioreactor for solid-state fermentation of wheat straw  ap. 207-213.  aA laboratory bioreactor, designed for solid-state fermentation of thermophilic microorganisms, was operated for production of cellulases and hemicellulases by the thermophilic fungus Thermoascus aurantiacus.

Removal of oxidized bases is initiated by a DNA glycosylase that recognises and excises the damaged base, initiating the base excision repair (BER) pathway. We show that upon induction of 8-oxoguanine, a mutagenic product of guanine oxidation, the mammalian 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase OGG1 is recruited together with other proteins involved in BER to euchromatin regions rich in RNA and RNA polymerase II and completely excluded from heterochromatin. The underlying mechanism does not require direct interaction of the protein with the oxidized base, however, the release of the protein from the chromatin fraction requires completion of repair. Inducing chromatin compaction by sucrose results in a complete but reversible inhibition of the in vivo repair of 8-oxoguanine. We conclude that after induction of oxidative DNA damage, the DNA glycosylase is actively recruited to regions of open chromatin allowing the access of the BER machinery to the lesions, suggesting preferential repair of active chromosome regions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aRNA 3aguanine 3aheterochromatin 3amammals 3amutagens 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3asucrose1 aCampalans, Anna1 aEpe, Bernd1 aRadicella, J.

Laboratory trials were carried out for 15 days using a pilot scale device. Samples of 5 kg slurry were used. At the end of the storage period, distributions of dry matter, pH, total ammoniacal nitrogen and total Kjeldahl nitrogen in slurry were characterized. In the field, ammonia volatilisation was measured for three days using a wind tunnel system. Oil and plastic film retained all ammoniacal nitrogen forms in the slurry, whereas the others reduced ammonia volatilisation by reducing the emitting surface or by adsorbing/absorbing ammonia. Over the whole process studied (storage plus application) ammonia emissions were reduced by 40% by oil up to 65-71% by zeolites with different particle sizes. 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3adry matter partitioning 3aemissions 3anitrogen 3aoils 3apeat 3apig manure 3aplastic film 3apolystyrenes 3aslurries 3astorage time 3avolatilization 3awind tunnels 3azeolites 2aAir Pollutionxprevention & control 2aAmmoniaxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aManure 2aNitrogenxchemistry 2aPlastics 2aRefuse Disposalxmethods 2aSwine 0acovers 0astores 0apig slurry store covers 0aemission reduction1 aMartinez, J.1 aGuiziou, F.1 aCoste, C.M.0 tBioresource technology.g2003 May, v. 87, no. 3 p.199-207x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02314naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245007300143300001600216520093900232650002401171650001301195650001201208650001301220650002101233650002001254650001201274650000701286650001901293650001901312650001301331650001601344650003001360650003401390650001401424650002501438650003101463650001201494650003401506650001101540650001301551650001601564650002301580653001901603700001701622773007901639852000901718930003301727945001301760946001101773655001201784IND2331833620221122224035.0030408e200305  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233183362DNAL7 a125078582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAktas, N.10aReaction conditions for laccase catalyzed polymerization of catechol  ap. 209-214.  aPoly(catechol) was synthesized in batch runs with laccase from Trametes versicolor (ATCC 200801). The polymerization reaction was conducted in a closed, temperature controlled system containing acetone and sodium acetate buffer for pH control. The effects of the solvent mixture, monomer (catechol), enzyme, medium pH and temperature on the polymerization rate were investigated with respect to initial reaction conditions and depletion rate of dissolved oxygen in the medium. Maximum initial reaction rate was attained with 10% (v/v) acetone-sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.0, 25 degrees C, 0.02 U/ml enzyme and 250 mg/l initial catechol and 10 mg/l dissolved oxygen. A general saturation enzyme kinetics response was observed for catechol substrate. Temperature rise supported the rate increase up to 45 degrees C, after which the rate tended to be stable due to a drop in dissolved oxygen concentration as well as enzyme instability. 3aCoriolus versicolor 3aacetates 3aacetone 3acatechol 3adissolved oxygen 3aenzyme kinetics 3alaccase 3apH 3apolymerization 3asodium acetate 3asolvents 3atemperature 2aBasidiomycotaxenzymology 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aCatalysis 2aCatecholsxchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLaccase 2aOxidoreductasesxpharmacology 2aOxygen 2aPolymers 2aTemperature 2aWater Purification 0apoly(catechol)1 aTanyolac, A.0 tBioresource technology.g2003 May, v. 87, no. 3 p.209-214x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02672naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001900142245013300161300001800294500001500312520132700327650001701654650003901671650001101710650002101721650001401742650000901756650001101765650001901776650002201795650002501817653001801842700002901860700002201889700002301911700001901934700002401953700002001977773009401997852000902091856008202100939003302182946001102215655001202226IND4459373720221122202536.0110625e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445937372DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2010006912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, Yoshio10aDesign and synthesis of new fluorescent probe for rapid and highly sensitive detection of proteins via electrophoretic gel stain  ap. 1403-1413.  a2019-12-04  aA new fluorescent molecular probe, 2,2′-(1E,1′E)-2,2′-(4-(dicyanomethylene)-4H-pyrane-2,6-diyl)bis(ethene-2,1-diyl)bis(sodium benzenesulfonate) salt (1), possessing the cyanopyranyl moieties and two benzene sulfonic acid groups was designed and synthesized to detect proteins in solution and for high-throughput SDS-PAGE. Compound 1 exhibited no fluorescence in the absence of proteins; however, it exhibited strong fluorescence on the addition of bovine serum albumin as a result of intramolecular charge transfer. Compared with the conventional protocols for in-gel protein staining, such as SYPRO Ruby and silver staining, 1 achieves higher sensitivity, even though it offers a simplified, higher throughput protocol. In fact, the total time required for protein staining was 60-90 min under optimum conditions much shorter than that required by the less-sensitive silver staining or SYPRO Ruby staining protocols. Moreover, 1 was successfully applied to protein identification by mass spectrometry via in-gel tryptic digestion, Western blotting, and native PAGE together with protein staining by 1, which is a modified protocol of blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE). Thus, 1 may facilitate high-sensitivity protein detection, and it may be widely applicable as a convenient tool in various scientific and medical fields. 3afluorescence 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asilver 3aWestern blotting 3adigestion 3agels 3asodium 3asulfonic acids 3amass spectrometry 3abovine serum albumin 0asulfonic acid1 aTakagi, Tadayuki,d1932-1 aChimuro, Tomoyuki1 aShinohara, Atsushi1 aSakaguchi, Nao1 aHiratsuka, Atsunori1 aYokoyama, Kenji0 tElectrophoresis.g2011 June, v. 32, no. 12 p.1403-1413dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2010006913Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110625  aNon-US 7aarticle02141naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245010600185300001600291500004500307520089400352650001301246650001701259650001501276650003201291650001501323650002601338650002001364653001301384653002501397653001201422653002801434700001701462700001601479773007301495852000901568856008501577930003301662945001301695946001101708655001201719IND2060858220221122180934.0971211e199706  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206085822DNAL7 a184839182pmid7 a10.1080/030794597084192242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhinakar Raj, G.10aEffect of heterophil depletion by 5-fluorouracil on infectious bronchitis virus infection in chickens  ap. 427-432.  aSummaries in French, German, and Spanish  aAn anti-tumour drug, 5-fluorouracil (5 FU) was used to deplete heterophils in 11-day-old white leghorn chickens. The reduction in heterophil numbers was monitored by total and differential white cell counts in the peripheral blood. Three days after injection of 5 FU, when the heterophil numbers were significantly reduced, chickens were infected with the Massachusetts strain of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Following infection, although the numbers of birds exhibiting clinical signs (nasal exudate) were significantly higher in the 5 FU treated group, the consistency of the nasal exudate was characteristically thin and watery. No significant differences were seen in the virus titres in trachea, lung and kidney between normal and heteropaenic chickens infected with IBV. However, the epithelial cell damage in the tracheal sections was less in the heterophil-depleted chickens. 3achickens 3afluorouracil 3aleukocytes 3aInfectious bronchitis virus 3aepithelium 3atrachea (vertebrates) 3aleukocyte count 0asymptoms 0avirus neutralization 0alesions 0aexperimental infections1 aSavage, C.E.1 aJones, R.C.0 tAvian pathology.g1997 June, v. 26, no. 2 p.427-432x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794597084192243Available from publisher's Web site  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle01920naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245008600185300001600271500004500287520077700332650001301109650001901122650002101141650001301162650001701175650002301192650002101215650001401236653001901250700001501269700001401284773007301298852000901371856008501380930003301465945001301498946001101511655001201522IND2060857920221122142808.0971211e199706  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206085792DNAL7 a184839172pmid7 a10.1080/030794597084192232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShapouri, M.R.S.10aImmunogenicity of E. coli-expressed sigma 3 protein of avian reovirus in chickens  ap. 419-425.  aSummaries in French, German, and Spanish  aAn E. coli-expressed fusion protein was used to study the immunogenicity of avian reovirus sigma 3 protein in chickens. The protein induced the production of specific antibodies detectable by immunofluorescence, ELISA and immunoblot. The antibody titre was low as determined by ELISA and was negative by virus neutralization test. However, when tested in passive immunization studies, the chicken antiserum specific to this protein and control antiserum from chickens vaccinated with avian reovirus S1133 strain showed some protection against virus-induced mortally in 1-day-old chicks. The results thus confirm the importance of humoral immunity against avian reovirus infection and indicate that sigma 3 protein may play a role in the induction of protective antibodies. 3achickens 3aviral proteins 3aEscherichia coli 3aantigens 3aimmunization 3aantibody formation 3ahumoral immunity 3aantiserum 0aavian reovirus1 aArella, M.1 aSilim, A.0 tAvian pathology.g1997 June, v. 26, no. 2 p.419-425x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794597084192233Available from publisher's Web site  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02381naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245013100161300001400292500004500306500001500351520121600366650001401582650002201596650001101618650001201629650002201641650001701663653001401680653002001694700001501714700001501729700001701744773007101761852000901832856008501841930003301926945001301959946001101972655001201983IND2058156120221122142748.0970702e199703  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205815612DNAL7 a10.1080/030794597084191932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShibuya, K.10aScleral ectasia associated with hereditary retinal dysplasia in a mutant strain of Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica)  ap. 53-61.  aSummaries in French, German, and Spanish  a2019-12-04  aOcular defects and age-related lesions in mutant (GUB strain) Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica), phenotypically characterised by silver plumage, are described. Grossly, a circular area of hypopigmentation in the posterior retina with thinning of the subjacent sclera was observed in all GUB quails. As the birds matured, the thinned sclera progressed to scleral ectasia. Histologically, the sclera at the ectatic area consisted of an outer fibrous layer and was devoid of the inner cartilaginous shell. Atypical differentiation and duplication of the retina with absence of the choroid was common at the ectatic area. The retina, choroid, ciliary body and ins were all poorly pigmented. With increasing age, the ectatic area became cystic, and the duplicated retina degenerated and atrophied. In addition, there were mononuclear cell infiltration in the stroma of the iris and ciliary body, anterior and posterior synechiae, cataract and/or glaucoma in aged GUB quails. These findings suggest that posterior scleral ectasia in the GUB strain of Japanese quails may have developed secondarily to a congenital structural defect of the posterior portion of sclera associating with general ocular defects. 3ahistology 3agenetic disorders 3aretina 3amutants 3aCoturnix japonica 3aeye diseases 0adysplasia 0aJapanese quails1 aNunoya, T.1 aTajima, M.1 aMizutani, M.0 tAvian pathology.g1997 Mar., v. 26, no. 1 p.53-61x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794597084191933Available from publisher's Web site  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02354naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245007800149300001400227520116000241650002101401650001401422650002701436650002401463650002001487650001501507650001301522650003901535650002701574650002501601650001301626650001501639650003101654650001301685650001601698653002201714700001501736700001301751773007801764852000901842930003301851945001301884946001101897655001201908IND2331632620221122142838.0030327e200303  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233163262DNAL7 a127335782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSonwalkar, R.D.10aRoles of silica gel in polycondensation of lactic acid in organic solvent  ap. 69-73.  aPoly(lactic acid) is among the most important biodegradable, biocompatible polymers. To explore the feasibility of making poly(lactic acid) through potentially more selective enzymatic methods, the lipase-catalyzed direct polycondensation of lactic acid in organic solvents was investigated. At 37 degrees C the reaction was found to favor nonpolar solvents with larger logP values and smaller log Sw/o values. The addition of silica gel appeared to greatly enhance the lactic acid conversion (up to 98%) and the lipase stability under the reaction condition. However, upon further investigations, the silica gel itself was found to catalyze the polycondensation, in addition to the role of water removal. The conversion catalyzed by silica gel alone was actually higher than that by silica gel + lipase (or lipase alone). Up to 93% conversion of the acid functional group (or about 99.5% conversion of lactic acid monomer) was obtained in 120 h with silica gel as the catalyst. The finding is especially significant for interpreting (or reconsidering) the results of many presumably enzyme-catalyzed organic-phase reactions in the presence of silica gel. 3abiodegradability 3acatalysts 3acondensation reactions 3aenzymatic treatment 3apolylactic acid 3asilica gel 3asolvents 2aBiocompatible Materialsxchemistry 2aLactic Acidxchemistry 2aLipasexpharmacology 2aPolymers 2aSilica Gel 2aSilicon Dioxidexchemistry 2aSolvents 2aTemperature 0apoly(lactic acid)1 aChen, C.C.1 aJu, L.K.0 tBioresource technology.g2003 Mar., v. 87, no. 1 p.69-73x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02411naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245013600147300001400283520072500297650002401022650001801046650001101064650001201075650001601087650001101103650001701114650001501131650001201146650001701158650001201175650001901187650001701206650010601223650001801329650002901347650001801376650002101394650004601415650001601461650002701477650003301504650003101537650002301568650002701591650002101618650002401639653001001663700001601673773007801689852000901767930003301776945001301809946001101822655001201833IND2332176120221122052137.0030424e200210  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233217612DNAL7 a121466462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReddy, C.S.K.10aEnhanced production of itaconic acid from corn starch and market refuse fruits by genetically manipulated Aspergillus terreus SKR10  ap. 69-71.  aA potent itaconic acid producing strain, Aspergillus terreus SKR10, was isolated from horticulture waste.

Itaconic acid yields of 28.5 +/- 2.2 and 31.0 +/- 1.7 gl(-1) were obtained with acid and alpha-amylase hydrolyzed corn starch. The efficiency of itaconic acid production by this wild type strain was improved by ultraviolet, chemical and mixed mutagenic treatments.

These two mutants were capable of producing twice the yield of itaconic acid as the parent strain. 3aAspergillus terreus 3aalpha-amylase 3aapples 3abananas 3acorn starch 3afruits 3ahorticulture 3ahydrolysis 3amarkets 3amutagenicity 3amutants 3aplant residues 3asolid wastes 2aAspergillusxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aBiotechnology 2aColchicinexpharmacology 2aCulture Media 2aFruitxchemistry 2aMethylnitronitrosoguanidinexpharmacology 2aMutagenesis 2aMutagensxpharmacology 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aSodium Azidexpharmacology 2aStarchxmetabolism 2aSuccinatesxmetabolism 2aUltraviolet Rays 2aZea maysxchemistry 0afruit1 aSingh, R.P.0 tBioresource technology.g2002 Oct., v. 85, no. 1 p.69-71x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02556naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245011000146300001400256520122200270650002101492650002301513650000901536650001401545650001201559650001101571650002301582650001401605650001101619650001301630650002501643650001901668650001701687650001401704650001301718650005101731650001201782650001001794651001001804651001001814700002001824700001501844700002001859700001501879773007801894852000901972930003301981945001302014946001102027655001202038IND2329661020221122040245.0021112e200301  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232966102DNAL7 a124210112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStroup, J.A.10aComparison of growth and performance in upland and lowland switchgrass types to water and nitrogen stress  ap. 65-72.  aThe objective of the study was to examine lowland (Alamo and Kanlow) and upland (Blackwell and Caddo) cultivars of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) for differences in response to water deficit and nitrogen fertilizer. Cultivars were grown in pots with fritted clay at two water levels: well watered and deficit conditions (-0.1 and -1.0 MPa) and two nitrogen levels (10 and 100 kg ha-1). Nitrogen determined growth potential of the cultivars more than water availability. The lowland cultivars produced greater biomass yields than upland cultivars. However, upland cultivars showed a smaller response to drought stress. Under water stress conditions all cultivars exhibited a higher leaf percentage of total dry matter (DM), with the upland cultivars having the highest leaf percentage of total DM. Nitrogen proved to have more of an effect on single-leaf photosynthesis rates than water. Alamo demonstrated the greatest biomass production among all cultivars. The differences found between the two lowland cultivars suggest that Alamo would be better suited for forage and biomass production in central Texas, being a higher producer under drought and non-drought conditions than Kanlow as well as upland cultivars. 3aPanicum virgatum 3abiomass production 3aclay 3acultivars 3adrought 3aforage 3agrowth performance 3ahighlands 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aphotosynthesis 3awater stress 2aGeography 2aNitrogen 2aPoaceaexclassificationxgrowth & development. 2aSeasons 2aWater 3aTexas 0aTexas1 aSanderson, M.A.1 aMuir, J.P.1 aMcFarland, M.J.1 aReed, R.L.0 tBioresource technology.g2003 Jan., v. 86, no. 1 p.65-72x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20030304b20030311c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02717naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245013200145300001400277500001500291520122300306650001401529650001701543650002301560650002401583650001101607650001901618650000901637650001901646650000901665650002801674650001501702650001701717650000701734650001401741650004801755650005401803650002201857650002501879650002901904650002101933651000901954651000901963653002501972700001701997700001702014773007802031852000902109930003302118945001302151946001102164655001202175IND2329658620221122040130.0021112e200301  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232965862DNAL7 a124210022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoumare, M.10aEffects of a municipal solid waste compost and mineral fertilization on plant growth in two tropical agricultural soils of Mali  ap. 15-20.  a2019-12-05  aA pot experiment was conducted to compare the effects of compost and mineral fertilization on the growth and chemical composition of ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) in two Malian agricultural soils (Baguineda, abbreviated as Bgda, 12 degrees 23'S, 7 degrees 45' W and Gao, 16 degrees 18' N, 0 degrees GM). Treatments included: control, NPK alone, NPK + C25, NPK + C50, NPK + C100, PK + C50, NK + C50, NP + C50, K + C50, P + C50, N + C50 and C50 alone, where NPK represents the non-modified Hoagland's solution (corresponding to 271, 95 and 172 kg/ha of N, P and K respectively) and C25, C50 and C100 the different rates (25, 50 and 100 T/ha) of compost. Compost and mineral fertilization significantly increased dry matter production. The application of 50 T/ha of compost alone increased the dry matter yield by 100% and 17.5% while mineral NPK alone, by 69.7 and 65% for Gao and Bgda soils, respectively. The combination of compost and mineral NPK (NPK + C25 for Gao and NPK + C50 for Bgda) showed the highest crop yields. Increases in soil organic carbon, available P, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, K and pH were observed in treatments with compost. Therefore, compost appeared to be a good supplier of nutrients for tropical soils. 3amanganese 3aplant growth 3aagricultural soils 3asoil organic carbon 3acopper 3atropical soils 3azinc 3aLolium perenne 3airon 3adry matter accumulation 3acrop yield 3aMSW composts 3apH 3anutrients 2aLoliumxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aMineralsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aPlant Development 2aPlantsxdrug effects 2aRefuse Disposalxmethods 2aTropical Climate 3aMali 0aMali 0achemical composition1 aTack, F.M.G.1 aVerloo, M.G.0 tBioresource technology.g2003 Jan., v. 86, no. 1 p.15-20x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20030304b20030311c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02994naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002200129245009300151300001400244520138200258650002401640650002301664650001501687650001001702650002201712650000901734650001601743650002301759650002001782650000901802650001601811650001601827650001601843650001101859650001401870650002601884650001401910650001601924650001601940650001201956650003501968650002402003650001002027650002202037650002502059650001502084650001302099650001602112650001302128653002302141700002002164700002002184700002002204773007802224852000902302930003302311945001302344946001102357655001202368IND2329660420221122025655.0021112e200301  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232966042DNAL7 a124210072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuthukrishnan, N.10aRecycling spent larval food of Corcyra cephalonica Stainton as a broiler feed ingredient  ap. 39-44.  aIn commercial insectaries, large-scale production of rice moth, Corcyra cephalonica Stainton in pearl millet grain medium leads to an extensive accumulation of spent C. cephalonica larval medium (CLM). Experiments were conducted to determine whether inclusion of CLM for corn in the standard broiler diet (SBD) could ensure normal growth and development of broilers. Chemical analysis revealed that CLM diets met the nutritional requirements as of SBD. CLM diet contained no aflatoxin as well. Biological experiments were conducted to study the suitability of CLM diet in different combinations with SBD at 100% + 0%, 75% + 25%, 50% + 50%, 25% + 75% and 0% + 100% w/w without any nutritional change, and after nutritional modification with corn starch. CLM replacement was based on the corn content of the basal diet. Birds preferred SBD 100% and SBD 75% + CLM 25% nutritionally unchanged diets, and showed higher growth rate and weight gain. These parameters were significantly lower in other diet combinations. Modified isoenergetic CLM based diets in all the combinations, however, contributed higher feed intake and resulted in more weight gain as of SBD. Furthermore, none of treatments in both experiments yielded bird mortalities. The experimental CLM diets except SBD 75% + CLM 25% in both experiments were cost effective and contributed lower diet cost/kg weight gain. 3aCorcyra cephalonica 3aPennisetum glaucum 3aaflatoxins 3abirds 3achemical analysis 3acorn 3acorn starch 3acost effectiveness 3acrop production 3adiet 3afeed intake 3aingredients 3ainsectaries 3alarvae 3amortality 3anutrient requirements 3arecycling 3aweight gain 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aChickensxgrowth & development 2aDietary Supplements 2aLarva 2aMothsxphysiology 2aOryzaxparasitology. 2aPlant Oils 2aTriticum 2aWeight Gain 2aZea mays 0aspent larval media1 aPorchezhian, T.1 aVenugopal, M.S.1 aJanarthanan, R.0 tBioresource technology.g2003 Jan., v. 86, no. 1 p.39-44x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20030304b20030311c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02620naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245014100143300001600284520076500300650001501065650002601080650002301106650001201129650001101141650001201152650002501164650002001189650001401209650001401223650001301237650001401250650001501264650001401279650002601293650001401319650001201333650002401345650001401369650006601383650001601449650002201465650002601487650002601513650002501539650002701564650002601591650002901617650003201646650002401678650002201702651001601724651001601740653002301756700001701779700001601796773008001812852000901892930003301901945001301934946001101947655001201958IND2330490520221122003615.0030121e200212  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233049052DNAL7 a123654952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, L.B.10aBiomass production and nutrient cycling in Eucalyptus short rotation energy forests in New Zealand.

Several kinetics equations are employed to describe the effects of PVA on the crystallization properties of PA6 in PA6/PVA blends in detail. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aalcohols 3acrystallization 3aequations 3aphysics 3apolyamides1 aYeh, Jen-Taut1 aWang, Ke1 aFu, Qiang0 tJournal of polymer science.g2008 July 01, v. 46, no. 13 p.1360-1368dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-62667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/polb.214703Available from publisher's Web site  a20080530b20080606c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02157naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245007700143300001400220520086200234650002501096650001701121650001801138650001401156650001501170650001601185650001601201650001001217650006901227650006401296650003301360650001001393650002101403650002901424653002401453653002501477653002201502700001601524700001501540773007801555852000901633930003301642945001301675946001101688655001201699IND2331630420221121090131.0030327e200303  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233163042DNAL7 a127335732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNegro, C.10aPhenolic compounds and antioxidant activity from red grape marc extracts  ap. 41-44.  aThe aims of this work were to determine the amounts of the different classes of phenolic compounds in an ethanolic extract from red grape marc and its components, peels and seeds, and to evaluate their antioxidant activities by the beta-carotene bleaching test for their utilization as natural antioxidants. The results showed that red grape marc was rich in polyphenol compounds with a clear antioxidant activity. The extracts, in fact, at very low concentration (20 ppm) in total phenols showed an antioxidant activity (AA) higher than 43% on average, while at higher concentration (80-160 ppm) all the fractions had an AA comparable to that of butlylated-hydroxytoluene. Grape seeds seemed to give the highest contribution to such AA, as they contained high quantities of proanthocyanidines, a type of flavonoid known for its high antioxidant properties. 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abeta-carotene 3ableaching 3aflavonoids 3agrape seeds 3apolyphenols 3aseeds 2aAntioxidantsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aPhenolsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aSeeds 2aVitisxchemistry 2abeta Carotenexchemistry 0awinemaking residues 0anatural antioxidants 0awinemaking wastes1 aTommasi, L.1 aMiceli, A.0 tBioresource technology.g2003 Mar., v. 87, no. 1 p.41-44x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle04841naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165100001900174245017100193300001800364500005100382500002400433500001500457520234800472650002302820650001602843650002202859650001302881650001502894650002602909650001802935650001902953650001102972650002502983650002003008650005303028650002303081650001503104650001003119650000903129650002203138650002903160650002303189650002803212650001903240650003203259650001103291650001003302650001103312650001803323650000903341650001603350650002603366650002203392650002303414650001803437650001703455650002703472650001503499650002403514650001603538650002503554651001803579653002203597653001603619653001803635700001503653700001103668700001703679773013703696852000903833856008603842930003303928945002503961946001303986655001203999IND4399613420221121053851.0080103e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439961342DNAL7 a179643082pmid7 a10.1016/j.jada.2007.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT0001 aStimpson, J.P.10aNeighborhood Deprivation Is Associated with Lower Levels of Serum Carotenoids among Adults Participating in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey  ap. 1895-1902.  aIn the special issue: Hunger and malnutrition.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aObjective: This study tested the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation will be associated with lower levels of serum carotenoids in comparison with wealthy residential areas. Design: Cross-sectional, nationally representative survey data were used to assess the relationship between neighborhood level socioeconomic status and serum carotenoids. Subjects: Seventeen thousand two participants aged 17 years and older from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were linked with 1990 census data. Main outcome measures: Serum levels of lycopene, β-carotene, α-carotene, lutein/zeaxanthin, and β-cryptoxanthin. Statistical analysis: Multivariate linear regression was used to model the association of serum carotenoids and neighborhood deprivation, which is a summary index of 11 indicators for tract level socioeconomic status. Adjustments are made for individual level age, sex, years of education, household income, employment, race/ethnicity, body mass index, serum cotinine, alcohol use, physical activity, and serum cholesterol. Results: Multivariate analysis revealed a negative and statistically significant association between high levels of neighborhood deprivation and β-carotene (β=-2.98 μg/dL [-0.06 micromol/L], P=0.00), α-carotene (β=-1.28 μg/dL [-0.02 micromol/L], P=<0.0001), lutein/zeaxanthin (-1.69 μg/dL [-0.03 micromol/L], P=0.00, β-cryptoxanthin (β=-1.34 μg/dL [-0.02 micromol/L], P<0.0001), and total carotenoids (β=-8.20 μg/dL, P=<0.0001). Lycopene was not related to neighborhood deprivation. Adjusted mean levels of carotenoids for high deprivation neighborhoods were lower than neighborhoods with low deprivation: β-carotene=8.72 μg/dL [0.16 micromol/L] vs 20.64 μg/dL [0.38 micromol/L], α-carotene=0.44 μg/dL [0.008 micromol/L] vs 5.56 μg/dL [0.10 micromol/L], lutein/zeaxanthin=13.79 μg/dL [0.24 micromol/L] vs 20.55 μg/dL [0.36 micromol/L], β-cryptoxanthin=4.57 μg/dL [0.08 micromol/L] vs 9.93 μg/dL [0.18 micromol/L], lycopene=22.07 μg/dL [0.41 micromol/L] vs 25.63 μg/dL [0.48 micromol/L], and total=49.56 μg/dL vs 82.36 μg/dL. Conclusions: Neighborhood deprivation was associated with lower serum levels of carotenoids. There was a substantial disparity between low deprivation and high deprivation residential areas with respect to fruit and vegetable intake. 3anutritional status 3ablood serum 3aresidential areas 3alycopene 3azeaxanthin 3alow income households 3abeta-carotene 3aalpha-carotene 3alutein 3asocioeconomic status 3ahuman nutrition 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3abeta-cryptoxanthin 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aCarotenoidsxblood 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aCryptoxanthins 2aDietxeconomicsxstandards. 2aFemale 2aFruit 2aHumans 2aLuteinxblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aNutrition Surveys 2aNutritional Status 2aPoverty Areas 2aSocial Class 2aSocioeconomic Factors. 2aVegetables 2aXanthophyllsxblood 2aZeaxanthins 2abeta Carotenexblood 0aUnited States 0aincome and wealth 0acarotenoids 0aneighborhoods1 aNash, A.C.1 aJu, H.1 aEschbach, K.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2007 Nov., v. 107, no. 11 p.1895-1902dAmerican Dietetic Associationx0002-82237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2007.08.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/03/28  aOther US 7aarticle03055naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100001500186245017200201300001600373500002400389506007600413520115800489506003701647650001901684650001301703650001501716650001401731650002601745650001001771650002101781650001101802650000901813650002101822650001401843650001301857650001101870650002201881650002301903650002601926650002701952650003101979650002902010650001402039650005202053650004302105700002002148700001402168700002502182700001802207700001702225700001502242700001902257773010802276852000902384856004802393655001202441IND4399400420221207110357.0071226e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439940042DNAL7 a179851102pmid7 aPMC27557882pmcid7 a10.1007/s00122-007-0667-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzajko, K.14aThe novel gene Ny-1 on potato chromosome IX confers hypersensitive resistance to Potato virus Y and is an alternative to Ry genes in potato breeding for PVY resistance  ap. 297-303.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHypersensitive resistance (HR) is an efficient defense strategy in plants that restricts pathogen growth and can be activated during host as well as non-host interactions. HR involves programmed cell death and manifests itself in tissue collapse at the site of pathogen attack. A novel hypersensitivity gene, Ny-1, for resistance to Potato virus Y (PVY) was revealed in potato cultivar Rywal. This is the first gene that confers HR in potato plants both to common and necrotic strains of PVY. The locus Ny-1 mapped on the short arm of potato chromosome IX, where various resistance genes are clustered in Solanaceous genomes. Expression of HR was temperature-dependent in cv. Rywal. Strains PVYO and PVYN, including subgroups PVYNW and PVYNTN, were effectively localized when plants were grown at 20°C. At 28°C, plants were systemically infected but no symptoms were observed. In field trials, PVY was restricted to the inoculated leaves and PVY-free tubers were produced. Therefore, the gene Ny-1 can be useful for potato breeding as an alternative donor of PVY resistance, because it is efficacious in practice-like resistance conferred by Ry genes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPotato virus Y 3abreeding 3acell death 3acultivars 3afield experimentation 3ahosts 3ahypersensitivity 3aleaves 3aloci 3amultigene family 3apathogens 3apotatoes 3atubers 2aBreedingxmethods 2aChromosome Mapping 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aPlant Diseasesxvirology 2aPotyvirus 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSolanum tuberosumxgeneticsxvirology.1 aChrzanowska, M.1 aWitek, K.1 aStrzelczyk-Żyta, D.1 aZagórska, H.1 aGebhardt, C.1 aHennig, J.1 aMarczewski, W.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2008 Jan., v. 116, no. 2 p.297-303dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-007-0667-1 7aarticle02023naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001300129245013500142300001600277520082300293650002201116650001501138650001101153650001001164650003301174650002001207650001001227650001101237650001101248650001101259650001001270650001901280650001301299650001701312650002201329650003801351650001001389651001001399651001001409773008001419852000901499930003301508945001301541946001101554655001201565IND2332045920221121014513.0030418e200301  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233204592DNAL7 a126532822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArya, R.10aYield of Cassia angustifolia in combination with different tree species in a silvi-herbal trial under hot arid conditions in India  ap. 165-169.  aA silvi-herbal trial was conducted in the hot arid region of India to study the performance of a shrub (Cassia angustifolia) in combination with different tree species. The study area was frequented by frost. Leaf yield of C. angustifolia under different treatments was estimated. It was found that the shrubs produced a significantly higher yield of leaves in the vicinity of the tree species as compared to the shrubs at a far distance from the trees. This was perhaps because of more protection of crops near the canopy of the plants during frosts. The yield was not much affected by the variation of tree species indicating that the effect of tree-shrub combination was not profound. C. angustifolia as inter-crop provides support to the farming system by way of conferring stability and generating assured income. 3aSenna alexandrina 3aarid zones 3acanopy 3acrops 3adry environmental conditions 3afarming systems 3afrost 3aincome 3aleaves 3ashrubs 3atrees 2aDesert Climate 2aForestry 2aPlant Leaves 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aSenna Plantxgrowth & development 2aTrees 3aIndia 0aIndia0 tBioresource technology.g2003 Jan., v. 86, no. 2 p.165-169x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03639naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165100001600174245008400190300001800274500005100292500002400343500001500367520147300382650001701855650001601872650002301888650002701911650001801938650002601956650001801982650001502000650001602015650001202031650002402043650002802067650003202095650002002127650002102147650002102168650001102189650002102200650001202221650001802233650003002251650002602281651001502307651001502322651001602337653001202353653000902365653001102374653003102385653001802416653002202434653001902456653001802475653002002493653001602513653001902529700001702548700001302565773013702578852000902715856008602724930003302810945002502843946001302868655001202881IND4399614220221121014507.0080103e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439961422DNAL7 a179643102pmid7 a10.1016/j.jada.2007.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT0001 aCassady, D.10aIs Price a Barrier to Eating More Fruits and Vegetables for Low-Income Families  ap. 1909-1915.  aIn the special issue: Hunger and malnutrition.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aObjective: To determine if price is a barrier to fruit and vegetable consumption for low-income families by comparing the average cost of a market basket of fruits and vegetables from the Thrifty Food Plan and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 (2005 Dietary Guidelines), investigating variations in price by neighborhood income and by type of supermarket, and estimating the influence of a 2005 Dietary Guidelines fruit and vegetable basket on the food budget of a low-income family. Design: A market basket survey was conducted at 25 supermarkets across three time periods to allow for seasonal variation in produce prices. Setting: Stores were selected from census tracts with a variety of income levels in Sacramento, CA, and Los Angeles, CA. Main outcome measures: The average cost of a Thrifty Food Plan and 2005 Dietary Guidelines market basket for fruits and vegetables. Statistical analyses performed: Student t tests were used to compare the mean cost of market baskets. Results: The 2005 Dietary Guidelines market basket cost 4% less than the Thrifty Food Plan (P<0.001), and was significantly less expensive in low-income areas at $65 (P<0.05), and in bulk supermarkets at $59 (P<0.05). The 2005 Dietary Guidelines market basket would require a low-income family to devote 43% to 70% of their food budget to fruits and vegetables. Conclusions: Public policies should examine ways to make fruits and vegetables more affordable to low-income families. 3asupermarkets 3afood intake 3aDietary Guidelines 3ageographical variation 3aaffordability 3alow income households 3ameal planning 3avegetables 3afood prices 2aBudgets 2aCommercexeconomics 2aCosts and Cost Analysis 2aDietxeconomicsxstandards. 2aFoodxeconomics 2aFruitxeconomics 2aHealth Promotion 2aHumans 2aNutrition Policy 2aPoverty 2aPublic Policy 2aStatistics, Nonparametric 2aVegetablesxeconomics 3aCalifornia 0aCalifornia 0aLos Angeles 0aproduce 0adiet 0aincome 0afamily resource management 0afruits (food) 0aThrifty Food Plan 0amarket baskets 0aneighborhoods 0ahuman nutrition 0afood guides 0aprice barriers1 aJetter, K.M.1 aCulp, J.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2007 Nov., v. 107, no. 11 p.1909-1915dAmerican Dietetic Associationx0002-82237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2007.08.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/03/28  aOther US 7aarticle01694naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245009100132300001400223500002600237520072900263650001500992650001201007650001901019650002001038650002201058650002801080650001001108653001501118653001501133773014901148852000901297939003301306945000801339946000901347655001201356991559778790742620221121014513.0810709e198105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE819169742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenson, W.L.10aCosts and impacts of proposed restrictions on use of feed additives in poultry rations  ap. 38-49.  aPredominantly tables.  aThe use of feed additives, routinely used in poultry rations since the 1940's is now being questioned. Concern over the safety of using such additives had led to the proposal that their use be further restricted. Excessive use may pose human health or safety problems but restrictions may lower production efficiency and result in higher costs to consumers. This article sets forth some of these considerations and briefly summarizes the findings of a recent UDSA analysis of the economic impact of restricting feed additives in the poultry industry. It reviews the basis for weighing these conflicting interests and points out how little concrete information is available with which to evaluate the impacts of restrictions. 3astatistics 3apoultry 3afeed additives 3aeconomic impact 3acosts and returns 3ahuman health and safety 3afeeds 0aproduction 0aregulation0 tPoultry and egg situation PES - United States Dept. of Agriculture, Economics and Statistics Service.g1981 May, v. 310 p.38-49x0032-57087nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810709c00000000  aAGE  aUSDA 7aarticle03978naa a2200973 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174100001700183245012600200300001800326500005100344500002400395500001500419520098200434650001701416650002301433650001801456650002301474650001601497650002001513650002001533650001901553650001301572650002101585650002101606650001501627650002601642650001901668650001801687650001801705650002501723650001201748650001401760650002301774650001801797650002301815650001501838650002801853650002601881650001901907650001901926650005801945650002102003650002802024650002502052650003802077650004902115650001102164650002302175650003902198650002102237650001102258650001202269650001102281650002702292650005602319650005902375650002002434650000902454650002002463650001702483650002602500650002802526650001202554653002402566653001602590653001602606653002402622653002702646653001602673773013702689852000902826856008602835930003302921945002502954946001302979655001202992IND4399614920221121014643.0080103e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439961492DNAL7 a179643132pmid7 a10.1016/j.jada.2007.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ200 0aX3801 aMarino, D.D.10aWater and Food Safety in the Developing World: Global Implications for Health and Nutrition of Infants and Young Children  ap. 1930-1934.  aIn the special issue: Hunger and malnutrition.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aContaminated water and food are major causes of malnutrition and mortality in the developing world, particularly among children. Infants are most vulnerable to diarrheal illnesses when introduced to fluids and foods as they are weaned from breastfeeding to a mixed diet. There is scant literature about the role of nutrition professionals in addressing this problem. Considerable progress has been made in identifying strategies to prevent diarrhea in children. Strategies include implementing low-technology methods of sanitizing water, emphasizing the benefits of breastfeeding, protecting prepared foods from unclean environments, and educating and motivating food preparers. Resolution of water and food safety problems requires a collaborative interdisciplinary approach among health professionals and involvement of community leaders. Dietetic professionals have the training to empower individuals and communities with skills to create a safe water and food environment. 3amalnutrition 3aat-risk population 3anutritionists 3adisease prevention 3amethodology 3afood sanitation 3achild nutrition 3abreast feeding 3adiarrhea 3ahealth promotion 3ainfant nutrition 3adietitians 3afood safety education 3ahuman diseases 3awater quality 3ahealth status 3adeveloping countries 3aweaning 3amortality 3anutritional status 3afood handling 3afood contamination 3aleadership 3amicrobial contamination 3acitizen participation 3afood pathogens 2aBreast Feeding 2aChild Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxphysiology 2aChild, Preschool 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aDeveloping Countries 2aDiarrheaxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aDiarrhea, Infantilexepidemiologyxetiology. 2aFemale 2aFood Contamination 2aFood Handlingxmethodsxstandards. 2aHealth Education 2aHumans 2aHygiene 2aInfant 2aInfant Foodxstandards 2aInfant Nutrition Disordersxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aInfant Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxphysiology 2aInfant, Newborn 2aMale 2aRisk Assessment 2aRisk Factors 2aSocioeconomic Factors 2aWater Supplyxstandards 2aWeaning 0adiarrheal illnesses 0arisk groups 0afood safety 0ahealth care workers 0alow technology methods 0anew methods0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2007 Nov., v. 107, no. 11 p.1930-1934dAmerican Dietetic Associationx0002-82237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2007.08.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/03/28  aOther US 7aarticle02571naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245012100147300001400268520108800282650002401370650002401394650001201418650002701430650001001457650002301467650001601490650000701506650001901513650001001532650002501542650001701567650003601584650003401620650001301654650003001667650003501697650003001732650003801762650003101800650002401831650002501855651001101880700001801891773007801909852000901987930003301996945001302029946001102042655001202053IND2332175820221120231221.0030424e200210  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233217582DNAL7 a121466432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersson, J.10aEvaluation of straw as a biofilm carrier in the methanogenic stage of two-stage anaerobic digestion of crop residues  ap. 51-56.  aStraw was evaluated as a biofilm carrier in the methanogenic stage of the two-stage anaerobic digestion of crop residues. Three reactor configurations were studied, a straw-packed-bed reactor, a glass packed-bed reactor and a reactor containing suspended plastic carriers. The reactor with the packed straw bed showed the best results. It had the highest methane production, 5.4 11(-1) d(-1), and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal ranged from 73-50% at organic loading rates from 2.4-25 g COD 1(-1) d(-1). The degradation pattern of volatile fatty acids showed that the degradation of propionate and longer-chain fatty acids was limiting at higher organic loading rates. A stable effluent pH showed that the packed-bed reactors had good ability to withstand the variations in load and volatile fatty acid concentrations that can occur in the two-stage process. The conclusion is that straw would work very well in the intended application. A further benefit is that straw is a common agricultural waste product and requires only limited resources concerning handling and cost. 3aagricultural wastes 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiofilm 3achemical oxygen demand 3aglass 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3apH 3apropionic acid 3astraw 3avolatile fatty acids 2aAnaerobiosis 2aBacteria, Anaerobicxmetabolism 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiofilms 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aCrops, Agriculturalxchemistry 2aEuryarchaeotaxmetabolism 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexmetabolism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMethanexmetabolism 2aSewagexmicrobiology 0aSweden1 aBjornsson, L.0 tBioresource technology.g2002 Oct., v. 85, no. 1 p.51-56x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02585naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245016500145300001600310520114800326650002501474650002201499650002001521650001401541650001201555650001201567650003101579650002301610650001401633650001101647650001301658650001001671650003601681650003001717650000901747650001701756650002101773650001901794650002801813650002301841650006201864700001901926773008001945852000902025930003302034945001302067946001102080655001202091IND2332046320221120220129.0030418e200301  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233204632DNAL7 a126532862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, L.P.10aEffects of Alternaria triticina and foliar fly ash deposition on growth, yield, photosynthetic pigments, protein and lysine contents of three cultivars of wheat  ap. 189-192.  aA greenhouse experiment was conducted to study the effects of Alternaria triticina with and without foliar dusting of fly ash (0.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 g plant-1/day-1) on the growth, yield, photosynthetic pigments, protein and lysine contents of three cultivars of wheat, Triticum aestivum.

In growth room trials, Pseudomonas fluorescens Biotype F isolate DF37 significantly reduced the incidence, severity, and vascular discoloration of Verticillium wilt in both cultivars Kennebec and Russet Burbank over two seasons. Bacillus pumulis isolate M1 reduced wilt parameters only on cultivar Kennebec. Among the plant extracts tested, Canada milkvetch extract (MVE) was the most effective in reducing the wilt (55-84% reduction relative to the control). MVE reduced disease regardless of the method of application (incorporation into soil versus seed coating). In the first year of field testing, bacterial treatment DF37 and plant extract MVE were effective in reducing Verticillium wilt on Russet Burbank and Kennebec, respectively. Reductions in percent infection and vascular discoloration were estimated at 26% and 67% relative to the non-treated control for DF37 and 45% and 55% for MVE, respectively. In the second year of field trials, bacterial isolates DF37 and M1, and plant extract MVE reduced all wilt parameters by percentages ranging from 19% to 31% and increased yield (18%) on cultivar Kennebec. Bacterial isolate DF37 also reduced wilt (29-43%) and increased yield (24%) on cultivar Russet Burbank. 3afungal antagonists 3acultivars 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aplant extracts 3adisease control 3avarietal resistance 3apotatoes 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aVerticillium wilt 3aVerticillium dahliae 3abacteria 3aantifungal properties 3aManitoba 0abiological control agents1 aEl Hadrami, A.1 aAdams, L.R.1 aTenuta, M.1 aDaayt, F.0 tBiological control.g2008 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.90-100dAcademic Pressx1049-96447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2007.10.0203Available from publisher's Web site  a20080428b20080502c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/04/28  aOther US 7aarticle02381naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245015000169300001600319520126400335650002301599650002001622650002501642650001901667650001901686650001101705650002401716650002101740650001001761653002601771653002101797773009101818852000901909856005701918939003301975946001102008655001202019IND8905098320221120184745.0890915e198905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890509832DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0877822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurphy, R.10aWater flow across the sieve tube boundary: estimating turgor and some implications for phloem loading and unloading. IV. Root tips and seed coats  ap. 571-579.  aIn the present paper, the theory developed in Part I of this series is applied to seed coats of Phaseolus vulgaris and some combined data on root tips of Hordeum distichum and Hordeum vulgare. Because of the large back-pressures implied, it is concluded that phloem transport into these primary sinks would be physiologically impossible in the absence of a symplastic pathway for the unloading of water from sieve elements. In this case, unloading of water and sucrose will occur predominantly as a pressure-driven flow of solution through plasmodesmata, although diffusion can contribute significantly to the plasmodesmatal sucrose flux. At least 20% of the plasmodesmata connecting sieve elements and adjacent cells must be unobstructed if large changes in turgor and osmotic pressure are to be avoided. Depending on the membrane area available for water fluxes, it is possible that the difference in water potential across the sieve-tube plasmalemma can lead to significant errors when axial turgor gradients are estimated from gradients of osmotic pressure and external water potential. The magnitude and even the sign of these errors is uncertain, but it is possible that sieve-tube turgor pressures will be significantly underestimated in primary sinks. 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aHordeum vulgare 3aroot water potential 3aphloem loading 3asieve elements 3aturgor 3amathematical models 3aosmotic pressure 3atesta 0awater flow resistance 0amunch hypothesis0 tAnnals of botany.g1989 May, v. 63, no. 5 p.571-579wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a087782  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01933naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009300127300001600220500002300236500001500259520104200274650002101316650001901337650003601356650001601392650003701408653001601445653001501461773009001476852000901566939003301575946001101608655001201619IND8905093420221120174307.0890919e198903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890509342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReynolds, T.10aComparative effects of heterocyclic compounds on inhibition of lettuce fruit germination  ap. 391-404.  aLiterature review.  a2019-12-04  aThe molecules of many biologically active plant constituents contain heterocyclic ring systems. Inhibitory effects of a number of heterocyclic compounds and their alicyclic and open-chain analogues on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Great Lakes) germination were therefore determined under specified conditions. The most obvious property which correlates chemical structure with biological activity is lipophilicity, as was found in previous studies. However, other less obvious factors play a part. The inhibitory activity of coumarin, for instance, is much greater than would be expected in comparison with compounds of related structures. In general, substitution of a carbon atom in a ring structure by oxygen or nitrogen has either little effect or a lowering effect on activity, unless the increased solubility in water allows an inhibitory concentration to be reached which did not occur with the carbocyclic compound. However, introduction of unsaturation increases activity markedly, especially with some of the indole compounds. 3aseed germination 3aLactuca sativa 3aheterocyclic nitrogen compounds 3aallelopathy 3astructure-activity relationships 0agermination 0ainhibitors0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1989 Mar., v. 40, no. 212 p.391-404x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02267naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002900152245010700181300001800288520096700306650001001273650002101283650001701304650001801321650001101339650003401350650001301384650002401397650001901421650002301440650000901463650003401472653002301506653001501529700001801544773015001562852000901712856009201721930003301813946001101846655001201857IND4428943420221120174401.0091120e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442894342DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2009.02083.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajumdar, Ranendra Kumar10aEvaluation of the influence of inert atmosphere packaging on the quality of salt-fermented Indian shad  ap. 2554-2560.  aLona-ilish, is a traditional salt-fermented fish product, made exclusively from Hilsa (Tenualosa ilisha).

In this work, the influence of the light intensity and urea supplementation as a nitrogen source using fed-batch cultivation for S. platensis growth and chlorophyll content was examined. Cultivations were carried out in 5 l open tanks, at 30 +/- 1 degrees C. Response surface methodology was utilized for analysis of the results, and models were obtained for biomass productivity, nitrogen-cell conversion factor and chlorophyll productivity. The best cellular growth was observed with 500 mg/l of urea at a light intensity of 5600 lx, whereas the highest concentration of chlorophyll in the biomass was observed with 500 mg/l of urea at a light intensity of 1400 lx. Overall, the best chlorophyll productivity was observed with 500 mg/l of urea at a light intensity of 3500 lx, providing the optimal balance between the cellular growth and the biomass chlorophyll content. 3abiosynthesis 3anitrogen 3acell culture 3alight intensity 3abiological production 3aArthrospira platensis 3aurea 3achlorophyll 3apigments 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBiomass 2aBioreactors 2aChlorophyllxbiosynthesis 2aCyanobacteriaxmetabolism 2aLight 2aModels, Biological 2aNitrogen 2aTime Factors 2aUreaxmetabolism 0anitrogen source 0aSpirulina platensis1 aDanesi, E.D.G.1 aCarvalho, J.C.M. de1 aSato, S.0 tBioresource technology.g2004 Apr., v. 92, no. 2 p.133-141x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20050815b00000000c00000000  aINDdGHKe2005/06/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02481naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001600146245009300162300001600255500001500271520118100286650001801467650001401485650002401499650002201523650001301545650001601558650001401574650002401588650001901612650001301631650002501644650002701669650002401696650002101720653002301741653001701764653002901781700001701810700001501827773007901842852000901921930003301930945002501963946001101988655001201999IND4367683420221120072453.0050315e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436768342DNAL7 a147661642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In the present paper, a comparison is made of different basic catalysts (sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide) for methanolysis of sunflower oil. All the reactions were carried out under the same experimental conditions in a batch stirred reactor and the subsequent separation and purification stages in a decanter. The analytical methods included gas chromatography and the determination of fat and oil conventional parameters. The biodiesel purity was near 100 wt.% for all catalysts. However, near 100 wt.% biodiesel yields were only obtained with the methoxide catalysts. According to the material balance of the process, yield losses were due to triglyceride saponification and methyl ester dissolution in glycerol. Obtained biodiesel met the measured specifications, except for the iodine value, according to the German and EU draft standards. Although all the transesterification reactions were quite rapid and the biodiesel layers achieved nearly 100% methyl ester concentrations, the reactions using sodium hydroxide turned out the fastest. 3asunflower oil 3acatalysts 3atransesterification 3afatty acid esters 3abiofuels 2aBioreactors 2aCatalysis 2aChromatography, Gas 2aEsterification 2aKinetics 2aMethanolxmetabolism 2aPlant Oilsxmetabolism 2aPotassium Compounds 2aSodium Hydroxide 0achemical reactions 0amethanolysis 0afatty acid methyl esters1 aMartinez, M.1 aAracil, J.0 tBioresource technology.g2004 May, v. 92, no. 3 p.297-305x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20050812b00000000c00000000  aINDdGHKe2005/04/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02482naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001500163245008300178300001600261500001500277520095300292650002901245650001501274650001801289650002101307650002501328650002401353650002101377650001501398650001501413650002501428650001201453650003801465650003601503650002401539650000901563650001501572650001601587653002701603653002001630653002101650653001601671653002401687700001701711700001401728700001601742773008001758852000901838930003301847945002501880946001101905655001201916IND4367825420221120072502.0050322e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436782542DNAL7 a155016572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aTurner, C.10aInferring pathogen inactivation from the surface temperatures of compost heaps  ap. 521-529.  a2019-12-05  aA sufficiently high composting temperature should inactivate many common pathogens likely to be present in solid animal waste. Monitoring core temperatures inside compost heaps is not straightforward, which means that heaps are not generally monitored. An alternative is to monitor surface temperatures and use those data to infer core temperatures, and thus whether pathogen inactivation has occurred. This paper describes two methods (thermal imaging and thermocouples) for the measurement of surface temperature, and a modelling approach using time series analysis to predict the temperatures obtained in the core of aerated heaps of composting pig farmyard manure (FYM) from surface temperature data. The model was able to predict core temperatures in the heap quite closely for a period of time for well insulated parts of the heap, although predictions were further from observed values close to the surface of the heap and the aeration pipe. 3ainactivation temperature 3amonitoring 3athermocouples 3aanimal pathogens 3atime series analysis 3asurface temperature 3acomposted manure 3acomposting 3apig manure 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Physiological Phenomena 2aManurexanalysisxmicrobiology. 2aModels, Theoretical 2aSoil 2aSus scrofa 2aTemperature 0atemperature monitoring 0athermal imaging 0acore temperature 0atemperature 0apig farmyard manure1 aWilliams, A.1 aWhite, R.1 aTillett, R.0 tBioresource technology.g2005 Mar., v. 96, no. 5 p.521-529x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20080327b20080404c00000000  aINDdGHKe2005/06/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02532naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001800163245013700181300001600318500001500334520102500349650001701374650002201391650001901413650001301432650001601445650002601461650001601487650002101503650005701524650001601581650005501597650001601652650001701668650001301685650001301698650001301711650002501724650003501749653001701784700001201801700001701813700001401830773008001844852000901924930003301933945002501966946001101991655001202002IND4367827120221120063010.0050322e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436782712DNAL7 a156931712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Nutrients, especially nitrogen source have a marked influence on citrate productivity because it is an essential constituent of basal cell proteins. Citric acid has been known to be produced when the nitrogen source was the limiting factor. Ammonium nitrate was employed as a nitrogen source in the present study and batch culture experiments were carried out under various concentrations of ammonium nitrate. Specific growth rate was decreased and the biosynthesis of citric acid was delayed at higher concentrations of ammonium nitrate. Specific citric acid production rate was the highest when intracellular ammonium ion concentration was between 2.0 and 3.0 mmol g(-1) cells. Citrate production was however, stopped when intracellular ammonium ion concentration decreased below 1.0 mmol g(-1) cell. 3afermentation 3aAspergillus niger 3a2-deoxyglucose 3anitrogen 3abioreactors 3abiological production 3acitric acid 3aammonium nitrate 2aAspergillus nigerxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBioreactors 2aCitric Acidxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aColorimetry 2aFermentation 2aKinetics 2aMolasses 2aNitrates 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultraviolet 0aoptimization1 aAli, S.1 aQadeer, M.A.1 aIqbal, J.0 tBioresource technology.g2005 Mar., v. 96, no. 5 p.645-648x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20080327b20080404c00000000  aINDdGHKe2005/06/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02802naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001300146245015900159300001600318520122400334650001301558650001501571650002501586650001901611650004401630650002601674650001501700650001201715650002301727650003601750650001601786650003801802650001201840650003101852650002401883650002301907650002501930650003501955650003501990650005302025650004302078700001702121773008002138852000902218930003302227945002502260946001102285655001202296IND4367827020221120062910.0050322e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436782702DNAL7 a155016722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aIsik, M.10aEffects of alkalinity and co-substrate on the performance of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor through decolorization of Congo Red azo dye  ap. 633-643.  aThe effect of substrate (glucose) concentrations and alkalinitiy (NaHCO3) on the decolorization of a synthetic wastewater containing Congo Red (CR) azo dye was performed in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB). Color removal efficiencies approaching 100% were obtained at glucose-COD concentrations varying between 0 and 3000 mg/l. The methane production rate and total aromatic amine (TAA) removal efficiencies were found to be 120 ml per day and 43%, respectively, while the color was completely removed during glucose-COD free operation of the UASB reactor. The complete decolorization of CR dye under co-substrate free operation could be attributed to TAA metabolism which may provide the electrons required for the cleavage of azo bond in CR dye exist in the UASB reactor. No significant differences in pH levels (6.6-7.4), methane production rates (2000-2700 ml/day) and COD removal efficiencies (82-90%) were obtained for NAHCO3 concentrations ranging between 550 and 3000 mg/l. However, decolorization efficiency remained at 100% with decreasing NaHCO3 concentrations as low as 250 mg/l in the feed. An alkalinity/COD ratio of 0.163 in the feed was suggested for simultaneous optimum COD and color removal. 3aazo dyes 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3adecolorization 3aupflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor 3aequipment performance 3aalkalinity 3aglucose 3amethane production 2aBacteria, Anaerobicxmetabolism 2aBioreactors 2aCongo Redxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGlucose 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMethanexmetabolism 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aSewagexmicrobiology 2aSodium Bicarbonatexmetabolism 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultraviolet 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolism1 aSponza, D.T.0 tBioresource technology.g2005 Mar., v. 96, no. 5 p.633-643x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20080327b20080404c00000000  aINDdGHKe2005/06/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02398naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001500163245011500178300001600293500001500309520078100324650002201105650002101127650002201148650001501170650001301185650002201198650002301220650002301243650001601266650000701282650001501289650001501304650003401319650002401353650002601377650003101403650001301434650002101447650002401468650003201492650001601524650002101540653002901561653001501590700001601605700001601621700001301637773008001650852000901730930003301739945002501772946001101797655001201808IND4367827420221120062936.0050322e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436782742DNAL7 a155887682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The resulting product was used as a novel adsorbent for the adsorption of herbicide paraquat from an aqueous solution in a continuously stirred adsorber and batch flasks, respectively. The results showed that the adsorption process could be well described by the pseudo-second-order reaction model. From the view of the negatively charged surface of diatomaceous earth and cationic property of paraquat, the results were also reasonable to be explained by physical adsorption in the ion-exchange process under the effects of pH and temperature. Further, it was found that the Freundlich model appeared to fit the isotherm data better than the Langmuir model. 3areaction kinetics 3abrewing industry 3awaste utilization 3aadsorbents 3aparaquat 3aindustrial wastes 3asorption isotherms 3adiatomaceous earth 3atemperature 3apH 3aadsorption 2aAdsorption 2aDiatomaceous Earthxchemistry 2aFeasibility Studies 2aHerbicidesxchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aModels, Chemical 2aParaquatxchemistry 2aSodium Hydroxidexchemistry 2aTemperature 2aWaterxchemistry 0aspent diatomaceous earth 0aherbicides1 aHsien, K.J.1 aChang, Y.M.1 aLo, C.C.0 tBioresource technology.g2005 Apr., v. 96, no. 6 p.657-663x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20080527b20080606c00000000  aINDdGHKe2005/06/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02947naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100002300180245006400203300001600267520139200283650001101675650001701686650002001703650001801723650002001741650002101761650002301782650004301805650001301848650002001861650001201881650003401893650001601927650002201943650003801965650002902003650002802032650001102060650002002071650002002091651001002111700001402121700002402135700001502159700002302174700001402197773008002211852000902291930003302300945002502333946001102358655001202369IND4367827320221120062837.0050322e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436782732DNAL7 a155887672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPerez-Espinosa, A.10aCo phytoavailability for tomato in amended calcareous soils  ap. 649-655.  aA plot study was conducted to assess changes in Co phytoavailability for a tomato cultivar grown on an agricultural soil (a Calcic Petrocalcid) amended with sewage sludge, under controlled conditions in South-eastern Spain. The experiment consisted of three main treatment blocks: (A) without organic fertilisation, (B) with addition of 60 t ha-1 and (C) 120 t ha-1 of sewage sludge. For each block (A, B, and C), four levels of Co (0, 50, 100 and 200 mg kg-1) were added, as CoCl2. Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, DTPA (0.005 M plus triethanolamine), ammonium acetate (1 N at pH 7), and water extractable fractions of the soils were analysed for all the plots. The time dependent Co accumulation in different parts (roots, stems, leaves, and fruits) of the tomato plants was studied. Soil Co seemed to be mainly in non-available forms, according to the low concentrations found in the water and ammonium acetate extracts, compared to DTPA. The gradient of Co accumulation in tomato plants was root > leaf > stem + branches > fruit, with a concentration in the edible parts ranging between 4 and 25 mg kg-1. The organic amendment enhanced the plant extraction of Co, this effect being more significant with time. Plant extraction efficiency decreased with increasing Co concentration in the soils. Co in fruit showed the best correlation with all the Co extraction pools in the soil. 3acobalt 3aheavy metals 3abioavailability 3asewage sludge 3asoil amendments 3acalcareous soils 3aagricultural soils 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3atomatoes 3abioaccumulation 2aCalcium 2aCobaltxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aFertilizers 2aFruitxmetabolism 2aSolanum lycopersicumxmetabolism. 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPlant Stemsxmetabolism 2aSewage 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSoil Pollutants 3aSpain1 aMoral, R.1 aMoreno-Caselles, J.1 aCortes, A.1 aPerez-Murcia, M.D.1 aGomez, I.0 tBioresource technology.g2005 Apr., v. 96, no. 6 p.649-655x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20080528b20080606c00000000  aINDdGHKe2005/06/22  aNon-US 7aarticle01925naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001900146245010000165300001600265520066000281650001100941650002300952650001000975650001500985650001601000650002101016650002701037650002101064650001101085650002001096650004501116651001101161700001701172700002001189700001701209700001701226700001901243700001601262700001901278773008001297852000901377930003301386945002501419946001101444655001201455IND4367826720221120062916.0050322e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436782672DNAL7 a155016682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The contact angle of the modified SHF decreased from 33.24° to 12.98°, whereas the atomic force microscopy image verified that the roughness of the modified films decreased and indicated that the HACC mixed colloids filled in the interstices on the surface of the SHF. A new method of capacitance was developed to characterize the electric charge value, the groups, and the microscopic conditions of the self-assembled SHF surface for the first time. Cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry exhibited that the capacitance of the SHF increased to 0.0196 F/g, which indicated the enhanced positively charged surface and increased the number of hydrophilic quaternary ammonium groups on the surface. Lipid adsorption analysis also revealed that the modified SHF possessed a weaker lipid adhesion ability and stronger lipid removal ability than those of the original SHF and hence showed promising features for application in ophthalmological products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aadsorption 3aatomic force microscopy 3acapacitance 3achitosan 3acolloids 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophilicity 3alipids 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3aroughness 3asilicone 3awettability 0aHydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride chitosan 0aWettability 0aSurface modification 0aElectrochemical method 0aLipid adhesion1 aWang, Xuejiao1 aQi, Jinxu1 aYao, Qian1 aOderinde, Olayinka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2050-09481 aYao, Zhen,1 aSong, Wei1 aShu, Weixia1 aChen, Ping1 aWang, Yihong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8538-21130 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Dec. 05, v. 558 p.422-428dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.08.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03493naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245010500178300001400283500001500297520178300312592002802095650001602123650002802139650001202167650001302179650001202192650001502204650002102219650001302240650001202253650002602265650001102291650002302302650003302325650002002358650001002378650002702388650001502415650001702430650003102447650001802478650000702496650002202503651001402525653001102539653001302550653001702563700002602580773023802606856008602844852000902930655001202939IND60544428720221123025841.0190416e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054442872DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-6339(15)30054-X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaridón, Juan Esteban10aQuality indicators in subtropical soils of Formosa, Argentina: Changes for agriculturization process  ap. 13-24.  a2019-12-06  aThe agriculturization process has been defined as the advance of annual crops in different environments, in competition with traditional land uses such as agriculture rotations with pastures. In Argentina and other countries agriculturization has different degrees of impact on natural resources. In the northeast region of the province of Formosa, Argentina, agriculturization includes deforestation (clear cutting, slash burning and plowing), technological improvements and changes in land use. Because of these alterations, it is necessary to define the state of the soil to evaluate its sustainability. This can be done by means of indicators, which are not universal; they differ according to the use, management and type of soils, weather conditions and ecosystems.The objectives of this paper are: (1) To identify quality indicators for subtropical Argiudolls and Hapludolls; (2) To determine which indicators related to organic matter are most affected during agriculturization.The changes produced in the Typic Hapludolls and Typic Argiudolls after 25 years of continuously using native forests, agriculture, fruit plantations and pastures were analyzed. These changes were in pH, electrical conductivity, total organic carbon, particulate organic carbon, total nitrogen, structural stability, hydraulic conductivity, respiration and dehydrogenase and urease and enzyme activity. Variables with significant differences between diverse uses were evaluated by multivariate methods, Principal Component Analysis, and Correlation Analysis. The results of this study showed that total organic carbon, particulate organic carbon, structural stability and dehydrogenase activity are the quality indicators most affected by agriculturization. All are related to organic matter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplantations 3aelectrical conductivity 3aburning 3aland use 3aforests 3aHapludolls 3anitrogen content 3apastures 3aplowing 3amultivariate analysis 3aurease 3awater conservation 3aprincipal component analysis 3aenzyme activity 3aslash 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aArgiudolls 3aclearcutting 3aparticulate organic carbon 3adeforestation 3apH 3asubtropical soils 3aArgentina 0acarbon 0aSoil use 0aSoil quality1 aCasas, Roberto Raúl,0 tInternational soil and water conservation research.g2014 Dec., v. 2, no. 4 p.13-24dElsevier B.V.aInternational Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation and China Water & Power PresswJournal:23246x2095-63397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-6339(15)30054-X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01889naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007900163300001400242520057300256592002800829650002000857650001400877650001800891650003600909650001500945650001200960650004400972650001201016653002201028653001601050653002601066653001501092653001201107700001501119700001401134700001701148700001401165700001601179700001401195700001501209773011601224856008201340852000901422655001201431IND60601269020221116195926.0190401e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060126902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2018.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xuegui10aPhytochemical and chemotaxonomic study on Medicago sativa L.

Samples from semitendinosus (ST), Longissimus dorsi (LD) and Psoas Major (PM) of Charollais breed were imaged by a pushbroom hyperspectral imaging system with a spectral range of 900–1700nm. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used for dimensionality reduction, wavelength selection and visualizing hyperspectral data. Six optimal wavelengths (934, 974, 1074, 1141, 1211 and 1308nm) were selected from the eigenvector plot of PCA and then used for discrimination purpose. The results showed that it was possible to discriminate lamb muscles with overall accuracy of 100% using NIR hyperspectral reflectance spectra. An image processing algorithm was also developed for visualizing classification results in a pixel-wise scale with a high overall accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abreeds 3adiscriminant analysis 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aimage analysis 3alambs 3alongissimus muscle 3amultivariate analysis 3aprincipal component analysis 3apsoas muscles 3areflectance 3awavelengths1 aElMasry, Gamal1 aSun, Da-Wen1 aAllen, Paul0 tJournal of food engineering.g2011 June, v. 104, no. 3 p.332-340dElsevier Ltdx0260-87747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245008700169300001600256520139400272592002801666650001701694650001701711650001101728650003801739650001501777650001701792650002201809650002201831650001201853650001301865650003001878653001801908653002501926653002701951653002001978653001501998700002402013700002102037700002002058700001702078700001502095700002302110773011002133856007902243852000902322655001202331IND60560121820221118194821.0180620e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056012182DNAL7 a10.1515/biol-2016-00492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurmanova, Vladimira10aImpact of HLA-G 14 bp polymorphism and soluble HLA-G level on kidney graft outcome  ap. 372-379.  aHuman leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) is a non-classical HLA class I protein with various immunosuppressive functions. Besides its profound effect to induce fetal tolerance, HLA-G has been also found to enhance graft acceptance. The aim of the study was to analyse the association between HLA-G 14 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism, soluble HLA-G level and kidney graft outcome in the Slovak population. We investigated 69 kidney transplant recipients aged 27–65 years. Out of this group, 37 recipients developed acute rejection, confirmed by biopsy, and 32 patients had stable allograft function. Plasma was obtained from recipients at 1 day before transplantation and analyzed by ELISA. Genotyping of HLA-G polymorphism was performed by PCR. Significantly higher pre-transplantation levels of sHLA-G were found in the group with stable allograft function in comparison to group with acute rejection (P = 0.0409). In the homozygous −14/−14 recipients with stable allograft function, significantly higher values of sHLA-G were determined in comparison to the recipients with acute rejection (P = 0.0052). The study revealed an association between 14 bp deletion polymorphism and soluble HLA-G level that is proportional to kidney graft acceptance. It is suggested that pre-transplantation levels of soluble HLA-G should be monitored as additional marker to predict kidney graft outcome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHLA antigens 3aallografting 3abiopsy 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenotyping 3ahomozygosity 3aimmunosuppression 3akidney transplant 3akidneys 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 0asoluble HLA-G 0agenetic polymorphism 0akidney transplantation 0aacute rejection 0agenotyping1 aBandzuchova, Helena1 aZilinska, Zuzana1 aTirpakova, Jana1 aKuba, Daniel1 aBuc, Milan1 aPolakova, Katarina0 tOpen life sciences.g2016 Jan. 1, v. 11, no. 1 p.372-379dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23145x2391-54127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biol-2016-00493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245020300170520105200373592002801425650001901453650001901472650002301491650002501514650000901539650002001548650001501568650003001583650002601613650001301639650001801652650001801670650002301688653004201711653001801753653002501771653001801796700001701814700001601831700001501847700001401862773011901876856008801995852000902083655001202092IND60678335920221120054637.0200509e20200310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067833592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1359762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Yongda10aEngineered bioactive nanoparticles incorporated biofunctionalized ECM/silk proteins based cardiac patches combined with MSCs for the repair of myocardial infarction: In vitro and in vivo evaluations  aThe development of cardiac patches by the combination of bioactive nano- and bio-materials with mesenchymal stem cells signifies an auspicious approach for the treatment of cardiac repair in myocardial infarction. In the present investigation, we study about the cardiac function of morphology improved gold nanoparticles combined with extracellular matrix/silk proteins for the cell proliferation and expansion of cardiomyocytes. The physico-chemical and morphological characteristics demonstrated that spherical and homogeneous Au particles are distributed on the matrix porous surface for providing favorable conductivity and biological influences in cardiac repair. The in vitro cell studies of prepared patches have established enhanced cell compatibility and retention of cardiomyocytes survival. The in vivo determinations imply that Au-ESF group decreases infarct size to 65% from 89% in control group. These developed cardiac patches can be highly suitable in the cardiac regeneration and offer new platform in cardiac tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiac output 3acardiomyocytes 3acell proliferation 3aextracellular matrix 3agold 3ain vivo studies 3ainfarction 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3amyocardial infarction 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3asilk proteins 3atissue engineering 0aCardiac repair: myocardial infraction 0aNanoparticles 0aExtracellular matrix 0aSilk proteins1 aHong, Meiman1 aDai, Ruozhu1 aWu, Haiyun1 aZhu, Ping0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Mar. 10, v. 707 p.135976-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1359763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02087naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014000167300001400307520091400321592002801235650001601263650001601279650001201295650001101307650001601318650001701334650001001351653001001361653002101371653001601392653002201408700002301430700002001453700002101473773011701494856008101611852000901692655001201701IND60601269120221116200017.0180706e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060126912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2012.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEscudé, Élise10aWhy all vole molars (Arvicolinae, Rodentia) are informative to be considered as proxy for Quaternary paleoenvironmental reconstructions  ap. 11-23.  aRodents are considered as a good model and as a good proxy to characterise Quaternary environments. Molars and incisors are the best-preserved remains and are found in abundance in the fossil record. Since several decades, the lower molars are mostly used for specific determinations. Instead of using qualitative and descriptive characters, morphometric methods provide now a general quantitative description of shape. Applying these new morphometric methods (outline analysis), we demonstrate that lower as well as upper molars are useful and efficient for palaeontological analyses within voles (Arvicolinae). Herein it is made evident that except the first lower molars, the use of all the other molars allows the improvement of specific determinations. It provides a better representation of abundance and diversity of the fossil record and thus involves more accurate paleoenvironmental reconstructions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArvicolinae 3aarchaeology 3afossils 3amodels 3amorphometry 3apaleoecology 3avoles 0aVoles 0aOutline analysis 0aSystematics 0aPalaeoenvironment1 aRenvoisé, Élodie1 aLhomme, Vincent1 aMontuire, Sophie0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2013 Jan., v. 40, no. 1 p.11-23dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2012.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245010400169500001900273520134900292592002801641650001701669650001701686650001101703650001601714650001101730650001501741650001801756650004301774650000901817650002301826650001101849650001101860650001101871650002401882650001201906653001801918653002501936653003001961653001601991700001502007700002002022700001802042700001602060700001502076700001402091700001802105700001602123700002102139700001602160700005202176773011902228856008802347852000902435655001202444IND60700935220221121111952.0210219e20201115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070093522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1406412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Zi-lin10aContamination sources of the enteric virus in recreational marine water shift in a seasonal pattern  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHuman enteric virus occurrence in bathing beaches poses a potential health risk to swimmers. They may come from several sources, but the understanding of the seasonal contribution of contamination sources to virus occurrence is still lacking. Here, the surveillance of human enteric viruses at the First Bathing Beach in Qingdao was performed January–December 2018. The occurrence of Enteric viruses, assayed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), was analyzed at temporal and spatial levels to determine the viral contamination sources. The results showed that only Astroviruses (AstVs) and Adenoviruses (HAdVs) were found in the swimming area. Their occurrence correlated significantly with the sewage-polluted area, but HAdVs were only found in autumn and AstVs in spring. Meanwhile, enteric viruses in the swimming area showed significantly higher levels than the surrounding area, particularly AstVs in summer with the swimmer crowd. All these data imply that sewage discharge and swimmers co-contribute to the viral occurrence in a seasonal pattern, with the former being more focused in warm seasons (spring and autumn) and the latter in hot seasons (summer). These results indicate that sewage discharge and crowd swimmers, as unsafe swimming conditions, should be avoided to improve public health at the bathing beaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3aAstroviridae 3aautumn 3aenvironment 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3apublic health 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3aseasonal variation 3asewage 3aspring 3asummer 3aviral contamination 3aviruses 0aEnteric virus 0aContamination source 0aRecreational marine water 0aSeasonality1 aMiao, Jing1 aYang, Zhong-wei1 aShi, Dan-yang1 aWu, Hai-yan1 aYang, Dong1 aYin, Jing1 aWang, Hua-ran1 aLi, Hai-bei1 aChen, Zheng-shan1 aLi, Jun-wen1 aJin, Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6012-84660 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Nov. 15, v. 743 p.140641-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1406413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01729naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245014700160300001600307520057400323592002800897650001300925650001800938650001000956650001800966650002000984650001301004650001901017653001601036653002401052653002001076653001701096700002701113700001701140773011001157856007901267852000901346655001201355IND60560121920221118194659.0180620e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056012192DNAL7 a10.1515/biol-2016-00502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Bohua10aCharacterization of particle shape, zeta potential, loading efficiency and outdoor stability for chitosan-ricinoleic acid loaded with rotenone  ap. 380-386.  aCarboxymethyl chitosan grafted with ricinoleic acid (CMC-g-RA), an amphiphilic drug carrier, was synthetized, loaded with rotenone (Rot), and characterized for particles shape, zeta potential, loading efficiency and outdoor stability.

In this sense, dynamic network Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) arises as a suitable method to evaluate the operational performance of RSCs over a period of time. However, its use for sustainability-oriented efficiency assessment constitutes a knowledge gap that limits its applicability for thorough decision-making processes, e.g. at the retail company level. This article fills this gap through the combination of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and dynamic network DEA. A novel five-step LCA + DEA approach is proposed and applied to a case study of 30 RSCs in Spain for the period 2015–2017. In this case, the supply chain structure involves three divisions: central distribution, operation of retail stores, and home delivery. Both overall- and term-efficiency scores were found to widely range from 0.38 to 1.00, with only 1 RSC deemed efficient. Regarding divisional efficiency, store operation was found to generally show significantly higher efficiency scores than the distribution divisions. The link between long distribution distances and low efficiency stresses the relevance of integrating a network perspective into the efficiency assessment. In addition to efficiency scores, the LCA + DEA approach enriches the assessment by providing environmental, operational and socio-economic benchmarks to further support the management of RSCs from a sustainability perspective.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adecision making 3alife cycle assessment 3aretail marketing 3asocioeconomics 3asupply chain 3aSpain 0aCarbon footprint 0aEfficiency assessment 0aEnergy footprint 0aRetail store 0aSupply chain 0aSustainability benchmarking1 aMartín-Gamboa, Mario1 aIribarren, Diego1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9934-89790 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Feb. 25, v. 705 p.135977-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1359773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02050naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245011500172300001800287520103500305592002801340650001301368650002601381650001701407650001801424650002301442650001101465650001501476700002801491773012601519856008201645852000901727655001201736IND60567508020221120111808.0170422e20160211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056750802DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b113112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrinivasan, Venkatesh10aPurcell Factor: A Tunable Metric for Plasmon-Coupled Fluorescence Emission Enhancements in Cermet Nanocavities  ap. 2908-2913.  aWe demonstrate an important approach to correlate Purcell factor (PF) and surface plasmon-coupled emission (SPCE) enhancements with the use of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations and time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) studies of a radiating dipole in cermet nanocavities. We observed >50-fold fluorescence enhancement with high directionality and polarization of Rhodamine 6G (Rh6G) emission trapped in the nanocavity created between the titanium-based ceramic nanoparticle and metallic silver thin film. Compositional variation with hybrid nanoparticles, TiC₀N₁ (TiN), TiC₀.₅N₀.₅ (TiCN), and TiC₁N₀ (TiC), brought about enhanced PFs and tunable fluorescence enhancements that were used for mobile-phone-based detection of tryptophan with nanomolar sensitivity. We hope that this study opens the door to next-gen plasmonics with the ability to tune and enhance the hot-spot electromagnetic field intensity of alternative plasmonic materials, as hybrid synergy spacers in the SPCE platform.  aPublisher supplied data 3aceramics 3aelectromagnetic field 3afluorescence 3ananoparticles 3aphysical chemistry 3asilver 3atryptophan1 aRamamurthy, Sai Sathish0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Feb. 11, v. 120, no. 5 p.2908-2913dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b113113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100003200142245018000174300001400354520128200368592002801650650001401678650001301692650004101705650001801746650001101764650002301775650001701798650001401815650001301829650002701842650002001869650002001889650000901909650001601918650002801934653003701962653003101999653001102030653001302041653003402054700001902088700002502107700001702132700001302149700001802162773008302180856007602263961001202339852000902351655001202360IND60481644120221122115328.0160208e20150304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048164412DNAL7 a10.1515/hf-2014-03092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPelaez-Samaniego, Manuel R.10aInterrelationship between lignin-rich dichloromethane extracts of hot water-treated wood fibers and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in wood plastic composite (WPC) production  ap. 31-38.  aHot water extraction (HWE) partially removes hemicelluloses from wood while leaving the majority of the lignin and cellulose; however, the lignin partially migrates to the inner surfaces of the cell wall where it can be deposited as a layer that is sometimes visible as droplets. This lignin-rich material was isolated via Soxhlet extraction with dichloromethane to investigate its rheological behavior in blends with high-density polyethylene (HDPE), a common material in wood plastic composites (WPCs). Pyrolysis gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and electrospray ion mass spectrometry (ESI/MS) confirmed that the isolated material is constituted mainly of low-molecular-weight lignin oligomers. The blends of HDPE/isolated lignin, in varying ratios, were tested by means of dynamic rheology. A “shoulder” was found in plots “shear storage moduli (G′) vs. frequency sweep” and a shift of the terminal zone to lower frequencies was observed. Apparently, this shoulder is caused by the elastic contribution of the interfacial tension between the blend components. The rheology of WPCs produced from HWE wood and HDPE shows a similar shoulder in G′ plots, suggesting that the HDPE/lignin blends are in part responsible for the shape of the G′ curves.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3adroplets 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3amethylene chloride 3apolyethylene 3apyrolysis 3arheology 3asolid phase extraction 3astorage modulus 3asurface tension 3awood 3awood fibers 3awood plastic composites 0ahigh-density polyethylene (HDPE) 0ahot water extraction (HWE) 0alignin 0arheology 0awood plastic composites (WPC)1 aYadama, Vikram1 aGarcia-Perez, Manuel1 aLowell, Eini1 aZhu, Rui1 aEnglund, Karl0 tHolzforschung.g2015 Mar. 4, v. 70, no. 1 p.31-38dDe Gruyterx1437-434X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hf-2014-03093Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245013600165500001100301520127900312592002801591650002601619650002001645650002801665650001301693773011301706856007801819852000901897655001201906IND60627723920190311000000.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062772392DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2018000402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLawal, Mariam V.10aModified Starches as Direct Compression Excipients – Effect of Physical and Chemical Modifications on Tablet Properties: A Review  aREVIEW  aStarch is an abundant natural polymer with unique properties that make it amenable to various kinds of treatments. This deliberate attempt at altering the character of native starch results in modified starches. Starches are extensively used in the pharmaceutical industry, especially as excipients in tablet formulation. It is now widely acknowledged that starches in their native form have functional limitations. Modification is a means of enhancing the functionality of native starch for a wide variety of applications. The importance of modified starches as excipients for pharmaceutical direct compression has been identified. Although, there is a wealth of information on starch modification, characterization and applications in the literature, there does not appear to be as yet, any attempt at a methodological analysis of physical and chemical modification techniques as they apply to pharmaceutical direct compression. This review aims at addressing these gaps. It describes a range of physical and chemical techniques employed in producing modified starches and their potentials as excipients for direct compression. The effect of modification on the morphological and functional properties of starch in various direct compression formulations is also reviewed.  aPublisher supplied data 3afunctional properties 3amodified starch 3apharmaceutical industry 3apolymers0 tStärke =.g2019 Jan., v. 71, no. 1-2 p.e1800040-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl50456x0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2018000403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01873naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245005700210300001600267520085600283592002801139650002301167650002201190650002001212650001701232650002001249650002201269650002201291773010901313856008101422990002301503852000901526655001201535IND60094269620221122092619.0141104e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009426962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sbi.2012.02.0042doi7 aPMC34989572pmcid7 a224452272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaraska, Justin W10aMapping membrane protein structure with fluorescence  ap. 507-513.  aMembrane proteins regulate many cellular processes including signaling cascades, ion transport, membrane fusion, and cell-to-cell communications.

These methods can reveal how a protein is structured and how it transitions between different conformational states. Here, I will review recent work done using fluorescence to map the structures of membrane proteins, focusing on how each of these methods can be applied to understanding the dynamic nature of individual membrane proteins and protein complexes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell communication 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3amembrane fusion 3amembrane proteins 3aprotein structure0 tCurrent Opinion in Structural Biology.g2012 Aug., v. 22, no. 4 p.507-513dElsevier Ltdx0959-440X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sbi.2012.02.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011100170300001800281520105300299592002801352650001501380650001901395650000901414650002301423650001201446650001601458650001001474650001201484650002101496650001101517651001101528651001601539651001601555651001901571653002001590653001501610653001901625653001601644653002101660700001801681773011001699856008501809852000901894655001201903IND60558900020221119080548.0161119e20161109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055890002DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2016.12089072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Hugh D.12aA new terrestrial planarian species of the genus Marionfyfea (Platyhelminthes: Tricladida) found in Europe  ap. 2673-2690.  aSmall (c. 1 cm long) terrestrial planarians found in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and France are described as a new species, Marionfyfea adventor sp. nov. Individuals of the new species have a patchy brown external appearance with small, seemingly random pale blue-ish patches. They have multiple eyes, uniserial around the anterior end, biserial or triserial laterally for a short distance then sparsely uniserial and lateral to the posterior end. The anatomy is characterized by five or six pairs of ventral testes and a single pair of ovaries adjacent to the pharyngeal pouch. The base of each ovary is surrounded by parovarian cells. The penis is of the inverted type with a basal hemispherical seminal vesicle. Two adenodactyls, one ventral, one dorsal, are present in the common antrum. The only other known species of Marionfyfea is recorded only from the Auckland Islands, New Zealand and we assume that the new species has been introduced to Europe. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:7AC3D565-0BEB-4B67-8BEC-11A13A70D663  aPublisher supplied data 3aTricladida 3aanimal ovaries 3aeyes 3aintroduced species 3aislands 3anew species 3apenis 3apharynx 3aseminal vesicles 3atestes 3aFrance 3aNetherlands 3aNew Zealand 3aUnited Kingdom 0aPlatyhelminthes 0aTricladida 0aContinenticola 0aMarionfyfea 0ainvasive species1 aSluys, Ronald0 tJournal of natural history.g2016 Nov. 9, v. 50, no. 41-42 p.2673-2690dTaylor & Francisx1464-52627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222933.2016.12089073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245012000158300001400278520102400292592002801316650004401344650001201388650001401400650001501414650001601429650001701445650001201462650001301474650001301487650003301500650000901533653004601542653001201588653001601600653001801616653002601634653001201660653001701672653001501689653002201704700001701726700001701743700001701760700001801777700001601795773008401811856007601895852000901971655001201980IND60481644220221122214852.0160208e20150218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048164422DNAL7 a10.1515/hf-2014-03172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xiaoyan10aModification of poplar wood with glucose crosslinked with citric acid and 1,3-dimethylol-4,5-dihydroxy ethyleneurea  ap. 47-53.  aPoplar wood (Populus adenopoda Maxim) has been modified by glucose (GLC) in the presence of citric acid (CA) or 1,3-dimethylol-4,5-dihydroxy ethyleneurea (DM) as crosslinker agents. GLC can penetrate easily the wood cell walls, and after crosslinking, the cell wall is bulked. At 20% GLC concentration level, the leaching ratio of GLC incorporated into wood decreased from 73% to 15% in the presence of 10% CA or DM. The crosslinking efficiency of DM was higher than that of CA. The fixed chemicals in the cell walls caused ca. 6% permanent bulking, namely, a 43% reduction in volumetric swelling after water saturation. FTIR spectroscopy shows that GLC can be activated in the presence of a catalyst; however, the reaction of GLC with a wood polymer is very limited. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) reveals that some of the chemicals remained located in the cell lumens. The findings demonstrate that GLC alone is not efficient, but joint treatment of GLC with crosslinkers is a feasible way of wood modification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPopulus 3acatalysts 3acell walls 3acitric acid 3acrosslinking 3aglucose 3aleaching 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3awood 0a1,3-dimethylol-4,5-dihydroxy ethyleneurea 0abulking 0acitric acid 0across-linking 0adimensional stability 0aglucose 0aleachability 0areactivity 0awood modification1 aXiao, Zefang1 aFeng, Xinhao1 aSui, Shujuan1 aWang, Qingwen1 aXie, Yanjun0 tHolzforschung.g2015 Feb. 18, v. 70, no. 1 p.47-53dDe Gruyterx1437-434X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hf-2014-03173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245008100158300001600239500002000255520112000275592002801395650001101423650001701434650001101451650001401462650001501476650002101491650001401512650001101526650001101537650001401548650001401562650001301576650001401589650001301603650001101616650001801627650002001645700002801665773010201693856007301795852000901868655001201877IND60571358220221119214647.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057135822DNAL7 a10.1111/jpy.125292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrice, Dana C.10aRobust Dinoflagellata phylogeny inferred from public transcriptome databases  ap. 725-729.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDinoflagellates are dominant members of the plankton and play key roles in ocean ecosystems as primary producers, predators, parasites, coral photobionts, and causative agents of algal blooms that produce toxins harmful to humans and commercial fisheries. These unicellular protists exhibit remarkable trophic and morphological diversity and include species with some of the largest reported nuclear genomes. Despite their high ecological and economic importance, comprehensive genome (or transcriptome) based dinoflagellate trees of life are few in number. To address this issue, we used recently generated public sequencing data, including from the Moore Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project, to identify dinoflagellate‐specific ortholog groups. These orthologs were combined to create a broadly sampled and highly resolved phylogeny of dinoflagellates. Our results emphasize the scope and utility of public sequencing databases in creating broad and robust phylogenies for large and complex taxonomic lineages, while also providing unique insights into the evolution of thecate dinoflagellates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiozoa 3aalgal blooms 3acorals 3adatabases 3aecosystems 3aeukaryotic cells 3afisheries 3agenome 3ahumans 3aparasites 3aphylogeny 3aplankton 3apredators 3aprotists 3atoxins 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aBhattacharya, Debashish0 tJournal of phycology.g2017 June, v. 53, no. 3 p.725-729dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-36467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.125293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245014500171300001800316520157100334592002801905650001801933650001401951650001901965650001401984650004401998650001702042650001102059650002202070650001602092700001902108700001902127700001702146773012602163856008202289852000902371655001202380IND60567508220221120111654.0170422e20160211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056750822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b114292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayanthi, Sundaresan10aDeuterium MAS NMR and Local Molecular Dynamic Model to Study Adsorption–Desorption Kinetics of a Dipeptide at the Inner Surfaces of SBA-15  ap. 2797-2806.  aThis work presents a deuterium magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR study of the adsorption–desorption dynamics of glycine-(2,2)-d₂-alanine dipeptide adsorbed at the inner surfaces of mesoporous SBA-15 silica under different hydration levels and temperatures. The experimental and theoretical challenges posed by the strong quadrupolar interaction of the rigid CD₂ group, 3-fold bigger than that of the rotating methyl CD₃, were addressed. Deuterium MAS NMR spectra modulated by exchange were analyzed using theoretically calculated exchange spectra based on the two-site Bloch–McConnel exchange equation represented in Floquet space. To solve this equation, which is composed of a high dimensional Floquet exchange matrix, our former computational approach was modified to reduce the overall computation time by orders of magnitude so as to yield more accurate exchange parameters from the spectral analysis. The adsorption–desorption kinetics of minutely hydrated silica surfaces is understood to originate from the diffusion of water molecules into and out of adsorbate binding sites, thereby gating the dynamic behavior of the adsorbate via increase or reduction of the size of the surrounding water cluster. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were employed to model the dynamic behavior of the adsorbate at the two states. Deviations between the MD and experimental observations are attributed to the simplified surface modeling, thereby highlighting the importance of experimental MAS NMR data to improve future modeling of realistic functional surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3adeuterium 3adynamic models 3aequations 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aporous media 3asilica 3aspectral analysis 3atemperature1 aKababya, Shifi1 aSchmidt, Asher1 aVega, Shimon0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Feb. 11, v. 120, no. 5 p.2797-2806dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b114293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245022400169520137400393592002801767650003301795650002801828650001301856650001601869650001901885650001501904650001301919650001401932650001701946650001401963650001101977653002701988653003302015653003802048653000702086653000902093653000702102653000802109653000902117653000802126653000702134653000802141653000902149653000802158653000902166700002102175700001702196700006302213700001802276700001702294700006002311700002202371700002202393700001802415700005802433773011802491856008602609852000902695655001202704IND60679059420221121193159.0200210e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067905942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1100132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbtahi, Hamid10aEffect of competition between petroleum-degrading bacteria and indigenous compost microorganisms on the efficiency of petroleum sludge bioremediation: Field application of mineral-based culture in the composting process  aThe effect of competition between isolated petroleum-degrading bacteria (PDB) and indigenous compost microorganisms (ICM) on the efficiency of composting process in bioremediation of petroleum waste sludge (PWS) was investigated. After isolating two native PDB (Acinetobacter radioresistens strain KA5 and Enterobacter hormaechei strain KA6) from PWS, their ability for growth and crude oil degradation was examined in the mineral-based culture (MBC). Then, the PDB isolate were inoculated into the composting experiments and operated for 12 weeks. The results showed that the PDB degraded 21.65–68.73% of crude oil (1–5%) in the MBC after 7 days. The PDB removed 84.30% of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPHs) in the composting bioreactor containing the initial TPH level of 20 g kg⁻¹. Removal of petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs) in the composting experiments proceeded according to the first-order kinetics. The computed values of degradation rate constants and half-lives showed a better performance of the PDB than ICM for TPHs removal. This finding suggests that simultaneous application of the PDB and ICM in the composting reactors resulted in a decline in the effectiveness of the PDB which is due to competition between them. The study also verified that the capability of PDB in degrading PHCs can be successfully scaled-up from MBC to composting process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter radioresistens 3aEnterobacter hormaechei 3abacteria 3abioreactors 3abioremediation 3acomposting 3acomposts 3ahalf life 3ahydrocarbons 3apetroleum 3asludge 0aPetroleum waste sludge 0aPetroleum-degrading bacteria 0aIndigenous compost microorganisms 0aBH 0aCorg 0aFC 0aICM 0aMATH 0aMBC 0aOD 0aPDB 0aPHCs 0aPWS 0aTPHs1 aParhamfar, Milad1 aSaeedi, Reza1 aVillaseñor, José,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5865-06101 aSartaj, Majid1 aKumar, Vinod1 aCoulon, Frederic1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4384-32221 aParhamfar, Maryam1 aDidehdar, Mojtaba1 aHamed seifi, 1 aKoolivand, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9375-46310 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 258 p.110013-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1100133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01680naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003100188245007300219300001600292520059300308592002800901650002200929650002000951650002000971650001300991650001901004650002201023650001401045650001701059700002001076773010901096856008101205990002301286852000901309655001201318IND60094269820221120094856.0141104e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009426982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sbi.2012.04.0032doi7 aPMC34235912pmcid7 a225724572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUbarretxena-Belandia, Iban10aMembrane protein structure determination by electron crystallography  ap. 520-528.  aDuring the past year, electron crystallography of membrane proteins has provided structural insights into the mechanism of several different transporters and into their interactions with lipid molecules within the bilayer.

At first we will show how we can re-calculate some of these anchor points by using Sothic dating based on the arcus visionis method, and modelling lunar dates using a Bayesian approach. Then, we will discuss two radiocarbon studies carried out on short-lived Egyptian materials held at the Louvre Museum that could be attributed to particular reigns or other precise periods. Using a Bayesian approach, these dates were combined with the known order of succession and the lengths of reigns. Sothic and lunar dates were integrated as priors in the model. This approach has led to a new proposal for the absolute chronology of Egypt's 18th Dynasty.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aarchaeology 3amodels 3aEgypt 0aEgypt's 18th Dynasty 0aAbsolute chronology 0aBayesian modelling 0aSothic dating 0aLunar dating 0aRadiocarbon dating 0aAccelerator Mass Spectrometry1 aAubourg, E.1 aBerthier, B.1 aDelque-Količ, E.1 aPierrat-Bonnefois, G.1 aDee, M.W.1 aAndreu-Lanoë, G.1 aBronk Ramsey, C.1 aMoreau, Chantal,0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2013 Jan., v. 40, no. 1 p.423-432dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2012.05.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02152naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245008900161300001400250520079900264592002801063650002801091650002401119650001501143650002301158650001501181650001001196650001701206653003901223653001601262653001601278653006201294653001601356653002801372653002301400700001701423700001701440700002201457700001201479700001701491700001801508773008301526856007601609852000901685655001201694IND60481644420221122214849.0160208e20150304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048164442DNAL7 a10.1515/hf-2014-03422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSi, Chuan-Ling12aA new cis-p-coumaroyl flavonol glycoside from the inner barks of Sophora japonica L.  ap. 39-45.  aTree barks could be a rich source of novel bioactive compounds, which are not well explored.

Recently, a number of questions have been raised concerning possible complications in starch analytical methods. In this paper, each of these concerns, including starch hydrolysis, isomerization of maltose to maltulose, effective hydrolysis of maltodextrins by amyloglucosidase, enzyme purity and hydrolysis of sucrose, and β‐glucans have been studied in detailed. Results obtained for a range of starch containing samples using AOAC Methods 996.11 and 2014.10 are compared and a new simpler format for starch measurement is introduced. With this method that employs a thermostable α‐amylase (as distinct from a heat stable α‐amylase) which is both stable and active at 100 °C and pH 5.0, 10 samples can be analyzed within 2 h, as compared to the 6 h required with AOAC Method 2014.10.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-amylase 3aanalytical methods 3abeta-glucans 3afeeds 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3aheat stability 3ahydrolysis 3aingredients 3aisomerization 3amaltodextrins 3amaltose 3apH 3aperoxidase 3astarch 3asucrose 3athermostable enzymes1 aCharmier, Lucie M.

The SAM formation of a silane coupling reagent on silicon is known to comprise three development stages of nucleation, growth, and coalescence. In the present study, the first nucleation stage is found to have dynamical processes: a molecular cluster attached to the substrate works as a reaction base, on which additional reactive molecules are in a bind/unbind equilibrium. In this time period, the cluster needs a long time to develop in diameter. Once a domain of ca. 30 nm in diameter is formed, the reaction rate is changed, which is dominated by the rim length of the domain. This implies that the weakly adsorbing limit approximation on the substrate surface can be employed. Another important point is that the molecular domains generate a SAM like an occupied sheet of tiles, and each tile is connected to the substrate by a few feet. In fact, a molecular tile can easily be removed by applying soft air plasma leaving the rest of the tiles of highly packed molecules, which is confirmed by infrared p-polarized external reflection spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aatomic force microscopy 3aphysical chemistry 3asilane 3asilica 3asilicon 3aspectroscopy 3atiles1 aKumazawa, Kazuhisa1 aAoyama, Kazumasa1 aSuzuki, Hiroshi1 aNorimoto, Shingo1 aShimoaka, Takafumi1 aHasegawa, Takeshi0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Feb. 11, v. 120, no. 5 p.2807-2813dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b114603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245007600160300001800236520135700254592002801611650002101639650001501660650002001675650001001695650001301705650002201718650001601740650001401756700002001770700001801790700002001808700002001828700002001848773011101868856007501979852000902054655001202063IND60529107920221119004423.0160717e20121002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052910792DNAL7 a10.1021/ac30156152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoo, Yong Kyoung10aMultifunctionalized Cantilever Systems for Electronic Nose Applications  ap. 8240-8245.  aMultiple target detection using a cantilever is essential for biosensor, chemical sensor, and electronic nose systems. We report a novel microcantilever array chip that includes four microreaction chambers in a chip, which consequently contains four different functionalized surfaces for multitarget detection. For model tests, we designed microcantilever chips and demonstrated the ability of binding of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) targets onto four different surfaces. We used peptide receptors that are known to have highly selective binding. By simply using four microreaction chambers, we immobilized DNT specific peptide (HPNFSKYILHQRC; SP), DNT nonspecific peptide (TSMLLMSPKHQAC; NSP), and self-assembled monolayer (SAM) as well as a bare cantilever. After flowing DNT gases through the cantilever chip, we could monitor the four different binding signals simultaneously. The shifts in NSP provided information as a negative control because it contained information of temperature fluctuations and mechanical vibration from gas flow. By utilizing the differential signal of the SP and NSP, we acquired 7.5 Hz in resonant responses that corresponds with 160 part per billion (ppb) DNT concentration, showing the exact binding response by eliminating the inevitable thermal noise, vibration noise, as well as humidity effects on the peptide surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding capacity 3abiosensors 3aelectronic nose 3agases 3ahumidity 3apeptide receptors 3atemperature 3avibration1 aChae, Myung-Sic1 aKang, Ji Yoon1 aKim, Tae-sŏng,1 aHwang, Kyo Seon1 aLee, Jeong Hoon0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 Oct. 02, v. 84, no. 19 p.8240-8245dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac30156153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03619naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245006700167506002800234520195800262592002802220506003702248650001202285650002102297650002702318650002602345650001702371650002902388650002502417650001702442650001502459650001702474650001402491650001402505650001702519650001102536650001602547650002802563650001602591650000902607650001602616650001402632650001802646650001502664700001602679700001402695700001502709700001902724700001902743700001602762700001802778700001802796700001502814773009602829856008302925852000903008655001203017IND60739718020221207103443.0191028s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073971802DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/201915040062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuchian, C.E.10aAntioxidant and antimicrobial effects of grape pomace extracts  aResource is Open Access  aThe use of antioxidants and antibacterials in food industry has become increasingly necessary to ensure the high quality of food. Grape pomace is the main by-product of winemaking industry that concentrates bioactive metabolites with more studied antioxidant activity and possible antibacterial activity. The grape pomace contains fragmented skin, broken cells, pulp remains, stalks and seeds with high amount of phenolic compounds due to their poor extraction during the winemaking process. Anthocyanins, catechins, flavonol glycosides, phenolic acids, alcohols and stilbenes have been identified among the compounds present in grape pomace. In this study, antibacterial activity against different pathogens (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Candida albicansATCC 90028, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923) was evaluated and the relation with polyphenols content and antioxidant activity of grape pomace from selected grapes from Iaşi vineyard was studied. The grape pomace samples were obtained after the fermentation process from the 2017 harvest of Sauvignon Blanc, Traminer, Busuioacă de Bohotin, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Fetească Neagră and Fetească Regală grape varieties. The antioxidant properties were evaluated using the DPPH method, FRAP assay and Folin Ciocalteu method. The content of resveratrol was quantified using an HPLC method. Samples with antioxidant activity showed the highest phenolics content. This study reveals that grape pomace is a potential source of natural antioxidant agents. The pomace extracts were tested to establish the effects on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The analysed samples exhibited insignificant antibacterial activity and the method requires optimization. Grape marc represents an important source of resveratrol and other bioactive compounds that could be a valuable source of antioxidants for further utilization in food and pharmaceutical industry.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCandida 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aanthocyanins 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abyproducts 3afermentation 3aflavanols 3aflavonols 3agrape pomace 3agrapes 3ametabolites 3apharmaceutical industry 3apolyphenols 3apulp 3aresveratrol 3avineyards 3awine industry 3awinemaking1 aCotea, V.V.1 aVlase, L.1 aToiu, A.M.1 aColibaba, L.C.1 aRăschip, I.E.1 aNadăş, G.1 aGheldiu, A.M.1 aTuchiluş, C.1 aRotaru, L.0 tBIO web of conferences.g2019, v. 15 p.04006-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/201915040063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01919naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245003600173520088600209592002801095650002301123650001201146650002201158650001401180650001001194650001201204650001401216650001401230650001201244653002301256700001701279700006101296773012101357856008201478852000901560655001201569IND60679059520221120113416.0200128e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067905952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2019.1106792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillipps, Hollian R.10aPatterns of prolactin secretion  aProlactin is pleotropic in nature affecting multiple tissues throughout the body. As a consequence of the broad range of functions, regulation of anterior pituitary prolactin secretion is complex and atypical as compared to other pituitary hormones. Many studies have provided insight into the complex hypothalamic-pituitary networks controlling prolactin secretion patterns in different species using a range of techniques. Here, we review prolactin secretion in both males and females; and consider the different patterns of prolactin secretion across the reproductive cycle in representative female mammals with short versus long luteal phases and in seasonal breeders. Additionally, we highlight changes in the pattern of secretion during pregnancy and lactation, and discuss the wide range of adaptive functions that prolactin may have in these important physiological states.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanterior pituitary 3afemales 3ahormone secretion 3alactation 3amales 3amammals 3apregnancy 3aprolactin 3atissues 0aProlactin receptor1 aYip, Siew H.1 aGrattan, David R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5606-25590 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 502 p.110679-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2019.1106793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245005800208300001600266520140900282592002801691650002201719650002001741650002101761650001101782650001401793650002001807700001701827773010901844856008101953990002302034852000902057655001202066IND60094269920221120110528.0141104e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009426992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sbi.2012.03.0092doi7 aPMC34088842pmcid7 a224834322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Qiu-Xing14aThe influence of lipids on voltage-gated ion channels  ap. 529-536.  aVoltage-gated ion channels are responsible for transmitting electrochemical signals in both excitable and non-excitable cells. Structural studies of voltage-gated potassium and sodium channels by X-ray crystallography have revealed atomic details on their voltage-sensor domains (VSDs) and pore domains, and were put in context of disparate mechanistic views on the voltage-driven conformational changes in these proteins. Functional investigation of voltage-gated channels in membranes, however, showcased a mechanism of lipid-dependent gating for voltage-gated channels, suggesting that the lipids play an indispensible and critical role in the proper gating of many of these channels. Structure determination of membrane-embedded voltage-gated ion channels appears to be the next frontier in fully addressing the mechanism by which the VSDs control channel opening. Currently electron crystallography is the only structural biology method in which a membrane protein of interest is crystallized within a complete lipid-bilayer mimicking the native environment of a biological membrane. At a sufficiently high resolution, an electron crystallographic structure could reveal lipids, the channel and their mutual interactions at the atomic level. Electron crystallography is therefore a promising avenue toward understanding how lipids modulate channel activation through close association with the VSDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystallography 3aelectrochemistry 3alipids 3apotassium 3asodium channels1 aGonen, Tamir0 tCurrent Opinion in Structural Biology.g2012 Aug., v. 22, no. 4 p.529-536dElsevier Ltdx0959-440X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sbi.2012.03.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01171naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245004400205300001400249506007600263520019800339592002800537506003700565650001700602650001200619650001000631700002000641773011000661856007700771852000900848655001200857IND60171938920221207095251.0150602e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017193892DNAL7 a10.1104/pp.113.2143462doi7 aPMC36412282pmcid7 a235471022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkhtar, Tariq A.10aVeratrole Biosynthesis in White Campion  ap. 52-62.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVeratrole, a scent compound in white campion flowers, is derived from l -phenylalanine via a series of reactions that lead through intermediates including a signaling compound in plant defense.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiosynthesis 3aflowers 3aodors1 aPichersky, Eran0 tPlant physiology.g2013 May, v. 162, no. 1 p.52-62dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.113.2143463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001700149245010200166300001400268520129000282592002801572650001201600650001201612650001701624650001401641650001201655650001801667650001901685650001601704650001301720650001601733650001401749650001201763700002301775700002001798700001701818700002401835700002201859700001801881700002301899773009601922856008502018852000902103655001202112IND4457020520221117221139.0141112e20110525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445702052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2011.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmber, Marie10aApplication of thermal sums concept to estimate the time to harvest new banana hybrids for export  ap. 52-57.  aApplication of the thermal sum concept was developed to determine the optimal harvesting stage of new banana hybrids to be grown for export. It was tested on two triploid hybrid bananas, FlhorBan 916 (F916) and FlhorBan 918 (F918), created by CIRAD's banana breeding programme, using two different approaches. The first approach was used with F916 and involved calculating the base temperature of bunches sampled at two sites at the ripening stage, and then determining the thermal sum at which the stage of maturity would be identical to that of the control Cavendish export banana. The second approach was used to assess the harvest stage of F918 and involved calculating the two thermal parameters directly, but using more plants and a longer period. Using the linear regression model, the estimated thermal parameters were a thermal sum of 680 degree-days (dd) at a base temperature of 17.0°C for cv. F916, and 970dd at 13.9°C for cv. F918. This easy-to-use method provides quick and reliable calculations of the two thermal parameters required at a specific harvesting stage for a given banana variety in tropical climate conditions. Determining these two values is an essential step for gaining insight into the agronomic features of a new variety and its potential for export.  aPublisher supplied data 3abananas 3aexports 3aharvest date 3aheat sums 3ahybrids 3alinear models 3amaturity stage 3anew variety 3aripening 3atemperature 3atriploidy 3atropics1 aPaget, Bénédicte1 aHubert, Olivier1 aSalas, Irene1 aSalmon, Frédéric,1 aJenny, Christophe1 aChillet, Marc1 aBugaud, Christophe0 tScientia horticulturae.g2011 May 25, v. 129, no. 1 p.52-57dElsevier B.V.x0304-42387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2011.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01887naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245012600163300001600289520073400305592002801039650001001067650001001077650003001087650002401117650001301141653001601154653001901170653002001189653001801209653001501227653006101242700002201303700001701325773008601342856007601428852000901504655001201513IND60481644720221122190957.0160208e20150610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048164472DNAL7 a10.1515/hf-2014-02252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZauner, Michaela10aFailure and failure mechanisms of wood during longitudinal compression monitored by synchrotron micro-computed tomography  ap. 179-185.  aThe lasting plastic deformation of the cellular elements of beech, fir, and spruce wood under uniaxial compression has been investigated by the combination of in situ loading and synchrotron micro-computed tomography.

This technique is proposed as an efficient post-treatment method for deposited perovskite layers that are mainly suffering from excessive number of pinholes. In this regard, we followed a set of sequential steps of partial dissolving the perovskite layer surface and a cold-roll pressing to compress and spread the semidissolved portion of the perovskite that is exposed to slight N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) vapor. Because of applying no heating during the compressing process, the cells showed good stability against decomposition. Transformation of perovskite layer from columnar microstructures containing a large amount of uncoated TiO₂ surface to a continuous and approximately pinhole-free structure resulted in an increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the cells from 8.16 to 13.24%, showing a 62% enhancement in the cell performance. For cell performance enhancement observed in this study, we can propose three considerable explanations: drop of the recombination regions, increasing the visible light absorbance, and the increase in contact surface between perovskite and TiO₂ layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3adimethylformamide 3aheat 3amicrostructure 3aphotovoltaic cells 3apressing 3atitanium dioxide 3avapors1 aGharibzadeh, Saba1 aAhmadi, Vahid1 aShahverdi, Hamid

Although many studies have examined the irrigation cooling effect (ICE) based on near-surface air temperature from meteorological observations or climate model simulations, few studies have directly addressed the effect of irrigation on land surface temperature (LST), which is closely linked to the surface energy balance and near-surface air temperature. In this paper, an ICE detection (ICED) method is proposed to assess the effect of irrigation on LST using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products across China. The magnitude of the ICE is calculated as the LST difference between irrigated area and adjacent non-irrigated area in the self-adaptive moving window determined by the ICED method. The results show that irrigation cools daytime LST by 1.15 K, and cools nighttime LST by 0.13 K, on average, across irrigated areas in China. The effect of irrigation on LST differs greatly among the climate zones and seasons, characterized by the enhanced ICE in arid regions and the growing season. In the arid climate zone, nearly all the irrigated areas show a lower daytime LST than the adjacent non-irrigated areas, leading to a strong ICE magnitude of >6 K in the growing season. In the humid climate zone, the impact of irrigation on LST is generally negligible, with a magnitude around zero throughout the year. This study provides observational evidence and a comprehensive assessment of the effect of irrigation on LST. The proposed ICED method has the potential to be used to study the spatiotemporal variation of the effect of irrigation on LST over other regions with intensive irrigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aarid zones 3aclimate models 3acooling 3aenergy balance 3agreenhouse gases 3agrowing season 3ahumid zones 3airrigated farming 3airrigation rates 3ameteorological data 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3asatellites 3asimulation models 3aspatial variation 3asurface temperature 3atemporal variation 3aChina 0aIrrigated area 0aRemote sensing 0aObservational evidence 0aSpatiotemporal variation 0aGoogle Earth Engine1 aHuang, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5625-03381 aTang, Qiuhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0886-66990 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Feb. 25, v. 705 p.135984-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1359843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002900144245011700173500002000290520104600310592002801356650002101384650001901405650000901424650000901433650001601442650001301458650002601471650002001497650001901517650001801536650001701554650002201571650001101593650002201604650001601626700002001642700003501662700002401697773011301721856007801834852000901912655001201921IND60627724320190311000000.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062772432DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2018000762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaterinopoulou, Katerina10aPreparation, Characterization, and Biodegradability Assessment of Maize Starch‐(PVOH)/Clay Nanocomposite Films  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study is focused on the preparation, characterization, and biodegradability assessment of clay nanocomposite films based on plasticized maize starch, prepared via solution casting method. Intercalated nano‐structure is achieved in all obtained films. Mechanical properties of the films prove to be dependent on the content of plasticizer (Glycerol) and poly‐vinyl‐alcohol (PVOH). Nanocomposite film with 10 wt% Glycerol and 20 wt% PVOH content possesses high stiffness and strength, but it is very brittle while nanocomposite film with 20 wt% Glycerol and 10 wt% PVOH content possesses reduced stiffness and strength but enhanced elongation at break, and film forming capability. Thermal stability of plasticized maize starch increases by 50 °C after addition of both PVOH and montmorillonite while water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) is reduced by 74% in comparison to the plasticized maize starch film. The biodegradation process increases in films with high starch content, while it is slow down when PVOH is added.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3aclay 3acorn 3acorn starch 3aglycerol 3amechanical properties 3amontmorillonite 3ananocomposites 3ananomaterials 3aplasticizers 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3astarch 3athermal stability 3awater vapor1 aGiannakas, Aris1 aBarkoula, Nektaria‐Marianthi1 aLadavos, Athanasios0 tStärke =.g2019 Jan., v. 71, no. 1-2 p.e1800076-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl50456x0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2018000763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100002200161245006900183300001600252500000900268500001500277520191000292592002802202650002102230650001702251650002402268650002102292650002702313650001802340650002502358650001002383650001102393650001102404650002402415650002502439651000902464653001502473653001202488700002202500773012102522852000902643856009802652655001202750IND2037215920221118230633.0191122e199307  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203721592DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1993.0011183X003300040040x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKephart, Kevin D.10aForage Quality Responses of C3 and C4 Perennial Grasses to Shade  ap. 831-837.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aBoth C₃ and C₄ grasses exhibit similar morphological responses to shade, but they differ in photosynthesis-related responses to shade, such as forage yield and growth rate. Morphological adaptation and reduced photosynthesis under shade may affect forage quality. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of adaptation to shade on forage quality of C₃ and C₄ grasses. The C₃ species were tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.), and deertongue grass (Panicum clandestinum L.); the C₄ species were switchgrass(Panicum virgatum Michx.) and big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vit.). Grasses were established near Ames, IA, and grown under shade cloths which allowed 37 and 70% of ambient sunlight (AS) to penetrate. In addition, the grasses were subjected to a nonshaded (100% AS) treatment. Leaf blades, nonlaminar herbage, and total herbage samples were obtained at approximately 21-d increments from late spring to early summer for 2 yr. Neutral-detergent fiber (NDF) concentration in leaf blades was 18% greater in C₄ species than in C₃ species. Otherwise, few clear differences were observed between C₃ and C₄ types. Compared with the 100% AS treatment, NDF concentration in the 37% AS treatment was reduced 2 to 3%, whereas N concentration was increased by about 31% in nonlaminar herbage. In vitro digestible dry matter was increased 3 to 5% by shade. Nitrogen content per unit leaf area was not affected by shade, suggesting that nitrogenous compounds were concentrated by thinning of leaves. Thus, stressful growth conditions that limit photosynthate, such as shade, may improve forage quality. Contribution of the Field Crops Res. Unit and the U.S. Dairy Forage Res.

In this work, two different metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) were initially prepared by hydrothermal treatment, namely aluminum trimesate (MIL-100(Al)) and copper trimesate (HKUST-1). These materials were subsequently submitted to a post-synthetic modification step to grow titania nanoparticles on their surface. Anatase nanoparticles with sizes around 5 nm were successfully anchored on MIL-100(Al), and the concentration of TiO₂ in this sample was about 68 wt.%. This is the first time that this composite (TiO₂@MIL-100(Al)) is reported in the literature. It showed an improved photocatalytic activity, removing 90% of methylene blue (kₐₚₚ = 1.29 h⁻¹), 55% of sodium diclofenac (kₐₚₚ = 0.21 h⁻¹), and 62% of ibuprofen (kₐₚₚ = 0.37 h⁻¹) after four hours of illumination with UV-A light. A significant concentration (14 µM) of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected for this composite. HKUST-1 showed a structural collapse during its post-synthetic modification, leading to a non-porous material and providing fewer sites for the heterogeneous nucleation of titania. This behavior led to a low concentration of rutile nanoparticles on HKUST-1 (9 wt.%). However, the obtained composite (TiO₂@HKUST) also showed an improved photoactivity compared to HKUST-1, increasing the photodegradation rates evaluated for methylene blue (0.05 h⁻¹ vs. 0.29 h⁻¹), sodium diclofenac (negligible vs. 0.03 h⁻¹), and ibuprofen (0.01 h⁻¹ vs. 0.02 h⁻¹). This work brings new insights concerning the preparation of photocatalysts by growing semiconductor nanoparticles on trimesate-based MOFs.  aPublisher supplied data  aPROEXcCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a301423/2018-0cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a306193/2020cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  aAPQ-00792-17cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais  ared-00102-16cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais  a05/2020cPró-Reitoria de Pesquisa, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais 3aaluminum 3adiclofenac 3ahot water treatment 3aibuprofen 3alighting 3amethylene blue 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3areactive oxygen species 3asemiconductors 3atitanium dioxide1 aGomes, Ana L.

Four cultivars were crossed as female with 16 pest-resistant germplasm lines in a North Carolina Design II to evaluate combining ability and potential heterosis of F₂ hybrids for six fiber characteristics. The 20 parents and 64 F₂ hybrids were evaluated in four environments at Mississippi State, MS. Environment × hybrids interactions were significant for strength and micronaire, but not for length, uniformity, or elongation. Parent populations generally were more sensitive to the environment than were their F₂ hybrids for most characteristics. General combining ability (GCA) effects were more importan than specific combining ability (SCA) effects. Except for 2.5% span length, GCA effects for ‘DES119’ were significant, positive, and consistent for all characteristics. ‘C315’, MHR10 and ‘Deicot 344’ had significant, positive GCA effects for strength, 50% span length and 2.5% span length. In general, fiber traits of F₂ hybrids were similar to mid-parental values. Very few F₂ hybrids wre superior in fiber properties to their high parent, but approximately 50% of the F₂ hybrids were not significantly different from their high parents for most fiber traits except micronaire. These results are encouraging for the potential of utilizing pest-resistant germplasms as parents with cuitivars to produce F₂ hybrids that combine acceptable yield and fiber properties.

It is involved in multiple cellular processes including proliferation, development, metabolism, differentiation and apoptosis; many of which are linked to several pathological conditions, including cancer. Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality in the world: in 2008 for example, there were 163,000 deaths as a result of lung cancer. Despite technologies emerging which provide the potential for novel targeted therapies and improved early diagnoses, the overall rate of five-year survival still remains at only 15%. One reason for this disappointing statistic is related to the presentation of the disease, and specifically a lack of markers for early detection. Notably, the expression of some miRNAs has been reported to be involved in the diagnosis, classification and even prognosis of lung cancer. Tumorsuppressive and oncogenic miRNAs were found in lung carcinogenesis and the biological functions of these miRNAs have been validated in transplantable lung cancer models and human paired normal-malignant lung tissue banks. Some of these tumor-suppressive and oncogenic miRNAs related to lung cancer will be reviewed here. This article will focus on emphasing miRNAs effectiveness as a biomarker in lung carcinogenesis and candidate pharmacology.

To better understand the moisture-related durability of WABs, knowledge is important of how moisture changes generate strain in the bond. In this paper, strain on end-grain surfaces of bonded ash specimens was analyzed by means of digital image correlation. Strains were generated by wood shrinkage, and the evaluation was focused on shear strain (SStr). The bond lines were studied depending on the adhesive type – phenol resorcinol formaldehyde (PRF), melamine urea formaldehyde (MUF), polyurethane (PUR), and emulsion polymer isocyanates (EPI). Moreover, three different glueline (GL) thicknesses of MUF were taken into consideration. Comparing the adhesive types, SStr distributions (SStrD) were strongly influenced by adhesive elasticity. MUF and PRF bonds were quite rigid and were associated with pronounced strain amplitudes in and close to the GL together with strain dissipation reaching deep in the wood. PUR and EPI adhesives were more elastic and therefore allowed for smoother strain transition showing less distinct strain peaks. GL thickness had significant impact on SStrD. A high strain level and direct strain transition between adherends was found for the 0.01 mm GL, whereas a pronounced strain decrease was observed in the 0.1 and 0.2 mm GLs. This indicates different stress levels in the wood-adhesive interface dependent on GL thickness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesives 3adigital images 3adurability 3aemulsions 3aformaldehyde 3amechanical loads 3amelamine 3aphenol 3apolyurethanes 3aresorcinol 3ashrinkage 3aurea formaldehyde 3awater content 3awood 0aadhesive 0aash 0adigital image correlation 0aEPI 0aglueline thickness 0amoisture-induced strain 0aMUF 0aPRF 0aPUR1 aNiemz, Peter1 avan de Kuilen, Jan-Willem0 tHolzforschung.g2015 Apr. 14, v. 70, no. 2 p.145-155dDe Gruyterx1437-434X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hf-2014-03243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245015100175300001600326520179400342592002802136650002702164650001202191650001002203650003202213650000902245650001902254650001202273650002002285650001802305650004302323650001002366650001502376650002002391650001502411651002202426653002002448653001202468653001002480653001402490653002202504653001502526700002302541700001402564700002302578773010902601856009002710852000902800655001202809IND60534586020221118140945.0190405e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053458602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2015.07.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Rongchang10aPrevalence and pathogen load of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in sheep faeces collected from saleyards and in abattoir effluent in Western Australia  ap. 216-220.  aThe prevalence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in faeces collected from sheep at sale yards in Western Australia and for abattoir effluent was determined using a quantitative multiplex PCR (qPCR). A total of 474 faecal samples were collected from sheep at two saleyards on four occasions (April–July 2014) and 96 effluent samples were collected from an abattoir over a four month period (April–July). The overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium in sheep faeces was 6.5% (31/474), with the zoonotic species Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium ubiquitum accounting for 54.2% of the typed positive samples. Subtyping of the C. parvum and C. ubiquitum positives at the gp60 locus identified four C. parvum positives as IIdA18G1 and nine C. ubiquitum isolates as the XIId subtype. The overall prevalence of Giardia in sheep faeces was 6.3% (30/474), with the non-zoonotic assemblage E responsible for the majority (81.5%) of positive isolates typed. Median Cryptosporidium and Giardia oo/cyst concentrations in positive faecal samples were 1.7×103oocysts g−1 (range 32–3.7×106 oocysts g−1) and 2.5×103cysts g−1 (range 143–7.5×105cysts g−1) respectively. Cryptosporidium and Giardia were identified in 10.4% (10/96) and 5.2% (5/96) of abattoir effluent samples (respectively). Median Cryptosporidium and Giardia oo/cyst concentrations in positive effluent samples was 1.3×103 cysts g−1 (range 393–1.5×104) and 1.5×104 oocysts g−1 (range 759–4.8×103) respectively. These findings have important implications for the sheep meat industry because Cryptosporidium and Giardia have both been associated with reduced carcase productivity in sheep, and the contamination of lamb carcases and watersheds with zoonotic species have important public health consequences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium parvum 3aGiardia 3afeces 3alivestock and meat industry 3aloci 3amicrobial load 3aoocysts 3aovine carcasses 3apublic health 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asheep 3asheep meat 3aslaughterhouses 3awatersheds 3aWestern Australia 0aCryptosporidium 0aGiardia 0aLambs 0aSaleyards 0aAbattoir effluent 0aPrevalence1 aGardner, Graham E.1 aRyan, Una1 aJacobson, Caroline0 tSmall ruminant research.g2015 Sept., v. 130 p.216-220dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2015.07.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04180naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003000132024002200162024001900184024001100203040001800214100001800232245016700250300001800417500001500435506007600450506017300526520160100699592002802300506003702328650002102365650002302386650001502409650001102424650001402435650002302449650001102472650001402483650001002497650001102507650001202518650001502530650001202545651001002557651001202567651001202579651001502591651001002606653001602616700002602632700001902658700002002677700002102697700001902718700002202737700002202759700002002781700002002801700002202821700002102843700002102864700001802885700002302903773015402926856011203080856007603192956013203268961001303400852000903413655001203422IND60114684420221214224416.0150105e20140901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011468442DNAL7 a3028482aris7 a10113/601262hdl7 a10.1128/AEM.00733-142doi7 aPMC41361122pmcid7 a249730632pmid8 ans6278  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuzyka, Denys10aWild Bird Surveillance for Avian Paramyxoviruses in the Azov-Black Sea Region of Ukraine (2006 to 2011) Reveals Epidemiological Connections with Europe and Africa  ap. 5427-5438.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aDespite the existence of 10 avian paramyxovirus (APMV) serotypes, very little is known about the distribution, host species, and ecological factors affecting virus transmission. To better understand the relationship among these factors, we conducted APMV wild bird surveillance in regions of Ukraine suspected of being intercontinental (north to south and east to west) flyways. Surveillance for APMV was conducted in 6,735 wild birds representing 86 species and 8 different orders during 2006 to 2011 through different seasons. Twenty viruses were isolated and subsequently identified as APMV-1 (n9), APMV-4 (n4), APMV-6 (n3), and APMV-7 (n4). The highest isolation rate occurred during the autumn migration (0.61%), with viruses isolated from mallards, teals, dunlins, and a wigeon. The rate of isolation was lower during winter (December to March) (0.32%), with viruses isolated from ruddy shelducks, mallards, white-fronted geese, and a starling. During spring migration, nesting, and postnesting (April to August) no APMV strains were isolated out of 1,984 samples tested. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of four APMV-1 and two APMV-4 viruses showed that one APMV-1 virus belonging to class 1 was epidemiologically linked to viruses from China, three class II APMV-1 viruses were epidemiologically connected with viruses from Nigeria and Luxembourg, and one APMV-4 virus was related to goose viruses from Egypt. In summary, we have identified the wild bird species most likely to be infected with APMV, and our data support possible intercontinental transmission of APMVs by wild birds.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOrthorubulavirus 3amigratory behavior 3amonitoring 3aautumn 3aserotypes 3avirus transmission 3awinter 3aphylogeny 3ageese 3aspring 3aviruses 3awild birds 3anesting 3aEgypt 3aNigeria 3aUkraine 3aLuxembourg 3aChina 0aRubulavirus1 aPantin-Jackwood, Mary1 aStegniy, Borys1 aRula, Oleksandr1 aBolotin, Vitaliy1 aStegniy, Anton1 aGerilovych, Anton1 aShutchenko, Pavlo1 aStegniy, Maryna1 aKoshelev, Vasyl1 aMaiorova, Klavdii1 aTkachenko, Semen1 aMuzyka, Nataliia1 aUsova, Larysa1 aAfonso, Claudio L.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2014 Sept. 1, v. 80, no. 17 p.5427-5438dAmerican Society for MicrobiologywJournal:jnl7018x0099-22407nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/601263Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00733-143Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Wild%20bird%20surveillance%20for%20avian...%20302848.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245011700174520168800291592002801979650002602007650001602033650001502049650001202064650001102076650002202087650002602109650001202135650001202147650001102159650001102170650001402181650002502195650001402220650002202234650001302256650001602269651001702285651001202302653000802314653000702322653000702329653000702336653001502343653001802358653001802376653001602394653001502410653001102425700003002436700002302466700002602489700002502515773010702540856008802647852000902735655001202744IND60679060120221121232814.0200410e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067906012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.1089052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinto, Carlos F.10aDemographic and performance effects of alternative host use in a Neotropical treehopper (Hemiptera: Membracidae)  aThe mechanisms which promote divergence in populations of phytophagous insects using alternative hosts depend on the characterization of hosts as different selective scenarios and the modeling of the demographic dynamics of the insect on those hosts. In the Bolivian Yungas forests, the treehopper Alchisme grossa (Hemiptera: Membracidae) utilizes two sympatric Solanaceae hosts, Brugmansia suaveolens and Solanum ursinum. On both hosts, females take care of nymphs during their development and adults use almost exclusively their natal host species. We characterized: 1) the performance of families (mother and nymphs) on both hosts, 2) maternal care across families and hosts, 3) biotic (herbivory, predators and parasites) and abiotic (temperature, relative humidity and luminosity) conditions across hosts and 4) demographic parameters of cohorts living under natural conditions on both hosts using matrix population modelling. The life cycle was longer on B. suaveolens than on S. ursinum. Microenvironmental abiotic and biotic traits differed between hosts. Nevertheless, performance did not differ between hosts and no differences between hosts were found in demographic parameters. None of the environmental variables explained the demographic parameters. Females performed maternal care with the same intensity on both hosts. Taken together with published data on the system, these results suggest that individuals of A. grossa in this study belong to a single population. Colonization of one of these hosts might be a recent event and evolutionary processes that promote ecological adaptation and hence demographic or performance differences have not yet become noticeable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrugmansia suaveolens 3aMembracidae 3aNeotropics 3aSolanum 3aadults 3aalternative hosts 3aenvironmental factors 3afemales 3aforests 3amodels 3anymphs 3aparasites 3aphytophagous insects 3apredators 3arelative humidity 3asympatry 3atemperature 3aAndes region 3aBolivia 0aMPM 0aHI 0aBS 0aSU 0aDemography 0aMaternal care 0aMatrix models 0aPerformance 0aSolanaceae 0aYungas1 aTorrico-Bazoberry, Daniel1 aFlores-Prado, Luis1 aBustamante, Ramiro O.1 aNiemeyer, Hermann M.0 tEcological modelling.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 416 p.108905-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.1089053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245012700164300001600291520118700307592002801494650001101522650001001533650001601543650002401559650001501583650001301598650001901611650003001630650001301660650001201673650001301685650001401698653003601712653001301748653002701761653002401788700002401812700001901836700001901855700002101874700002501895700001801920700002101938773008601959856007602045852000902121655001202130IND60481645320221121223354.0160208e20150326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048164532DNAL7 a10.1515/hf-2014-03372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiziks, Vladimirs10aAssessment of wood microstructural changes after one-stage thermo-hydro treatment (THT) by micro X-ray computed tomography  ap. 167-177.  aThe microstructural changes in a selection of softwoods and hardwoods resulting from thermo-hydro treatment (THT) at 160°C were examined by means of a state-of-the-art micro X-ray computed tomography. A dedicated X-ray scanning and volumetric processing protocol was developed. All reconstructed volumes had an approximate voxel pitch between 0.8 and 1.2 μm³. The microstructures of the same needle-shaped specimens before and after THT were visualized, and the individual parameters (maximum opening and lumen volume) for various cell types were quantified and compared. The highest values of substance volume were recorded for the ash sapwood (81%) and spruce specimens (72%). After THT, a significant correlation was found between the mass loss determined by gravimetry and the X-ray volume loss. The largest change occurred in the lumen volume of several tissue components, such as libriform fibers, tracheids, and ray parenchyma. The average aspen fiber volume reduction after THT was 31%, a value 2.6 times higher than the volume reduction of the average vessels. The porosity of ash sapwood increased from 41 to 56%, whereas the porosity of birch decreased from 34 to 29%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3aPicea 3aX-radiation 3acomputed tomography 3agravimetry 3ahardwood 3amicrostructure 3aparenchyma (plant tissue) 3aporosity 3asapwood 3asoftwood 3atracheids 0amicro X-ray computed tomography 0aporosity 0athermo-hydro treatment 0awood microstructure1 aVan den Bulcke, Jan1 aGrinins, Juris1 aMilitz, Holger1 aAndersons, Bruno1 aAndersone, Ingeborga1 aDhaene, Jelle1 aVan Acker, Joris0 tHolzforschung.g2015 Mar. 26, v. 70, no. 2 p.167-177dDe Gruyterx1437-434X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hf-2014-03373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03551naa a2200889 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245008800174300001400262520136100276592002801637650001701665650002501682650001401707650001001721650002101731650001101752650001601763650002001779650001001799650002401809650001301833650001201846650001001858650001001868650001901878650001801897650002001915650001201935650001301947650002201960650001101982650001101993653000902004653001002013653001002023653000902033653000902042653000902051653001102060653001202071653000902083653001002092653001002102653000702112653000702119653001202126653001002138653001102148653001002159653000902169653000802178653000902186653000802195653000902203653000702212653000702219653000702226653001502233653004302248653003002291653002002321700001602341700001702357700001902374700001702393700001502410700001802425773010702443856009002550852000902640655001202649IND60534586220221118141006.0190405e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053458622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2015.07.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaoyan10aNovel splice isoforms of dairy goat DBC1 and their diverse mRNA expression profiles  ap. 15-26.  aAs a critical regulator of nuclear factors affecting adipogenesis, deleted in breast cancer 1 (DBC1) leads to the hyperacetylation of p53, a target of the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase Sirtuin 1, and activation of the apoptotic pathway. To date, the transcript variants of DBC1 and their functions have never been reported in dairy goats. Herein, we identified two novel transcripts of dairy goat DBC1, namely, DBC1 and DBC1a. DBC1 was 42 base pairs longer than DBC1a, and the splice site of the 42- nucleotide deletion complied with the classic “GT-AG” rule. The goat DBC1a in this study had a high degree of homology with other predicted goat DBC1 variants as well as the only known bovine DBC1 variant, DBC1-X4. DBC1 and DBC1a were widely expressed in different tissues and highly expressed in the pancreas, spleen, lung, liver, kidney, and mammary gland. Moreover, DBC1 has a significantly higher expression than DBC1a in the pancreas, kidney, liver, heart, muscle, brain, and testis. Interestingly, in mammary gland, DBC1 and DBC1a demonstrated similar mRNA expression levels, implying that DBC1a variant plays an important role in milk production. This is the first report on the alternative splicing of goat DBC1 and its mRNA expression profile, which will provide a foundation for further study the function of DBC1 in dairy goat industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipogenesis 3aalternative splicing 3aapoptosis 3abrain 3abreast neoplasms 3acattle 3adairy goats 3agene expression 3aheart 3ahistone deacetylase 3aindustry 3akidneys 3aliver 3alungs 3amammary glands 3amessenger RNA 3amilk production 3amuscles 3apancreas 3asequence deletion 3aspleen 3atestes 0aDBC1 0aDBC1a 0aSIRT1 0aERα 0aERβ 0aNAD+ 0aRT-PCR 0aqRT-PCR 0amRNA 0aCCAR2 0aCCAR1 0aAR 0aAS 0aRNA-Seq 0aGAPDH 0aPGC-1a 0aPEPCK 0aCRCC 0aSNP 0aNCBI 0aCDS 0acDNA 0aaa 0ant 0abp 0aDairy goat 0aDeleted in breast cancer 1 (DBC1) gene 0aAlternative splicing (AS) 0amRNA expression1 aLi, Mingxun1 aWu, Xianfeng1 aPan, Chuanying1 aLei, Chuzhao1 aChen, Hong1 aLan, Xianyong0 tSmall ruminant research.g2015 Sept., v. 130 p.15-26dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2015.07.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01342naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245011100162300002000273520039900293592002800692650002200720650001200742650001300754700002100767700001800788700002600806773013700832856007400969852000901043655001201052IND60667672120221120215248.0190919e20190917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066767212DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc05787k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStasyuk, Anton J.10aHypsochromic solvent shift of the charge separation band in ionic donor–acceptor Li⁺@C₆₀⊂[10]CPP  ap. 11195-11198.  aIn this work, we study computationally, using the DFT/TDDFT approach, the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) in CPP-based donor–acceptor supramolecules C₆₀⊂[10]CPP and Li⁺@C₆₀⊂[10]CPP.

The expression of the estrogen receptor (ESR1), which encodes the alpha estrogen receptor (ER-α), is tissue specific. For example, the expression of ESR1 in the endometrium and mammary gland is very high and low in the placenta and skin. The gene is located on human chromosome 6 and is also known as Era, ESRA, ESTRR, and NR3A1. Several studies have shown that genetic variants in this gene are associated with breast cancer sensitivity. The aim of this study was to investigate ESR1gene expression in different tissues of Raini Cashmere goat using Real Time PCR. Materials and Methods One male and one female goats were selected for tissue sampling. Samples were taken from tissues of the heart, kidneys, brain, ovaries, uterus, breast and testicles (3 repetitions of each tissue) during slaughter at the slaughterhouse. RNA was extracted and cDNA was synthesized. Real Time PCR was performed using SYBR Green method to study relative gene expression. GAPDH gene was used as housekeeping gene. Pfaffl method was used to analyze achieved data. Results The study of ESR1 gene expression in the tissues of the heart, kidney, brain, ovary, uterus, mammary gland and testis of goat using Real Time PCR showed that this gene is expressed in all studied tissues. The highest levels of expression were observed in the kidney, ovary, uterus and testis tissues, and the lowest levels of expression were observed in the brain and heart tissues. Conclusions Based on the results of the present study and the results of other researchers, it can be concluded that estrogen receptors play an important role in spermatogenesis and male fertility, because in the present study it was found that ESR1 is much more expressed in reproductive tissues than in non-reproductive tissues. Therefore, estrogen and its receptors are likely to be essential for male fertility, and the results of this study provide a basis for future research to describe the role of ESR1 gene as a candidate gene for better fertility and natural physiology in domestic animals, especially goats.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3abrain 3abreast neoplasms 3abreasts 3achromosomes 3aendometrium 3aestrogen receptors 3aestrogens 3agene expression 3aheart 3ahumans 3akidneys 3amale fertility 3amales 3amammary glands 3aplacenta 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aslaughter 3aslaughterhouses 3aspermatogenesis 3atestes 0aesr1 0agene expression 0araini cashmere goat 0areproductive tissues0 tBiyutiknuluzhī-i kishāvarzī.g2020 Apr., v. 12, no. 1 p.177-192dShahid Bahonar University of KermanwJournal:27822x2228-65007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22103/jab.2020.15791.12293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007100167300001400238520105800252592002801310650001801338650001601356650001501372650001701387650002801404650001601432650001301448650001901461650001201480650001201492650001301504650001001517650002301527650001301550650003301563650002201596651001001618653000901628653001401637653002101651653001201672653003301684653000801717653002601725653001901751653002201770700002601792700002401818700002201842700002001864700002101884700001801905773011701923856008102040852000902121655001202130IND60601270220221117235140.0180706e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060127022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2012.06.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPitre, Mindy C.10aBiofilm growth in human skeletal material from ancient Mesopotamia  ap. 24-29.  aInvestigators have long recognised the effects of microbial activity on archaeological bone. These investigators, however, have focused on single or groups of microbes rather than on complex microbial aggregates such as biofilms, a focus that has affected our understanding of archaeological bone biodeterioration. In this paper, we report on the investigation of a biofilm in archaeological human bone from the site of Tell Leilan, Syria (2900–1900 BCE). Scanning electron microscopy indicated that the biofilm is characterised by single cells and microcolonies of bacteria and fungi, as well as calcite crystals that were all embedded within extracellular polymeric substances. Using culture techniques and DNA sequencing, we isolated and identified several microbes from the biofilm including Amycolatopsis sp., Penicillium chrysogenum, Aspergillus sp., Chaetomium sp., and Cladosporium sp. Having characterised the Leilan biofilm, we are now closer to understanding the complex process of bone biodeterioration in archaeological bone collections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmycolatopsis 3aAspergillus 3aChaetomium 3aCladosporium 3aPenicillium chrysogenum 3aarchaeology 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3acalcite 3acrystals 3afungi 3amicrobial activity 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asequence analysis 3aSyria 0aBone 0aTaphonomy 0aBiodeterioration 0aBiofilm 0aScanning electron microscopy 0aSEM 0aDehydration technique 0aDNA sequencing 0aCulture technique1 aMayne Correia, Pamela1 aMankowski, Peter J.1 aKlassen, Jonathan1 aDay, Melissa J.1 aLovell, Nancy C.1 aCurrah, Randy0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2013 Jan., v. 40, no. 1 p.24-29dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2012.06.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245013200176520154500308592002801853650001001881650001101891650001901902650002501921650001201946650001901958650001901977650001201996650002002008650001202028650001202040650001902052650002902071650002902100650000902129651002502138651002902163653001702192653002602209653002702235653001702262700002102279700001802300700002802318700001602346773010702362856008802469852000902557655001202566IND60679060520221121232809.0200410e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067906052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.1089212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimioni, Guillaume10aNatural forest dynamics have more influence than climate change on the net ecosystem production of a mixed Mediterranean forest  aClimate models predict increased drought conditions for the Mediterranean region, putting forests under increasing risk from direct or indirect effects of droughts. On the other hand, increasing CO₂ and longer growing seasons could compensate the negative impacts of more intense droughts on forest productivity and carbon sequestration. Furthermore, large areas of Mediterranean forests are relatively young and unmanaged, and maturing usually tends to decrease carbon sequestration.We conducted a simulation study to explore the interplay between climate, CO₂, and maturing, on forest net primary production (NPP) and net ecosystem production (NEP) over the 2000–2100 period. We used the Not Only Tree/Grass (NOTG) model, which is individual-based, process-oriented, and spatially explicit. We applied the model to the Font-Blanche experimental site, a typical mixed Mediterranean forest dominated by Aleppo pines and holm oaks.Simulations under three climate scenarios (current, moderate change, severe change) suggest that NPP could be enhanced by climate change, both due to higher CO₂ and longer growing seasons. On the other hand NEP would only be temporarily enhanced by climate change. The largest effect, however, was a decrease of NEP over time for all scenarios, due to forest maturing, with heterotrophic respiration progressively catching up with NPP. This implies that, regardless of climate change, the sink capacity of large unmanaged forest areas in southern Europe could strongly diminish during the 21st century.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3adrought 3aforest dynamics 3aforests 3agrasses 3agrowing season 3anet ecosystem production 3anet primary productivity 3arisk 3aMediterranean region 3aSouthern European region 0aFont-Blanche 0aSpatial heterogeneity 0aNet primary production 0aWater stress1 aMarie, Guillaume1 aDavi, Hendrik1 aMartin-St Paul, Nicolas1 aHuc, Roland0 tEcological modelling.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 416 p.108921-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.1089213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03542naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001500161245004900176300001600225500000900241500001500250520230800265592002802573650001902601650001602620650001002636650001402646650001702660650001402677650001202691650001302703650001002716650001002726650001302736650001702749653001902766653002702785700001802812700001702830700002102847773012102868852000902989856009802998655001203096IND2037210920221118231254.0191122e199307  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203721092DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1993.0011183X003300040024x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeo, Y.

Merr.], five loci ((I/i-K/i-i/i, R/r-m/r, T/t, W1/wl, O/o) interact to produce seed coat and/or hilum color phenotypes of gray (G), yellow (Y), black (BI), imperfect black brown (Br), striped brown-black, red-brown (Rbr), or buff (Bf). The T/t and Wl/wl loci also condition tawny/gray pubescence and purple/white flowers, respectively. T236, a white-flowered gray-pubescence accession in the soybean genetic collection, has an unusual red-buff (Rbf) seed coat. The genetic relationship of Rbf to the other seed coat colors was not known. To evaluate this relationship, T236 was mated to six soybean lines of known genotype relative to the five loci. F₂ individuals were classified as to flower, pubescence, seed coat, and hilum color. In all crosses, only F₂ plants with white flowers, gray pubescence, and an R_ genotype produced Rbf seed coats or hila. The F₂ segregation ratios were not compatible with an inheritance model for Rbf that invoked allelic segregation at a sixth locus. Indeed, Rbf seed coat seemed to be conditioned by a new allele at the T/t locus, symbolized as t-r. While there was no perceptible difference in the gray pubescence phenotypes conditioned by the t and t-r alleles, the t-r allele was detectable in an R_w1wl genetic background, where the allelic series T/t-r/t produced the seed coat color phenotypes of B1/Rbf/Bf (in left-to-right dominance-recessiveness order). In all other backgrounds (i.e., R_Wl_, rrWl__, and rrwlwl), the seed coat colors produced by t and t-r were identical. The currently accepted model for the inheritance of anthocyanidin pigments in the soybean seed coat is that: (i) R is necessary for anthocyanidin production,(ii) T is needed for dihydroxylation of the B-ring, (iii) Wl is needed for trihydroxylation of the B-ring. Our postulation that the Rbf seed coat phenotype requires an R_t-r_wlwl genotype is consistent with this theory. It is also consistent with the report that pelargonidin, a monohydroxylated B-ring anthocyanidin, is the predominant pigment in the Rbf seed coats of strain T236.

First, we observed oviposition behavior of female wasps when encountering host larvae (Mythimna separata, Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). On their first encounters with host larvae, 96% of inexperienced female wasps showed oviposition behavior. Immediately afterward, and for 2 h after the first oviposition, wasp oviposition behavior was suppressed. Only 20–30% of wasps showed a second oviposition response, even after several encounters with a new host. Then, oviposition behavior gradually recovered 6 to 24 h after the first oviposition. At 6 h after the first oviposition experience, more than 80% of the wasps showed a second oviposition response when encountering a new host. Next, in a wind tunnel, we investigated the effect of time since first oviposition on wasp responses to host-infested plant volatiles. Female landings in response to volatiles of host-infested maize plants, Zea mays, showed a bell-shaped curve from 0 to 48 h after first oviposition. Eight hours after the first oviposition, the rate of landing by wasps was significantly higher than that of oviposition-inexperienced wasps. The ecological strategy explaining the effect of oviposition experience on olfactory responses of C. kariyai to host-infested plant volatiles is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApanteles kariyai 3aMythimna separata 3aZea mays 3acorn 3afemales 3ainsect behavior 3alarvae 3aoviposition 3awasps 3awind tunnels1 aKuramitsu, Kazumu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6733-13791 aTakabayashi, Junji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3575-99521 aKainoh, Yooichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7183-24830 tJournal of insect behavior.g2021 Nov., v. 34, no. 5-6 p.264-270dSpringer USwJournal:jnl43293x0892-75537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10905-021-09786-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03336naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245017300171300001500344520174600359592002802105650002402133650001102157650001302168650002502181650001702206650001002223650001602233650000902249650001802258650002202276650002702298650002002325650000902345650002102354650001502375650000702390650001902397650002302416650002502439653002602464653001602490653002302506653001502529700001702544700001902561700001902580773010802599856009002707852000902797655001202806IND60534586520221118141002.0190405e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053458652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2015.07.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharifi, M.14aThe effect of feeding low quality date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) on the performance, antioxidant status and ruminal fermentation of mid-lactating Saanen dairy goats  ap. 95-100.  aThis study was conducted to evaluate the effect of feeding low quality date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) (LDP) on the performance, antioxidant status, and ruminal fermentation in Saanen dairy goats. Eight multiparous Saanen dairy goats averaging 92±9 DIM and 2050±280g of milk production were used in a replicated 4×4 Latin square design. Each experimental period lasted 21 days: 14 for adaptation, and 7 for measurements. Experimental treatments were as follows: (1) diet without LDP (control), (2) diet containing 6% of LDP (LDP6), (3) diet containing 12% of LDP (LDP12), and (4) diet containing 18% of LDP (LDP18) (DM basis). The dry matter intake (DMI) and apparent digestibility were not affected by the treatments. In addition, there was no difference in milk yield, and milk composition. Inclusion of LDP in the diet increased total antioxidant capacity (TAC) as LDP18 had the highest and control had the lowest concentration of TAC in milk and blood, respectively. No significant difference was seen in malondialdehyde (MDA) content in milk and blood. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity had no significant effect across treatment in blood. There was significant difference in ruminal pH among treatments, yet goats fed LDP12 and LDP18 had the highest ruminal propionate concentration and the lowest acetate concentration. With increasing of LDP to diet, the acetate: propionate ratio decreased while concentration of valerate increased. The results of this study indicate that LDP can be substituted with partial replacement of diet in dairy goats ration without negative effects on animal performance. In addition, inclusion of LDP in ration improved the antioxidant capacity of dairy goats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aSaanen 3aacetates 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3ablood 3adairy goats 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adry matter intake 3aglutathione peroxidase 3amalondialdehyde 3amilk 3amilk composition 3amilk yield 3apH 3apropionic acid 3arumen fermentation 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aLow quality date palm 0aPerformance 0aAntioxidant status 0aDairy goat1 aBashtani, M.1 aNaserian, A.A.1 aFarhangfar, H.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2015 Sept., v. 130 p.95-100dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2015.07.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01941naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245007500168300002000243520083100263592002801094650002301122650001801145650001401163650001501177650001301192650001801205650002801223700002101251700002401272700001901296700002601315700001801341773013701359856007401496852000901570655001201579IND60667672420221120113654.0190919e20190917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066767242DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc05989j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchulte-Zweckel, Janine12aA hydroxylamine probe for profiling S-acylated fatty acids on proteins  ap. 11183-11186.  aReversible S-palmitoylation is a key regulatory mechanism of protein function and localization. There is increasing evidence that S-acylation is not restricted to palmitate but it includes shorter, longer, and unsaturated fatty acids. However, the diversity of this protein modification has not been fully explored. Herein, we report a chemical probe that combined with MS-based analysis allows the rapid detection and quantification of fatty acids linked to proteins. We have used this approach to profile the S-acylome and to show that the oncogene N-Ras is heterogeneously acylated with palmitate and palmitoleate. Studies on protein distribution in membrane subdomains with semisynthetic proteins revealed that unsaturated N-Ras presents an increased tendency toward clustering and higher insertion kinetic rate constants.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3ahydroxylamine 3aoncogenes 3apalmitates 3aproteins 3arapid methods 3aunsaturated fatty acids1 aDwivedi, Mridula1 aBrockmeyer, Andreas1 aJanning, Petra1 aWinter, R.q(Roland),1 aTriola, Gemma0 tChemical communications.g2019 Sept. 17, v. 55, no. 75 p.11183-11186dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9cc05989j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245008800172506002800260520137600288592002801664506003701692650002801729650002201757650001501779650001201794650001901806650002401825650001101849650001101860700002401871700002001895773009601915856008302011852000902094655001202103IND60739719320221207103358.0200716s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073971932DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202022010242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArsenii, Dokuchaev10aIn-silico study of age-related ionic remodeling in human ventricular cardiomyocytes  aResource is Open Access  aAgeing is one of the dominant risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. A large number of experimental data is collected on the cellular remodeling in the ageing myocardium from mammals, but very little is known about the human cardiomyocytes. We used a combined electro-mechanical model of human ventricular cardiomyocytes and a population of models approach to investigate the variability in the response of cardiomyocytes to age-related changes in model parameters of the ionic currents. To generate a control model population, we varied 9 ionic parameters and excluded model samples with biomarkers of cellular action potential (AP) and Ca2+ transient (CT) falling outside the physiological ranges. Using the control population of models, we evaluated the response to age-related reduction in the K+ transient outward current, SERCA pump, and an increase in the Na+Ca2+ exchange current and L-type Ca2+ current. Then, we randomly generated 60 age-related sets of the 4 parameters and applied each set to every model in the control population. We showed an increase in the frequency of repolarization anomalies (RA) and critical AP prolongation in the ageing model populations suggesting arrhythmogenic effects of the ionic remodeling. The population based approach allowed us to assess the pro-arrhythmic contribution of the ionic parameters in ageing cardiomyocytes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCa2-transporting ATPase 3aaction potentials 3abiomarkers 3acalcium 3acardiomyocytes 3acomputer simulation 3ahumans 3amodels1 aSvyatoslav, Khamzin1 aOlga, Solovyova0 tBIO web of conferences.g2020, v. 22 p.01024-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/202022010243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012200171300001400293520168900307592002801996650001302024650002302037650001402060650002102074650001302095650001502108650001302123650000902136650001702145650001502162650001502177650002302192651001102215653001702226653003002243653002602273653001402299700001602313700002102329700001802350773023902368856008602607852000902693655001202702IND60544424920221120205928.0190416e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054442492DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-6339(15)30020-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaxson, T. F.,10aLand husbandry: an agro-ecological approach to land use and management Part 1: Considerations of landscape conditions  ap. 22-35.  aIn this, the first of two papers, the roles of key features of any landscape in determining potentials for erosional losses of soil and water are considered from an agro-ecological viewpoint. In this light, the effectiveness of past commonly-accepted approaches to soil and water conservation are often found to have been inadequate. In many cases they have tackled symptoms of land degradation without appreciating fully the background causes, which often relate to inadequate matching of land-use/land-management with features of the landscape. A number of reasons for this mismatch are suggested. Understanding the ecological background to land husbandry (as defined below) will improve the effectiveness of attempts to tackle land degradation. In particular, an ecologically based approach to better land husbandry helps to foresee potential problems in some detail, so that appropriate forward planning can be undertaken to avoid them. This paper describes some practical ways of undertaking an appropriate survey of significant landscape features, enabling the definition and mapping of discrete areas of different land-use incapability classes. This is accompanied by an example of how the outcome was interpreted and used to guide the selection of appropriate areas which were apparently suitable for growing flue-cured tobacco within an area of ca. 140 km2 in Malawi. This process relied on knowledge and experience in various disciplines (interpretation of air-photos, topographic survey, soil survey, vegetation analysis, hydrology, soil & water conservation, geology, agronomy) so as to ensure that the mapping process was based on the principles of better land husbandry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3aflue-cured tobacco 3ahydrology 3aland degradation 3aland use 3alandscapes 3aplanning 3asoil 3asoil surveys 3atopography 3avegetation 3awater conservation 3aMalawi 0aAgro-ecology 0aSoil & water conservation 0aLand-use incapability 0aForesight1 aAlder, John1 aJackson, Timothy1 aHunter, Nigel0 tInternational soil and water conservation research.g2014 Sept., v. 2, no. 3 p.22-35dElsevier B.V.aInternational Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation and China Water & Power PresswJournal:23246x2095-63397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-6339(15)30020-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245008800163300001800251500002000269520148300289592002801772596004401800596006101844650002301905650001801928650003001946650001201976650001601988650001402004650000902018650001802027650001302045650001402058650001802072650002302090650001602113650001402129650001502143700002402158700002302182700002302205700002302228773014502251856007502396852000902471655001202480IND60788373520221117004050.0220813e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078837352DNAL7 a10.1002/nafm.103592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoppola, Giancarlo10aSubmergence Responses of Cool‐Season Annual Plants and Potential for Fish Habitat  ap. 1269-1276.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe artificial water regimes of flood control reservoirs limit vegetation establishment in littoral zones and produce mudflats with limited habitat for juvenile fishes. One strategy to enhance habitat on mudflats is to sow cool‐season plants to provide submerged structure when inundated. However, how the structure of these plants persists following inundation has not been evaluated. To investigate the species‐specific responses of plants to inundation, we submerged six cool‐season annual plant cultivars in outdoor flow‐through tanks and monitored maximum height and density of plant structures over time. Time‐to‐event analyses and generalized linear models characterized differences in structural persistence between cultivars over time. Plantings degraded rapidly if inundated before plants matured. However, mature plants of Marshall ryegrass Lolium multiflorum and triticale Triticosecale provided dense structure that persisted for 3 months. As Marshall ryegrass degraded, the stem density decreased and produced wide gaps relative to triticale, which remained dense and complex. Differences in plant architecture during the senescence process following submergence may influence fish species and size class use. Our results indicate that cool‐season grasses have high potential as habitat enhancers due to long‐term persistence, and differences in plant structural characteristics may provide flexibility for managers to attract target fish species.  aPublisher supplied data  cReservoir Fisheries Habitat Partnership  cMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks 3aLolium multiflorum 3aTriticosecale 3aadministrative management 3aannuals 3acold season 3acultivars 3afish 3aflood control 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3alittoral zone 3aplant architecture 3asubmergence 3atriticale 3avegetation1 aMiranda, Leandro E.1 aColvin, Michael E.1 aHatcher, Hunter R.1 aLashley, Marcus A.0 tNorth American journal of fisheries management.g2019 Dec., v. 39, no. 6 p.1269-1276dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19701x0275-59477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.103593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245005700212300001400269500001900283500001100302520161500313592002801928650002101956650001501977650001601992650002202008650002002030650002602050650001802076650001302094650002102107650001702128650001402145650001502159650001602174650002902190650001402219700002402233773012702257856008202384852000902466655001202475IND60723997520221119143725.0210119e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072399752DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-020-02034-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShad, Ahtesham Ahmad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2777-236410aShigella sonnei: virulence and antibiotic resistance  ap. 45-58.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aShigella sonnei is the emerging pathogen globally, as it is the second common infectious species of shigellosis (bloody diarrhoea) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and the leading one in developed world. The multifactorial processes and novel mechanisms have been identified in S. sonnei, that are collectively playing apart a substantial role in increasing its prevalence, while replacing the S. flexneri and other Gram-negative gut pathogens niche occupancy. Recently, studies suggest that due to improvement in sanitation S. sonnei has reduced cross-immunization from Plesiomonas shigelliodes (having same O-antigen as S. sonnei) and also found to outcompete the two major species of Enterobacteriaceae family (Shigella flexneri and Escherichia coli), due to encoding of type VI secretion system (T6SS). This review aimed to highlight S. sonnei as an emerging pathogen in the light of recent research with pondering aspects on its epidemiology, transmission, and pathogenic mechanisms. Additionally, this paper aimed to review S. sonnei disease pattern and related complications, symptoms, and laboratory diagnostic techniques. Furthermore, the available treatment reigns and antibiotic-resistance patterns of S. sonnei are also discussed, as the ciprofloxacin and fluoroquinolone-resistant S. sonnei has already intensified the global spread and burden of antimicrobial resistance. In last, prevention and controlling strategies are briefed to limit and tackle S. sonnei and possible future areas are also explored that needed more research to unravel the hidden mysteries surrounding S. sonnei.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aO-antigens 3aPlesiomonas 3aShigella flexneri 3aShigella sonnei 3aantibiotic resistance 3aciprofloxacin 3adiarrhea 3adigestive system 3amicrobiology 3apathogens 3asanitation 3ashigellosis 3atype VI secretion system 3avirulence1 aShad, Wajahat Ahmed0 tArchives of microbiology.g2021 Jan., v. 203, no. 1 p.45-58dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl49610x0302-89337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-020-02034-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01657naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245008300156300001600239520077600255592002801031650002101059650000901080650001201089651001901101700001601120700001901136773012901155856007401284852000901358655001201367IND60765196120221123005523.0220419e20120111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076519612DNAL7 a10.17221/4617-jfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKřepela, M.12aA contribution to the knowledge of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stem shape  ap. 211-218.  aThis is a study on the evaluation of stem shape in Scots pine.

Generalized Procrustes analysis was used as the method of study. The stems were described by the use of landmarks. Full Procrustes coordinates were calculated for all stems, and the full Procrustes mean shape was set for individual sample trees, locations and all stems. For Procrustes tangent coordinates, variability was examined using the method of principal components. The two most important principal components were diagrammatized and described.

The aims of the case study were to identify social hotspots of the laptop and to test and evaluate the methodology. METHODS: The case study was based on the social LCA methodology described in the Guidelines for social LCA and included the product system from ‘cradle to grave’ as well as the impacts on all relevant stakeholders. We focused on a simplified list of materials and used mainly country-specific data. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A new method for impact assessment of hotspots was developed. The total activity in each phase was distributed among countries. The countries were divided into groups related to the extent of activity in the product system, as well as to their performance on a subcategory. High values in both groups were highlighted and hotspots were identified. The results revealed some hotspots, some hot countries and some hot issues, all indicating a risk of negative social impacts in the product system of a laptop. It also identified workers and the local community as the stakeholders most at risk of negative social impacts. Among the hotspots identified, the following subcategories were of importance: safe and healthy living conditions, social benefit/social security, access to material resources, involvement in areas with armed conflicts, community engagement (lack of), corruption, and access to immaterial resources. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed it is possible to conduct a social LCA on a generic complex product using the Guidelines, even though data collection was impaired by lack of data and low data quality. It identified methodological issues that need further attention, for example the indicator impact pathways. Still, it is clear that new insights can be gained by social LCA, where the life cycle perspective and the systematic approach help users identify potentially important aspects that could otherwise have been neglected.  aPublisher supplied data 3arisk 3adata collection 3aguidelines 3asocial benefit 3aproduct system 3amaterials life cycle 3astakeholders 3acase studies 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aFinnveden, Göran,0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2013 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.127-143dSpringer-Verlagx0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-012-0442-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002900137245013400166300001800300520164500318592002801963650002601991650001402017650002002031650001902051650001002070650001702080650001302097650002602110650001802136650001202154653001202166653001302178653002002191653000902211653001202220700002502232700002702257700002702284700002502311700002102336700001902357700001902376700002002395700003302415700002302448700002602471700002102497700002302518700002402541773009802565856003802663961001302701852000902714655001202723IND50069165820221122063938.0130913s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006916582DNAL7 a10.1071/FP122962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales, Aguida M.

By combining expression profiling and virus induced gene silencing (VIGS), we are developing a genetic framework for Rpp4-mediated resistance. We measured gene expression in mock-inoculated and P. pachyrhizi-infected leaves of resistant soybean accession PI459025B (Rpp4) and the susceptible cultivar (Williams 82) across a 12-day time course. Unexpectedly, two biphasic responses were identified. In the incompatible reaction, genes induced at 12h after infection (hai) were not differentially expressed at 24 hai, but were induced at 72 hai. In contrast, genes repressed at 12 hai were not differentially expressed from 24 to 144 hai, but were repressed 216 hai and later. To differentiate between basal and resistance-gene (R-gene) mediated defence responses, we compared gene expression in Rpp4-silenced and empty vector-treated PI459025B plants 14 days after infection (dai) with P. pachyrhizi. This identified genes, including transcription factors, whose differential expression is dependent upon Rpp4. To identify differentially expressed genes conserved across multiple P. pachyrhizi resistance pathways, Rpp4 expression datasets were compared with microarray data previously generated for Rpp2 and Rpp3-mediated defence responses. Fourteen transcription factors common to all resistant and susceptible responses were identified, as well as fourteen transcription factors unique to R-gene-mediated resistance responses. These genes are targets for future P. pachyrhizi resistance research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhakopsora pachyrhizi 3acultivars 3agene expression 3agene silencing 3agenes 3asoybean rust 3asoybeans 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 3aviruses 0adefence 0agenomics 0aresistant genes 0aRpp4 0asoybean1 aO’Rourke, Jamie A.1 avan de Mortel, Martijn1 aScheider, Katherine T.1 aBancroft, Timothy J.1 aBorém, Aluízio1 aNelson, Rex T.1 aNettleton, Dan1 aBaum, Thomas J.1 aShoemaker, R.

Evaporation dominates post‐fire ET, with canopy and sub‐canopy removal restricting transpiration and increasing evaporation potential. Therefore, in order to project the hydrology and associated stability of peatlands to a diverse range of post‐fire weather conditions and future climates the regulation of evaporation must be accurately parameterised in peatland ecohydrological models. To achieve this, we measure the surface resistance (rₛ) to evaporation over the growing season one year post‐fire within four zones of a boreal peatland that burned to differing depths, relating rₛ to near surface soil tensions. We show that the magnitude and temporal variability in rₛ varies with burn severity. At the peatland scale, rₛ and near‐surface tension correlates non‐linearly. However, at the point scale no relationship was evident between temporal variations in rₛ and near‐surface tension across all burn severities; in part due to the limited fluctuation in near‐surface tensions and the precision of rₛ measurements. Where automated measurements enabled averaging of errors, the relationship between near‐surface tension and rₛ switched between periods of strong and weak correlation within a burned peat hummock. This relationship, when strong, deviated from that obtained under steady state laboratory conditions; increases in rₛ were more sensitive to fluctuations in near‐surface tension under dynamic field conditions. Calculating soil vapour densities directly from near‐surface tensions is shown to require calibration between peat types and provides little if any benefit beyond the derivation of empirical relationships between rₛ and measured soil tension. Thus, we demonstrate important spatiotemporal fluctuations in post‐fire rₛ that will be key to regulating post‐fire peatland hydrology, but highlight the complex challenges in effectively parameterising this important underlying control of near‐surface tensions within hydrological simulations.  aPublisher supplied data  aNSERC‐CRDPJ477235‐14cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  aSCL4600100599cSyncrude Canada Ltd & Canadian Natural Resources Ltd 3aautomation 3aburn severity 3acanopy 3acarbon 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3ahydrologic cycle 3apeat 3apeatlands 3asoil 3atemporal variation 3atranspiration 3avapors 3aweather 3awildfires1 aLukenbach, Maxwell C.1 aHokanson, Kelly J.1 aDevito, Kevin J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8216-09851 aPetrone, Richard M.1 aMendoza, Carl A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2731-00041 aWaddington, James Michael0 tHydrological processes.g2021 Apr., v. 35, no. 4 p.e14132-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3938466x0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.141323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245008700205300001600292500001900308520200300327592002802330596005902358596005902417650002302476650001402499650001602513650001102529650002702540650001802567650001102585650001402596650001802610700001602628700001502644700001402659700001502673700001902688773012902707856008202836852000902918655001202927IND60723997720221119143900.0210119e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072399772DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-020-02025-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Guojian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0629-515910aMicrobial colonization on the leaf surfaces of different genotypes of Napier grass  ap. 335-346.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo address correlations between population sizes of microbes on the leaf surfaces and leaf morphological and physicochemical properties, various leaf morphological and physicochemical features as possible predictors of microbial population sizes on the leaf surfaces of four Napier grass cultivars were assessed. Results indicated microbes except for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) preferred to colonize the leaf surfaces bearing trichomes, and their population sizes were significantly correlated with trichomes, especially for yeasts. The population sizes of microbes were positively correlated with soluble sugar content (p < 0.05). Furthermore, no significant correlation was found between population sizes of microbes and wax content, except for yeasts. The multivariate regression trees (MRT) analysis showed different genotypes of leaf–microbe system could be characterized by four-leaf attributes with soluble sugar of leaf tissues being the primary explanatory attribute. Leaves with soluble sugar content below 9.72 mg g⁻¹ fresh weight (FW) were rarely colonized. For leaves with soluble sugar content above 9.72 mg g⁻¹ FW, water content was the next explanatory leaf attribute, followed by wax content on the leaf surfaces. Leaves with higher water content (> 73%) were more colonized, and small microbial population was associated with higher wax content (> 10.66 mg g⁻¹ dry matter). In conclusion, leaf chemical attributes have a higher contribution than morphological structure properties in determining population sizes of microbes on the leaf surfaces. The exuded soluble sugar and protein promote the development of microbial populations. For different genotypes of leaf–microbe system, the relationship between microbial abundance on their leaf surfaces and leaf morphological structure or physicochemical properties may be predicted by the MRT. Population sizes of microbes are primarily influenced by soluble sugar content under the water-rich conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  a31672486cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31971764cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aCenchrus purpureus 3acultivars 3alactic acid 3aleaves 3amicrobial colonization 3asugar content 3asugars 3atrichomes 3awater content1 aXu, Liuxing1 aYin, Xiang1 aHu, Yaqin1 aTian, Jing1 aZhang, Jianguo0 tArchives of microbiology.g2021 Jan., v. 203, no. 1 p.335-346dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl49610x0302-89337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-020-02025-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03493naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245019000167520172900357592002802086650002202114650002502136650001202161650002402173650002802197650002402225650002102249650001102270650001802281650000702299650001902306650001902325650001202344650002902356650003302385650001602418650001702434650003702451653002402488653002702512653003402539653001802573653001702591700006302608700002702671700001802698700002202716773013302738856008302871852000902954655001202963IND60626685220221118180753.0190502e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062668522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enmm.2018.1001982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRouhani, Zahra10aResponse surface optimization of hydrothermal synthesis of Bismuth ferrite nanoparticles under supercritical water conditions: Application for photocatalytic degradation of Tetracycline  aUltrafine bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) powders have been successfully synthesized through supercritical water hydrothermal technique, in a batch type reactor. A Box–Behnken three-level experimental design was used to optimize the process variables affecting the BiFeO3 efficiency includes pH of starting solution (1.5–12.5), reaction time (1–2 h), and reaction temperature (450–550 ℃). The samples were characterized via X–ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The model was validated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and conducting an experiment at optimal design conditions (temperature of 522 ℃, pH of 3.25 and 1.3 h). The maximum BiFeO3 production efficiency which obtained at optimum condition was about 45%. The attained results showed good correlation between the predicted model and experimental data (Model P-Value = 0.0052). The present work confirmed that the supercritical water hydrothermal method is a suitable way to produce BiFeO3 nanoparticles with a mean grain size of 60 nm and narrow size distribution. Moreover, the optical property of the product was investigated by Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The attained nanostructures showed a narrow band gap of 1.96 eV, indicating that BiFeO3 powders can be applied as a novel visible-light-responsive photocatalyst for degradation of tetracycline (TC). Photocatalytic experiments revealed that using BiFeO3 nanoparticles, TC degradation efficiency of 80.3% and 87.5% could be reached under UV and visible light radiations, respectively. Furthermore, it was found the degradation of TC follows the pseudo-second-order kinetics by BiFeO3.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanalysis of variance 3abismuth 3aexperimental design 3aferrimagnetic materials 3ahot water treatment 3amodel validation 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apowders 3areflectance spectroscopy 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3atetracycline 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aSupercritical water 0aHydrothermal synthesis 0aBismuth ferrite nanoparticles 0aPhotocatalyst 0aTetracycline1 aKarimi-Sabet, Javad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9937-71711 aMehdipourghazi, Mohsen1 aHadi, Alireza1 aDastbaz, Abolfazl0 tEnvironmental nanotechnology, monitoring & management.g2019 May, v. 11 p.100198-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23256x2215-15327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enmm.2018.1001983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010400167300001800271500001900289520112700308592002801435596011101463596005501574650004401629650003701673650002201710650001501732650002401747650001401771650001301785650002001798650001401818650001801832700001901850700001601869700001501885700001501900700005101915700001201966700001601978700001201994700001502006773012102021856008302142852000902225655001202234IND60717559420221120114622.0201117e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071755942DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-05491-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shengnan10aCovering soy polysaccharides gel on the surface of β-cyclodextrin-based metal–organic frameworks  ap. 3049-3061.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, β-cyclodextrin-based metal–organic frameworks (β-CDMOFs) were successfully prepared using alkaline potassium ions through a hydrothermal method. Based on post-synthesis strategy, a facile protocol could enable exploitation of a green soft matter including rigid β-CDMOF through coating a natural edible soybean hull polysaccharides (SHPs). The morphology, crystal structure, thermal, infrared properties of β-CDMOF, dendricolloids and β-CDMOF complexes (β-CDMOF@SHP) were investigated. Optical and scanning electron microscopy results showed that SHP could capture scattered β-CDMOF into a formed dendritic hydrogel. Further, a weak interplay (coordination and hydrogen bonding) that occurred between SHP and β-CDMOF was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. Considering this renewable, rigid and soft dendritic β-CDMOF@SHP exhibits potential advantages in food, filtration membranes and the formation of pharmaceutical products.

Here we describe a facile and inexpensive method for fabricating the super-hydrophobic/super-oleophilic stainless steel meshes with the FAS modified electroless Ni-P composite coatings. The Ni-P particles on the mesh are spherical with a uniform size diameter and relatively concatenate each other to form a nanoscale rough surface. The static contact angles of the as-prepared meshes fall in between 124.4 ± 1.5° and 167.9 ± 2.1°. These meshes exhibit non-sticking of water, anti-fouling, and excellent penetrating through the oil properties. The prepared meshes can rapidly and continuously separate water-oil mixture without resorting to any extra driving force and the chemical agent. The best separation efficiency is 96.8%. The super-hydrophobic mesh is steady and reliable for a long-term separation of the water-oil mixtures. Finally, a separation mechanism of the super-hydrophobic meshes for the water-oil mixtures is proposed. We anticipate that the prepared meshes could provide a candidate application to effective waste oil cleanup and other rapid water-oil separation processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3acolloids 3aoils 3aporous media 3astainless steel 3awastes 0aSuper-hydrophobicity 0aElectroless plating 0aStainless steel mesh 0aWater-oil separation1 aLi, Shuo1 aCheng, Zhiliang1 aXu, Guiying1 aQuan, Xuejun1 aZhou, Yuting0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Mar. 05, v. 540 p.224-232dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.12.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100004500181245011300226300001800339506007600357520159100433592002802024506003702052650001502089650002502104650002802129650001402157650001202171650001802183650001702201650001402218650001502232650001202247650001402259650002302273650001202296700001902308700001802327700001402345700002002359700002102379700002002400700002502420700001902445773014202464856007402606852000902680655001202689IND60642454320221207122130.0190507e20161026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064245432DNAL7 a10.1039/c6tb01814a2doi7 aPMC54237332pmcid7 a285033052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVega L.Equal contributors., Johana C.

Increasing evidence suggests that cell–cell adhesion controlled by the intercellular cadherin junction plays important roles in the quality of the resulting engineered tissue. These findings prompted efforts to interrogate biological effects of cadherin at a molecular scale; however, few efforts were made to harness the effects of cadherin on cells cultured in an in vivo-like three dimensional matrix. To this end, this study reports a hydrogel matrix three dimensionally functionalized with a controlled number of Fc-tagged recombinant N-cadherins (N-Cad-Fc). To retain the desired conformation of N-Cad, these cadherins were immobilized and oriented to the gel by anti-Fc-antibodies chemically coupled to gels. The gels were processed to present N-Cad-Fc in uniaxially aligned microchannels or randomly oriented micropores. Culturing cortical cells in the functionalized gels generated a large fraction of neurons that are functional as indicated by increased intracellular calcium ion concentrations with the microchanneled gel. In contrast, direct N-Cad-Fc immobilization to microchannel or micropore walls of the gel limited the growth of neurons and increased the glial to neuron ratio. The results of this study will be highly useful to organize a wide array of cadherin molecules in a series of biomaterials used for three-dimensional cell culture and to regulate phenotypic activities of tissue-forming cells in an elaborate manner.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanisotropy 3abioactive properties 3abiocompatible materials 3acadherins 3acalcium 3acell adhesion 3acell culture 3ahydrogels 3amicropores 3aneurons 3aphenotype 3atissue engineering 3atissues1 aLee, Min Kyung1 aQin, Ellen C.1 aRich, Max1 aLee, Kwan Young1 aKim, Tong-hyŏn,1 aChung, Hee Jung1 aLeckband, Deborah E.1 aKong, Hyunjoon0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2016 Oct. 26, v. 4, no. 42 p.6803-6811dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6tb01814a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245008000181300001300261520092500274592002801199650001901227650002201246650000901268650001101277650000901288650002701297650001101324650001801335650001601353650001301369650003301382650001001415650001301425650001601438650002801454653001901482653001901501653001601520653001301536700003201549700002401581700002901605700002001634700003501654773009601689856008401785852000901869655001201878IND60122625720221121035427.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012262572DNAL7 a10.1080/19476337.2013.7771232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-Miranda, Jesús10aEffect of some variables on oil extraction yield from Mexican pumpkin seeds  ap. 9-15.  aThe effect of particle size (0.59 and 1.19 mm), meal to solvent ratio (1:5, 1:10, 1:15, and 1:20 w/v) and contact time (0, 1, 2, and 5 h) on oil extraction yield and efficiency from pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) seeds using n-hexane were evaluated.

Pumpkin seed oil contained (755 g/kg) unsaturated fatty acids and an elevated content of linoleic (431 g/kg) and oleic acids (324 g/kg).

NiNW with an average diameter and length of 35 nm and 5 μm, respectively, were firstly prepared by Ni electrodeposition in an anodic aluminum oxide template. The NiNW surfaces were then coated with siliceous shells containing dithiocarbamate groups via a one-step procedure consisting in the alkaline hydrolytic co-condensation of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and a siloxydithiocarbamate precursor (SiDTC). A small amount of these new nanoadsorbents (2.5 mg·L–¹) removed 99.8% of mercury ions from aqueous solutions with concentration 50 μg·L–¹ and in less than 24 h of contact time. This outstanding removal ability is attributed to the high affinity of the sulfur donor ligands to Hg(II) species combined with the high surface area-to-volume ratio of the NiNW.  aPublisher supplied data 3asulfur 3aaqueous solutions 3aions 3amercury 3aaluminum oxide 3aligands 3asorbents 3amagnetic separation 3ananowires 3anickel 0awater quality monitoring 0adithiocarbamate 0aferromagnetic 0areports 0anickel nanowires1 aTavares, Daniela S.1 aDaniel-da-Silva, Ana L.1 aLopes, Cláudia B.1 aPereira, Eduarda1 aAraújo, João

Identification of black aspergilli associated with these grains is necessary to make sure of the safety of the grains because its occurrence is an indicator of mycotoxin production. Forty-five isolates were isolated from the samples collected from Upper Egypt’s markets and identified morphologically based on colony color, conidia, stipe and vesicle size and molecularly by using β-tubulin and calmodulin genes. Isolates were divided into 30 strains of Aspergillus welwitschiae and 15 strains of A. niger. We have found new criteria in the morphological identification of A. welwitschiae as its colony color was black to brown with yellow edge, but in A. niger was black with white edge, also A. welwitschiae sometimes produced finely-to-distinctly roughened brownish conidia on malt extract agar (MEA) media. Thirteen isolates of A. welwitschiae and six of A. niger were recognized as potential producers for ochratoxin A.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3acalmodulin 3acolor 3aconidia 3acorn 3aculture media 3alivestock feeds 3amicrobiology 3aochratoxin A 3awheat 3aEgypt1 aMaghraby, Thanaa A.1 aHamza, Lamiaa H.

Microbes have an essential role to play in the biogeochemical cycles, mineralization of organic water, along with xenobiotics degradation. Microbial dynamics are susceptible to environmental stressors which includes pollutants such as antibiotics, metals, and other degradants. River Yamuna is polluted extensively by domestic and industrial wastes. Xenobiotics, when released into the environment, can lead to water pollution. The present study evaluates the microbial diversity in Yamuna River (28°40′5.53′′ N, 77°15′0.35′′ E) along with the prediction of the metagenome function. In this context, the metagenomic DNA was extracted and sequencing was done on Illumina@MiSeq platform. The total number of OTUs picked was 41,994, out of which 74% were classified within the kingdom Bacteria. 35% of the OTUs were assigned to phylum Proteobacteria, followed by Bacteriodetes (22%), whereas 26% of OTUs were unassigned. PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) was used to predict metagenomic functions using 16S rDNA as a marker. Metagenomic reads were assigned to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Cluster of Orthologous (COG), and Gene Ontology (GO). Functional characterization reveals the presence of methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein which is an important adaptation for the microbes in the environment. The enzymes can be mapped for the bioremediation of xenobiotics. Information obtained from the amplicon sequencing of River Yamuna, collaborated with “omic” studies, may help in the design of bioremediation strategies and can be used for environmental clean-up of pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProteobacteria 3abioremediation 3achemotaxis 3afreshwater 3agene ontology 3ametagenomics 3amineralization 3aphylogeny 3aprediction 3ariver water 3arivers 3awater pollution 3axenobiotics1 aMohit, Kumar,1 aSingh, Dileep Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5522-523X0 tArchives of microbiology.g2021 Jan., v. 203, no. 1 p.367-375dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl49610x0302-89337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-020-02045-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245010700173300001800280500001900298520169300317592002802010596009702038650002202135650001202157650003402169650002102203650000902224650001302233650002402246650001902270650002302289700002002312700006202332773012102394856008302515852000902598655001202607IND60717559820221120114504.0201117e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071755982DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-05468-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDalal, Md Habibullah10aCathodic exfoliation of graphite into graphene nanoplatelets in aqueous solution of alkali metal salts  ap. 3612-3622.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aElectrochemical exfoliation has emerged as a green, effective and scalable route for mass production of graphene. Cathodic exfoliation of graphite, offers a direct production of high quality and low defect graphene. However, the protocols for cathodic exfoliation reported to date, use mostly non-aqueous electrolytes which require extended period of intercalation, and post-treatment to further exfoliate the intercalated graphene layers. In contrast, the employment of environment friendly aqueous-based electrolytes, coupling with a shorter exfoliation period would be attractive features of any new protocol. Here, we demonstrate efficient cathodic electrochemical exfoliation of graphite to graphene nanoplatelets in aqueous electrolytes using common and inexpensive alkali-metal salts such as KCl. The key driving force to exfoliate graphite successfully in aqueous electrolyte is applying a sufficiently high voltage, and a high salt concentration which facilitate cation intercalation, and promotes hydrogen evolution to exfoliate the graphene. The cathodic exfoliated graphene nanoplatelets using KCl aqueous electrolyte exhibits a low defect density (ID/IG of 0.06, a C/O ratio of 57.8), high graphite exfoliation yields (> 80%) in short times (< 10 min for a graphite foil of 1 cm × 1 cm × 0.0254 cm, 30.0 mg). The highly conductive structure consists mainly of 10–13 layers graphene sheets that serve as an excellent support material for electrocatalytic reactions. This environment-benign aqueous-based cathodic electrochemical exfoliation of graphite opens a new opportunity in large-scale and low-cost production of high-quality graphene nanoplatelets.  aPublisher supplied data  aCE 140100012cCentre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science, Australian Research Council 3aaqueous solutions 3acations 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3afoil 3agraphene 3ahydrogen production 3ananocomposites 3asalt concentration1 aLee, Chong-Yong1 aWallace, Gordon G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0381-72730 tJournal of materials science.g2021 Feb., v. 56, no. 4 p.3612-3622dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-05468-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010500169500001900274520148400293592002801777650003701805650000901842650001101851650001701862650001401879650001301893650001701906650001901923650001001942653001701952653001601969653003201985653002402017653002502041700001602066700002402082700001502106700002602121700001602147773009602163856008502259852000902344655001202353IND60686439420221118235854.0201023e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068643942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2020.1156582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSobhani, Zahra10aIdentification and visualisation of microplastics/nanoplastics by Raman imaging (i): Down to 100 nm  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWhile microplastics (1 μm–5 mm) contamination is creating public concern, nanoplastics (<1000 nm) might create even more serious environmental contamination issues. This is likely due to the smaller size/higher specific surface area of nanoplastics which works more efficiently as a vector for other contaminants’ transportation and fate, to release the formulation additives and to be accumulated in the human body. The research on nanoplastics is currently hampered by the absence of an effective characterisation method, although X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy/Scanning Electron Microscopy (XPS/SEM) is reportedly dominating the nanoplastics characterisation approaches. Recently, imaging technology, which provides direct visualisation of the targets, is attracting increased attention. In this study, we demonstrate that Raman imaging can be employed to visualise and identify microplastics and nanoplastics down to 100 nm, by distinguishing the laser spot, the pixel size/image resolution, the nanoplastics size/position (within a laser spot), the Raman signal intensity, and via the sample preparation etc. We also validate this technique for the analysis of paint-polishing dust samples that have been collected from a driveway when a vehicle’s clear coating of poly-acrylic was polished by hand. We estimate that billions-trillions of microplastics/nanoplastics ranging from ∼7 μm down to ∼200 nm have been generated by hand-polishing an engine hood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3adust 3ahumans 3ananoplastics 3apollution 3aresearch 3asurface area 3atransportation 3awater 0aMicroplastic 0aNanoplastic 0aEnvironmental contamination 0aRaman mapping image 0aPaint-polishing dust1 aZhang, Xian1 aGibson, Christopher1 aNaidu, R.,1 aMegharaj, Mallavarapu1 aFang, Cheng0 tWater research.g2020 May 01, v. 174 p.115658-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.1156583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011700175300001300292520092700305592002801232650001901260650002001279650001801299650003001317650001901347650000901366650001701375650001901392650002301411653004901434653004701483653003001530653001801560773023701578856008601815852000901901655001201910IND60544425820221120200000.0190416e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054442582DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-6339(15)30026-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlum, Winfried E.H.10aSoil and Land Resources for Agricultural Production: General Trends and Future Scenarios-A Worldwide Perspective  ap. 1-14.  aBased on the global distribution of land and soil quality and the world population, future trends in the agricultural use of land and soil resources are described, which will severely compromise future global food and fiber production through the increase and the spatial changes of world population, through the loss of fertile land caused by insufficient soil management and through urbanisation and industrialization Moreover, future changes in life style and the increasing demand for food and bioenergy, trough changes in world economy, through climate change and a worldwide decrease in fresh water supply, sustainable land use for the production of food and fiber will be under threat.Until 2050 global food production must be doubled for satisfying global needs.

The higher frequency of some phenotypes in urban vs rural/wild areas has led to the assumption that directional selection in urban habitats occurs, which may thereby favour some behavioural and physiological traits in urban animal populations compared to rural ones. However, empirical evidence of directional selection on phenotypic traits in urban areas remains scarce. In this study we tested whether eumelanin‐based colouration could be linked to survival in two urban populations of the feral pigeon Columba livia. A number of studies in different cities pointed out a higher frequency of darker individuals in more urbanised areas compared to rural ones. To investigate whether directional selection through survival on this highly heritable trait could explain such patterns, we conducted mark–recapture studies on two populations of feral pigeons in highly urbanized areas. We predicted that darker coloured individuals would exhibit higher survival and/or philopatry (integrated into ‘local survival’) than paler coloured ones. No difference in local survival was found between adults of different colouration intensities. However, on one site, we found that darker juveniles had a higher local survival probability than light ones. Juvenile local survival on that site was also negatively correlated with the number of chicks born. This suggests the existence of colour‐ and/or density‐dependent selection processes acting on juvenile feral pigeons in urban environments, acting through differential mortality and/or dispersal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColumba livia 3aadults 3achicks 3acities 3acolor 3acorrelation 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3amortality 3aphenotype 3apigeons 3aprobability 3aurban areas 3aurban population 3aurbanization1 aDauphin, Lise1 aJacquin, Lisa1 aGasparini, Julien1 aPrévot‐Julliard, Anne‐Caroline0 tJournal of avian biology.g2013 Nov., v. 44, no. 6 p.583-590dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-048X.2013.00087.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245017100167520117500338592002801513650001601541650001401557650002101571650001201592650001201604650001501616650001701631650001301648650002501661650002201686653002801708653001801736653003001754653002401784700001601808700001601824773011201840856008501952852000902037655001202046IND60748022420221119190509.0210911e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074802242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2021.1197502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGou, Jingren12aA novel method to prepare a highly porous separator based on nanocellulose with multi-scale pore structures and its application for rechargeable lithium ion batteries  aNanocellulose has been adopted to fabricate renewable and thermally stable separators for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). However, the nanofibrils tend to form dense network because of the capillarity during drying, consequently limiting the electrolyte retention capability of the membrane and blocking the migration of ions. To tackle the problems, a novel method is presented to fabricate a nanocellulose based separator with high porosity and multiscale pore structure. The micro-sized pores derived from the dissolution of PS spheres can assure a highly porous feature of the separator. The nano-sized pores fabricated from the ethanol bath further increase the porosity and improve the permeability of the separator. Although the resultant pores weaken the mechanical strength of the separator, the electrochemical performances including the ionic conductivity, interfacial resistance and electrochemical window are ameliorated due to the distinctive microstructures. Moreover, the battery performances, containing capacity retention and rate capability, of the coin battery assembled with the as-constructed separator are proven to be agreeable by the battery test.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapillarity 3acellulose 3aelectrochemistry 3aethanol 3alithium 3ananofibers 3apermeability 3aporosity 3astrength (mechanics) 3athermal stability 0aNanocellulose separator 0aHigh porosity 0aMultiscale pore structure 0aLithium ion battery1 aLiu, Wangyu1 aTang, Aimin0 tJournal of membrane science.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 639 p.119750-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2021.1197503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04058naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010300159500001900262500002000281520229500301592002802596596005902624596005902683596014802742596014502890650001103035650001203046650001503058650001703073650000803090650001003098650002803108650002303136650001403159650000903173650001103182650001403193650001903207650002503226651001703251700005403268700001603322700001903338773012503357856007303482852000903555655001203564IND60735971220221116204433.0210430e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073597122DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.141362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jingzhong10aRecords of hydrological change and environmental disasters in sediments from deep Lake Issyk‐Kul  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn the context of global warming, the mountainous areas of Central Asia are sensitive to climate and environmental changes and are highly vulnerable to natural disasters. Here, we use high‐resolution lacustrine grain‐size and geochemical records from Lake Issyk‐Kul to infer hydrological changes, environmental events, and their driving factors in the western Tianshan Mountains of Central Asia over the last 350 years. The regional hydrological and environmental changes can be divided into three phases. In stage I (1674–1860 AD), the values of total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and magnetic susceptibility (MS) were high, and the element contents changed indistinctively, suggesting that lake water levels were relatively stable. In Stage II (1860–2000 AD), the TOC and TN contents increased, the MS values decreased, and the grain size changed markedly, suggesting that water levels fluctuated dramatically. In Stage III (2000–2013 AD), the coarse particle and migratory element contents increased dramatically, indicating that regional rainfall and runoff increased and that the water level rose. Studies have also shown that the synchronous increases in sedimentary coarse particles, TOC and migratory elements indicate multiple flood events. Extreme floods have been frequent and intense in recent years, which indicates that the climate is generally warming, which is in good agreement with tree ring data, ice core records and other sediment records in alpine regions. Additionally, the lake sediments recorded a seismic event in approximately 1910 AD, which was consistent with historical documentation. Comparative analysis of records suggests that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation is one of the dominant factors driving climate and hydrological changes in the study area. Climate change, combined with natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes) and anthropogenic activities, is generating extreme floods and variations in hydrological patterns in the mountain basin. These findings can provide crucial information about sedimentary physicochemical clues for tracking past hydrological and environmental conditions and contribute to a better understanding of hydrological processes and driving factors in the mountainous areas of Central Asia.  aPublisher supplied data  aU2003202cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41671200cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aXDA2006030101cThe Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Pan‐Third Pole Environment Study for a Green Silk Road  a2017ZYKG01cThe Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Pan‐Third Pole Environment Study for a Green Silk Road 3abasins 3aclimate 3ageophysics 3agrowth rings 3aice 3alakes 3amagnetic susceptibility 3amigratory behavior 3amountains 3arain 3arunoff 3asediments 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal organic carbon 3aCentral Asia1 aWu, Jinglu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9589-03221 aZhan, Shuie1 aZhou, Jianchao0 tHydrological processes.g2021 Apr., v. 35, no. 4 p.e14136-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3938466x0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.141363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005300139245012000192300001600312500002000328520177100348592002802119650002502147650002302172650001102195650001102206650001402217650001402231650001802245650001702263650001502280650001402295650001302309650001102322650001102333650001402344650002202358650001102380651001202391700002002403700002302423773012802446856007302574852000902647655001202656IND60614898020221117210153.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061489802DNAL7 a10.1111/eff.124092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaer, Jan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8388-668410aAbiotic triggers for sea and river lamprey spawning migration and juvenile outmigration in the River Rhine, Germany  ap. 988-998.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe activity patterns of migrating lampreys (sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus and river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis) are poorly understood. This study uses extensive screening data from the cooling water intake of a nuclear power plant on the River Rhine, Germany, gathered on 1308 days over 46 consecutive months between 2011 and 2014. More than 34,000 lampreys were retrieved, of which the great majority (99.9%) were outmigrating nonfeeding postmetamorphic individuals. The main factors controlling outmigration were season, water temperature and river discharge. The bulk of downstream migration was observed each year in spring at water temperatures between 9 and 12°C, with earlier migrations during significant discharge peaks between December and February. The migration activity of postmetamorphic individuals declined during summer and autumn, regardless of discharge. Turbidity increased the occurrence of postmetamorphic lampreys and supported diurnal migration, which accounted for nearly 20% of all lamprey records. In winter, outmigrating individuals of both species exhibited significantly longer body lengths than those detected during other seasons. Haematophagus postmetamorphic sea lampreys were also retrieved (n = 28) and represent the most upstream records of parasitically feeding sea lamprey detected thus far. Adult lampreys migrating upstream were found mainly in spring, but in very low numbers, indicating high prespawning mortalities. The study points to a challenging future for the protection of lampreys in this area: the long duration and the round‐the‐clock nature of the observed migration demand flexible solutions to realise safe operational windows for water intake stations and to minimise impacts on juvenile lampreys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLampetra fluviatilis 3aPetromyzon marinus 3aadults 3aautumn 3ajuveniles 3amortality 3anuclear power 3apower plants 3ariver flow 3ascreening 3aspawning 3aspring 3asummer 3aturbidity 3awater temperature 3awinter 3aGermany1 aHartmann, Frank1 aBrinker, Alexander0 tEcology of freshwater fish.g2018 Oct., v. 27, no. 4 p.988-998dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3895938x0906-66917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.124093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006200140245015400202300001800356500002000374520126700394592002801661596002701689596002601716650003001742650000901772650001101781650002401792650001301816650001101829650001101840650001101851650001701862650001601879651003101895700002001926700001801946700002401964700002301988773014502011856007502156852000902231655001202240IND60788374420221117004036.0220813e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078837442DNAL7 a10.1002/nafm.103712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStout, J.

However, the presence of ghost tags (i.e., PIT tags left in the system after a fish dies) creates uncertainty about the status (live or dead) of tags detected. Herein, we describe our raft‐based mobile PIT tag antenna system, which was used to evaluate the movements of “seeded tags” (i.e., PIT tags that we placed in the river as ghost tag analogs) and their interactions with habitat features. We deployed 5,000 seeded tags in the San Juan River, a large sand‐bed river in the southwestern USA. Total distances moved by PIT tags ranged from 0.8 to 4,124 m, but 75% of movements were less than 100 m. Flow conditions causing the smallest to largest movements were (1) base flows, (2) spring runoff flows, (3) flash flood flows, and (4) a combination of spring runoff and flash flood flows. Based on Ivlev's electivity index, tags were more likely to be detected in riffles than in runs. These findings will help to classify mobile PIT tag detections as ghost tags or live fish, a critical data gap limiting the accurate estimation of demographic rates, population status metrics, and descriptions of the habitat use of fishes.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Geological Survey  cBureau of Reclamation 3aadministrative management 3afish 3afloods 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3arivers 3arunoff 3aspring 3atransponders 3auncertainty 3aSouthwestern United States1 aConner, Mary M.1 aBudy, Phaedra1 aMackinnon, Peter D.1 aMcKinstry, Mark C.0 tNorth American journal of fisheries management.g2019 Dec., v. 39, no. 6 p.1337-1347dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19701x0275-59477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.103713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03452naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009000166500001900256520226600275592002802541650001802569650001002587650001902597650001102616650001102627650001402638650001302652650001002665651001002675653002102685653003002706653001902736653002102755700001502776700001702791700001602808700001602824773009602840856008502936852000903021655001203030IND60686439720221118235950.0200412e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068643972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2020.1156702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yang10aPerformance of host-associated genetic markers for microbial source tracking in China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNumerous genetic markers have been developed to establish microbial source tracking (MST) assays in the last decade. However, the selection of suitable markers is challenging due to a lack of understanding of fundamental factors such as sensitivity, specificity, and concentration in target/nontarget hosts, especially in East Asia. In this study, a total of 506 faecal samples comprised of human and 12 nonhuman hosts were collected from 28 cities across China and tested for marker performance characteristics. We firstly tested 40 host-associated markers based on a binary (presence/absence) criterion. Here, 15 markers (7 human-associated, 4 pig-associated, 3 ruminant-associated, and 1 poultry-associated) showed potential applicability in our study area. The selected 15 markers were then tested using qualitative and quantitative methods to characterise their performance. Overall, Bacteroidales markers presented higher sensitivity and concentrations in target samples compared to other bacterial or viral markers, but their specificity was low. Among nontarget samples, pets accounted for 43.7% and 35.7% of cross-reactivity with human-associated and poultry-associated markers, respectively. Noncommon animals, including horse and donkey, contributed 61.3% of cross-reactivity with ruminant-associated markers. When considering the quantitative distribution of markers, their concentration in nontarget samples were 1–3 orders of magnitude lower than in target samples. Moreover, a novel classification method was proposed to classify the nontarget hosts into four groups spanning “no cross-reactivity”, “weak cross-reactivity”, “moderate cross-reactivity”, and “strong cross-reactivity” animal hosts. There were 77.9% nontarget samples identified as no cross-reactivity and weak cross-reactivity hosts, suggesting that these nontarget hosts produce little interference for corresponding markers. Our findings elucidate the performance of host-associated markers around China in a qualitative and quantitative manner, and reveal the interference degree of cross-reactivity from nontarget animals to genetic markers, which will facilitate tracking of multiple faecal pollution sources and planning timely remedial strategies in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidales 3aasses 3across reaction 3ahorses 3ahumans 3apollution 3aresearch 3awater 3aChina 0aFaecal pollution 0aMicrobial source tracking 0aGenetic marker 0aQuantitative PCR1 aWu, Renren1 aLin, Kairong1 aWang, Yishu1 aLu, Junqing0 tWater research.g2020 May 15, v. 175 p.115670-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.1156703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245006300157300001800220500002000238520153700258592002801795596004801823650003001871650003401901650002601935650000901961650001001970650001101980700002001991700002302011773014502034856007502179852000902254655001202263IND60788374520221117004101.0220813e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078837452DNAL7 a10.1002/nafm.103702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDean, Jan C.10aOutput Performance of U.S.‐Built Backpack Electrofishers  ap. 1321-1328.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEight backpack electrofishers were subjected to maximum power output load tests over a wide range of resistances that equate to water conductivity. An electrical load corresponds to the power demand that is placed on a unit, and it is a function of applied voltage and electrical resistance. Electrofisher resistance is a function of its electrodes and of water conductivity. The models that were tested included the Aqua Shock Solutions AP1; the ETS Electrofishing Systems ABP‐3 and ABP‐4; the Midwest Lake Electrofishing Systems Infinity Xstream; and Smith‐Root models LR‐24, APEX, LR‐20B, and Model 12. Power output was plotted versus resistance and versus equated water conductivity for multiple pulsed direct current duty cycles. According to our test results and working model, the units that can fish successfully in the lowest conductivity include the APEX and Xstream (14 μS/cm), closely followed by the LR‐24 and LR‐20B (16 μS/cm). The Xstream and the ABP‐4 should fish successfully in the very highest water conductivity (2,800 μS/cm), followed by the AP1 (1,750 μS/cm) and the APEX and LR‐24 (1,350 μS/cm). These conductivity estimates are based on fishing in normal depth with standard electrodes, using pulsed direct current with a 25% duty cycle. For standardized and quantitative fish sampling, we recommend backpack electrofishers with independent controls for voltage, frequency, and duty cycle (or pulse width), fine voltage control, and accurate peak metering for voltage and current.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSFWS National Conservation Training Center 3aadministrative management 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrical resistance 3afish 3alakes 3amodels1 aTemple, Alan J.1 aSmith, Jeremiah W.0 tNorth American journal of fisheries management.g2019 Dec., v. 39, no. 6 p.1321-1328dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19701x0275-59477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.103703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010500169300001400274520119400288592002801482650003401510650002501544650002401569650001501593650001901608650001601627650001701643650001501660650001901675650002201694650002601716650002001742650001101762650001801773650001401791650000901805650001301814650001301827653002301840653002201863653002601885653002501911653002001936653001901956700001101975700001301986773009701999856008402096852000902180655001202189IND60122626220221121050539.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012262622DNAL7 a10.1080/19476337.2013.7922962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xin-Huai10aIn vitro cytoprotection of modified casein hydrolysates by plastein reaction on rat hepatocyte cells  ap. 40-47.  aCasein hydrolysate of a degree of hydrolysis of 9.4% was generated from caseinate using papain and modified by plastein reaction with extrinsic phenylalanine or tyrosine addition, and then fractionated by an ethanol-water solvent (6:4, v/v). Compared to casein hydrolysate or mixtures of casein hydrolysate and phenylalanine or tyrosine, two modified hydrolysates prepared thereof showed higher scavenging activity on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) or hydroxyl radicals and reducing power. The obtained soluble and precipitated fractions had higher and lower total hydrophobic amino acids especially stronger and weaker three antioxidant properties than the parent substrates, respectively. All hydrolysates particularly soluble fractions protected rat hepatocytes against H ₂O ₂- or galactosamine-induced injury in vitro , resulting in enhanced cell viability, decreased cellular malondialdehyde content, and lactate dehydrogenase leakage. Cytoprotection of the hydrolysates was observed at a dosage-dependence manner. A negative correlation (P < 0.05) was found between malondialdehyde content and scavenging activity on hydroxyl radicals or reducing power of the hydrolysates.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aantioxidant activity 3acasein hydrolysates 3acaseinates 3acell viability 3ahepatocytes 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3ahydroxyl radicals 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amalondialdehyde 3apapain 3aphenylalanine 3aplasteins 3arats 3asolvents 3atyrosine 0acasein hydrolysate 0aplastein reaction 0asolvent fractionation 0aantioxidant activity 0arat hepatocytes 0acytoprotection1 aFu, Yu1 aYue, Nan0 tCyTA: journal of food.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 12, no. 1 p.40-47dTaylor & Francisx1947-63457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19476337.2013.7922963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245014800166300001600314520178200330592002802112650001902140650000902159650001002168650001302178650001702191650001302208700001802221700001702239700001702256773007802273856008402351852000902435655001202444IND60095389920221123033158.0141104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009538992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2012.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJasinge, D.10aInvestigation of the influence of coal swelling on permeability characteristics using natural brown coal and reconstituted brown coal specimens  ap. 303-309.  aPermeability has been identified as one of the foremost factors that determine the effectiveness of CO₂ sequestration in deep coalbeds. Coal matrix swelling can cause a remarkable decrease in the permeability of a coalbed reservoir during the carbon dioxide injection process. The main aim of this paper is to correlate the diametrical swelling percentage with coal permeability. This experimental program further attempts to investigate the effect of gas flow properties in coal due to CO₂ sorption. Furthermore, the applicability of using a laboratory-made reconstituted coal specimen for permeability testing has been comprehensively investigated. A laboratory-based experimental program has been carried out using a high pressure triaxial experimental set-up. In this study, the effect of swelling on coal permeability has been investigated using two types of specimens. An intact brown coal specimen cored from a natural coal block and a reconstituted brown coal specimen made by compacting coal dust in a mould has been subjected to testing. Tests have been carried out under different gas injection and confining pressures. CO₂ and N₂ gases have been used as injection media. Gas injection has been carried out with two stages of N₂ injection, prior to and after CO₂ injection. Diametrical swelling of the two specimens has been compared with the permeability data. A good correlation was observed between permeability and coal swelling. The coal swelling percentage increased on exposure to carbon dioxide compared to exposure to N₂. This effect increased as gas injection pressure increased. Exposure of the coal specimens to CO₂ has contributed to a detrimental effect on permeability. This was clearly evident during the second injection of N₂ gas.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3agases 3anitrogen 3apermeability 3asorption1 aRanjith, P.G.1 aChoi, Xavier1 aFernando, J.0 tEnergy.g2012 Mar., v. 39, no. 1 p.303-309dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2012.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03422naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245014100153300001800294520182900312592002802141650002102169650002602190650002702216650002102243650001802264650002102282650001702303650002202320650001702342650001802359650001902377650001702396650001402413650001702427650001802444650001502462650000702477650002102484650002002505650002302525700001702548700002102565700001902586700002102605700001802626700002202644773014302666856007402809852000902883655001202892IND60642455120221120185426.0190507e20160914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064245512DNAL7 a10.1039/c6tb01855f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Chao10aGraphene oxide linked sulfonate-based polyanionic nanogels as biocompatible, robust and versatile modifiers of ultrafiltration membranes  ap. 6143-6153.  aAiming to enhance the current biological performances of ultrafiltration membranes, in this study, a new kind of graphene oxide linked sulfonate-based polyanionic nanogel (GO-SPN) was fabricated by free radical cross-linked copolymerization. Then, GO-SPN embedded polyethersulfone (PES/GO-SPN) ultrafiltration (UF) membranes were achieved through one-pot PES dissolution and interpenetration, followed by a liquid–liquid phase inversion method. The GO-SPN modified UF membranes exhibited increased porous cross-section structures with a pH-dependent water flux. Notably, the modified UF membranes showed excellent in vitro hemocompatibility and cytocompatibility performances, such as good anti-coagulant activity, red blood cell compatibility (with very low hemolysis ratios below 0.2%), anti-platelet adhesion and activation, low inflammation potential, and high endothelial cell compatibility. Moreover, to confirm the actual application potential of the GO-SPN embedded membranes in diverse fields, we also examined the performances of PES/GO-SPN composite hollow fiber UF membranes. It was validated that the mechanical properties of the hollow fiber UF membranes (tensile strength higher than 1.2 MPa) could satisfy the demands of industrial or clinical applications. Furthermore, the modified membranes exhibited versatile ability, i.e. they could load Ag-nanoparticles which bestowed them with excellent bactericidal capability (about 97%) against both Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Due to the integration of hemo- and cyto-compatibility, good mechanical strength as well as bactericidal capability, the GO-SPN embedded membranes offer a new protocol to greatly extend the application potential of UF membranes in fields ranging from clinical hemodialysis to water purification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aanticoagulant activity 3abiocompatibility 3acell adhesion 3acopolymerization 3acrosslinking 3aendothelial cells 3aerythrocytes 3afree radicals 3agraphene oxide 3ahemodialysis 3ahemolysis 3ainflammation 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3apH 3atensile strength 3aultrafiltration 3awater purification1 aCheng, Chong1 aNie, Sheng-Qiang1 aWang, Ling-Ren1 aNie, Chuan-Xiong1 aSun, Shu-Dong1 aZhao, Chang-Sheng0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2016 Sept. 14, v. 4, no. 36 p.6143-6153dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6tb01855f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03388naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245014100172300001400313500001500327520163500342592002801977650002402005650002202029650002002051650001802071650000902089650001802098650002602116650000902142650001502151650001702166650000902183650001302192650002302205650002302228650002002251650001802271651001302289653003302302653001902335653002202354653002402376700002102400700002502421700002102446700002502467700002102492773023802513856008602751852000902837655001202846IND60544426220221120180219.0190416e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054442622DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-6339(15)30028-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugino, Tomohide10aEffects of long-term organic material applications and green manure crop cultivation on soil organic carbon in rain fed area of Thailand  ap. 29-36.  a2019-12-06  aA long-term field experiment on organic material application and crop rotation with green manure crops has been conducted since 1976 at Lopburi Agricultural Research and Development Center, Department of Agriculture, Lop Buri Province, Thailand, to clarify the effect of organic materials and green manure crop on soil organic carbon changes. The stock change factors that stand for the relative change of soil organic carbon on the carbon stock in a reference condition (native vegetation that is not degraded or improved). Stock change factor for input of organic matter (FI), representing different levels of C input to soil such as organic material application, crop residue treatment and green manure crop cultivation, was computed with the present field experimental results. While the computed FI of "High input with manure" was within the range of IPCC default FI value, some of the computed FI of " High input without manure" was much higher than the IPCC default though it was varied due to the biomass production and nutrient contents of the green manure crops planted as the second crops after corn. Therefore, the FI computed by field experimental results can contribute to more accurate estimation of SOC changes in farm land especially in Southeast Asia because the default FI mostly depends on the experimental data in temperate zones. Moreover, the field experiment has focused the effect of reduced tillage practices on SOC changes and corn yield since 2011. The results of the experiment will be used to compute Stock change factor for management regime (FMG) which represents the effects of tillage operations.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil organic carbon 3aagricultural land 3areduced tillage 3acrop residues 3acorn 3agreen manures 3afield experimentation 3asoil 3acrop yield 3acarbon sinks 3arain 3aplanting 3aindigenous species 3abiomass production 3atemperate zones 3acrop rotation 3aThailand 0aOrganic material application 0aorganic matter 0aGreen manure crop 0aSoil organic carbon1 aNobuntou, Wanida1 aSrisombut, Nuttapong1 aRujikun, Praison1 aLuanmanee, Suphakarn1 aPunlai, Nongluck0 tInternational soil and water conservation research.g2013 Dec., v. 1, no. 3 p.29-36dElsevier B.V.aInternational Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation and China Water & Power PresswJournal:23246x2095-63397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-6339(15)30028-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245009600167300001800263520115400281592002801435650001601463650002401479650001001503650001401513650001801527650001601545650002801561650001801589650000701607650001901614650001901633650001701652700001901669700002101688773009801709856008701807990002301894852000901917655001201926IND60098028020221116215634.0141104e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009802802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2013.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hui10aPreparation of polyacrylamide based microgels with different charges for drug encapsulation  ap. 1479-1486.  aThe unique physicochemical properties of hydrogels have attracted considerable attention in their drug storage and delivery applications. Herein, a series of acrylamide based hydrogels with different charges (cationic, neutral, and anionic) under different pH (1, 7, and 13) were prepared via an inverse emulsion polymerization process. The effects of pH and aqueous to organic phase (w/o) ratio on the size of the produced hydrogels were studied. Fluorescein was used as the model drug to assess and optimize the encapsulation efficiency of the hydrogels. Optical microscopy and confocal fluorescence microscopy were carried out to examine the existence and distribution of fluorescein inside the hydrogels. It was found that the hydrogels were swollen to the greatest extent at pH=13 and their size increased with decreasing w/o ratio. Fluorescein was molecularly dispersed within the cationic and anionic hydrogels at pH=13 with an encapsulation efficiency of ∼45wt%. This study provides a convenient method to prepare hydrogels with the required properties and demonstrates the potential of using hydrogels to store and stabilize therapeutics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aconfocal microscopy 3adrugs 3aemulsions 3aencapsulation 3afluorescein 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahydrocolloids 3apH 3apolyacrylamide 3apolymerization 3atherapeutics1 aHelwa, Youssef1 aRempel, Garry L.0 tEuropean polymer journal.g2013 June, v. 49, no. 6 p.1479-1486dElsevier Ltdx0014-30577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2013.04.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03469naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002700146245017100173300001600344500001500360520182400375592002802199650001302227650002502240650002402265650001502289650002002304650001902324650002102343650001202364650003702376650001402413650001702427650002202444653001002466653004402476653001002520653002902530653003702559653001602596653001802612653001702630700002102647700002202668700001902690700001802709773013202727852000902859856008302868655001202951IND4447794720221119144241.0181016e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444779472DNAL7 a10.1177/1040638710022005022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoiacono, Christina M.10aDetection of PrPSᶜ in Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded Tissue by Western Blot Differentiates Classical Scrapie, Nor98 Scrapie, and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy  ap. 684-689.  a2019-12-04  aTransmissible, spongiform encephalopathies including bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and scrapie are fatal neurodegenerative disorders associated with the presence of an infectious abnormal isoform of normal mammalian proteins called prions. Identification of the prion protein associated with scrapie (PrPSᶜ) in the central nervous system is typically based upon immunoassays including immunohistochemistry (IHC) using formalin-fixed tissues or Western blot (WB) assays using fresh and/or frozen, non–formalin-fixed tissues. Each assay can discriminate between BSE, classical scrapie, and a previously reported strain of scrapie recently identified in the United States named Nor98 scrapie. Different tissue samples are required from the same animal to run these 2 different immunoassays. This may result in inconsistent test results for the same animal. Sampling problems such as collecting insufficient volumes of fresh tissue or less than optimal anatomic location of brainstem for IHC can affect the ability of the test procedures to offer definitive and discriminatory results. Recently, a WB method using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue to identify PrPSᶜ was developed that successfully identified PrPSᶜ in sheep affected by classical scrapie. In the current study, the use of this technique to produce discriminatory results identifying classical BSE in bovine tissue and both classical and Nor98 scrapie in ovine tissue using paraffin-embedded brain samples is described. Protein-banding patterns from WB using FFPE tissue were similar to protein-banding patterns produced by WB assays utilizing fresh tissues from the same animals, and results correlated well with the IHC PrPSᶜ-positive staining present in the cerebellum and obex regions of brain samples from these animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3asampling 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aexperimental design 3abrain stem 3atissue analysis 3aPrPSc proteins 3aWestern blotting 3ascrapie 3abovine spongiform encephalopathy 3adetection 3aformaldehyde 3adisease diagnosis 0aprion 0atransmissible spongiform encephalopathy 0abrain 0aparaffin-embedded tissue 0aBovine spongiform encephalopathy 0amethodology 0aNor98 scrapie 0aWestern blot1 aBeckwith, Nadine1 aKunkle, Robert A.1 aOrcutt, Dennis1 aHall, S.

The results showed that mid-infrared spectroscopy in conjunction with multivariate analysis can effectively be used to identify and quantify corncob in white and blue corn dough and in white and blue corn tortilla.  aPublisher supplied data 3adough 3atortillas 3acorn cobs 3acorn 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aadulterated products 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3achemometrics 3aalgorithms 3aprediction 0acorn tortilla 0aFTIR 0acorncob 0aadulteration 0amultivariate analysis 0acorn dough1 aMeza-Márquez, Ofelia Gabriela1 aOsorio-Revilla, Guillermo1 aGallardo-Velázquez, Tzayhrí0 tCyTA: journal of food.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 12, no. 1 p.65-72dTaylor & Francisx1947-63457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19476337.2013.7965723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001800146245011700164300001600281500001500297520107200312592002801384650002201412650002601434650001401460650001601474650001501490650000901505650001501514650001701529650001801546650002401564650001901588650001301607650002001620653002101640653001701661653001601678653002401694653003001718653004201748700002101790700001901811700002201830700002201852700002301874773013201897852000902029856008302038655001202121IND4447795120221119144308.0181016e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444779512DNAL7 a10.1177/1040638710022005032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeffré, Anne10aCanine Reference Intervals for Coagulation Markers Using the STA Satellite® and the STA-R Evolution® Analyzers  ap. 690-695.  a2019-12-04  aThe aim of the current study was to determine canine reference intervals for prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen, and antithrombin (AT) according to international recommendations. The STA Satellite® coefficients of variation of within-laboratory imprecision were 3.9%, 1.3%, 6.9%, and 5.1% for PT, APTT, fibrinogen, and AT, respectively. At 4°C, citrated specimens were stable up to 8 hr for whole blood and 36 hr for plasma, except for APTT, which increased slightly (<1 sec). Nonparametric reference intervals determined in citrated plasma from 139 healthy fasting purebred dogs were 6.9–8.8 sec, 13.1–17.2 sec, 1.24–4.30 g/l, and 104–188% for PT, APTT, fibrinogen, and AT, respectively. Based on Passing–Bablok comparison between STA Satellite and STA-R Evolution® using 60 frozen specimens from a canine plasma bank, the corresponding reference intervals were transferred to the STA-R Evolution: 7.1–9.2 sec, 12.9–17.3 sec, 1.20–4.43 g/l, and 94–159% for PT, APTT, fibrinogen, and AT, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood coagulation 3alaboratory techniques 3aprecision 3aprothrombin 3abiomarkers 3adogs 3afibrinogen 3ablood plasma 3arepeatability 3areference standards 3athromboplastin 3aaccuracy 3areproducibility 0aprothrombin time 0aantithrombin 0amethodology 0areference intervals 0ablood coagulation factors 0aActivated partial thromboplastin time1 aGrollier, Sophie1 aHanot, Camille1 aVergez, François1 aTrumel, Catherine1 aBraun, Jean-Pierre0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 22, no. 5 p.690-695dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638710022005033Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03217naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001100150245014900161520159800310592002801908650002501936650001901961650001601980650001501996650003402011650001502045650001302060650001502073650001302088650002002101650001602121653005602137653002302193653002902216653002302245653002502268700001502293700001402308700001802322700001602340700001702356700001602373700001802389700001402407700001502421700005702436773011202493856008502605852000902690655001202699IND60748023120221119190423.0210911e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074802312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2021.1197602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Bo10aPolybenzimidazole/cerium dioxide/graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets for high performance and durable high temperature proton exchange membranes  aA novel membrane was fabricated from polybenzimidazole (m-PBI) and cerium dioxide/graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (m-PBI-X wt%/CeO₂/g-C₃N₄) in order to achieve long-term durability and excellent performance as high temperature proton exchange membrane (HT-PEM) for fuel cells (FCs). The CeO₂ nanoparticles was employed to disperse 2D graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (g-C₃N₄) in the PBI solution as confirmed by SEM, and also to scavenge the possible hydroxyl radicals when the membrane is operated in the fuel cell device. Unlike to other composite membrane in which the introduction of nanoparticles generally resulted in the sacrificing of mechanical properties, the well dispersed g-C₃N₄ and CeO₂ in PBI membrane induced the excellent mechanical properties. Moreover, the abundant nitrogen atom in g-C₃N₄ showed strong interaction force with phosphoric acid as confirmed by theoretical calculation. Thus, high proton conductivities of composite membrane have been observed. Thus, the m-PBI/1% CeO₂/g-C₃N₄ composite membrane showed the highest peak power density of 540 mW cm⁻² at 160 °C, which is higher than that of the pristine m-PBI membrane (359.31 mW cm⁻²) under the same testing condition. Most importantly, the durability test demonstrated that the voltage has no obvious attenuation during the 200 h test indicating its excellent stability under the fuel cell device environment at 160 °C. These results indicated that the m-PBI-X wt%/CeO₂/g-C₃N₄ composite membranes was a promising membrane for the application of HT-PEMFCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetric membranes 3acarbon nitride 3aceric oxide 3adurability 3aelectric potential difference 3afuel cells 3agraphene 3ananosheets 3anitrogen 3aphosphoric acid 3atemperature 0aHigh temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell 0aComposite membrane 0aGraphitic carbon nitride 0aChemical stability 0aLong-term durability1 aGeng, Kang1 aYin, Hang1 aYang, Chuanyu1 aHao, Jinkai1 aLuan, Zoujie1 aHuang, Ziyi1 aQin, Xiaoping1 aSong, Wei1 aLi, Nanwen1 aShao, Zhigang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2777-63620 tJournal of membrane science.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 639 p.119760-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2021.1197603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009400167300001600261520137400277592002801651650001101679650002901690650002001719650001101739650001801750650003301768650001901801650001101820650001301831650002901844650000901873651001001882700001901892700001701911773007801928856008402006852000902090655001202099IND60095390420221122233829.0141104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009539042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2011.06.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArnesano, M.10aExtension of portfolio theory application to energy planning problem – The Italian case  ap. 112-124.  aEnergy procurement is a necessity which needs a deep study of both the demand and the generation sources, referred to consumers territorial localization. The study presented in this paper extends and consolidate the Shimon Awerbuch’s study on portfolio theory applied to the energy planning, in order to define a broad generating mix which optimizes one or more objective functions defined for a determined contest. For this purpose the computation model was specialized in energy generation problem and extended with the addition of new cost-risk settings, like renewable energy availability, and Black–Litterman model, which extends Markowitz theory. Energy planning was then contextualized to the territory: the introduction of geographic and climatic features allows to plan energy infrastructures on both global and local (regional, provincial, municipal) scale. The result is an efficient decision making tool to drive the investment on typical energy policy assets. In general the tool allows to analyze several scenarios in support of renewable energy sources, environmental sustainability, costs and risks reduction. In this paper the model was applied to the energy generation in Italy, and the analysis was done: on the actual energy mix; assuming the use of nuclear technology; assuming the verisimilar improvement of several technologies in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3adecision support systems 3aeconomic theory 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3aenvironmental sustainability 3ainfrastructure 3amodels 3aplanning 3arenewable energy sources 3arisk 3aItaly1 aCarlucci, A.P.1 aLaforgia, D.0 tEnergy.g2012 Mar., v. 39, no. 1 p.112-124dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2011.06.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010700158300001600265520145800281592002801739650001601767650002401783650001801807650001501825650001601840650001101856650001201867650001001879650001201889650001401901650001501915651001901930700002101949700002301970773012901993856007402122852000902196655001202205IND60765197420221117160515.0220904e20120111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076519742DNAL7 a10.17221/4629-jfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJankovský, L.10aDothistroma needle blight Mycosphaerella pini E.

Rostrup was observed for the first time in the Czech Republic on an imported Pinus nigra Arnold in 1999. In 2000, it was also found in the open planting. During three years, it became an important pathogen of pines in the Czech Republic. Its occurrence was noticed in more than 50 localities, above all in the region of Moravia and Silesia and eastern Bohemia. In total, it was found on 10 species of pine (P. nigra Arnold, P.&nbsp;banksiana Lamb., <br />P. contorta Loudon, P. mugo Turra, P.&nbsp;leucodermis Ant., P. sylvestris L., P. cembra L., P. aristata Engelm., P.&nbsp;ponderosa P. et C.&nbsp;Lawson and P. jeffreyi Grev. et Balf.). Also Picea pungens &nbsp;Engelm. was noticed as a host species. In the Czech Republic, Pinus nigra is the most frequent host species of M. pini (80% localities) followed by Pinus mugo (27% localities). On Scots pine P. sylvestris, M. pini was noticed at two localities. The critical period for infection is in the Czech Republic from the second half of May until the end of June. The incubation period lasts about 2&ndash;4 months depending on climatic conditions. The first symptoms on the needles infected in the current year appear in August being clearly expressed from September to November.In the CR, Dothistroma needle blight spread probably with infected planting stock obtained from import at the end of the 80s and at the beginning of the 90s.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDothistroma 3aMycosphaerella pini 3aPicea pungens 3aPinus mugo 3aPinus nigra 3ablight 3aforests 3ahosts 3aimports 3apathogens 3aquarantine 3aCzech Republic1 aBednářová, M.1 aPalovčíková, D.0 tJournal of Forest Science.g, v. 50, no. 7 p.319-326dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21419x1212-48347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/4629-jfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002400146245013400170300001600304500001500320520161900335592002801954650001501982650002601997650002602023650001302049650001302062650000902075650002302084650001902107650001402126650002002140650001302160650002202173653002702195653001402222653000902236653002502245700003002270700002202300773013202322852000902454856008302463655001202546IND4447795720221119144116.0181016e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444779572DNAL7 a10.1177/1040638710022005082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, Jennifer B.14aThe Effect of Inoculum Volume on the Microbiologic Detection of Naturally Occurring Staphylococcus Aureus Intramammary Infections  ap. 720-724.  a2019-12-04  aCurrently no standard definitions for the diagnosis of Staphylococcus aureus intramammary infection (IMI) exist. As a result, criteria applied in research to diagnose S. aureus IMIs have varied making comparisons between published works difficult. The goal of the current study was to define the optimal inoculum volume used in the diagnosis of naturally occurring S. aureus IMIs. Microbiologic results from 2 field studies examining S. aureus IMIs were used to examine the effects of inoculum volume on the microbiologic detection of S. aureus. A total of 1,583 milk samples were included in the analysis, and the results of using a 0.01-ml and a 0.1-ml inoculum are presented. Using a 0.01-ml inoculum resulted in a sensitivity of 91% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 88.6–93%) and a specificity of 99.4% (95% CI: 98.6–99.8%). Using the larger 0.1-ml inoculum resulted in a sensitivity of 96.8% (95% CI: 95.2–97.9%) and a specificity of 99.3% (95% CI: 98.4–99.7%). All false-positive samples were from S. aureus–negative quarters in S. aureus–positive cows. There were no false-positive cultures from S. aureus–negative cows. Of the false-negative samples, the majority (77%) were from 6 of the 34 S. aureus–positive quarters. Results from the current study of naturally occurring S. aureus IMIs support the hypothesis that, when using quarter level milk samples, a S. aureus IMI is most accurately diagnosed using a 0.1-ml inoculum. Regardless of inoculum volume, a single quarter sample culture that is positive with S. aureus (≥1 colony-forming unit) is sufficient to diagnose a S. aureus IMI.  aPublisher supplied data 3adairy cows 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3adiagnostic techniques 3asampling 3aaccuracy 3amilk 3apopulation density 3audder quarters 3aprecision 3abovine mastitis 3ainoculum 3adisease diagnosis 0aintramammary infection 0adiagnosis 0aCows 0abacterial infections1 aRajala-Schultz, Päivi J.1 aDeGraves, Fred J.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 22, no. 5 p.720-724dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638710022005083Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02318naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245010200175300001800277520110100295592002801396650004401424650002201468650000901490650001901499650001301518650003301531650002201564650002101586650001401607650003701621700002001658700002001678700001701698773009801715856008701813990002301900852000901923655001201932IND60098028320221116215548.0141104e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009802832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2013.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVamvounis, George10aSynthesis and properties of poly(3-n-dodecylthiophene) modified thermally expandable microspheres  ap. 1503-1509.  aFunctionalization of thermally expandable microspheres (TEMs) with a conjugated polymer is explored. These functionalized thermally expandable microspheres were prepared by grafting 3-n-dodecylthiophene via oxidative polymerization from a thiophene modified TEM. The thiophene modified TEM to 3-n-dodecylthiophene ratio was varied during grafting and the resulting poly(3-n-dodecylthiophene) grafted TEM were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, Thermal Gravimetric Analysis, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Thermo-Mechanical Analysis and X-ray diffraction. The particles were approximately 30μm in diameter and upon heating, the functionalized microspheres expanded up to 50 times. This expansion property was related to the poly(3-n-dodecylthiophene) content, where the increase in poly(3-n-dodecylthiophene) on microsphere decreased the thermal expansion. The X-ray diffraction shows a sharpening of the poly(3-n-dodecylthiophene) (100) diffraction peak upon expansion. Grafting conjugated polymers to thermally expandable microspheres provides robust functional photo- and electro-active TEMs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aheat 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermal expansion 3athermogravimetry 3athiophene 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aJonsson, Magnus1 aMalmström, Eva1 aHult, Anders0 tEuropean polymer journal.g2013 June, v. 49, no. 6 p.1503-1509dElsevier Ltdx0014-30577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2013.01.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245009600177300001600273500001500289520151300304592002801817650001401845650001601859650001801875650001901893650001901912650001001931650001301941650001401954650002201968650001201990650001602002650001202018653001602030700002102046700002002067773010802087856005502195852000902250655001202259IND50070915920221119225748.0131123e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007091592DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-048X.2013.00150.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarren, Jeffrey M.10aBody condition dynamics and the cost‐of‐delay hypothesis in a temperate‐breeding duck  ap. 575-582.  a2019-12-06  aPre‐breeding body condition is an important determinant of reproductive success in birds, largely through its influence on timing of breeding. Declines in clutch size and recruitment probability within breeding seasons indicate a tradeoff may exist between the number of young (clutch size) and quality of young (recruitment probability). We explored local drivers of pre‐breeding body condition and tested predictions of the cost‐of‐delay hypothesis in female lesser scaup Aythya affinis. Yearling females arrived on the study site in lower body condition than older females, but both age classes had similar rates of body condition gain on the breeding grounds prior to nesting. Rates of body condition gain were positively influenced by water temperature, a proxy for wetland phenology. The effect of water level was asymptotic and interacted with water temperature, with greater rates of gain in body condition occurring in years with low water levels. Our results supported the predicted response of clutch size to the rate of pre‐breeding body condition gain. After accounting for lay date, clutch size was positively related to the rate of body condition gain (= 0.08 ± 0.039). We did not find support for a predicted interaction between rate of body condition gain and intra‐seasonal decline in clutch size (= 0.01 ± 0.01). Our results indicate that local conditions during pre‐breeding influence body condition dynamics in female lesser scaup, which subsequently affects clutch size.  aPublisher supplied data 3ayearlings 3aprobability 3aage structure 3abreeding sites 3abody condition 3aducks 3abreeding 3aphenology 3awater temperature 3anesting 3aclutch size 3afemales 0arecruitment1 aCutting, Kyle A.1 aKoons, David N.0 tJournal of avian biology.g2013 Nov., v. 44, no. 6 p.575-582dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-048X.2013.00150.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03108naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009600167300001400263520157900277592002801856650001401884650001601898650001601914650002501930650002101955650001001976650001101986650002201997650000902019650001502028650002402043650001802067650002102085650001602106650001502122651001002137653003602147653001802183653001602201653001502217653001402232700001702246700001802263773023802281856008602519852000902605655001202614IND60544426820221120184824.0190416e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054442682DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-6339(15)30033-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXuexuan, Xu10aHydrological cycle research by D &18 O tracing in small watershed in the loess hilly region  ap. 75-82.  aThe objective of this study was to determine the mechanisms of the hydrologic cycle in the loess area in China. Sixty eight water samples from precipitation, soil water of the 0 – 4 m layer, surface water in the valley, ground water (spring and well) were collected and the Deuterium (D) and Oxygen – 18 (O) of these water samples were analyzed to interpret the relationship among those waters in the watershed in the loess hilly region during 2005 – 2009. The results show that: the D &18O of precipitation in Yangou was consistent with that of Xi'an, apparently the north migration of water vapor in Xi'an; according to the correlations among the differential waters in D &18 O, confirmed that precipitation recharge could account for most of the sources of valley flow, with part of the recharge water going to soil water recharge. The D &18O of groundwater were very close to that of precipitation, likely the soil preferential flow was dominant in groundwater recharge although the infiltration had a certain lag. Under the influence of rainfall and evaporation, the response of the soil moisture profile, and its D &18O profile were different. The soil moisture had the strong influenced layer in the 0 60 cm range, a weak impacted layer in 60 160 cm, and a stable layer below 160 cm. It was shown that the soil evaporation depth could be up to 160 cm because the D &18O changed in that depth. The study could increase our understanding of the magnitude and pattern of the hydrologic cycle, which should improve water resources management in the watershed scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeuterium 3aevaporation 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3ahydrologic cycle 3aloess 3aoxygen 3apreferential flow 3arain 3asoil water 3asoil water recharge 3asurface water 3awater management 3awater vapor 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aHilly area in the Loess Plateau 0aPrecipitation 0aGroundwater 0aSoil water 0aδD & δO1 aJiaona, Zhao1 aXiaoni, Zhang0 tInternational soil and water conservation research.g2013 Dec., v. 1, no. 3 p.75-82dElsevier B.V.aInternational Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation and China Water & Power PresswJournal:23246x2095-63397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-6339(15)30033-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02198naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245010300168520097300271592002801244650001201272650002201284650002401306650001801330650001101348650002901359651000901388651001101397651001801408653001801426653002801444653001501472653003201487653002401519653001501543700001801558700002501576773009401601856008401695852000901779655001201788IND60679057320221121224605.0200523e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067905732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2019.1111962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGimpel, Henner12aA comprehensive model for individuals’ acceptance of smart energy technology – A meta-analysis  aIndividuals' use of smart energy technology – i.e., technology that increases energy efficiency or increases the integration of renewable energy sources – holds great potential to solve the energy-related climate problem. However, individuals' current uptake of smart energy technology is low. If policymakers are to successfully address this issue, it is vital that they understand the determinants of individuals' smart energy technology adoption. Hence, this paper provides a comprehensive adoption model for smart energy technology, including data from over 4k individuals in Europe, Asia, and North America involved in various technological contexts and phases of diffusion. A meta-analysis identifies Attitude and Performance Expectancy as the primary determinants of individuals’ smart energy technology adoption. Further, results show that Environmental Concern influences all other determinants.

Diverse computational methods address this problem by pointing to the existence of recurrent patterns among sequence, structure, and function. These patterns emerge naturally from evolutionary variation, natural selection, and divergence—the defining features of biological systems—and they identify molecular events and shapes that underlie specificity of function and allosteric communication. Here we review these methods, and the patterns they identify in case studies and in proteome-wide applications, to infer and rationally redesign function.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3agenomics 3anatural selection 3aproteins1 aBachman, Benjamin J.1 aErdin, Serkan1 aLichtarge, Olivier0 tCurrent Opinion in Structural Biology.g2012 June, v. 22, no. 3 p.316-325dElsevier Ltdx0959-440X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sbi.2012.05.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01456naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245013300207300001600340506007600356520018800432592002800620506003700648650001700685650001000702650001700712650002000729650002900749650002600778700001700804700001500821700001800836700001800854773011200872856007700984852000901061655001201070IND60171934420221207112318.0150602e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017193442DNAL7 a10.1104/pp.113.2159962doi7 aPMC36412072pmcid7 a235091772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAken, Olivier van,10aAtWRKY40 and AtWRKY63 Modulate the Expression of Stress-Responsive Nuclear Genes Encoding Mitochondrial and Chloroplast Proteins  ap. 254-271.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWRKY transcription factors modulate the expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial and chloroplast proteins via direct promoter binding and coordinate common stress responses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achloroplasts 3agenes 3amitochondria 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aZhang, Botao1 aLaw, Simon1 aNarsai, Reena1 aWhelan, James0 tPlant physiology.g2013 May, v. 162, no. 1 p.254-271dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.113.2159963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245013700131300001300268506002800281520142700309592002801736506003701764650001401801650001401815650001601829650002101845650002101866650001301887650001401900650001301914650000901927653001701936653001101953653002601964653002001990700002802010700002202038773012602060852000902186655001202195IND60739715520221207114441.0210420e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073971552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehrabi, Zahra10aEvaluation of nitrate concentration in soil, groundwater and potato tubers on different farm size levels in Fereidan city of Isfahan  ap. 1-12.  aResource is Open Access  aTo determine the nitrate pollution (water, soil, and tubers) in small (< 0.5 ha), medium (0.5- 1 ha) and large (> 1 ha) size of potato fields, this study was conducted in Fereidan region of Isfahan province during growing season of 2014-2015. For this purpose, the amounts of inputs and the tuber yield were recorded in each farm. Also, average nitrate-N concentration in irrigation water, soil and tubers of different potato farms were measured before planting and after harvesting. The results showed that the average soil N-nitrate concentration in small, medium and large size farms were 16.3, 17.4 and 19.9 mg kg-1 before planting and 10.3, 13.3 and 23.3 mg kg-1 after harvesting, respectively. The average N-nitrate concentration of irrigation water in small, medium and large size farms were 36.3, 27.1 and 19.5 mg L-1 before planting and 47.6, 33.1 and 16.4 mg L-1 after harvesting, respectively. At the post-harvest time, NO3-N concentration of irrigation water were below the standard range concentration (45 mg L-1) in the all large farms while 87 % of small and 85% of medium farms had more than standard concentration. The nitrate concentrations of tubers in large-sized farms were lower than others. The tuber NO3-N concentration was affected by potato cultivar. The lowest concentration of nitrate was observed in the late-season potato cultivars (Agria). that might be associated with greater tubers yield.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acultivars 3afarm size 3agroundwater 3airrigation water 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3apollution 3apotatoes 3asoil 0ahealthy food 0amanure 0anitrate contamination 0apotato cultivar1 aEshghizadeh, Hamid Reza1 aNematpour, Afsane0 t̒Ulūm-i āb va khāk.g2017 June, v. 21, no. 1 p.1-12dIsfahan University of TechnologywJournal:27871x2476-55547nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245016500162300001800327520150600345592002801851650001001879650002101889650001301910650001101923650002201934650003101956650001301987650001202000650000902012653001302021653001102034653003002045653001302075700002102088700001802109700001802127773008702145856007602232852000902308655001202317IND60481642320221122041309.0160208e20141206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048164232DNAL7 a10.1515/hf-2014-02132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahmani, Mohsen10aInfluence of exposure time, wood species and dimension on the remaining copper and chromium content in CC-treated wood after field and laboratory leaching tests  ap. 1143-1150.  aMost studies on preservative depletion from treated wood are performed with small samples on a laboratory scale. Although these studies provided repeatable and constant test parameters, the results have little applicability to real conditions. Therefore, a series of laboratory tests were carried out according to CEN/TS 15119 part 1 and part 2 by means of EN 252 and non-standard sized Scots pine sapwood as well as spruce stakes. The stakes were impregnated by vacuum pressure with chromium (Cr)-copper(Cu)-containing wood preservative. For comparison, a set of 18 stakes per test parameter was installed at a test site (in ground use), whereby, every 4 months, three stakes from each series were removed for analysis. Both the time depending losses of metal as well as the remaining element contents were determined for samples exposed under lab conditions, whereas distribution and remaining element contents were measured for samples exposed in the field. The obtained data were evaluated regarding factors influencing the metal leaching, such as exposure time, wood species, or dimension. The results showed that wood species had a significant effect on the Cu depletion, while it had less influence on the Cr loss. Cr and Cu distribution in the standard and non-standard sized pine sapwood significantly changed as compared to spruce.

It is shown that the limiting factors for determining the sizes of analyte nanoparticles are the degree of sample dilution and the dwell time under optimized operating conditions of the mass spectrometer. The reliable determination of the sizes of silver nanoparticles of 60 and 100 nm at the duration of an analysis of 60 and 180 s, respectively, was achieved at a concentration of 2–4 ng/mL. A possibility of predicting dwell time for nanoparticles of a known size is demonstrated. The determination of several average sizes of nanoparticles is shown on an example of a polydisperse mixture of silver nanoparticles with sizes of 60 and 100 nm at a 10 ms dwell time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3ananosilver 3aspectrometers1 aGalitskaya, O.

Bare and modified inks were prepared by combining carbon black and cellulose acetate to achieve high-performance conductive tracks with low sheet resistance. The carbon black tracks withstand extremely high folding cycles (>20 000 cycles), a new record-high with a response loss of less than 10%. The conductive tracks can also be used as 3D paper-based electrochemical cells with high heterogeneous rate constants, a feature that opens a myriad of electrochemical applications. As a relevant demonstrator, the conductive ink modified with Prussian-blue was electrochemically characterized proving to be very promising toward the detection of hydrogen peroxide at very low potentials. Moreover, carbon black circuits can be fully crumpled with negligible change in their electrical response. Fully printed motion and wearable sensors are additional examples where bioinspired microcracks are created on the conductive track. The wearable devices are capable of efficiently monitoring extremely low bending angles including human motions, fingers, and forearm. Here, to the best of our knowledge, the mechanical, electronic, and electrochemical performance of the proposed devices surpasses the most recent advances in paper-based devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarms (limbs) 3acellulose acetate 3aelectrochemistry 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amonitoring 3ananomaterials 3apaper 3asoot 0acarbon black 0aconductive ink 0apaper-based electronics 0afoldable devices 0awearable sensors1 aCorrêa, Cátia C.1 aBernardes, Juliana S.1 aPereira, Mariane P.1 aOliveira, Letícia J.

Strain 16MFT21ᵀ is a Gram-staining-positive, catalase-oxidase-positive, rod-shaped facultative-aerobic bacterium. The phylogenetic analysis that is based on the 16S-rRNA gene sequence of strain 16MFT21ᵀ revealed that it belongs to the genus Bacillus in the family Bacillaceae in the class Bacilli. The highest degrees of the sequence similarity of the strain 16MFT21ᵀ is with Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 14580ᵀ (96.6%) and Bacillus sonorensis NBRC 101234ᵀ (96.6%). The isolate formed a pale-yellow pigment, and it grew in the presence of 0% to 10% (w/v) NaCl (optimum at 2% NaCl), a pH of 6.0 to 10.0 (optimum pH from 7.0 to 8.0), and from 4°C to 30°C (optimum at 30°C). The major polar lipids consist of diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). The predominant fatty acids are iso-C₁₅:₀, anteiso-C₁₅:₀, iso-C₁₇:₀, and anteiso-C₁₇:₀. The main respiratory quinone is menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and based on the use of the meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid, the peptidoglycan cell-wall type is A1γ. Based on the phylogenetic, phenotypic, and chemotaxonomic data, strain 16MFT21ᵀ (=KCTC 18866ᵀ =JCM 31664ᵀ) for which the name Bacillus piscis sp. nov. is proposed should be classified as a new species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aBacillus sonorensis 3aDissostichus mawsoni 3abacteria 3achemotaxonomy 3afatty acids 3afish 3amuscles 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3apeptidoglycans 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3asequence homology 3asodium chloride 3aAntarctic region1 aJeon, Seon Hwa1 aChoi, Seok-Gwan1 aJung, Hee-Young1 aKim, Myung Kyum1 aSrinivasan, Sathiyaraj0 tjournal of microbiology.g2016 Dec., v. 54, no. 12 p.809-813dThe Microbiological Society of KoreawJournal:jnl4619042x1225-88737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-016-6473-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03264naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010800170300001600278500001900294520166900313592002801982596009302010596009602103596009102199650002502290650001302315650001602328650001202344650002402356650003002380650002302410650001102433650002102444651001002465651001002475700006602485700006902551773013102620856008202751852000902833655001202842IND60728644220221118234854.0210223e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072864422DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-020-02396-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSotes, Gastón J.10aHigh competitive ability of Centaurea melitensis L.

The genus Centaurea (Asteraceae) is well-known in invasion ecology because several aggressive invaders, including Centaurea melitensis L., belong to this genus. We compared the competitive ability of C. melitensis individuals from Spain (native range) and Chile (invaded range) when competing against Helenium aromaticum (Hook.) L.H. Bailey, a native relative from Chile. We performed germination bioassays and common garden competition experiments to compare: (1) the germination capacities of C. melitensis (Spain and Chile) and H. aromaticum (2) the potential allelopathic effect of leaf lixiviates of C. melitensis (Spain and Chile) on the seed germination of H. aromaticum, (3) the ability of C. melitensis from both origins to reduce the growth of H. aromaticum. No significant differences in the capacity of seed germination were found among C. melitensis from Chile and Spain and the native H. aromaticum. However, the seed germination of H. aromaticum was inhibited by the presence of C. melitensis leaves from Chile and Spain. Also, the biomass of H. aromaticum was reduced in the presence of C. melitensis, regardless of their origin. Our results demonstrate the competitive superiority of the invasive C. melitensis over H. aromaticum, but we found no evidence of an evolutionary increase in the competitive ability of the invader populations. Therefore, at least part of the invasive potential of C. melitensis seems to be acquired by selective processes in their original range.  aPublisher supplied data  aCONICYT/FONDAP-15110009cComisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica  aCONICYT PIA CCTE AFB-17008cComisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica  aCONICYT-21100246/2010cComisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica 3aCentaurea melitensis 3aHelenium 3aallelopathy 3abiomass 3aecological invasion 3ageographical distribution 3aintroduced species 3aleaves 3aseed germination 3aChile 3aSpain1 aCavieres, Lohengrin A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9122-30201 aGómez González, Susana,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3779-87010 tBiological invasions.g2021 Mar., v. 23, no. 3 p.693-703dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-020-02396-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03474naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013400164500002200298520192000320592002802240650001102268650002502279650001502304650001902319650001002338650002302348650001102371650001502382650001002397650001502407650001102422650002102433650001702454650001502471650001202486653001602498653003202514653000802546653001002554653001602564700002302580700001902603700002002622700002402642773021102666856008202877852000902959655001202968IND60620369720221120170149.0190412e20180920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062036972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaa.2018.09.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAuer, Ulrike10aMonitoring changes in distribution of pulmonary ventilation by functional electrical impedance tomography in anaesthetized ponies  aPre-press version  aTo assess changes in the distribution in pulmonary ventilation in anaesthetized ponies using electrical impedance tomography (EIT).Prospective experimental study.A group of eight adult pony geldings.General anaesthesia was induced and maintained using isoflurane in oxygen with volume-controlled ventilation [tidal volume (VT) (10 mL kg−1), respiratory rate (8–12 breaths minute−1)] to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide between 35 and 40 mmHg (4.66–5.32 kPa). Regional distribution of ventilation was assessed with EIT (plane of fifth to sixth intercostal space) at 30, 60 and 90 minutes after intubation. The resulting functional images were divided into four regions of interest (ROI, A–D) to determine: 1) the ratio of VT distribution between dependent to nondependent lung (D/ND) and 2) changes in distribution within the lungs in the latero-lateral direction. The centre of ventilation (COV) was calculated. The dimension of the chest in the latero-lateral (W) and dorso-ventral (H) direction was measured at the height of the withers and the W/H ratio was calculated. The influence of time on the D/ND ratio, COV and ROI A–D were analysed with anova followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests. Pearson correlation coefficient and the coefficient of determination (r2) were calculated to evaluate the relationship between the W/H ratio and D/ND ratio, and COV. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.The median D/ND ratio (T30–T90) was 0.67 (0.40–1.01) and for COV 31.15% (11.20–45.20), confirming the expected uneven distribution of ventilation. The D/ND ratio had a moderate negative correlation with the W/H ratio (r = −0.68, r2 = 0.46, p < 0.001), while the COV did not correlate with the W/H ratio (r = −0.04).Uneven ventilation in mechanically ventilated right laterally recumbent anaesthetized ponies occurs within 30 minutes and changed little over the following 60 minutes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanalysis of variance 3aanesthesia 3acarbon dioxide 3achest 3aelectric impedance 3ahorses 3aisoflurane 3alungs 3amonitoring 3aoxygen 3arespiratory rate 3atidal volume 3atomography 3awithers 0aanaesthesia 0adistribution of ventilation 0aEIT 0ahorse 0aventilation1 aSchramel, J.

India is a highly flood prone country. The present empirical study estimates perception of farmers on social vulnerability in a regularly flash flood area of Bihar in general and district Purnea in particular. Various socioeconomic, agro-economic predictors’ association and contribution to the farmers’ perception on social vulnerability have been measured with sample size 10 per cent of population size. Data were collected with the help of pre-structured interview schedule and analyzed with statistical software SPSS 23. Descriptive statistics, coefficient of correlation and linear regression were the statistical tools used in the analysis process. It has been found that Social participation (xᵤ), Irrigation Index (x₁₅) and Gender ratio (x₇) were positively and significantly correlated with Perception on social vulnerability (Y). It has also been found that predictors viz., Vulnerable members (x₉), Age (x), Divyang (xₛ) and Family size (xₛ) were negatively but significantly correlated with Perception on social vulnerability (Y) of the farmers in regularly flooded agroecosystem of Purnea district of Bihar. Age (x), Family size (x₆), Gender ratio (x₇), Divyang (xₛ), Vulnerable members (x₉), Social participation (xᵤ) and Irrigation index (x₁₅) have contributed cumulatively in causing Perception on social vulnerability (Y) explaining 21.4 perception of variability embedded in predicted variable Perception on social vulnerability. All the identified predictors can used to modify the perception on social vulnerability of farmers living in flash flood agroecosystem.

At the time of this writing, the phylum Actinobacteria consisted of only one class, Actinobacteria, including five subclasses, 10 orders, 56 families, and 330 genera. Moreover, new taxa of this phylum continue to be discovered. Korean actinobacterial species with a valid name has been reported from 1995 as Tsukamurella inchonensis isolated from a clinical specimen. In 1997, Streptomyces seoulensis was validated with the isolate from the natural Korean environment. Until Feb. 2016, 256 actinobacterial species with valid names originated from Korean territory were listed on LPSN. The species were affiliated with three subclasses (Acidimicrobidae, Actinobacteridae, and Rubrobacteridae), four orders (Acidimicrobiales, Actinomycetales, Bifidobacteriales, and Solirubrobacterales), 12 suborders, 36 families, and 93 genera. Most of the species belonged to the subclass Actinobacteridae, and almost of the members of this subclass were affiliated with the order Actinomycetales. A number of novel isolates belonged to the families Nocardioidaceae, Microbacteriaceae, Intrasporangiaceae, and Streptomycetaceae as well as the genera Nocardioides, Streptomyces, and Microbacterium. Twenty-six novel genera and one novel family, Motilibacteraceae, were created first with Korean indigenous isolates. Most of the Korean indigenous actionobacterial species were isolated from natural environments such as soil, seawater, tidal flat sediment, and fresh-water. A considerable number of species were isolated from artificial resources such as fermented foods, wastewater, compost, biofilm, and water-cooling systems or clinical specimens. Korean indigenous actinobacterial species were isolated from whole territory of Korea, and especially a large number of species were from Jeju, Gyeonggi, Jeonnam, Daejeon, and Chungnam. A large number of novel actinobacterial species continue to be discovered since the Korean government is encouraging the search for new bacterial species and researchers are endeavoring to find out novel strains from extreme or untapped environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidimicrobiales 3aBifidobacteriales 3aIntrasporangiaceae 3aMicrobacterium 3aNocardioides 3aRubrobacteridae 3aStreptomyces seoulensis 3aTsukamurella inchonensis 3abiofilm 3acomposts 3afermented foods 3afreshwater 3aindigenous species 3anew taxa 3aresearchers 3aseawater 3asediments 3asoil 3awastewater 3aSouth Korea1 aKim, Mi-sun,1 aLee, Ji Hee1 aKang, Joo Won1 aKim, Tae-in,1 aLee, Ji Hee1 aSeong, Chi Nam0 tjournal of microbiology.g2016 Dec., v. 54, no. 12 p.789-795dThe Microbiological Society of KoreawJournal:jnl4619042x1225-88737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-016-6446-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245005000171300001600221520131800237592002801555650001801583650002201601650001101623650001001634650004201644650001101686650001701697653000801714653000701722653000701729653000901736653001101745653001101756653001801767653001501785700002101800700002001821700001601841700002101857700002001878700002501898700002101923700002401944773008501968856008402053852000902137655001202146IND60528168120221118055302.0161019e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052816812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2016.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanhanen, Reetta10aT cell receptor diversity in the human thymus  ap. 116-122.  aA diverse T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is essential for adaptive immune responses and is generated by somatic recombination of TCRα and TCRβ gene segments in the thymus. Previous estimates of the total TCR diversity have studied the circulating mature repertoire, identifying 1 to 3×106 unique TCRβ and 0.5×106 TCRα sequences. Here we provide the first estimate of the total TCR diversity generated in the human thymus, an organ which in principle can be sampled in its entirety. High-throughput sequencing of samples from four pediatric donors detected up to 10.3×106 unique TCRβ sequences and 3.7×106 TCRα sequences, the highest directly observed diversity so far for either chain. To obtain an estimate of the total diversity we then used three different estimators, preseq and DivE, which measure the saturation of rarefaction curves, and Chao2, which measures the size of the overlap between samples. Our results provide an estimate of a thymic repertoire consisting of 40 to 70×106 unique TCRβ sequences and 60 to 100×106 TCRα sequences. The thymic repertoire is thus extremely diverse. Moreover, extrapolation of the data and comparison with earlier estimates of peripheral diversity also suggest that the thymic repertoire is transient, with different clones produced at different times.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadaptive immunity 3aclones 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahumans 3athymus gland 0aTCR 0aDP 0aSP 0aCDR3 0aT cell 0aThymus 0aTCR diversity 0aRepertoire1 aHeikkilä, Nelli1 aAggarwal, Kunal1 aHamm, David1 aTarkkila, Heikki1 aPätilä, Tommi1 aJokiranta, T.

Leaves of six different plants were collected in and around Aligarh Muslim University Campus. Aqueous extracts of six plants were screened for egg hatchability and nematicidal activity against second stage juveniles of M. incognita in the plant pathology and nematology laboratory, AMU Aligarh. The nematode egg and juveniles were exposed 12, 24 and 48 h in (S, S/2, S/10, S/100) concentrations of plant extracts. The plant extracts of leaves of six plants species viz. Jatropha pandurifolia , Polyalthia longifolia, Wedelia chinensis , Nerium indicum, Duranta repens and Cassia fistula exhibited highly promising mortality of 99.00–72.00% after 48 h of exposure. Aqueous extracts of leaves of J. pandurifolia, P. longifolia, W. chinensis were recorded to be highly effective for inhibition of egg hatching and increasing juvenile mortality of M. incognita . There was a gradual decrease in egg hatching and increase in mortality rate of juveniles of M. incognita with increase in the concentration of leaf extract and exposure time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCassia fistula 3aDuranta erecta 3aJatropha 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aMuslims 3aNerium oleander 3aPolyalthia longifolia 3aWedelia 3aegg hatchability 3aeggs 3aexposure duration 3ahatching 3ajuveniles 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3amortality 3anematicidal properties 3anematology 3aplant pathology 0aMeloidogyne incognita 0anematicidal activity 0aleaf extracts 0ajuvenile mortality 0aegg hatching1 aParihar, Kavita1 aRehman, Bushra1 aAshraf Ganai, Mohd1 aUsman, A.1 aSiddiqui, Mansoor A.0 tArchiv für Phytopathologie und Pflanzenschutz.g2014 May 9, v. 47, no. 8 p.1015-1021dTaylor & Francisx1477-29067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03235408.2013.8296263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01214naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245010100156300001800257520019800275592002800473650002300501650002100524650001900545650000700564650001300571650001600584700001500600700001800615700001500633700001700648773012900665856007300794852000900867655001200876IND60658037820221122011618.0190816e20061121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065803782DNAL7 a10.1039/b611405a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jianhua10aTemperature, ionic strength and pH induced electrochemical switching of smart polymer interfaces  ap. 4820-4822.  aA reversible electrochemical switching has been displayed at smart polymer brush interfaces, which was responsive to temperature, ionic strength and pH stimuli, independently or simultaneously.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3aelectrochemistry 3aionic strength 3apH 3apolymers 3atemperature1 aWang, Geng1 aHu, Jianqiang1 aLu, Xianbo1 aLi, Jinghong0 tChemical communications.g2006 Nov. 21, , no. 46 p.4820-4822dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b611405a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01573naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011500155300001800270520065000288592002800938650000900966650001100975650002600986650001301012700002001025700001801045700002001063773010401083856007501187852000901262655001201271IND60577888620221116195047.0170810e20130212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057788862DNAL7 a10.1021/ma302270a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkagi, Yuki10aTransition between Phantom and Affine Network Model Observed in Polymer Gels with Controlled Network Structure  ap. 1035-1040.  aThe elastic moduli of elastomeric materials are predicted by the affine or phantom or junction affine network models.

The validation of these models is difficult because of the network heterogeneity. In this study, we tried to evaluate these models using Tetra-PEG gel, which has extremely homogeneous network structure.

To assess bacterial diversity in the tomato rhizosphere, we performed two contrasting approaches: culture-dependent and -independent. In the culture-dependent approach, two culture media (Reasoner’s 2A agar and soil extract agar) were supplemented with 12 antibiotics for isolating diverse bacteria from the tomato rhizosphere by inhibiting predominant bacteria. A total of 689 bacterial isolates were clustered into 164 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% sequence similarity, and these were found to belong to five bacterial phyla (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, and Firmicutes). Of these, 122 OTUs were retrieved from the antibiotic-containing media, and 80 OTUs were recovered by one specific antibiotic-containing medium. In the culture-independent approach, we conducted Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and obtained 19,215 high-quality sequences, which clustered into 478 OTUs belonging to 16 phyla. Among the total OTUs from the MiSeq dataset, 22% were recovered in the culture collection, whereas 41% of OTUs in the culture collection were not captured by MiSeq sequencing. These results showed that antibiotics were effective in isolating various taxa that were not readily isolated on antibiotic-free media, and that both contrasting approaches provided complementary information to characterize bacterial diversity in the tomato rhizosphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidobacteria 3aActinobacteria 3aBacteroidetes 3aFirmicutes 3aProteobacteria 3aabiotic stress 3aagar 3aantibiotics 3aculture media 3adata collection 3agenes 3amicrobiome 3anutrient availability 3aplant growth 3arhizosphere 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence homology 3asoil 3asoil bacteria 3aspecies diversity 3atomatoes1 aPark, Jiyoung1 aChu, Bora1 aKim, Jeong Myeong1 aJoa, Jae-Ho1 aSang, Mee Kyung1 aSong, Jaekyeong1 aWeon, Hang-Yeon0 tjournal of microbiology.g2016 Dec., v. 54, no. 12 p.823-831dThe Microbiological Society of KoreawJournal:jnl4619042x1225-88737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-016-6410-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02029naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012400168300001600292500001900308520092400327592002801251650001601279650002401295650002101319650000901340650001301349650001901362653001301381653000801394653002301402653001001425653001501435773012301450856008501573852000901658655001201667IND60705999120221122014556.0200807e20200902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070599912DNAL7 a10.1080/19390211.2020.17907102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCogan, P.

Three such assumptions are addressed herein and are characterized as: 1) the false dichotomy of herbs vs drugs, 2) the entourage fallacy, and 3) the false equivalence of incomparable evidence. An argument is presented which is intended to persuade that the legality or mere composition of phytochemical products do not speak to the reality of their pharmacological effects. It is further argued that non-prescription cannabidiol and hemp extracts should not be afforded regulatory protection by designation as dietary supplements.  aPublisher supplied data 3acannabidiol 3adietary supplements 3ahealth education 3ahemp 3aindustry 3aphytochemicals 0acannabis 0aCBD 0adietary supplement 0aDSHEA 0aregulation0 tJournal of dietary supplements.g2020 Sept. 2, v. 17, no. 5 p.527-542dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2249x1939-022X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19390211.2020.17907103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03752naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009700171520234500268592002802613650001902641650001902660650001402679650002402693650002002717650002602737650001402763650001002777650001902787650001202806650002602818650001902844650001602863650002902879650000902908650001602917653002402933653001202957653003802969700002103007700002803028700002203056773010903078856008603187852000903273655001203282IND60734546020221121041706.0220205e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073454602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.1082652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJilling, Andrea10aPriming mechanisms providing plants and microbes access to mineral-associated organic matter  aMineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) is considered a stable reservoir for soil nutrients that influences long-term soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics. However, recent experimental and theoretical evidence shows that root exudates may mobilize MAOM, thereby providing plants and microbes access to a large and N-rich pool. Given the mechanisms underlying MAOM C and N mobilization remain largely untested, we examined direct and indirect pathways by which root exudates destabilize this nutrient pool in laboratory mesocosms. We simulated root exudation with ¹³C-labeled oxalic acid to test whether root exudates are directly capable of mobilizing MAOM from mineral surfaces; and with ¹³C-labeled glucose to test whether indirect stimulation of microbial and extracellular enzyme activity leads to MAOM decomposition. We also tested the potential for oxalic acid and glucose to mobilize MAOM in an additional subset of sterilized soils to clarify the potential for non-microbial pathways of MAOM destabilization.Over the course of the 12-day MAOM incubation with and without simulated exudates, we measured C cycling (CO₂ respiration rates, ¹³C–CO₂ efflux), N cycling (inorganic N pools, gross N mineralization) and related microbial processes (enzyme activities and microbial community composition via phospholipid fatty acid analysis). Both of the simulated root exudates enhanced MAOM-C mineralization, with cumulative respiration increasing 35–89% relative to the water-only control. Likewise, glucose additions enhanced the production of an exo-cellulase and a chitinase by up to 130% and 39%, respectively, while oxalic acid enhanced oxidative enzyme activities up to 91% greater than control rates. We observed a positive association between glucose-induced shifts in enzyme activities, MAOM-C mineralization, and gross ammonification. Oxalic acid additions were associated with initial increases in fungal relative abundance and in sterile soils appeared to stimulate the release of metals and dissolved organic nitrogen into exchangeable pools. Our results indicate that common root exudates, like glucose and oxalic acid, can significantly increase the turnover and potential release of C and N from MAOM through indirect (e.g., enzyme induction) and direct (e.g., mobilization of metal oxides) mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonification 3acarbon dioxide 3achitinase 3acommunity structure 3aenzyme activity 3aextracellular enzymes 3aexudation 3afungi 3agene induction 3aglucose 3amicrobial communities 3amineralization 3aoxalic acid 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3asoil 3asoil carbon 0aSoil organic matter 0aPriming 0aMineral-associated organic matter1 aKeiluweit, Marco1 aGutknecht, Jessica L.M.1 aGrandy, A.

Most practical soil–plant–atmosphere energy balance models calculate G0 as a function of either total (RN) or soil net radiation (RN,S). Even though RN,S includes sunlit and shaded conditions, this is seldom considered, even at spatial scales of a few m. In order to improve the utility of surface energy balance models designed for row crops at relatively small spatial scales, a method was developed to calculate G0 as a function of shaded, partially sunlit, or fully sunlit RN,S. Calculation of RN,S was derived using a geometric approach, and G0 was derived by the calorimetric method using measurements of soil temperature and volumetric soil water content under upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) over a wide range of canopy cover conditions. Calorimetric G0 and calculated RN,S were related by assuming their normalized values were equal at 24h time steps and in phase. The method required only a single empirical parameter, which related the 24h minimum G0 (G0,MIN) to the 24h maximum RN,S (RN,S,MAX) as G0,MIN=a×RN,S,MAX, and a=−0.31 was found by simple linear regression (p<0.01). Model sensitivity (SM) of calculated G0 was calculated for sparse, medium, and full canopy cover; nighttime, shaded, partially sunlit, and fully sunlit surface conditions; and north–south and east–west row orientations, where input values of agronomic, shortwave, and longwave input variables were varied ±25% of their base values. The method was most sensitive (1.0<SM<36) to canopy width, canopy height, leaf area index, row spacing, canopy and soil emittances, and canopy and soil temperatures for medium to full canopy cover. Also, there was generally greater sensitivity for shaded and partially sunlit surfaces compared with sunlit and nighttime surfaces, and north–south rows compared with east–west rows. However, the method had little sensitivity (SM usually <0.50) to input variables used to calculate the shortwave components of RN,S.  aPublisher supplied data  cARSdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000840  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acalorimetry 3acanopy 3acrops 3aenergy balance 3aheat transfer 3aheight 3aleaf area index 3alinear models 3arow spacing 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3avegetation cover 0aa 0aBEG 0aCzj 0aEND 0aEW 0afo,zj 0afSIS 0aG0 0aG0,MAX 0aG0,MIN 0aGZ 0aMID 0aNS 0aRN 0aRN,S 0aRN,S,MAX 0aRN,S,MIN 0aSM 0ati and ti+1 0aTS,0 0aTs,z 0azj 0azp 0aΔG0,Zp 0aΔzj 0aθv,zj 0aλ 0aρb,zj 0aCalorimetric method 0aCotton 0aEnergy balance model 0aIrrigation 0aModel sensitivity 0aTexas1 aEvett, Steven R.1 aAgam, Nurit1 aSchwartz, Robert C.1 aKustas, William P.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 216 p.115-128dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2015.10.0103Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/620363Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Colaizzi%20et%20al.%20%282016%29%20Part%201_Ag%20For%20Met%20216-115-128.pdf  aUSDAUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245013000162520152900292592002801821650002301849650001701872650002101889650001501910650001501925650002301940650001501963650002201978650001502000650002402015650002702039650001102066650001102077650002402088650001102112651001002123653002302133653002202156653002602178653002502204700001502229700001802244700001402262700001402276700001702290700002002307700001702327700001802344700001802362700001702380773011202397856008302509852000902592655001202601IND60647923420221122152804.0190705e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064792342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e006922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Tao10aHistorical population decline and habitat loss in a critically endangered species, the Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis)  aHabitat loss and degradation are among the leading causes of local extinctions, so it is crucially important to preserve and restore the remaining critical habitat increasingly critical to conserve biodiversity. However, mechanisms driving species extinction often begin with habitat loss and seldom are well understood, which is greatly limits our ability to mitigate their impacts. The Chinese Alligator (Alligator sinensis) is a critically endangered crocodilian, which is narrowly distributed in very small six regions of Anhui province, China. In the present study, we used 9 nuclear microsatellite loci genotyped across the taxon's distribution area to investigate genetic variation and population demography in A. sinensis. The Chinese Alligator showed unusually low levels of genetic diversity (Na, 5.44; Ne, 1.97; He, 0.47) based on 793 individuals. Msvar analyses found recent signals of population decline reflecting a bottleneck (an approximately 9-fold decrease) about 25,000 years ago. Ecological niche modelling indicated that the habitat area has declined (about 8–15 fold) for A. sinensis when compared with that under different historical climatic conditions. Our results indicated that population decline and habitat loss in critically endangered Chinese Alligators may have acted as intrinsic and extrinsic factors that have impacted the current status of A. sinensis. In addition, these two unfavorable factors may have also directly contributed to a reduction in the genetic diversity of A. sinensis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlligator sinensis 3abiodiversity 3aclimatic factors 3acrocodiles 3ademography 3aendangered species 3aextinction 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3ahabitat destruction 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amodels 3aniches 3apopulation dynamics 3asodium 3aChina 0aAlligator sinensis 0aGenetic diversity 0aPopulation demography 0aNiche reconstruction1 aWang, Huan1 aDuan, Shulong1 aAli, Izaz1 aYan, Peng1 aCai, Ruiqing1 aWang, Mingsheng1 aZhang, Jihui1 aZhang, Huabin1 aZhang, Baowei1 aWu, Xiaobing0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2019 Oct., v. 20 p.e00692-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e006923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03403naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245011200210300001600322500001900338520202000357592002802377650001202405650001802417650002502435650001402460650002102474650001102495650002202506650002602528651001102554700002202565700002102587700002502608700002202633700002202655700002002677700002102697700002902718773013102747856008202878852000902960655001202969IND60728644620221118234929.0210223e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072864462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-020-02398-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBogdanoff, Alex K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0116-865210aOptimum lionfish yield: a non-traditional management concept for invasive lionfish (Pterois spp.) fisheries  ap. 795-810.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis paper describes a non-traditional fisheries management concept and an indicator-based framework to encourage and guide management of invasive lionfish (Pterois spp.) fisheries in the temperate and tropical western Atlantic. We introduce the concept of optimum lionfish yield (OLY)—an extension of the concept of ecologically sustainable yield—which considers local ecological health in the establishment of fishery management targets. In contrast to traditional fishery targets, OLY is a target exceeding maximum sustainable yield (MSY) that still provides relatively high sustainable yield, but further contributes to population suppression beyond what is achievable through targets at or below MSY. Thus, OLY seeks to balance management trade-offs from both natural resource and invasive species management perspectives. In this study, we developed an age-structured population model and applied the concept of OLY to quantify targets to initiate management of a nationally-managed lionfish fishery in Belize. Socioeconomic and ecological data were used as indicators to formulate OLY values. The model indicates that lionfish in Belize are biologically robust to fishing pressure, which corroborates previous findings. Fishing lionfish at rates above MSY levels is expected to substantially reduce population abundance, much more so than fishing at rates below MSY levels, while having relatively minimal impacts on yield. Population suppression can be further enhanced by reducing size at selection, but this is expected to be done at a significant cost to landings. Together, these data support continued establishment of (managed) commercial lionfish fisheries throughout the invaded range to provide an alternative sustainable fishery resource and serve as a means of national- and international-level control. While the concept and framework described here is introduced for management of invasive lionfish, it could be applied to management of other invasive species, both aquatic and terrestrial.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPterois 3aage structure 3aenvironmental health 3afisheries 3ainvasive species 3amodels 3aspecies abundance 3asustainable fisheries 3aBelize1 aShertzer, Kyle W.1 aLayman, Craig A.1 aChapman, Jennifer K.1 aFruitema, Marc L.1 aSolomon, Jennifer1 aSabattis, Julie1 aGreen, Stephanie1 aMorris, James A., JrcJr0 tBiological invasions.g2021 Mar., v. 23, no. 3 p.795-810dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-020-02398-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245007200175520126900247592002801516650001301544650001201557650003001569650002401599650001701623650001701640650001701657651001001674653002601684653001701710653001701727653001801744653001401762773009901776856008501875852000901960655001201969IND60647923620221122152712.0190807e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064792362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geodrs.2019.e002312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartemink, Alfred E.10aOpen access publishing and soil science – Trends and developments  aAbout 42,000 soil papers are annually published, and the number of papers almost doubled in the past 10 years. Most growth has come from China, and about one-third of all soil papers are presently from China compared to 4% in 1999. The increase in papers has been accompanied by higher impact factors of the core soil science journals. There has been a proliferation of new publishers and journals, and some 1500 new internet publishers have been established. Scientific publishing is big and profiteable business. Open access publishing started in the early 2000s. In the top four soil science journals only 1% of the papers were published open access in 2008, but currently 5 to 20% of the papers are open access papers. Across all scientific disciplines the share of open access papers is about 28%. Some preliminary analysis suggests that open access papers in soil science tend to be more cited. The current cost of an open access paper in one of the 25 top soil science journals ranges from $750 to $4000. Funding agencies, some universities and scientific organizations are pushing towards a total open access approach of scientific publishing. Soil scientists should become involved in these discussions as it affects the way we disseminate our findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3afunding 3ainformation dissemination 3ainformation sources 3apublications 3asoil science 3auniversities 3aChina 0aScientific publishing 0aSoil science 0aPublications 0aBibliometrics 0aCitations0 tGeoderma regional.g2019 Sept., v. 18 p.e00231-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23258x2352-00947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geodrs.2019.e002313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245011700202300001400319520140500333592002801738650000801766650002001774650002001794650001901814650001501833650000901848650001201857650001001869650001401879650001901893650003101912650003001943650001701973650003501990651001102025653001002036653001102046653001102057653001202068653000802080700005802088700001602146700002002162700001802182700001502200700002102215700002102236773010002257856008302357852000902440655001202449IND60638078620221121013424.0190628e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063807862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2019.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaués, T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8890-608X10aCould polymorphisms in ABCB1 gene represent a genetic risk factor for the development of mammary tumors in dogs?  ap. 58-63.  aThe ABCB1 gene encodes the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) which regulates distribution and bioavailability of many endogenous and exogenous substrates, acting as a cellular mechanism of protection against these substances. Some studies have shown evidence that P-gp is related to carcinogenesis. In this study, we performed PCR and direct sequencing of ABCB1 exons 9 and 26 in 47 tissue DNA samples from canine mammary tumors.A statistically significant correlation between distinct canine breeds and the frequency of ABCB1 polymorphisms (c.985T > A and c.3442A > G SNP in ABCB1exons 9 and 26, respectively) was observed (P = 0.0015). In contrast, the TNM clinical staging, age, histological type and grade, as well as other histopathological characteristics, did not present statistically significant difference in relation to one or both SNP found in exons 9 and 26. These findings raise questions about the role of the canine ABCB1 polymorphisms in the development of mammary tumors, since the Poodle breed, which is the most common dog breed affected by mammary tumors in Brazil, presented the highest frequency of these variants. Notwithstanding, additional studies comprising a number of samples expressing the ABCB1 gene from healthy dogs, with advanced age and from different breeds, will be necessary to confirm the association of ABCB1polymorphisms and the development of mammary tumors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aP-glycoproteins 3abioavailability 3acarcinogenesis 3adog breeds 3adogs 3aelderly 3aexons 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arisk factors 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aBrazil 0aABCB1 0aCancer 0aCanine 0aMammary 0aSNP1 aEl-Jaick, K.B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3316-93231 aCosta, F.B.1 aFreitas, P.V.S.1 aMoreira, A.S.1 aCastro, L.1 aFerreira, M.L.G.1 aFerreira, A.M.R.0 tveterinary journal.g2019 June, v. 248 p.58-63dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2019.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013100171300001800302520091300320592002801233650002001261650002301281650002801304650002801332650002501360650002601385650001801411650001001429650001701439650004401456650001801500650001401518650002601532650001701558653002501575653002401600653002501624700001801649700001601667700002001683700001701703700001701720700001501737773012601752856008401878852000901962655001201971IND60122152520150626000000.0150325e20140528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012215252DNAL7 a10.1080/03235408.2013.8297152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhluwalia, Vivek10aIsolation, characterisation of major secondary metabolites of the Himalayan Trichoderma koningii and their antifungal activity  ap. 1063-1071.  aEthyl acetate extracts of two strains of Trichoderma koningii were evaluated for antifungal activity against soilborne pathogenic fungi, Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotium rolfsii, Macrophomina phaseolina and Fusarium oxysporum by poisoned food technique.

The required data on marketing of baby corn were collected from 60 farmers and 10 market intermediaries. In the study of baby corn, the production constraints noticed were high cost of seeds & non availability of quality seeds in time, relatively high harvesting cost, lack of awareness about value addition at farmers level and sub optimal input use. The main marketing constraints observed from the analysis of the study that are delay in sale of produce, no open auction sale of produce facility, arbitrary rate fixation of baby corn by commission agents, forced money lending by commission agents on high interest rate, unauthorized marketing charges by commission agents, lack of interest and awareness of farmer in marketing of baby corn and low selling price during the months may-august were the major constraints in the marketing of baby corn.  aPublisher supplied data 3aauctions 3acase studies 3acorn 3afarmers 3amarkets 3aIndia 0aMarketing constraints 0aDiversifying agriculture 0aMarket intermediaries 0aProduction constraints1 aSingh, Parminder1 aKumari, Neelam1 aMehla, Vinay1 aKumar, Vijay0 pIndian J.

The surface-area-normalized ORR activity of these bi-metallic Pt-on-Pd nanotubes (PtPdNTs) was nearly 6× the corresponding carbon-supported Pt nanoparticle (Pt/C) activity at 0.9 V vs. RHE (1.5 vs. 0.24 mA cmₘₑₜₐₗ⁻², respectively). Furthermore, the high specific activity of the PtPdNTs was achieved without sacrificing mass-normalized activity, which is more than twice that of Pt/C (0.333 A mgPₜPdNT⁻¹vs. 0.141 A mgPₜ/C⁻¹) and also greater than that of Pd/C (0.221 A mgPd/C⁻¹). We attribute the enhancements in specific and mass activity to modifications of the segregated Pt electronic structure and to nanoscale porosity, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3achemical reactions 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3ananoparticles 3ananotubes 3aoxygen 3apalladium 3aplatinum 3aporosity 3avapors1 aAtkinson, Robert W.1 aDyck, Ondrej1 aSun, Cheng-Jun1 aZawodzinski, Thomas A.1 aPapandrew, Alexander B.0 tChemical communications.g2015 Nov. 10, v. 51, no. 93 p.16633-16636dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5cc05706j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001700135245009300152300001500245520183900260592002802099650002502127650002202152650001502174650001802189650001302207650001302220650001402233700001702247700001502264700002102279700001602300700001802316773015202334856006902486856010202555990002302657852000902680655001202689IND60705999420221122032627.0200807e20200804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070599942DNAL7 a10.3791/609292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCapucha, Tal10a3d planning and printing of patient specific implants for reconstruction of bony defects  ap. e60929.  aWe are in the midst of the 3D era in most aspects of life, and especially in medicine. The surgical discipline is one of the major players in the medical field using the constantly developing 3D planning and printing capabilities. Computer-assisted design (CAD) and computer assisted manufacturing (CAM) are used to describe the 3D planning and manufacturing of the product. The planning and manufacturing of 3D surgical guides and reconstruction implants is performed almost exclusively by engineers. As technology advances and software interfaces become more user-friendly, it raises a question regarding the possibility of transferring the planning and manufacturing to the clinician. The reasons for such a shift are clear: the surgeon has the idea of what he wants to design, and he also knows what is feasible and could be used in the operating room. It allows him to be prepared for any scenario/unexpected results during the operation and allows the surgeon to be creative and express his new ideas using the CAD software. The purpose of this method is to provide clinicians with the ability to create their own surgical guides and reconstruction implants. In this manuscript, a detailed protocol will provide a simple method for segmentation using segmentation software and implant planning using a 3D design software. Following the segmentation and stl file production using segmentation software, the clinician could create a simple patient specific reconstruction plate or a more complex plate with a cradle for bone graft positioning. Surgical guides can be created for accurate resection, hole preparation for proper reconstruction plate positioning or for bone graft harvesting and re-contouring. A case of lower jaw reconstruction following plate fracture and nonunion healing of a trauma sustained injury is detailed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone transplantation 3acomputer software 3aharvesting 3amanufacturing 3apatients 3aplanning 3aresection1 aShilo, Dekel1 aBlanc, Ori1 aTurgeman, Shahar1 aEmodi, Omri1 aRachmiel, Adi0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2020 Aug. 04, , no. 162 p.e60929-e60929dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/609293Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/60929/3d-planning-printing-patient-specific-implants-for-reconstruction  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03287naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245013800171300001300309520153400322592002801856650001701884650002501901650000901926650002401935650001401959650002101973650002401994650001702018650001802035650001102053650001302064650001402077650002002091650002302111650001702134650001902151650002302170650002502193651002502218653002002243653001802263653002502281653001802306653003602324653003102360700001802391700002202409700002402431700002102455700001902476700002102495773009002516856008202606852000902688655001202697IND60647923720221122152801.0190830e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064792372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nfs.2019.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPassafiume, Roberta10aChemical–physical characteristics, polyphenolic content and total antioxidant activity of three Italian-grown pomegranate cultivars  ap. 9-14.  aIn Mediterranean countries, there is an increasing demand for pomegranate fruits due to their antioxidant properties and nutritional values. The large diffusion of new genotypes and cultivars requires the knowledge of all fruit characteristics in connection with the cultivation area, to satisfy the market demand. This study seeks to determine the fruit quality attributes and nutraceutical values of three pomegranate cultivars (Wonderful, Acco and Kamel) grown in the Mediterranean climate.The fruits were evaluated for their main physico-chemical traits (weight, volume, height, width, thickness, total arils number, total arils weight, juiciness, fruit index, peel index and total soluble solids content/titratable acidity ratio), bioactive compounds (total phenolic content and total anthocyanin content) and antioxidant activities (radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing power).Results: The data showed that Acco fruit is bigger, juicier and sweeter when compared with the cultivars Wonderful and Kamel. Wonderful is the smallest, least juicy and least sweet but the reddest among all the studied cultivars. Regarding the phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity (radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing power), cultivar Wonderful has the highest values and cultivar Acco contains the most anthocyanin content.This study showed that pomegranate cultivars grown in the Mediterranean area exhibit an appreciable quality, but there are significant differences in quality properties of the arils and juice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aaril 3abioactive compounds 3acultivars 3acultivation area 3adietary supplements 3afruit juices 3afruit quality 3afruits 3agenotype 3ajuiciness 3anutritive value 3aphenolic compounds 3apomegranates 3asupply balance 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3aMediterranean region 0aPunica granatum 0aFruit quality 0aAntioxidant activity 0aPhytochemical 0aPhysico-chemical characteristic 0aBioactive compound content1 aPerrone, Anna1 aSortino, Giuseppe1 aGianguzzi, Giuseppe1 aSaletta, Filippo1 aGentile, Carla1 aFarina, Vittorio0 tNFS journal.g2019 Sept., v. 16 p.9-14dElsevier GmbHwJournal:23304x2352-36467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nfs.2019.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245020400162300001800366520159600384592002801980650002202008650001702030650001002047650000902057650002102066650001902087650002602106650001302132650001602145650002302161700002302184700002202207700002002229700001602249700002102265700002702286773010402313856007502417852000902492655001202501IND60577889020221116195601.0170810e20130212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057788902DNAL7 a10.1021/ma302317m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashimoto, Chihiro10aHydration States of Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and Poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide) and Their Monomer Units in Aqueous Solutions with Lower Critical Solution Temperatures Studied by Infrared Spectroscopy  ap. 1041-1053.  aThe coil-to-globule transition of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPA) and poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide) (PdEA) in aqueous solutions has recently received substantial interest in its drastic change in the hydration state from a hydrated random coil to a hydrophobic globule for practical applications: drug delivery and tissue engineering. In this report, the hydration states of PNiPA and PdEA in aqueous solutions were investigated by IR spectroscopy in the amide I, N–H and C–H stretching band regions as compared with those of their repeat units, N-isopropylpropionamide (NiPP) and N,N-diethylpropylacrylamide (dEP) in aqueous and cyclohexane solutions in combined with their phase diagrams. The IR spectral changes in the amide I and C–H stretching band regions of N-alkylamides and N,N-dialkylamides including NiPP and dEP in aqueous solutions with varying concentration was characteristic due to different amide–amide interaction; the amide–amide interaction for N-alkylamide (CO···H–N hydrogen bond) is stronger than that for N,N-dialkylamide (dipolar interaction). It is found that almost all amide groups of PNiPA in aqueous solution forms the intramolecular CO···H–N hydrogen bond even in the coil state and that the amide group of PNiPA is less hydrated than that of PdEA in spite of the similar degree of hydration to alkyl groups. The IR spectral changes in the amide I and C–H stretching band regions of PNiPA and PdEA in aqueous solutions with heat are ascribed to the dehydration of the amide and alkyl groups from the coil state to the globule one.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acyclohexanes 3adrugs 3aheat 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amoieties 3atemperature 3atissue engineering1 aNagamoto, Akiyoshi1 aMaruyama, Takashi1 aKariyama, Naomi1 aIrisa, Yuma1 aIkehata, Akifumi1 aOzaki, Y.q(Yukihiro),0 tMacromolecules.g2013 Feb. 12, v. 46, no. 3 p.1041-1053dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma302317m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009800168300002000266520143600286592002801722596006901750650001301819650002201832650001701854650001101871650001401882650001201896650002001908650002101928650001501949650001701964650002001981650002402001650000902025650001002034650001402044650002102058650001702079650000902096650001802105650002202123650001002145650003102155651001102186700001702197700001702214700005502231773016902286856008202455852000902537655001202546IND60637042420221117210223.0190414e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063704242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-04257-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Li-Chuan10aHealth risk of metal exposure via inhalation of cigarette sidestream smoke particulate matter  ap. 10835-10845.  aCigarette sidestream smoke particulate matter (CSSP) is a major source of airborne metals in the indoor environment. However, the health impacts of inhalation of CSSP-bound metals are rarely studied. In this study, we quantify the amount of 37 metals discharged through CSSP from a leading Taiwan brand of cigarette, Long Life. We also estimate cancer and non-cancer risks due to inhalation of these metals and investigate possible modes of toxic action. Long Life CSSP exhibits a distinctive carcinogenic metal profile compared with Western brands. When released to a 60-m³ poorly ventilated room, Long Life CSSP metals increase the risk for cancer by a 9.26 or 20.90 in a million chance and the hazard quotient for non-cancer toxicity by 0.496 or 0.286 per cigarette depending on risk estimation system. Cd accounts for more than 90% and 80% of cancer and non-cancer risk, respectively. Long Life CSSP also contains considerable amounts of Al, Ba, and Fe. Metals are not responsible for CSSP-induced cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and transactivation activity of AhR, Nrf2, and ERα. However, they diminish resveratrol-activated Nrf2 activity and downstream antioxidant gene expression in low-AhR-expressing lung cells. Our results suggest that chronic exposure to Long Life CSSP elevates Cd-associated cancer and non-cancer risks. Furthermore, exposure to Long Life CSSP metals may impair Nrf2-mediated antioxidant protection.  aPublisher supplied data  aEO-105-PP06 and EO-106-PP06cNational Health Research Institutes 3aaluminum 3aantioxidant genes 3aantioxidants 3abarium 3abreathing 3acadmium 3acarcinogenicity 3achronic exposure 3acigarettes 3acytotoxicity 3agene expression 3ainhalation exposure 3airon 3alungs 3aneoplasms 3aoxidative stress 3aparticulates 3arisk 3arisk estimate 3asecond hand smoke 3asmoke 3atranscriptional activation 3aTaiwan1 aLin, Chun-Ju1 aLiu, Huei-Ju1 aLi, Lih-Ann1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9301-03090 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2019 Apr., v. 26, no. 11 p.10835-10845dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-04257-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245015900175520162400334592002801958650002501986650001202011650001102023650001002034650001502044650003302059650001302092650001102105650002202116650002202138650001202160650000702172650001402179650001402193650002302207650001602230650001902246650001102265650002002276650003102296650001202327650001302339650001102352653001902363653001402382653000802396653000902404700005702413773009202470856008502562852000902647655001202656IND60647923820221122113708.0190807e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064792382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plgene.2019.1001922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaddhe, Ankush Ashok10aMolecular cloning, expression analysis, and heterologous characterization of a novel sodium/hydrogen exchanger from a mangrove plant, Rhizophora apiculata  aMangroves are natural halophytes confined to the tropical and subtropical coastal region of the world. Rhizophora apiculata is a small mangrove tree with a natural reservoir of many unknown salt tolerance mechanisms which is completely unexplored. In the present study, we cloned the full-length coding sequence of a putative vacuolar Na+/H+ exchanger from R. apiculata (RaNHX1). In-silico analysis predicted highly conserved signature domain, motifs such as cation/proton exchanger 1 (CPA1), Na+/H+ exchanger domain, amiloride-binding motif, and 12 transmembrane helices, which confirmed they are a member of plant NHX family. Transcript analysis of RaNHX1 revealed differential transcript regulation pattern in various tissues and under salt stress libraries. Total Na+ and K+ analysis in leaves, stem, and root tissues under salt stress revealed that leaves are major Na+ storage tissues in R. apiculata. The heterologous expression of pYES2.1-RaNHX1 construct in AXT3 yeast mutant strain showed partial complementation of sensitive phenotype under NaCl and KCl stress indicating their involvement in sequestering Na+ and K+. In slight alkaline condition, AXT3-RaNHX1 partially complemented the mutant phenotype under Na+ and K+ supplements, while at acidic pH phenotype was less conclusive. Total Na+ and K+ analysis of AXT3-RaNHX1 showed higher accumulation in yeast cells compared to AXT3 mutant in NaCl stress conditions. Taken together, this is a first attempt to functionally characterize RaNHX1 member from R. apiculata which may contribute to better understanding of salt tolerance mechanism in R. apiculata.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizophora apiculata 3acations 3acoasts 3agenes 3ahalophytes 3aheterologous gene expression 3ahydrogen 3aleaves 3amangroves (trees) 3amolecular cloning 3amutants 3apH 3aphenotype 3apotassium 3apotassium chloride 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asodium-hydrogen antiporter 3atissues 3avacuoles 3ayeasts 0aMangrove plant 0aHalophyte 0aNHX 0aAXT31 aKundan Kumar,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9560-86060 tPlant gene.g2019 Sept., v. 19 p.100192-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23305x2352-40737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plgene.2019.1001923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245012700172300001800299520104600317592002801363650002801391650001101419650002201430650001301452650001501465650001201480650003001492650000901522653001701531653002401548653001201572653003101584773012601615856008401741852000901825655001201834IND60122152720150626000000.0150325e20140528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012215272DNAL7 a10.1080/03235408.2013.8303612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsumoto, Masaru10aDistribution analysis of population structures for Rhizoctonia solani AG-1 IA in Japanese paddy field, using rep-PCR assay  ap. 1082-1088.  aIn the present study, characterisation of genotypic variations of Rhizoctonia solani AG-1 IA associated with rice sheath blight by Rep-PCR assay and their structure of the genotypic variations by monitoring vertical and horizontal movements of their populations at a short distance level were investigated in Japanese paddy fields. Differences of the Rep-PCR fingerprintings were observed and distinguished into four genotypic variations referred to as GI, GII, GIII and GIV, respectively. Although similarity index of each genotype showed high levels of homology (85–90%) within the same genotypes, low levels of similarity index (65–70%) were also varied among the comparison of different genotypes. Moreover, diversity of genotypic populations was observed which is consistent with the correlations between the geographical undulations of the paddy fields and the occupation of their genotypic populations, indicating the presence of genotype GI on low lands such as AK1 and also the presence ofgenotype GIV on high lands such as AK4.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3ablight 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3amonitoring 3apaddies 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arice 0adistribution 0agenotypic variation 0arep-PCR 0aRhizoctonia solani AG-1 IA0 tArchiv für Phytopathologie und Pflanzenschutz.g2014 May 28, v. 47, no. 9 p.1082-1088dTaylor & Francisx1477-29067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03235408.2013.8303613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245015700164300002000321500001900341520110500360592002801465650002501493650001601518650000901534650001901543650001801562650001101580650001301591650001601604650002101620653001201641653001901653653001401672653003601686653001701722653002401739700001901763700006101782700006301843700005701906773014201963856007802105852000902183655001202192IND60715540520221118042710.0201028e20201016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071554052DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c136802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahzadi, Kiran10aFabrication of Highly Robust and Conductive Ion Gels Based on the Combined Strategies of Double-Network, Composite, and High-Functionality Cross-Linkers  ap. 49050-49060.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA robust hybrid ion gel is fabricated utilizing the combined strategies of double-network (DN), composite, and high-functionality cross-linkers. The charged poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid) (PAMPS) constructs the DN skeleton, with graphene oxide (GO) and N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) being the cross-linkers for the first and second networks, respectively. The ionic liquid, either 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide ([EMIm][DCA]) or 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIm][BF₄]), is locked in the network to offer the high conductivity. Compared to the DN PAMPS ion gel without nanoparticles and the hybrid DN ion gel with unconnected silica nanoparticles, the present ion gel exhibits a significantly higher tensile strength (3.2 ± 0.1 MPa) and an excellent compressive strength (26 ± 1 MPa). The [EMIm][DCA] ion gel has a high conductivity close to that of its neat ionic liquids. The conductivity of the gel is sensitive to deformation and temperature, which leads to potential applications in sensing body movements, pulse, and temperature change.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompression strength 3adeformation 3agels 3agraphene oxide 3aionic liquids 3asilica 3askeleton 3atemperature 3atensile strength 0aion gel 0adouble network 0acomposite 0ahigh-functionality cross-linker 0aconductivity 0amechanical strength1 aXiong, Wenjuan1 aShekh, Mehdihasan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8214-66651 aStadler, Florian J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5849-14851 aYan, Zhi-Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1447-99860 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Oct. 16, v. 12, no. 43 p.49050-49060dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c136803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001800135245010900153300001500262520139400277592002801671650001501699650002301714650001101737650001101748650002201759650001301781650002001794650001801814650002601832650001401858700003201872700002201904700002301926700002601949773015201975856006902127856010502196990002302301852000902324655001202333IND60705999520221122042854.0200807e20200806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070599952DNAL7 a10.3791/609552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBagheri, Amir12aA neurite outgrowth assay and neurotoxicity assessment with human neural progenitor cell-derived neurons  ap. e60955.  aNeurite outgrowth assay and neurotoxicity assessment are two major studies that can be performed using the presented method herein. This protocol provides reliable analysis of neuronal morphology together with quantitative measurements of modifications on neurite length and synaptic protein localization and abundance upon treatment with small molecule compounds. In addition to the application of the presented method in neurite outgrowth studies, neurotoxicity assessment can be performed to assess, distinguish and rank commercial chemical compounds based on their potential developmental neurotoxicity effect. Even though cell lines are nowadays widely used in compound screening assays in neuroscience, they often differ genetically and phenotypically from their tissue origin. Primary cells, on the other hand, maintain important markers and functions observed in vivo. Therefore, due to the translation potential and physiological relevance that these cells could offer neurite outgrowth assay and neurotoxicity assessment can considerably benefit from using human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) as the primary human cell model. The presented method herein can be utilized to screen for the ability of compounds to induce neurite outgrowth and neurotoxicity by taking advantage of the human neural progenitor cell-derived neurons, a cell model closely representing human biology."  aPublisher supplied data 3acell lines 3achemical compounds 3ahumans 3amodels 3aneural stem cells 3aneurites 3aneurophysiology 3aneurotoxicity 3aquantitative analysis 3ascreening1 aRazavipour, Seyedeh Fatemeh1 aWahlestedt, Claes1 aMowla, Seyed Javad1 aFaghihi, Mohammad Ali0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2020 Aug. 06, , no. 162 p.e60955-e60955dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/609553Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/60955/a-neurite-outgrowth-assay-neurotoxicity-assessment-with-human-neural  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245006300167300001800230520123400248592002801482650002701510650002101537650002001558650001301578650002401591650001101615650000901626650001301635650001801648700002101666700002501687773012501712856007401837852000901911655001201920IND60633215920221121085857.0190319e20190318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063321592DNAL7 a10.1039/c8gc03989e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbad-Fernández, Nerea10aAromatics from lignin through ultrafast reactions in water  ap. 1351-1360.  aNowadays, the valorization of lignin, the major natural source of aromatics, is a challenge for the scientific community. In this study, kraft lignin was effectively converted into aromatic monomers via ultrafast depolymerization in hot and pressurized water. At reaction times below 500 ms, it was possible to avoid char formation originating from undesirable condensation reactions by accurately controlling the reaction time. In alkaline medium, the reaction was optimum at 386 °C and 300 ms with a light oil yield of 60% and concentration of key compounds such as guaiacol, creosol, vanillin and acetovanillone of around 20% w/w. The total aromatic monomeric yield based on lignin was 10.5% w/w. The char formation at this point was surprisingly low (4% w/w). Analysis and quantification of the products allowed the evolution of the different reaction steps to be identified and a plausible mechanism for the depolymerization and repolymerization stages to be proposed. Furthermore, it was proven that the proposed technology is equally effective to directly treat industrial black liquors with a yield higher than 50% to light oil, containing guaiacol (2.7%), syringol (3.0%) and syringaldehyde (7.3%) as the main monomers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acondensation reactions 3adepolymerization 3agreen chemistry 3aguaiacol 3ahot water treatment 3alignin 3aoils 3avanillin 3awaste liquors1 aPérez, Eduardo,1 aCocero, María José0 tGreen chemistry.g2019 Mar. 18, v. 21, no. 6 p.1351-1360dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8gc03989e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03181naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245016800177300001800345500001500363520181100378592002802189650001602217650001302233650002402246650001802270650001602288650003302304650001902337650001602356650001202372650002102384650001502405653001502420700002302435700001702458700002102475700001702496700002102513700002502534773011202559856005502671852000902726655001202735IND4466527020221119094752.0120727e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446652702DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02467.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, Timothy J.10aDefining the response of a microorganism to temperatures that span its complete growth temperature range (−2°C to 28°C) using multiplex quantitative proteomics  ap. 2186-2203.  a2019-12-06  aThe growth of all microorganisms is limited to a specific temperature range. However, it has not previously been determined to what extent global protein profiles change in response to temperatures that incrementally span the complete growth temperature range of a microorganism. As a result it has remained unclear to what extent cellular processes (inferred from protein abundance profiles) are affected by growth temperature and which, in particular, constrain growth at upper and lower temperature limits. To evaluate this, 8‐plex iTRAQ proteomics was performed on the Antarctic microorganism, Methanococcoides burtonii. Methanococcoides burtonii was chosen due to its importance as a model psychrophilic (cold‐adapted) member of the Archaea, and the fact that proteomic methods, including subcellular fractionation procedures, have been well developed. Differential abundance patterns were obtained for cells grown at seven different growth temperatures (−2°C, 1°C, 4°C, 10°C, 16°C, 23°C, 28°C) and a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to identify trends in protein abundances. The multiplex analysis enabled three largely distinct physiological states to be described: cold stress (−2°C), cold adaptation (1°C, 4°C, 10°C and 16°C), and heat stress (23°C and 28°C). A particular feature of the thermal extremes was the synthesis of heat‐ and cold‐specific stress proteins, reflecting the important, yet distinct ways in which temperature‐induced stress manifests in the cell. This is the first quantitative proteomic investigation to simultaneously assess the response of a microorganism to numerous growth temperatures, including the upper and lower growth temperatures limits, and has revealed a new level of understanding about cellular adaptive responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3aproteins 3aphysiological state 3afractionation 3acold stress 3aprincipal component analysis 3amicroorganisms 3aheat stress 3aArchaea 3amicrobial growth 3aproteomics 0aadaptation1 aLauro, Federico M.1 aErtan, Haluk1 aBurg, Dominic W.1 aPoljak, Anne1 aRaftery, Mark J.1 aCavicchioli, Ricardo0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2011 Aug., v. 13, no. 8 p.2186-2203dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02467.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01673naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002400181245010900205300002000314506007600334520041300410592002800823506003700851650001700888650002300905650002100928650001500949650001300964700002400977700002701001700002901028700002401057773013501081856007401216852000901290655001201299IND60638929220221207145056.0190501e20160804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063892922DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc04575h2doi7 aPMC50018762pmcid7 a274473462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSangsuwan, Rapeepat10aDirect detection of nitrotyrosine-containing proteins using an aniline-based oxidative coupling strategy  ap. 10036-10039.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA convenient two-step method is described for the detection of nitrotyrosine-containing proteins.

Contaminant transport has a strong effect on disease spreading in the cabin environment. To obtain the complex cabin contaminant distribution fields accurately and completely, which is also essential to provide solid and precise data for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model validation, this paper aimed to investigate and improve the method for simultaneous particle and gaseous contaminant fields measurement. The experiment was conducted in a functional MD-82 aircraft. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) was used as tracer gas, and Di-Ethyl-Hexyl-Sebacat (DEHS) was used as particulate contaminant. The whole measurement was completed in a part of the economy-class cabin without heating manikins or occupied with heating manikins. The experimental method, in terms of pollutant source setting, sampling points and schedule, was investigated. Statistical analysis showed that appropriately modified sampling grid was able to provide reasonable data. A small difference in the source locations can lead to a significant difference in cabin contaminant fields. And the relationship between gaseous and particulate pollutant transport was also discussed through tracking behavior analysis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaircraft 3aatmospheric chemistry 3afluid mechanics 3aheat 3amodel validation 3apollutants 3astatistical analysis 3asulfur hexafluoride 0aAircraft cabin 0aContaminant 0aTest procedure 0aSampling grid 0aSource setting 0aTracking behavior1 aLiu, Junjie1 aPei, Jingjing1 aLin, Chao-Hsin1 aChen, Qingyan0 tAtmospheric environment.g2014 Mar., v. 85 p.223-233dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.11.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006400151245009800215300001600313520105100329592002801380650001701408650002201425650002001447650002501467650001101492650002201503650000901525650001901534650001601553651001801569653003201587653002001619653001701639653002601656653002601682653002601708700002101734700001801755700002301773700001901796773011501815856008601930852000902016655001202025IND60621756620221117164629.0210114e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062175662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbebe, Yared Abayneh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6416-644312aA coupled flood-agent-institution modelling (CLAIM) framework for urban flood risk management  ap. 483-492.  aIn this paper, we describe a modelling framework that allows the integration of human and physical components of flood risk. Within this framework, flood risk management is conceptualized as a coupled human-flood system. The human subsystem includes individuals and their behaviour and institutions that shape human-flood interaction. The framework presents a dynamic integration between agent-based models of individuals and institutions and numerical flood models. We demonstrate the framework's modelling application by examining the effects of three institutions in the Caribbean island of Sint Maarten. The case study shows the capabilities of the framework by exploring impacts of existing policies on flood risk reduction. Coupled agent-based-flood models built using the framework are useful to analyse policy options that address flood hazard and communities' vulnerability and exposure to support policy decision making. These models also show how flood risk changes over time in relation to the human dynamics on the urban environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3adecision making 3aenvironmental models 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3aurban areas 3aSaint Maarten 0aCoupled human-flood systems 0aSocio-hydrology 0aInstitutions 0aAgent-based modelling 0aFlood risk management 0aUrban flood modelling1 aGhorbani, Amineh1 aNikolic, Igor1 aVojinović, Zoran,1 aSanchez, Arlex0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2019 Jan., v. 111 p.483-492dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245007500170300001600245520143500261592002801696650002701724650002401751650001301775650002601788650001301814650002401827650000901851650001001860650001501870650001501885650002201900650001901922650001301941650001701954651001801971700002001989700002302009700006002032773011202092856008202204852000902286655001202295IND60590278020221123042732.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059027802DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-018-0797-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlaherty, KelleyL.10aTiming of white-tailed deer browsing affects wetland plant communities  ap. 313-324.  aWhite-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimm.) have the potential to alter plant community composition and successional trajectory by browsing differentially on forb, graminoid, and woody species. The objective of this study was to determine if seasonal elimination of deer browsing changed wetland plant community composition and structure. We established 66 deer exclosure plots in two wetland vegetation communities in Canaan Valley, West Virginia, USA. Plots were established in April 2005 and monitoring was conducted in June and October, 2005–2007 to obtain data on both early and late species. Composition differed between control and treatment plots in Solidago spp.–Rubus hispidus L. communities in late-protected plots (enclosed July–October) when data were gathered in October. Community composition also varied in early-protected plots (enclosed April–July) when data were gathered in June. Forb cover increased in treatment plots in Solidago spp.–Rubus hispidus communities. Composition differed in Populus tremuloides Michx. communities in late-protected and continuously protected plots. There was no increase in cover by any wetland indicator status categories after 2 years of protection. Timing of browse played an influential role in the effect that white-tailed deer have on wetland plant communities. Our results suggest that reducing browsing pressure seasonally can increase forb species cover.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3aPopulus tremuloides 3aSolidago 3abotanical composition 3abrowsing 3acommunity structure 3adeer 3aforbs 3agraminoids 3amonitoring 3aplant communities 3awetland plants 3awetlands 3awoody plants 3aWest Virginia1 aRentch, JamesS.1 aGrafton, WilliamN.1 aAnderson, JamesT.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9907-34660 tPlant ecology.g2018 Mar., v. 219, no. 3 p.313-324dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl55230x1385-02377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-018-0797-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01944naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245009400167300001600261520082000277592002801097650001501125650001401140650001101154650001301165650001701178650001701195650001201212650001701224650001601241700001801257700002001275700001501295700001701310700001901327700001501346773009001361856008601451852000901537655001201546IND60095682020221120071609.0141104e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009568202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2012.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Baofu10aPolyethyleneimine modified fluorescent carbon dots and their application in cell labeling  ap. 209-214.  aFluorescent carbon dots (CDs) were solvothermaly synthesized in water–glycol medium by using glucose as carbon source and then modified with polyethyleneimine (PEI) for the first time to improve fluorescence quality.

No apparent cytotoxicity was observed, demonstrating much better biosafety property compared with CdTe quantum dots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abiosafety 3acarbon 3acolloids 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescence 3aglucose 3aquantum dots 3awavelengths1 aWang, Wenxing1 aZhending,cShi,1 aFang, Fang1 aWang, Naizhi1 aZhang, Xiujuan1 aXu, Shukun0 tColloids and surfaces.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 100 p.209-214dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2012.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02113naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245015000172300001600322500001500338520085900353592002801212650001401240650002401254650003401278650000801312650003001320650002201350650002201372650001301394650001701407650001001424653001001434700001701444700001801461700001901479700002201498773009301520856008101613852000901694655001201703IND60573813720221117213816.0170725e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057381372DNAL7 a10.1007/s12041-016-0715-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSRIVASTAVA, PRIYANKA10aNovel mutations in the transmembrane natriuretic peptide receptor NPR-B gene in four Indian families with acromesomelic dysplasia, type Maroteaux  ap. 905-909.  a2019-12-06  aAcromesomelic dysplasia, type Maroteaux is a disorder characterized by disproportionate short stature predominantly affecting the middle and distal segments of the upper and lower limbs. It is an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutation in NPR2 gene which impairs skeletal growth. To screen the mutations in the gene NPR2, all of its coding exons and splice junction sites were PCR amplified from genomic DNA of affected individuals of four families and sequenced. Four homozygous mutations in four different families were identified. These include three novel mutations including a deletion frameshift mutation (p.Cys586Ter), one nonsense mutation (p.Arg479Ter), one missense mutation (p.Val187Asp) and one reported missense mutation (p.Tyr338Cys).

Together, these characteristics severely limit the applicability of Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) to high-dimensional models because very large numbers of model runs are typically required to achieve convergence and provide a robust assessment. Paradoxically, only 30 percent of GSA applications in the environmental modelling literature have investigated models with more than 20 parameters, suggesting that GSA is under-utilized on problems for which it should prove most useful. We develop a novel grouping strategy, based on bootstrap-based clustering, that enables efficient application of GSA to high-dimensional models. We also provide a new measure of robustness that assesses GSA stability and convergence. For two models, having 50 and 111 parameters, we show that grouping-enabled GSA provides results that are highly robust to sampling variability, while converging with a much smaller number of model runs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aenvironmental models 3amathematical models 0aGlobal sensitivity analysis 0aCurse of dimensionality 0aComputationally intensive simulations 0aFactor grouping 0aRobustness 0aConvergence1 aRazavi, Saman1 aGupta, Hoshin V.1 aBecker, William1 aHaghnegahdar, Amin0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2019 Jan., v. 111 p.282-299dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245008900174300001600263500001500279520166400294592002801958650001101986650001901997650002202016650001102038650000902049650002202058650001702080650001102097650003102108650001202139653001402151700003202165700005402197773011202251856008202363852000902445655001202454IND60590278120221123042702.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059027812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-018-0799-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, RachelMacedo10aDiversity and dominance patterns in Amazon coast dune forest island tree communities  ap. 343-357.  a2019-12-06  aAiming to better understand richness, dominance, diversity and community changes of coastal vegetation, we studied woody plant communities and soil parameters of equatorial dune forest islands. We investigated four sites isolated by mangroves (Buraco Beach, Bonifácio, Camarauaçu, Apeu-Salvador) and compared data to a paleodune forest with higher floristic and structural complexity (Salinas do Roque) for assessment of the regional species pool. We determined grain size distribution and organic matter content at Buraco Beach, Camarauaçu and Apeu-Salvador. Grain size distribution was similar among sites but upper soil layers at Camarauaçu showed low organic matter contents. We recorded trees and shrubs along several transect plots crossing forested dune ridges and surveyed areas outside of plots for additional species. Richness was lower at Camarauaçu (18 species vs. 25, 26 and 28 at Bonifácio, Apeu-Salvador and Buraco Beach, respectively). Fisher’s α ranged between 3.2 and 4.7, Pielou’s J’ between 0.70 and 0.80. Rényi profiles confirmed lower diversity for Camarauaçu, dominated by a small group of species with high importance values. Within-site beta diversity was lowest at Buraco Beach. Species were mainly wide-spread generalists. We found low richness compared to the Salinas do Roque reference site; null model tests indicated that the species pool of the dune sites was partly shaped by environmental filtering. We attribute differences in species composition and diversity/dominance patterns among the four dune sites to distance to the mainland and stochastic events with effects on non-standard long distance dispersal.  aPublisher supplied data 3ashrubs 3aorganic matter 3aplant communities 3amodels 3asoil 3aspecies diversity 3awoody plants 3acoasts 3aparticle size distribution 3aforests 0amangroves1 aReis, ÂngelaCristina Alves1 aMehlig, Ulf1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0142-45050 tPlant ecology.g2018 Mar., v. 219, no. 3 p.343-357dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl55230x1385-02377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-018-0799-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01660naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245015600177300001600333500001500349520051100364592002800875650001300903650001100916650002400927650001600951650002300967650001400990653001701004700001701021700002401038700002901062773009101091856008401182990002301266852000901289655001201298IND60092487020221118024529.0141103e20120520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009248702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cattod.2011.07.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnsari, Mohd Bismillah10aMesoporous carbon nitride as a metal-free base catalyst in the microwave assisted Knoevenagel condensation of ethylcyanoacetate with aromatic aldehydes  ap. 211-216.  a2019-12-06  aHigh nitrogen containing mesoporous carbon nitride (MCN) was synthesized and investigated as a metal-free base catalyst for the Knoevenagel condensation of ethylcyanoacetate with aromatic aldehydes.

In this study, we obtained and characterized a protein hydrolysate from defatted C. maxima seed meal, focusing on the effect of the used protease on tryptophan release. Protein hydrolysates were prepared using five different proteases and compared regarding the degree of hydrolysis (DH), free tryptophan content, hydrolysis kinetics, and potential antioxidant activity over reaction time. Protein hydrolysis using Flavourzyme resulted in the highest DH (35.6%), and free tryptophan concentration (337.9 mg/100 g), whereas hydrolysates obtained using Chymotrypsin showed the highest in vitro antioxidant activity (oxygen radical absorbance capacity [ORAC]) (371.1 mmol TE/100 g DM of protein extract). Our results show that protein hydrolysates from C. maxima seeds are a promising source of free tryptophan, with high antioxidant activity, supporting its potential as a food ingredient or for nutraceutical applications. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: C. maxima seeds are a promising source of free tryptophan, and its functionalization through hydrolysis showed a significant effect increasing tryptophan release and antioxidant activity, increasing its potential for ingredient or nutraceutical applications.  aPublisher supplied data  a1200466cFondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (Fondecyt)  a21181194cComisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica 3achymotrypsin 3adietary supplements 3afood composition 3ahydrolysis 3aingredients 3ameals (products) 3aoxygen radical absorbance capacity 3aprotein hydrolysates 3aprotein sources 3aproteolysis 3apumpkins 3asquashes 3atryptophan1 aBernal, Claudia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9117-04831 aMartínez, Ronny1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2317-02190 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2022 Feb., v. 46, no. 2 p.e16290-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.162903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245014100203300001400344520164200358592002802000650002502028650000902053650001802062650001102080650001302091653002402104653002502128653001902153653001602172653002602188653002002214700001502234700001402249700001702263700001702280700002002297773008702317856008402404852000902488655001202497IND60583035220221122072858.0171008e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058303522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2016.03.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeo, Y.Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8494-802310aSound exposure changes European seabass behaviour in a large outdoor floating pen: Effects of temporal structure and a ramp-up procedure  ap. 26-34.  aUnderwater sound from human activities may affect fish behaviour negatively and threaten the stability of fish stocks. However, some fundamental understanding is still lacking for adequate impact assessments and potential mitigation strategies. For example, little is known about the potential contribution of the temporal features of sound, the efficacy of ramp-up procedures, and the generalisability of results from indoor studies to the outdoors. Using a semi-natural set-up, we exposed European seabass in an outdoor pen to four treatments: 1) continuous sound, 2) intermittent sound with a regular repetition interval, 3) irregular repetition intervals and 4) a regular repetition interval with amplitude ‘ramp-up’. Upon sound exposure, the fish increased swimming speed and depth, and swam away from the sound source. The behavioural readouts were generally consistent with earlier indoor experiments, but the changes and recovery were more variable and were not significantly influenced by sound intermittency and interval regularity. In addition, the ‘ramp-up’ procedure elicited immediate diving response, similar to the onset of treatment without a ‘ramp-up’, but the fish did not swim away from the sound source as expected. Our findings suggest that while sound impact studies outdoors increase ecological and behavioural validity, the inherently higher variability also reduces resolution that may be counteracted by increasing sample size or looking into different individual coping styles. Our results also question the efficacy of ‘ramp-up’ in deterring marine animals, which warrants more investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3afish 3afish behavior 3ahumans 3aswimming 0aAnthropogenic noise 0aDicentrarchus labrax 0aFish behaviour 0aField study 0aSound characteristics 0aStress response1 aHubert, J.1 aBolle, L.1 aWinter, H.V.1 aten Cate, C.1 aSlabbekoorn, H.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2016 July, v. 214 p.26-34dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.03.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01729naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009800171500001400269520066500283592002800948650002300976650001200999650001301011650002601024650001401050650001701064650001301081700003101094700001701125700002701142773012801169856008501297852000901382655001201391IND60721705720221120140618.0201224e20201126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072170572DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms81218642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChateau, Alice 14aThe Bacillus anthracis Cell Envelope: Composition, Physiological Role, and Clinical Relevance  aNAL-light  aAnthrax is a highly resilient and deadly disease caused by the spore-forming bacterial pathogen Bacillus anthracis.

This paper presents the methodological framework for its participative multi-criteria approach and its architecture, and describes its functionality simulating a practical application. The web tool has the potential to break down data access and specialised skills barriers while providing a means for enhancing SEA consistency and transparency. However, data limitations remain affecting its applicability, and further technological advancements may help enhance its functionality.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental models 3aland use 3aplanning 3astakeholders 3aworld wide web 0aImpact assessment 0aGeographic information systems 0aOnline geoprocessing 0aDecision support tool 0aMulti-criteria assessment1 aGleeson, Justin1 aMcCarthy, Eoghan0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2019 Jan., v. 111 p.472-482dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03505naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245008800207300001600295520202600311592002802337650002402365650001702389650002602406650001302432650002002445650001202465650001102477650001502488650003002503650001502533650001802548650000902566650001102575650001402586650002502600650001402625650000902639650001402648650001002662650001502672700001902687700001802706700002802724700001702752700001502769773011202784856008202896852000902978655001202987IND60590278220221123032312.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059027822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-018-0798-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorán-López, T.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5804-525810aFragmentation modifies seed trait effects on scatter-hoarders’ foraging decisions  ap. 325-342.  aScatter-hoarding animals are crucial in seed dispersal of nut-bearing plants. We used the holm oak Quercus ilex—wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus mutualism as a model system to evaluate the relative importance of seed size and fat content on scatter-hoarders’ foraging decisions influencing oak dispersal and potential recruitment. We performed a field experiment in which we offered holm oak acorns with contrasting seed size (2 vs 5 g) and fat content (3 vs 11%). Moreover, to test if the strength of these seed trait effects was context-dependent, experimental acorns were placed in small fragments, where natural regeneration is scarce or absent, and forest habitats. In small fragments, rodents had to face increased intraspecific competition for acorns and reduced anti-predator cover during transportation. As a result, they became more selective to ensure rapid acquisition of most valuable food items but, in turn, transported seeds closer to avoid unaffordable predation risks. During harvesting and caching, larger acorns were prioritized and preferentially cached. Fat content only had a minor effect in harvesting preferences. In contrast, in forest sites, where rodent abundance was four times lower and understory cover was well-developed, rodents were not selective but provided enhanced dispersal services to oaks (caching rates were 75% higher). From the plants’ perspective, our results imply that the benefits of producing costly seeds are context-dependent. Seed traits modified harvesting and caching rates only when rodents were forced to forage more efficiently in response to increased intraspecific competition. However, when landscape traits limited cache protection strategies, a more selective foraging behavior by scatter-hoarders did not result in enhanced dispersal services. Overall, our result shows that successful dispersal of acorns depends on how specific traits modulate their value and how landscape properties affect rodents’ ability to safeguard them for later consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApodemus sylvaticus 3aQuercus ilex 3afield experimentation 3aforaging 3aforest habitats 3aforests 3afruits 3aharvesting 3aintraspecific competition 3alandscapes 3alipid content 3amice 3amodels 3amutualism 3anatural regeneration 3apredation 3arisk 3aseed size 3aseeds 3aunderstory1 aValladares, F.1 aTiribelli, F.1 aPérez-Sepúlveda, J.E.1 aTraveset, A.1 aDíaz, M.,0 tPlant ecology.g2018 Mar., v. 219, no. 3 p.325-342dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl55230x1385-02377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-018-0798-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02192naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245009600158300002000254520103100274592002801305596009801333650001401431650000901445650001501454650003101469650001901500700001601519700001401535700005401549773017301603856008101776852000901857655001201866IND60783641820221118232557.0220720e20220712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078364182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.2c000602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Han10aEffects of Different Size Distribution of Capturing Granules on Moving Bed Granular Filters  ap. 10172-10183.  aMoving bed filters are widely used in the field of high-temperature gas filtration. The property of the capturing particles is undoubtedly a crucial factor to determine the performance of the moving bed granular filters. A large cold-mode experiment was carried out in a moving bed granular filter with co-current flow (MBGF-CF). The characteristics of the pressure drop and the collection efficiency were investigated for two types of the capturing granules. The experimental results show that the filters express a similar filtration performance under the same operating conditions even if these two different capturing granules are used. A low superficial gas velocity or a low granule moving velocity results in a high filtration efficiency. In addition, the empirical relationship of the single-particle trapping mechanism for the dust to the total efficiency of the filter was proposed based on analyzing the particle size distribution, the particle shape, and the theoretical analysis of the void fraction construction.  aPublisher supplied data  aU1862202cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3achemistry 3adust 3afiltration 3aparticle size distribution 3aprocess design1 aFan, Yiping1 aXing, Kai1 aLu, Chunxi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9803-91190 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 July 12, v. 61, no. 28 p.10172-10183dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c000603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01626naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245004900176300001600225500002000241520057600261592002800837650001100865650001400876650000900890650002200899650002300921650002400944650001400968650001100982650002500993700001801018773014201036852000901178856008901187655001201276IND4369728820221122030331.0200107e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436972882DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8276.2005.00737.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChambers, Robert G.10aOutput Price Subsidies in a Stochastic World  ap. 501-508.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis article studies the comparative statics of output subsidies for firms, with monotonic preferences over costs and returns, that face price and production uncertainty.

Four trihalomethanes (THMs) and nine haloacetic acids (HAAs) were measured from a chlorine-disinfected sample and two aldehydes (i.e., formaldehydes and acetaldehydes) were analyzed after ozonation. Chlorination was effective for total coliform removal with Ct value in the range of 30–60 mg-min/L. Over 1.6 mg/L of ozone dose and 0.5 min of the contact time presented sufficient disinfection efficiency. The concentration of THMs increased with longer contact time (24 h), but that of HAAs showed little change with contact time. The measured concentration of formaldehyde at the ozone dose of 1.6 mg/L and the contact time of 9 min showed the greatest value in this study, approximately 330 μg L−1, from which the corresponding ecotoxicity was determined using an indicator species, Daphnia magna. The ecotoxicity results were consistent with the toxicological features judged by occurrence, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity. Both the disinfection efficiency as well as the DBP formation potential should therefore be considered to avoid harmful impacts on aquatic environments when a disinfection method is used for wastewater effluents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aaquatic environment 3abyproducts 3acarcinogenicity 3achlorination 3achlorine 3acoliform bacteria 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3aecotoxicology 3aeffluents 3aformaldehyde 3agenotoxicity 3ahaloacetic acids 3aindicator species 3aozonation 3aozone 3awastewater 0aChlorination 0aOzonation 0aDisinfection by-products 0aEcotoxicity 0aWastewater effluents1 aChoi, Su-Young1 aLee, Seung-Hoon1 aKweon, Ji-Hyang1 aSong, Ji-Hyeon0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2016 Aug., v. 215 p.314-321dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245012000165300001600285520160500301592002801906650001301934650001601947650002001963650002601983650001702009650001602026650001702042650001002059650001002069650002202079650001302101650002402114650001802138653004202156653004002198653002802238653002302266653002202289700001602311700001402327700001802341700001502359700001702374700002002391700005702411773008902468856008602557852000902643655001202652IND60547342720221120183307.0160903e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054734272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.05.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, W.10aModelling aerosol–cloud–meteorology interaction: A case study with a fully coupled air quality model (GEM-MACH)  ap. 695-715.  aA fully coupled on-line air quality forecast model, GEM-MACH, was used to study aerosol–cloud interactions for a case of an urban-industrial plume impacting stratocumulus. The aerosol effect on the cloud microphysics was achieved by the use of parameterization of cloud droplet nucleation predicted from the on-line size- and composition-resolved aerosols and coupled with a double-moment cloud microphysics parameterization. The model simulations with and without the on-line aerosol effect on cloud microphysics were compared and evaluated against in-situ aerosol and cloud observations from ICARTT 2004. Inclusion of the on-line aerosol interaction with cloud resulted in an increase in modelled cloud amount and cloud liquid water content (LWC) due to increased cloud droplet number concentration (Nd), a decrease in cloud droplet size and a reduction in warm precipitation. The modelled LWC and Nd agreed more closely with the observations when the on-line aerosol was allowed to affect the cloud than when aerosol effects on cloud were not explicitly simulated. The increased cloud amount due to the aerosol effects reduced the modelled downward shortwave radiative flux and air temperature at the surface, contributing to a decrease in ozone over the region of enhanced cloud and an increase in particle sulphate from an increased capacity for aqueous-phase production. Aerosol activation is shown to have a significant influence on the cloud microphysics and cloud processing of trace gases and aerosols. The importance of reasonable parameterization of cloud updraft speed is demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair quality 3aair temperature 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acase studies 3acloud cover 3adroplet size 3agases 3aozone 3asimulation models 3asulfates 3asurface temperature 3awater content 0aModelling aerosol–cloud interaction 0aAir quality and weather interaction 0aAerosol indirect effect 0aAerosol activation 0aAir quality model1 aMakar, P.A.1 aZhang, J.1 aMilbrandt, J.1 aGravel, S.1 aHayden, K.L.1 aMacdonald, A.M.1 aLeaitch, W.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1503-56390 tAtmospheric environment.g2015 Aug., v. 115 p.695-715dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.05.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02156naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014600164300001600310520104600326592002801372650001301400650001701413650001101430650001601441650001001457650001601467650001801483650001901501650003101520650000901551650001201560700002001572773011101592856008201703852000901785655001201794IND60590278320221123042651.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059027832DNAL7 a10.1134/S009780781707003X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDashko, R.E.10aImproving Approaches to Estimating Hydrogeological Investigations as a Part of Engineering Survey in Megacities: Case Study of St. Petersburg  ap. 875-885.  aUrban subsurface space is considered to be a dynamic multicomponent system, which includes sandy-clayey soils, groundwater in different state, microbiota, gases, and underground facilities (either as foundations or as surrounding walls), or engineering structures (tunnels of different purpose, hazardous industrial-waste storages, etc.).

This increased complexity is enabled by the variety of protein diversification mechanisms that exist at every step of the protein biosynthesis pathway, such as alternative splicing and post transcriptional and translational modifications. The resulting variation in subunits can generate compositionally distinct protein assemblies. These different forms of a single protein complex may comprise functional variances that enable response and adaptation to varying cellular conditions. Despite the biological importance of this layer of complexity, relatively little is known about the compositional heterogeneity of protein complexes, mostly due to technical barriers of studying such closely related species. Here, we show that native mass spectrometry (MS) offers a way to unravel this inherent heterogeneity of protein assemblies. Our approach relies on the advanced Orbitrap mass spectrometer capable of multistage MS analysis across all levels of protein organization. Specifically, we have implemented a two-step fragmentation process in the inject flatapole device, which was converted to a linear ion trap, and can now probe the intact protein complex assembly, through its constituent subunits, to the primary sequence of each protein. We demonstrate our approach on the yeast homotetrameric FBP1 complex, the rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis. We show that the complex responds differently to changes in growth conditions by tuning phosphorylation dynamics. Our methodology deciphers, on a single instrument and in a single measurement, the stoichiometry, kinetics, and exact position of modifications, contributing to the exposure of the multilevel diversity of protein complexes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalternative splicing 3agluconeogenesis 3amass spectrometry 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis 3aspectrometers 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics) 3ayeasts1 aBelov, Mikhail E.1 aMorgenstern, David1 aLevin, Yishai1 aDym, Orly1 aArkind, Galina1 aLipson, Carni1 aMakarov, Alexander A.1 aSharon, Michal0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2017 Apr. 18, v. 89, no. 8 p.4708-4715dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.7b005183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011300169300001400282520139200296592002801688650001501716650002201731650002501753650002301778653003001801653001601831653002701847653003901874653003801913653003001951653002501981700002302006700006102029700001802090773011302108856008602221852000902307655001202316IND60621757020221122010918.0190130e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062175702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Mengning12aA software tool for assessing the performance of and implementing water distribution system solution methods  ap. 52-69.  aWDSLib is an extensible simulation toolkit for the steady-state analysis of a water distribution system. It includes a range of solution methods: the forest-core partitioning algorithm, the global gradient algorithm, the reformulated co-tree flows method, and also combinations of these methods. WDSLib has been created using a modularized object-oriented design and implemented in the C++ programming language, and has been validated against a reference MATLAB implementation. WDSLib has been designed: (i) to avoid unnecessary computations by hoisting each of the modules to its appropriate level of repetition, (ii) to perform the computations independently of measurement units using scaled variables, (iii) to accurately report the execution time of all the modules in that it is possible to produce a timing model to parameterize multiple simulation times (such as in an optimization using a genetic algorithm) from a series of sampling simulation runs and (iv) to guard against numerical failures. Two example applications, a once-off simulation and a network optimization design application simulation, are presented. This toolkit can be used (i) to implement, test and compare different solution methods, (ii) to focus the research on the most time-consuming parts of a solution method and (iii) to guide the choice of solution method when multiple simulation runs are required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputer software 3aenvironmental models 3awater distribution 0aWater distribution system 0aC++ toolkit 0aObject-oriented design 0aForest-core partitioning algorithm 0aReformulated Co-Tree flows method 0aGlobal gradient algorithm 0aOpen source software1 aAlexander, Bradley1 aSimpson, Angus R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3440-556X1 aElhay, Sylvan0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2019 Feb., v. 112 p.52-69dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01855naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245007400173300001600247520090000263592002801163650001201191650000801203650001301211650001401224650002301238650001801261650002401279700001901303773009101322856008401413990002301497852000901520655001201529IND60092487420221118024515.0141103e20120520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009248742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cattod.2011.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsuhashi, Hiromi10aPreparation of a novel solid base catalyst of CaO covered with SiO₂  ap. 236-240.  aSolid base catalysts composed of CaO covered with 5–20mol% SiO₂ (SiO₂/CaO) were prepared by deposition of Si(OC₂H₅)₄ on a Ca(OH)₂ surface in an ethyl acetate solution, followed by thermal decomposition in air at 773–1023K.

Herein we report on the proof-of-concept of simple and sensitive potentiometric DNA biosensor for specific detection of miRNA-21 coupling and catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) with target recycling. This system consists of two hairpin DNA probes and one single-stranded DNA (capture probe). To decrease the background signal, the thiolated capture probe is covalently conjugated onto a cleaned gold electrode through typical Au-S bond. Upon target miRNA-21 introduction, the analyte opens hairpins DNA in turn to propagate the CHA reaction between two alternating hairpins accompanying the release of target miRNA-21 for recycling, thereby resulting in formation of numerous nicked double-helixes. Meanwhile, the newly produced CHA product hybridizes with the immobilized capture DNA probe on the electrode, thus causing the change in the surface charge density for potentiometric measurement. Under optimum conditions, CHA-based DNA biosensor presents good potentiometric responses for determination of target miRNA-21 at a level as low as 43 fM. An intermediate precision of <10% is accomplished with the batch-to-batch identification. The specificity and stability of CHA-based biosensor are satisfactory. Importantly, CHA-based potentiometric biosensor offers promise for the label-free, rapid, simple, cost-effective analysis of biological samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA probes 3abiosensors 3achemical bonding 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrodes 3agold 3asingle-stranded DNA 0aPotentiometric biosensor 0aCatalytic hairpin assembly 0aMicroRNA-21 0aTarget recycling 0aSurface charge density 0aIgA-nephropathy1 aTang, Dianping0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 140 p.9-16dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2018.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245017700181500001400358520134800372592002801720650002701748650001901775650002401794650001301818650001501831650001101846650001901857650002201876650001401898650001001912651001001922700003001932700002301962700002801985700003502013700002102048700002202069700002102091773012802112856008502240852000902325655001202334IND60721706320221122221208.0201224e20201221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072170632DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms81220492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArrieta-Gisasola, Ainhoa 10aGenotyping Study of Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- Monophasic Variant of Serovar Typhimurium and Characterization of the Second-Phase Flagellar Deletion by Whole Genome Sequencing  aNAL-light  aAfter Salmonella Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium, S. 4,[5],12:i:- is the most reported serovar in human clinical cases. During the past 20 years, many tools have been used for its typing and second-phase flagellar deletion characterization. Currently, whole genome sequencing (WGS) and different bioinformatic programs have shown the potential to be more accurate than earlier tools. To assess this potential, we analyzed by WGS and in silico typing a selection of 42 isolates of S. 4,[5],12:i:- and S. Typhimurium with different in vitro characteristics. Comparative analysis showed that SeqSero2 does not differentiate fljB-positive S. 4,[5],12:i:- strains from those of serovar Typhimurium. Our results proved that the strains selected for this work were non-clonal S. 4,[5],12:i:- strains circulating in Spain. Using WGS data, we identified 13 different deletion types of the second-phase flagellar genomic region. Most of the deletions were generated by IS26 insertions, showing orientation-dependent conserved deletion ends. In addition, we detected S. 4,[5],12:i:- strains of the American clonal line that would give rise to the Southern European clone in Spain. Our results suggest that new S. 4,[5],12:i:- strains are continuously emerging from different S. Typhimurium strains via different genetic events, at least in swine products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3abioinformatics 3acomputer simulation 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3ahumans 3amicroorganisms 3asequence analysis 3aserotypes 3aswine 3aSpain1 aAtxaerandio-Landa, Aitor 1 aGarrido, Victoria 1 aGrilló, María  Jesús1 aMartínez-Ballesteros, Ilargi 1 aLaorden, Lorena 1 aGaraizar, Javier 1 aBikandi, Joseba 0 tMicroorganisms.g2020 Dec. 21, v. 8, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms81220493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010200169300001600271520188800287592002802175650001902203650001502222650002902237650000902266650001502275650001102290650001502301650001102316650002002327650001102347650000902358650002102367650000902388653001102397653001202408653001302420653002102433653001602454700002102470700002002491700001902511700006002530773008902590856008402679852000902763655001202772IND60583035720221122072851.0171008e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058303572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2016.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeir, Scott M.10aEnvironmental levels of Zn do not protect embryos from Cu toxicity in three species of amphibians  ap. 161-168.  aContaminants often occur as mixtures in the environment, but investigations into toxicity usually employ a single chemical. Metal contaminant mixtures from anthropogenic activities such as mining and coal combustion energy are widespread, yet relatively little research has been performed on effects of these mixtures on amphibians. Considering that amphibians tend to be highly sensitive to copper (Cu) and that metal contaminants often occur as mixtures in the environment, it is important to understand the interactive effects that may result from multiple metals. Interactive effects of Cu and zinc (Zn) on amphibians have been reported as antagonistic and, conversely, synergistic. The goal of our study was to investigate the role of Zn in Cu toxicity to amphibians throughout the embryonic developmental period. We also considered maternal effects and population differences by collecting multiple egg masses from contaminated and reference areas for use in four experiments across three species. We performed acute toxicity experiments with Cu concentrations that cause toxicity (10–200 μg/L) in the absence of other contaminants combined with sublethal concentrations of Zn (100 and 1000 μg/L). Our results suggest very few effects of Zn on Cu toxicity at these concentrations of Zn. As has been previously reported, we found that maternal effects and population history had significant influence on Cu toxicity. The explanation for a lack of interaction between Cu and Zn in this experiment is unknown but may be due to the use of sublethal Zn concentrations when previous experiments have used Zn concentrations associated with acute toxicity. Understanding the inconsistency of amphibian Cu/Zn mixture toxicity studies is an important research direction in order to create generalities that can be used to understand risk of contaminant mixtures in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute toxicity 3aamphibians 3aanthropogenic activities 3acoal 3acombustion 3acopper 3aegg masses 3aenergy 3amaternal effect 3amining 3arisk 3atoxicity testing 3azinc 0aMetals 0aAnurans 0aMixtures 0aMaternal effects 0aPopulations1 aFlynn, R.

Herein, we report a facile self-born method for creating droplets in supramolecular gels to mediate the material’s functions. This method is based on the amplification of the defects of polymer matrices generated in curing by swelling-driving reconfiguration of supramolecular polymer networks. The system of poly(urea-co-polydimethylsiloxane) that can cross-link via hydrogen-bond interaction is used to demonstrate our concept. The elastomer matrices are prepared via a casting method and exhibit a heterogeneous structure with both strong- and weak-cross-linking domains. When these materials are swelled in solvents, solvent molecules concentrate in the weak-cross-linking domains to nucleate. With the reconfiguration of the matrices, the nuclei grow into pure droplets, leading to the formation of droplet-embedded structures. This method is applicable to different material systems. We also show that obtained coatings with such droplet-embedded structures exhibit various interesting properties including self-replenishment of the surface liquid, mechanoresponsiveness, and self-healing ability. Moreover, after the droplets are consumed, this method can be used to regenerate the droplet-embedded structure for refunctionalizing the materials. Therefore, we envision its applications in preparation of many useful polymer composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3adroplets 3agels 3ahydrogen bonding 3aliquids 3apolymers 3asolvents 0adynamic polymer networks 0adroplet self-born 0aregeneration 0afunctional surface 0areconfiguration1 aYang, Li1 aWang, Hong1 aDong, Shihua1 aChen, Longquan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6785-59141 aLi, Juntang1 aCui, Jiaxi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2550-979X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Aug. 10, v. 12, no. 35 p.39657-39664dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c112113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005500140245011600195500002000311520135300331592002801684596005401712650002701766650000801793650001001801650001601811650002301827650001601850650001901866650001601885650001001901650004401911650003401955650001001989650001801999700005802017700001802075773014302093856007502236852000902311655001202320IND60766689020221119212010.0220209e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076668902DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.162172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yixin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5437-409710aEffect of different drying time on physicochemical properties of black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus) by hot air  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe dried black carp was studied based on moisture content, color, aerobic plate count (APC), total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB‐N), peroxide value (POV), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), fatty acids, free amino acids, and nucleotides to explore the physicochemical properties changes. After drying for 12 hr, moisture content dropped to 42.53% and color changed obviously. L* value decreased and a* and b* values increased. APC and TVB‐N results indicated fillets had high food safety. POV and TBA both were on the rise in fillets, reaching the maximum values of 0.08 mg/100 g and 2.33 mg MDA/kg, respectively. Monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids were oxidized and decomposed, which led to the increase of saturated fatty acids absolute content. From the results of equivalent umami concentration, fillets reached the maximum value of 9.04 g MSG/100 g. The longer the drying time, the worse the taste quality in products.

Equilibrium solubility studies indicated the choice of Maisine 35-1 and Capryol 90 as lipids, and of Labrasol and Tween 80 as emulgents for formulating the LCT and MCT systems, respectively. Ternary phase diagrams were constructed to select the areas of nanoemulsion, and the amounts of lipid (X₁) and emulgent (X₂) as the critical factor variables. The SNEDDS were systematically optimized using 3² central composite design and the optimized formulations located using overlay plot. TEM studies on reconstituted SNEDDS demonstrated uniform shape and size of globules. The nanometer size range and high negative values of zeta potential depicted non-coalescent nature of the optimized SNEDDS. Thermodynamic studies, cloud point determination and accelerated stability studies ascertained the stability of optimized formulations. In situ perfusion (SPIP) studies in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats construed remarkable enhancement in the absorptivity and permeability parameters of SNEDDS vis-à-vis the conventional marketed product. In vivo pharmacodynamic studies in SD rats indicated significantly superior modification in plasma lipid levels of optimized SNEDDS vis-à-vis marketed product, inclusion complex and pure drug. The studies, therefore, indicate the successful formulation development of self-nanoemulsifying systems with distinctly improved bioavailability potential of ezetimibe.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3ablood lipids 3acolloids 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3along chain triacylglycerols 3amedium chain triacylglycerols 3ananoemulsions 3apermeability 3apolysorbates 3arats 3asolubility 3athermodynamics 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azeta potential1 aKatare, O.P.1 aSingh, Bhupinder0 tColloids and surfaces.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 100 p.50-61dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2012.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245013900164300002000303500001900323520094500342592002801287650003701315650001301352650002501365650002301390650001101413650001601424650002201440700001701462700005801479700001901537700005801556700005901614700006301673773013901736856008101875852000901956655001201965IND60711556420221121054352.0210219e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071155642DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c050372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoi, Federico10aGrowth Mechanism and Thermal Stability of a MoS₂–Graphene Interface: A High-Resolution Core-Level Photoelectron Spectroscopy Study  ap. 20889-20897.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe investigated the epitaxial growth of single-layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) on graphene/Ir(111), aiming to understand its steps and mechanism and verify the stability of the heterostructure. By means of high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we have revealed that accurate temperature control is crucial in allowing the formation and avoiding the degradation of single-layer MoS₂ on graphene. We observed that keeping the substrate temperature T>800 K during the growth promotes efficient sulfur intercalation under graphene and the dissolution of sulfur in the Ir bulk, two processes that have been targeted as ones mainly responsible for irreversible degradation of the MoS₂ single layer on graphene. We believe that these results could be instrumental in understanding and improving the epitaxial growth protocols for the growth of heterostructures combining epitaxial graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3agraphene 3amolybdenum disulfide 3aphysical chemistry 3asulfur 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aSbuelz, Luca1 aLacovig, Paolo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7001-79301 aLizzit, Daniel1 aBignardi, Luca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9846-91001 aLizzit, Silvano1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1620-72281 aBaraldi, Alessandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5690-96680 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 124, no. 38 p.20889-20897dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c050373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013700170300001600307520116300323592002801486650001701514650001101531650002301542650002301565650001701588650001201605650001901617650002701636650001201663650000901675700002701684700002101711700001601732700001401748700001501762700001801777700001701795700001401812700001401826700002501840700001501865700001701880700001401897700002301911700001801934700001601952700002401968700001901992700002302011700002002034773009302054856008102147852000902228655001202237IND60573814520221117213841.0170725e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057381452DNAL7 a10.1007/s12041-016-0711-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKUMAR, V.

Two major BB resistance genes, Xa21 and Xa33 and a major blast resistance gene, Pi2 were transferred to RPHR-1005 as two individual crosses. Foreground selection for Xa21, Xa33, Pi2, Rf3 and Rf4 was done by using gene-specific functional markers, while 59 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers polymorphic between the donors and recipient parents were used to select the best plant possessing target resistance genes at each backcross generation. Backcrossing was continued till BC ₂ F ₂ and a promising homozygous backcross derived line possessing Xa21 + Pi2 and another possessing Xa33 were intercrossed to stack the target resistance genes into the genetic background of RPHR-1005. At ICF ₄, 10 promising lines possessing three resistance genes in homozygous condition along with fine-grain type, complete fertility restoration, better panicle exertion and taller plant type (compared to RPHR-1005) were identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3abackcrossing 3ablight 3agenetic background 3agenetic resistance 3ahomozygosity 3ahybrids 3ainflorescences 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparents 3arice1 aBALACHIRANJEEVI, C.

The cyclodehydrohalogenation of 3-chloro-1,2-propanediol (3-MCH) to glycidol (GLD) was chosen as the representative of the study. The activity, selectivity, and operation stability of the developed composite catalysts versus their material properties were studied through the establishment of a suitable synthesis, characterization, and performance testing platform. An X-ray diffractometer, a scanning electron microscope, a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller N₂ adsorption analyzer, a chemisorption analyzer, and an inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometer were used complementarily for the characterization of catalyst materials. The results show that we can successfully synthesize composite solid-based catalysts with adjustable chemical and physical properties, including surface basicity. The liquid–solid reaction system is useful for the mechanistic understanding of the cyclodehydrohalogenation of 3-MCH catalyzed by the solid-based catalysts, especially the byproduct generation paths and the catalyst deactivation by surface poisoning. The results show that the conversion rate of cyclodehydrohalogenation of 3-MCH to GLD was proportional to the amount of total basic sites on the catalyst, and the selectivity to GLD was proportional to the medium basicity strength of the catalyst. The fundamental understanding obtained in this study provides valuable design principles for composite solid-based catalysts for a wide variety of dehydrohalogenation reactions.  aPublisher supplied data  aMOSTc, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwandhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004663  aMOSTc, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwandhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004663 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3abyproducts 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aepoxides 3aglycidol 3aprocess design 3aspectrometers1 aChen, Yu-Fan1 aTsai, Yi-Ta1 aHuang, Chien-Fu1 aPan, Yung-Tin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7735-673X1 aTsai, De-Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3151-10760 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 July 05, v. 61, no. 28 p.9970-9980dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c010643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03401naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245015300212300001800365520163300383592002802016650003502044650001602079650001802095650001802113650001802131650001502149650001102164650001502175650002402190650001302214650000902227650002002236650000902256651001202265653002502277653001102302653000902313653001802322653001602340653001702356700002102373700001702394700006202411773034002473856008502813852000902898655001202907IND60778172920221121052118.0220719e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077817292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2022.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKunutsor, Setor K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2625-027310aSerum copper-to-zinc ratio is associated with heart failure and improves risk prediction in middle-aged and older Caucasian men: A prospective study  ap. 1924-1935.  aSerum copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) may play a role in the development of adverse cardiovascular outcomes including heart failure (HF). Serum Cu/Zn-ratio has been shown to be a risk indicator for cardiovascular disease, but its relationship with HF has not been previously investigated. We aimed to assess the association between Cu/Zn-ratio and incident HF risk using a prospective cohort study. Study participants were recruited in eastern Finland with baseline examinations carried out between March 1998 and December 2001. Serum levels of Cu and Zn were measured using atomic absorption spectrometry in 1866 men aged 42–61 years without a history of HF at baseline. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for incident HF. During 26.5 years median follow-up, 365 HF cases occurred. Restricted cubic splines suggested linear relationships of serum Cu/Zn-ratio, Cu and Zn with HF risk. A unit increase in Cu/Zn-ratio was associated with an increased HF risk in analysis adjusted for several potential confounders including nutritional factors such as total energy intake, intake of fruits, berries and vegetables, and red meat (HR 1.63; 95% CI 1.06–2.51). The corresponding multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) for serum Cu and Zn were 2.42 (1.32–4.44) and 1.34 (0.50–3.63), respectively. Addition of Cu/Zn-ratio to a HF risk prediction model was associated with improved risk prediction. In middle-aged and older Finnish men, increased serum Cu/Zn-ratio is associated with an increased risk of HF in a linear dose-response fashion and might improve HF risk assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3ablood serum 3adose response 3aenergy intake 3aheart failure 3ametabolism 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprospective studies 3ared meat 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3azinc 3aFinland 0aCopper-to-zinc ratio 0aCopper 0aZinc 0aHeart failure 0aRisk factor 0aCohort study1 aVoutilainen, Ari1 aKurl, Sudhir1 aLaukkanen, Jari A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3738-15860 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2022 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.1924-1935dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2022.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001600156245013000172300001800302520107200320592002801392650002001420650002101440650002401461650002101485650003701506650001701543650001301560650000901573650001301582650001001595650001101605650001201616650002601628650001101654650001301665650002101678650001001699650001101709650003301720650004101753650001901794650004801813650002201861650001001883650001001893651001101903651001101914653000901925653001801934653001301952653001001965653003201975700001802007700001802025700002102043700002002064773013302084852000902217856007502226655001202301IND4471217120221119165915.0160905e20130807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447121712DNAL7 a238557132pmid7 a10.1021/jf402057s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shaun10aReduction of Carcinogenic Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Meat by Sugar-Smoking and Dietary Exposure Assessment in Taiwan  ap. 7645-7653.  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) represent an important pollutant in foods and/or the environment. This study aimed to determine the PAH contents in sugar-smoked meat by employing a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, safe (QuEChERS) method combined with a GC-MS technique and assess the dietary exposure of PAHs in Taiwan. Results showed that the longer the sugar-smoking duration, the more the total PAH formation. By sugar-smoking for 6 min, the total PAH contents generated in red meat (33.9 ± 3.1–125.5 ± 9.2 ppb) were higher than in poultry meat (19.1 ± 2.0–28.2 ± 1.2 ppb) and seafood (9.1 ± 1.4–31.8 ± 1.8 ppb), with lamb steak containing the largest amount of total PAHs. Most importantly, the highly carcinogenic benzo[a]pyrene remained undetected in all of the sugar-smoked meat samples. In addition, the cancer risk due to dietary PAH exposure based on total intake of meat in Taiwan was <2 × 10–⁷. This outcome demonstrates that sugar-smoking can be adopted to replace the traditional smoking process with wood as smoke source.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenicity 3adietary exposure 3aexposure assessment 3ameat consumption 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apoultry meat 3ared meat 3arisk 3aseafoods 3asmoke 3asteaks 2aAnimals 2aCarcinogensxanalysis 2aCattle 2aChickens 2aCookingxmethods 2aDucks 2aFishes 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aMeatxanalysis 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxanalysis. 2aSeafoodxanalysis 2aSheep 2aSwine 3aTaiwan 0aTaiwan 0aPAHs 0asugar-smoking 0aQuEChERS 0aGC-MS 0adietary exposure assessment1 aKao, Tsai Hua1 aChen, Chia Ju1 aHuang, Zhongwei,1 aChen, Bing Huei0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2013 Aug. 07, v. 61, no. 31 p.7645-7653dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf402057s3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03100naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245015000208300001600358520153200374592002801906650002101934650001201955650001901967650001201986650001901998650001202017650001902029650002202048650002502070650002602095650001402121650001902135650001502154653002102169653001702190653002902207653004102236653000802277700002502285700002502310700002102335700002302356700002102379773011602400856008102516852000902597655001202606IND60621757720221120042205.0181121e20181215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062175772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2018.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiazzese, Daniela1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1162-126X10aEffect of a co-substrate supply in a MBR treating shipboard slop: Analysis of hydrocarbon removal, biomass activity and membrane fouling tendency  ap. 178-188.  aThe paper reports the main results of an experiment carried out on a membrane bioreactor (MBR) plant designed for the treatment of shipboard slops. With a view of a co-treatment process of the slop with other wastewaters, sodium acetate, as external co-substrate, was supplied (high dosage – Period 1, low dosage – Period 2) to evaluate its effects on hydrocarbons removal. The MBR pilot plant enabled approximately 99% of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) removal during the entire experiment, confirming the robustness of the MBR technology for the treatment of slops. The chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis showed that the removal efficiency for each alkane was close to the value observed for total mixture removal (>99%) and the hydrocarbons removal was mostly due to the microorganism-mediated biodegradation. The biological contribution to TPH removal increased from approximately 85% to 98% when the co-substrate was decreased. Biomass kinetics revealed that a lower co-substrate dosage enhanced the growth of bacterial groups able to use hydrocarbons as primary substrate. A clear predominance of Microthrix Parvicella under low co-substrate dosage was observed. However, the lower co-substrate addition caused a significant worsening in the physical properties of the activated sludge, which resulted enriched in soluble exopolymers (>70%), more hydrophobic (>90%) and with small and dispersed flocs (<30 μm). Consequently, the membrane permeability reduced because of the irreversible fouling increase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aalkanes 3abiodegradation 3abiomass 3achromatography 3afouling 3ahydrophobicity 3amass spectrometry 3amembrane bioreactors 3amembrane permeability 3apetroleum 3asodium acetate 3awastewater 0aBiomass kinetics 0aCo-substrate 0aDiesel fuel hydrocarbons 0aGas chromatography/mass spectrometry 0aMBR1 aCorsino, Santo Fabio1 aTorregrossa, Michele1 aBongiorno, David1 aIndelicato, Serena1 aViviani, Gaspare0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 140 p.178-188dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2018.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01690naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005100140245011900191300002000310520035300330592002800683650001800711650001500729650002100744650002000765650002300785650002300808650002000831650001700851650001400868700001900882700001700901700001200918700001900930700001800949700002000967700001400987700002201001700001401023773013601037856007401173852000901247655001201256IND60638930320221118055612.0190501e20160830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063893032DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc04623a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiuThese authors contributed equally., Yonghui10aFully synthetic self-adjuvanting MUC1-fibroblast stimulating lipopeptide 1 conjugates as potential cancer vaccines  ap. 10886-10889.  aWe have designed and synthesized MUC1-fibroblast stimulating lipopeptide 1 conjugates as potential self-adjuvanting cancer vaccines using a linear solid phase peptide synthesis strategy.

Since sample processing, such as RNA extraction, introduces undesirable biases, it is advantageous to measure miRNA in a crude cell lysate. Here, we report on accurate miRNA quantitation in crude cell lysate by a CE-based hybridization assay termed direct quantitative analysis of multiple miRNAs (DQAMmiR). Accuracy and precision of miRNA quantitation were determined for miRNA samples in a crude cell lysate, RNA extract from the lysate, and a pure buffer. The results showed that the measurements were matrix-independent with inaccuracies of below 13% from true values and relative standard deviations of below 11% from the mean values in a miRNA concentration range of 2 orders of magnitude. We compared DQAMmiR-derived results with those obtained by a benchmark miRNA-quantitation method–quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). qRT-PCR-based measurements revealed multifold inaccuracies and relative standard deviations of up to 70% in crude cell lysate. Robustness of DQAMmiR to changes in sample matrix makes it a perfect candidate for validation and clinical use of miRNA-based disease biomarkers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3amicroRNA 3aquantitative analysis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astatistical analysis1 aStasheuski, Alexander S.1 aWegman, David W.1 aWu, Nan1 aYang, Burton B.1 aHayder, Heyam1 aPeng, Chun1 aLiu, Stanley K.1 aYousef, George M.1 aKrylov, Sergey N.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2017 Apr. 18, v. 89, no. 8 p.4743-4748dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.7b007073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245008500166300001600251520103800267592002801305650004401333650002101377650002401398650001301422650001701435650001601452650002601468650003101494650002201525650002101547650004401568650000701612650001901619650001301638650001301651650003701664700001501701700001301716773009001729856008601819852000901905655001201914IND60095683320221122033905.0141104e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009568332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2012.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXi, Juqun10aDrug-loaded chondroitin sulfate-based nanogels: Preparation and characterization  ap. 107-115.  aChondroitin sulfate-based (NMChS) nanogels synthesized by inverse microemulsion polymerization method for drug delivery were reported.

The results showed that the size of NMChS nanogels could be controlled in the range of 145–340nm by changing the degree of maleoyl substitution of chondroitin sulfate, and these nanogels were responsive to pH changes, which exhibited extended stability in aqueous media and low cytotoxicity in vitro by MTT assays. When these nanogels were loaded with doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX·HCl), a cytotoxic drug for cancer treatment, the high loading ability and the pH triggered-release of drug were obtained due to the electrostatic interactions between drug and matrix, and the pore size of the polymer network.

White prosperity. The vase life of flower spikes significantly increased and fresh weight retained for longer duration by CaCl₂ (50 mM) treatment over control (distilled water). Calcium treatment maintained higher level of soluble proteins by decreasing protease activity. The expression of senescence associated genes viz., cysteine protease (GgCyP1), ethylene response sensor 1a (GgERS1a) and ethylene response sensor 1b (GgERS1b) was down regulated by calcium treatment during the course of flower development. The expression of above genes increased at initial stage and decreased at later stages in both control and treated spikes and the reduction was more prominent in calcium treated spikes over control. The expression of defender against apoptotic death (GgDAD1) gene was up-regulated by calcium treatment during the course of flower development. On the other hand, the expression of DAD1 genes increased gradually from I to IV stages and decreased at V stage in both control and treated spikes but the level of expression was higher under Ca treatment. The study suggests that 50 mM calcium treatment may enhance vase life or delay the senescence in gladiolus through increase in soluble proteins, decrease in protease activity, and down regulation of CyP1, ERS1a, ERS1b and up-regulation of DAD1 genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGladiolus 3aapoptosis 3acalcium 3acysteine proteinases 3aenzyme activity 3aethylene 3aflowering 3aflowers 3agenes 3avase life 0agene expression 0aprotease 0aprotein1 aVasanthan, B.1 aArora, Ajay0 tIndian journal of plant physiology.g2012 Jan., v. 17, no. 1 p.28-36dIndian Society for Plant PhysiologywJournal:1943x0974-02527nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245014800173300001600321520137100337592002801708650002301736650002001759650001201779650001301791650002301804650000901827650001501836650000901851650001001860650001501870650001101885650002101896650001401917650001301931650001301944650001301957653002301970653002401993653001402017653001802031653001102049653001302060700001902073700002102092773008902113856008402202852000902286655001202295IND60583036220221122073105.0171008e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058303622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2016.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlewett, Tamzin A.10aSalinity-dependent nickel accumulation and effects on respiration, ion regulation and oxidative stress in the galaxiid fish, Galaxias maculatus  ap. 132-141.  aInanga (Galaxias maculatus) are a euryhaline and amphidromous Southern hemisphere fish species inhabiting waters highly contaminated in trace elements such as nickel (Ni). Ni is known to exert its toxic effects on aquatic biota via three key mechanisms: inhibition of respiration, impaired ion regulation, and stimulation of oxidative stress. Inanga acclimated to freshwater (FW), 50% seawater (SW) or 100% SW were exposed to 0, 150 or 2000 μg Ni L−1, and tissue Ni accumulation, metabolic rate, ion regulation (tissue ions, calcium (Ca) ion influx), and oxidative stress (catalase activity, protein carbonylation) were measured after 96 h. Ni accumulation increased with Ni exposure concentration in gill, gut and remaining body, but not in liver. Only in the gill was Ni accumulation affected by exposure salinity, with lower branchial Ni burdens in 100% and 50% SW inanga, relative to FW fish. There were no Ni-dependent effects on respiration, or Ca influx, and the only Ni-dependent effect on tissue ion content was on gill potassium. Catalase activity and protein carbonylation were affected by Ni, primarily in FW, but only at 150 μg Ni L−1. Salinity therefore offsets the effects of Ni, despite minimal changes in Ni bioavailability. These data suggest only minor effects of Ni in inanga, even at highly elevated environmental Ni concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGalaxias maculatus 3abioavailability 3acalcium 3acatalase 3aeuryhaline species 3afish 3afreshwater 3aions 3aliver 3ametabolism 3anickel 3aoxidative stress 3apotassium 3asalinity 3aseawater 3atoxicity 0aAcid-mine drainage 0aBiotic ligand model 0aEstuaries 0aGalaxiid fish 0aNickel 0aSalinity1 aWood, Chris M.1 aGlover, Chris N.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2016 July, v. 214 p.132-141dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01516naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012900165300001600294520060300310592002800913650001600941650001100957650002200968650002200990700002401012773011101036856008201147852000901229655001201238IND60590279420221120055943.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059027942DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078170700772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKochkin, B.T.10aEvaluating Long-Term Evolution of Radionuclide Migration Conditions from a Repository at the Yenisei Site (Krasnoyarsk Krai)  ap. 931-939.  aThe article considers the procedure aimed to identify and select the factors, events, and processes that can have an effect on the long-term safety of radioactive waste repository to be constructed at The Yenisei Site (Krasnoyarsk krai).

Juvenile European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) were caught at 11 locations in the southern North Sea and eastern English Channel. Stomach fullness varied ontogenetically in time and space. Food uptake seemed to be slightly limited for the smallest plaice individuals up to a size of 20 to 30 mm. Furthermore, strong homogeneity for microbiome and prey item composition prevailed. Little seasonal, annual and regional (on-offshore/depth) variation was observed in prey item composition. Brown shrimp Crangon crangon made up >70% of the reads in all stomachs, length classes, regions, seasons and years. Offshore samples differentiated with a distinct lack of β-Proteobacteria in the gut microbiome. Based on a visual similarity network analysis, there was no observable correlation between prey item and microbiome composition, indicating that the microbiome composition wasn't driven by diet, but might be determined by the benthic bacterial community. DNA metabarcoding yields clear insights in the prey and microbiome composition of plaice, even for seemingly empty stomachs, and should therefore be considered for future dietary and microbiome studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrangon crangon 3aDNA barcoding 3aPleuronectes platessa 3abacterial communities 3abeta-Proteobacteria 3adiet 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ajuveniles 3amicrobiome 3ashrimp 3astomach 3atemporal variation 3aEnglish Channel 3aNorth Sea 0aGut bacteria 0aJuvenile flatfish 0aMetabarcoding 0aStomach content analysis 0aSouthern North Sea 0aTrophic ecology1 aMaes, Gregory E.1 aDelerue-Ricard, Sophie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9620-73421 aVanden Bavière, Andreas1 aHostens, Kris1 aVolckaert, Filip A.M.0 tJournal of sea research.g2019 Feb., v. 144 p.67-77dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12050x1385-11017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2018.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02063naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245015200174300001600326520077300342592002801115650002001143650001201163650001601175650001501191650001701206650002601223653002601249653002601275653001601301653002901317653003101346700002201377700002301399700002201422700001801444773010701462856008701569852000901656655001201665IND60536631420221118230731.0190409e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053663142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2015.05.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValentino, Frank,10aFate of β-hexachlorocyclohexane in the mixed microbial cultures (MMCs) three-stage polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) production process from cheese whey  ap. 304-311.  aThis work aimed to study the fate and effect of β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH) during several steps of PHA production and purification, by using an artificially contaminated cheese whey (CW) as the feedstock. Most of β-HCH (around 90%) was adsorbed on CW solids and it was removed after the acidogenic fermentation step, when residual CW solids are separated along with anaerobic biomass from the liquid-phase. Purification steps also contributed strongly to the removal of residual β-HCH; overall, the PHA production process removed about 99.9% of initial β-HCH content. Moreover, it has been shown that β-HCH has neither detrimental effect on acidogenic fermentation nor on PHA accumulation, that were performed by using unacclimated mixed microbial cultures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHCH (pesticide) 3abiomass 3acheese whey 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 0aHexachlorocyclohexane 0aPolyhydroxyalkanoates 0aCheese whey 0aMixed microbial cultures 0aDecontamination efficiency1 aRiccardi, Carmela1 aCampanari, Sabrina1 aPomata, Donatella1 aMajone, Mauro0 tBioresource technology.g2015 Sept., v. 192 p.304-311dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.05.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010600170300001400276520104800290592002801338650001501366650001101381650002001392650001301412650002301425650001801448650001501466650001201481650001501493650003101508650003301539650001301572650001701585650001101602700001901613773008801632856008601720852000901806655001201815IND60095683620221122034454.0141104e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009568362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2012.04.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbe, Hiroyuki10aComparison of physico-chemical characteristics among three pharmaceutical spherical carbon adsorbents  ap. 90-94.  aIn this study, various physicochemical characteristics were evaluated for three pharmaceutical spherical carbon adsorbents, Kremezin as a brand product and its generics; Merckmezin and Spherical Carbon Adsorbent “Mylan”. Scanning electron microscopic observations, measurements of specific surface area, particle sizes, and pore volume distributions by mercury intrusion porosimetry, and dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) analysis were conducted. Compared to Kremezin, Merckmezin is dented with a small pore-rich structure; pores of less than 10nm make up 43% (Kremezin) and 68% (Merckmezin) of total pore volume. On the other hand, Spherical Carbon Adsorbent “Mylan” is porous with macropores. The results of fractal dimension analysis of micropores suggested that the complexity of the internal pore structure is Merckmezin>Kremezin≫Spherical Carbon Adsorbent “Mylan”.

GLIC is activated by protons with a pH₅₀ between 5 and 6, implicating a histidine residue in its activation, but although a histidine residue (His11′) in the pore-forming α-helix (M2) is known to be involved in gating, the His in the extracellular domain (ECD), His127, is not. Nevertheless, there is evidence from a GLIC–glycine chimera for a proton sensitive residue or region in the GLIC extracellular domain. Here we create a novel chimeric receptor with the ECD of GLIC and the transmembrane domain of ELIC (GELIC). Expression of this receptor in oocytes reveals proton activation, although the pH₅₀ (6.7) differs from that of GLIC (5.4). Exploration of protonatable residues in the ECD reveals that the pKₐs of five Asp residues (31, 49, 91, 136, and 178) differ between the open and closed states of GLIC. Substitution of these residues with Ala or Asn shows somewhat similar effects for GLIC and GELIC in Asp91 mutants, but different effects for the others. Overall, the data suggest that protonation of residues in the ECD is a requirement for channel opening in GELIC but plays only a minor role in GLIC, where gating may be largely driven via protonation of the His residue in its pore.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGloeobacter 3ahistidine 3aion channels 3amutants 3aoocytes 3aprotons 3areceptors1 aPrice, Kerry L.1 aLummis, Sarah C.

The interaction between soil-borne pathogens and plant roots before invasion is a focus of interest for revealing host and nonhost resistance mechanisms to soil-borne pathogens. In the present study, soybean cvs. Sloan (susceptible), Williams 82 (resistant) and nonhost common bean cv. Yidianhong were used to determine the effect of roots, root exudates, and isoflavones, amino acids, sugars, and citric acid from the root exudates on the pre-infection behavior (taxis, encystment and cyst germination) of zoospores of P. sojae. The elongation zone of roots of both host soybeans attracted significantly more zoospores than did that of the nonhost bean, and that of the susceptible cultivar attracted significantly more zoospores than did that of the resistant cultivar. Similarly, the host soybean root exudates attracted zoospores and promoted zoospore encystment and cyst germination, but nonhost root exudates had no effect on zoospores. Thus, P. sojae apparently selects its host depending on the root exudates. Of the 26 total components detected from root exudates, the exudates from susceptible and resistant soybeans and nonhost common bean had 12, 17, and 25 components respectively. The differences between the host and nonhost were mainly in the type and concentration of amino acids. Most components were significant chemoattractants of P. sojae zoospores. However, when these attractants were mixed at their relative concentrations in the root exudates, the chemoattraction was significantly reduced compared to that of the sum of each components, and the reduction from strongest to weakest was nonhost common bean, resistant and susceptible soybeans, indicating that these components in the root exudates interact with each other, and the intensity of the interaction relates to the type and concentration of the components. This phenomenon is because some components may share the same receptor, thus causing an obstructive effect. This result may also be a reason that common bean is a nonhost of P. sojae. In addition, the relative local concentrations of citric acid in the root exudates of both nonhost cv. Yidianhong and resistant cv. Williams 82 were repellent to zoospores of P. sojae. Root exudates of susceptible cv. Sloan amended with two concentrations of citric acids especially reduced zoospore chemoattraction, indicating that citric acid in the root exudates also plays an important role in host and nonhost resistance to P. sojae.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant No. 31670444cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  aGrant No. 31370449cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aPhytophthora sojae 3aamino acids 3aattractants 3abeans 3achemoattractants 3achemotaxis 3acitric acid 3acultivars 3aencystment 3agermination 3aisoflavones 3aresistance mechanisms 3aroot exudates 3aroots 3asoil-borne diseases 3asoybeans 3astem rot 3asugars 3azoospores1 aXu, Ying,1 aSong, Guangmei1 aGao, Xinying1 aZhao, Yuqi1 aJia, Mengzhen1 aChen, Yufei1 aSuo, Bing1 aChen, Qiuming1 aWu, Di1 aWu, Wenxu1 aWen, Jingzhi0 tJournal of general plant pathology.g2019 May, v. 85, no. 3 p.201-210dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3871472x1345-26307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10327-019-00839-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245007100169300002000240500001900260520154100279592002801820650001301848650002901861650002301890650001901913650001001932650001901942650002001961650002401981650001102005650001502016650001802031650001202049650001302061650001502074653003402089653004302123653003102166653002802197700006102225700001802286700001302304700002302317700006202340700005802402700006102460700003102521773014202552856007802694852000902772655001202781IND60715537720210831000000.0201028e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071553772DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c115022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClainche, Tristan Le10aMechano-Bactericidal Titanium Surfaces for Bone Tissue Engineering  ap. 48272-48283.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDespite advances in the development of bone substitutes and strict aseptic procedures, the majority of failures in bone grafting surgery are related to nosocomial infections. Development of biomaterials combining both osteogenic and antibiotic activity is, therefore, a crucial public health issue. Herein, two types of intrinsically bactericidal titanium supports were fabricated by using commercially scalable techniques: plasma etching or hydrothermal treatment, which display two separate mechanisms of mechano-bactericidal action. Hydrothermal etching produces a randomly nanostructured surface with sharp nanosheet protrusions killing bacteria via cutting of the cell membrane, whereas plasma etching of titanium produces a microscale two-tier hierarchical topography that both reduce bacterial attachment and rupture those bacteria that encounter the surface. The adhesion, growth, and proliferation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) on the two mechano-bactericidal topographies were assessed. Both types of supports allowed the growth and proliferation of the hASCs in the same manner and cells retained their stemness and osteogenic potential. Furthermore, these supports induced osteogenic differentiation of hASCs without the need of differentiation factors, demonstrating their osteoinductive properties. This study proves that these innovative mechano-bactericidal titanium surfaces with both regenerative and bactericidal properties are a promising solution to improve the success rate of reconstructive surgery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aantibacterial properties 3abacterial adhesion 3abone formation 3abones 3acell membranes 3across infection 3ahot water treatment 3ahumans 3ananosheets 3apublic health 3asurgery 3atitanium 3atopography 0amechano-bactericidal surfaces 0aadipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells 0aosteogenic differentiation 0ananostructured surfaces1 aLinklater, Denver1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1433-36851 aWong, Sherman1 aLe, Phuc1 aJuodkazis, Saulius1 aGuével, Xavier Le1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3634-77621 aColl, Jean-Luc1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2453-35521 aIvanova, Elena P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5509-80711 aMartel-Frachet, Véronique0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 12, no. 43 p.48272-48283dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c115023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245010500167520179500272592002802067650001202095650002202107650001802129650001202147650002202159650002302181650002102204650002402225650001602249653002402265653003702289653002902326653004702355653004602402700001702448700001602465700001502481700001702496700001602513773011602529856008702645852000902732655001202741IND60779303620221120073328.0220906e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077930362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1158312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Sihang12aA hybrid cooling method with low energy consumption for lithium-ion battery under extreme conditions  aHybrid battery thermal management system (BTMS) has received more and more attention because of its high efficiency. However, many factors significantly affect the energy consumption and performance of hybrid BTMS, so it is urgent to propose a reasonable cooling method and a multi-objective optimization method with low computational load. In this work, a hybrid cooling method combing passive cooling and active cooling is proposed, and the effects of pump start-up time, inlet temperature and flow rate on the thermal and electrical performance of the battery module are studied by conceptual experiment. Thermal-electrical performance coefficient (TEP) and energy utilization efficiency coefficient (EUE), two dimensionless numbers derived from prior information about the objective parameters, are proposed to evaluate and optimize the active cooling strategy. The experimental results show that the passive cooling strategy can meet the heat dissipation requirements of the battery module in low rate conditions, and even in high-temperature environments. The liquid cooling strategy needs to be adopted only under extreme condition (3C discharging at 35℃), and starting the pump prematurely not only causes greater energy consumption, but also reduces TEP due to uneven heat dissipation. According to the deterioration mechanism of temperature difference (ΔT), it is considered that the best time to start the pump is when the maximum temperature (Tₘₐₓ) of the battery module reaches the upper limit of the phase transition temperature. Based on this view, the optimized cooling strategy only uses 6.51% of energy consumption to control the temperature characteristics of the battery module within the safe range, and ensure that the discharge capacity is higher than 98.5%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3aenergy conversion 3aheat transfer 3aliquids 3alithium batteries 3amanagement systems 3aphase transition 3asystem optimization 3atemperature 0aLithium ion battery 0aHybrid thermal management system 0aDelayed cooling strategy 0aThermal-electrical performance coefficient 0aEnergy utilization efficiency coefficient1 aWang, Shijie1 aMa, Chuyuan1 aLi, Siyang1 aLiu, Xiaojie1 aZhang, Ying0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 266 p.115831-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1158313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245009300128300001600221500001500237520181400252592002802066650001602094650001702110650001402127650002102141650002302162650002602185650001002211650001402221650002202235650001602257650001402273650001902287650001602306650001002322650002002332653002002352653001402372653000802386653002602394700001502420700001702435700002302452700001302475700001402488700001802502773011602520852000902636655001202645IND60466407520221118023151.0151124e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046640752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLacoste, C.10aIncreased Susceptibility to Aphids of Flowering Wheat Plants Exposed to Low Temperatures  ap. 610-618.  a2019-12-06  aFrost is known to directly affect flowering wheat plants (Triticum aestivum L.) and lead to reduced grain yield. Additionally, it may increase wheat susceptibility to economically important pests, such as aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae). Wheat plants at flowering stage were exposed to one of the three temperature treatments: ambient (11–12°C), 0°C, and -3°C for 60 min. Preference (3-choice) and performance (no-choice) bioassays with aphids (Rhopalosiphum padi L.) were conducted 1, 3, 6, and 12 d after temperature treatments to assess effects of temperature-induced stress over time. As an initial feasibility study of using remote sensing technologies to detect frost-induced stress in flowering wheat plants, hyperspectral imaging data were acquired from wheat plants used in preference bioassays. Element analysis of wheat plants was included to determine the effect of temperature-induced stress on the nutritional composition of flowering wheat plants. The results from this study support the following cause-effect scenario: a 60-min exposure to low temperatures caused a significant decrease in potassium and copper content of wheat plants 6 d after temperature exposure, and it coincided with a marked increase in preference by aphids of wheat plants. The preference exhibited by aphids correlated positively with performance of aphids, so the preference—performance hypothesis was confirmed and possibly driven by potassium and copper content of wheat plants. In addition, we demonstrated that hyperspectral imaging data can be used to detect frost-induced susceptibility to aphid infestation in flowering wheat plants. These findings justify further research into airborne remote sensing of frost-induced stress and the possible secondary effects on crop susceptibility to arthropod pests.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3amalnutrition 3aflowering 3anutrient content 3aRhopalosiphum padi 3ahyperspectral imagery 3awheat 3abioassays 3aTriticum aestivum 3agrain yield 3apotassium 3aremote sensing 3atemperature 3afrost 3aarthropod pests 0aplant nutrition 0aHemiptera 0aIPM 0ahyperspectral imaging1 aNansen, C.1 aThompson, S.1 aMoir-Barnetson, L.1 aMian, A.1 aMcNee, M.1 aFlower, K.

We compare results from assessments of floating plastics in the South Pacific Ocean with accumulated beach plastics from Henderson Island. We also compare accumulated plastic mass on Henderson during 2015 and 2019 and investigate the presence of nanoplastics. There were differences between the size classes of beach and pelagic plastics, and an increase in microplastics (0.33–5 mm) on the beach between 2015 and 2019. Micro- and nanoplastics were found at all sites (mean ± SE: 1960 ± 356 pieces/kg dw). Across the whole beach this translates to >4 billion plastic particles in the upper 5 cm. This is concerning, particularly given Henderson is uninhabited and distant from urban centres (~2350 km from Pape'ete, French Polynesia). The vast number of small particles on Henderson may make nearshore filter feeders susceptible to ingestion and subsequent detrimental impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aingestion 3amarine pollution 3ananoplastics 3aFrench Polynesia 3aPacific Ocean 0aAnthropogenic debris 0aHenderson Island 0aMarine debris 0aMicroplastic 0aNanoparticle 0aPlastic pollution1 aLavers, Jennifer L.1 aArcher-Rand, Simeon1 aBond, Alexander L.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2021 June, v. 167 p.112366-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1123663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245014000171520137900311592002801690650002201718650002201740650001801762650003001780650001401810650001101824650001801835650002201853650002501875650003001900650001901930650001501949650002001964650002601984650001402010650001502024650001302039651001402052653001402066653002002080653002602100653002502126700002502151700002502176700003102201700002702232773011602259856008702375852000902462655001202471IND60779303720221120090815.0220906e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077930372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1158322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWahyono, Yoyon10aEvaluating the environmental impacts of the multi-feedstock biodiesel production process in Indonesia using life cycle assessment (LCA)  aBiodiesel production from multiple feedstocks, which is currently being carried out on a laboratory scale, has the potential to be scaled up on an industrial scale in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to study the environmental impact of multi-feedstock biodiesel production. This study assesses the environmental performance of the simulated production of multi-feedstock biodiesel and compares it to palm oil biodiesel production in Indonesia. Generally, the life cycle of multi-feedstock biodiesel production has a higher environmental impact at the plantation stage than palm oil biodiesel production. The land-use change of scrubland into plantations of multiple crops (soybean, canola, sunflower, oil palm) showed a contribution of 9.89 tCO₂ GHG emissions per tonne of biodiesel produced whereas as that into only oil palm plantation obtained a value of −3.43 tCO₂. Many of the environmental impacts such as ecotoxicity, eutrophication, acidification, and global warming are related to plantation activities, particularly due to the use of fertilisers. The cultivation of multiple crops is more detrimental to the environment than the oil palm alone because they use more fertilisers. The use of soybean, canola, and sunflower to produce multi-feedstock biodiesel is not recommended because it provides a higher environmental burden than palm oil biodiesel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3aHelianthus annuus 3aacidification 3aadministrative management 3abiodiesel 3acanola 3aecotoxicology 3aenergy conversion 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3aeutrophication 3afeedstocks 3aland use change 3alife cycle assessment 3apalm oils 3ashrublands 3asoybeans 3aIndonesia 0aBiodiesel 0aMulti-feedstock 0aLife cycle assessment 0aEnvironmental impact1 aHadiyanto, Hadiyanto1 aGheewala, Shabbir H.1 aBudihardjo, Mochamad Arief1 aAdiansyah, Joni Safaat0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 266 p.115832-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1158323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006400144245012900208300002000337500001900357520115500376592002801531650003701559650002801596650002101624650001501645650001301660650000901673650001301682650001601695653002701711653001201738653003301750653001401783653002101797653001801818700006201836700006401898773014201962856007802104852000902182655001202191IND60715537920221122151727.0201028e20201014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071553792DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c117252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGetachew, Bezawit A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6757-594710aLaser-Induced Graphene from Polyimide and Polyethersulfone Precursors as a Sensing Electrode in Anodic Stripping Voltammetry  ap. 48511-48517.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe need to reduce and eliminate exposure to the toxic contaminant lead (Pb) from drinking water calls for advances in cheap and low-footprint sensing technologies such as stripping voltammetry. This study examines the performance of laser-induced graphene (LIG) electrodes from polyimide (PI) and polyethersulfone (PES) precursors in anodic stripping voltammetry of Pb(II). Despite their similar electrochemical properties and conductivity, as characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and two-point conductivity, respectively, subtle differences in physical and chemical properties, as measured by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively, lead to PI-LIG electrodes exhibiting higher sensitivity than PES-LIG electrodes. Enhanced electrochemical activity of the PES-LIG electrodes for side reactions due to sulfur substitutions could potentially account for the difference in performance. The results of this study highlight that the starting material can heavily determine the performance of electrodes formed via laser-induced graphitization for sensing and other electrochemical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agraphene 3alead 3atoxicity 3avoltammetry 0alaser-induced graphene 0asensing 0aanodic stripping voltammetry 0apolyimide 0apolyethersulfone 0awater quality1 aBergsman, David S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0141-64171 aGrossman, Jeffrey C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1281-23590 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Oct. 14, v. 12, no. 43 p.48511-48517dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c117253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245015500164300001800319520168300337592002802020650001502048650001402063650001102077650002202088650001102110650002302121650002102144650000902165650000902174650001902183650001602202650002602218651001102244700001902255700002202274773014102296856008102437852000902518655001202527IND60573299520221120025929.0170721e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057329952DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-016-1328-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Hwa-Lung12aA spatiotemporal dengue fever early warning model accounting for nonlinear associations with hydrological factors: a Bayesian maximum entropy approach  ap. 2127-2141.  aDengue fever is identified as one of the most widespread vector-borne diseases in the world. In the last decade, high incidence of dengue fever has been observed in southern Taiwan on an annual basis. There is an urgent need to develop a dengue fever early warning model for the area. Previous studies showed that dengue fever transmission has complex space–time dynamics highly depending upon the activities of human and vectors and their interactions, as well as hydrological processes. This study developed a 1-week-ahead dengue fever warning system in southern Taiwan considering weekly-based nonlinear temporal lagged associations between dengue cases and hydrological factors across space and time by investigating the disease database during 1998–2011. The proposed model is based on an integration of distributed lag nonlinear model and spatiotemporal dependence structure under an epistemic framework of Bayesian maximum entropy method. This study identified that minimum temperature and maximum 24-h rainfall are the most significant to dengue fever incidences. Their associations to dengue fever risks are presented with respect to both hydrological measurement levels and temporal lags. A nested spatiotemporal covariance of transmissions was used to account for the disease diffusion across space and time. Results show that the proposed approach can provide early warnings of the dengue fever occurrences in both initial and peak epidemic stages in 2012, and obtain the spatiotemporal distribution of dengue fever epidemics. These features can be useful for local governmental agencies to seek more effective strategies for dengue fever prevention and control.  aPublisher supplied data 3acovariance 3adatabases 3adengue 3adisease outbreaks 3ahumans 3ahydrologic factors 3anonlinear models 3arain 3arisk 3aspace and time 3atemperature 3avector-borne diseases 3aTaiwan1 aLee, Chieh-Han1 aChien, Lung-Chang0 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2016 Dec., v. 30, no. 8 p.2127-2141dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1436-32407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-016-1328-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245009000162300001600252500001900268520147600287592002801763596005401791596005901845596005901904596008701963596007302050650002402123650002602147650002302173650001002196650002202206650001902228650001202247650001402259650001602273650002202289650001102311650001602322651001002338700001602348700005902364700001802423773014302441856008202584852000902666655001202675IND60728642020221118235011.0210223e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072864202DNAL7 a10.1007/s00484-019-01756-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hui10aVarying temperature sensitivity of bud-burst date at different temperature conditions  ap. 357-367.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe relationship between the rate of development (DR) of bud-burst and temperature may be nonlinear, which could lead to varying temperature sensitivity (TS) of budburst date under different climate conditions. In order to determine the functional form between DR/TS and temperature, we gathered twigs with flower buds of five woody plants (Malus halliana, Forsythia suspense, Crataegus pinnatifida, Prunus cerasifera F. atropurpurea, and Berberis thunbergii var. atropurpurea Chenault) in early spring of 2017 at Beijing, and placed them in six growth chambers at same daylength but different temperature conditions (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C). The proportion of bud- burst was recorded every 2 or 3 days for each species at each temperature condition. The results showed that the proportion of bud-burst followed the logistic function over time at a given temperature. Subsequently, we developed a mathematical model to simulate the proportion of bud-burst at any temperature and date. The DR and TS were parameterized using a differential method. The simulation results showed that the DR increased monotonically with the rise in temperature, but only two species could reach the maximum value at 30 °C. The TS decreased with the increase in temperature, but this effect was weak when the temperature was high enough. These findings suggested that the predicted warming in the future may result in a slowdown in the advance of spring phenology of woody plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFA0606103cNational Key R&D Program of China  a41601047cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41871032cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018070cYouth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  a2018RC101cProgram for “Kezhen” Excellent Talents in IGSNRR, CAS 3aBerberis thunbergii 3aCrataegus pinnatifida 3aForsythia suspensa 3aMalus 3aPrunus cerasifera 3abioclimatology 3aflowers 3aphenology 3aphotoperiod 3asimulation models 3aspring 3atemperature 3aChina1 aTao, Zexing1 aWang, Huanjiong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2325-01201 aGe, Quansheng0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2021 Mar., v. 65, no. 3 p.357-367dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46344x0020-71287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-019-01756-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245015600164300002000320520136000340592002801700650001901728650001001747650001101757650002801768650002201796650001701818650001101835650000901846650001801855650002201873650002201895650001701917650001101934650001901945653001601964653003501980653002502015653002002040653001902060653001902079700002002098700001702118700002002135700006002155700001602215773014102231856007802372852000902450655001202459IND60598342820221122115306.0180629e20170719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059834282DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b063532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, Roy C.

For comparison, an amine-linked analogue (nPc) was also prepared as a non-acid-cleavable counterpart. These dimeric phthalocyanines were significantly self-quenched due to the close proximity of the phthalocyanine units inside the mesopores, resulting in much weaker fluorescence emission and singlet oxygen generation, both in N,N-dimethylformamide and in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), compared with the free molecular counterparts. Under acidic conditions in PBS, the cPc-encapsulated nanosystem was activated in terms of fluorescence emission and singlet oxygen production. After internalization into human colon adenocarcinoma HT29 cells, it exhibited much higher intracellular fluorescence and photocytotoxicity compared to the nanosystem entrapped with nPc. The activation of this nanosystem was also demonstrated in tumor-bearing nude mice. The intratumoral fluorescence intensity increased gradually over 24 h, while for the nPc counterpart the fluorescence remained very weak. The results suggest that this nanosystem serves as a promising activatable nanophotosensitizing agent for photodynamic therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenocarcinoma 3acolon 3acopper 3acycloaddition reactions 3adimethylformamide 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3amice 3ananoparticles 3aoxygen production 3aphotochemotherapy 3aporous media 3asilica 3asinglet oxygen 0aactivatable 0amesoporous silica nanoparticle 0aphotodynamic therapy 0aphotosensitizer 0aphthalocyanine 0aself-quenching1 aChow, Sun Y.

To resemble the vegetation stem, two rows of vertical rods were installed on the floodplain of an asymmetrical compound channel. Two-dimensional flow velocity was measured using Particle Image Velocimetry. The results showed a decreasing trend in turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent intensity along the floodplain. At low flow depth, a significant decrease was observed in mean velocity and kinetic energy. Similar reduction was observed at the intersection of floodplain and main channel and around the stems. Under this condition, the direction of velocity vectors changed from floodplain to the main channel. However, this trend was reversed at higher flow depths. This reversal was due to the changes in momentum transfer and shear stress at the intersection of floodplain and main channel. Additionally, a numerical analysis showed that vortices are formed at the junction of the floodplain and main channel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3afloodplains 3akinetic energy 3amomentum 3aparticle image velocimetry 3ashear stress 3avegetation 3awatersheds 0aMain channel/floodplain boundary 0acompound channel 0aexperimental 0anumerical and PIV1 aKeshavarzi, Alireza1 aEmdad, Homayoun1 aJavan, Mahmood0 tInternational journal of river basin management.g2020 July 2, v. 18, no. 3 p.295-306dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12302x1814-20607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15715124.2019.16533063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02071naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011200157300001800269520088000287592002801167650002401195650001601219650001101235650001501246650001001261650002001271650001001291650001201301650002401313650001201337700002201349700002901371700002001400700002001420700002501440773012501465856007401590852000901664655001201673IND60633213320221121085918.0190319e20190318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063321332DNAL7 a10.1039/c8gc02972e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMgaya, James10aCashew nut shell: a potential bio-resource for the production of bio-sourced chemicals, materials and fuels  ap. 1186-1201.  aExploitation of agricultural waste as green starting materials to produce various valuable products is attracting the attention of academic, industrial and other practitioners.

These CFs, generated in UV-transparent AlN rod areas using an electric field, can be used as conducting paths for carrier injection from a metal to a semiconductor such as p-(Al)GaN, which allows perfect Ohmic behavior with high transmittance (>95% at 365 nm) to be obtained. In addition, conduction across AlN rods and Ohmic conduction mechanisms are investigated by analyzing AlN rods and AlN rod/p-AlGaN film interfaces. We apply these H-TCEs to three near-UV light-emitting diodes (LEDs) (385 nm LEDs with p-GaN and p-AlGaN terminated surfaces and 365 nm LED with p-AlGaN terminated surface). We confirm that the light power outputs increase by 66%, 79%, and 103%, whereas the forward voltages reduce by 5.6%, 10.2%, and 8.6% for 385 nm p-GaN terminated, 385 nm p-AlGaN terminated, and 365 nm p-AlGaN terminated LEDs with H-TCEs, respectively, compared to LEDs with reference ITOs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric field 3aelectric power 3aelectrodes 3aindium tin oxide 3alight emitting diodes 3asemiconductors 3atransmittance 0aAlN rod array 0aconducting filament 0atransparent conductive electrode 0aelectrical breakdown 0aultraviolet light-emitting diode1 aLee, Tae Ho1 aKim, Tae Geun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6211-11340 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 July 19, v. 9, no. 28 p.24357-24364dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b063623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03318naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245012900174520198400303592002802287650003002315650001402345650001602359650001702375650002202392650002502414650001102439650001602450650000902466653001902475653002302494653002002517653001602537653003502553653001702588700006602605700002502671773011602696856008702812852000902899655001202908IND60779304120221120094732.0220906e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077930412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1158362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTavallaei, Mohsen10a4E analysis and thermodynamic optimization of flaring associated gas recovery using external firing recuperative gas turbine  aAssociated gas with oil extraction is usually burning through the flaring process. This process destroys a valuable natural resource that should be either recovered or stored. The process also pollutes the environment by emitting greenhouse gasses. The current study presents a novel external firing gas turbine cycle to recover the associated gas. The external firing prevents corrosion within gas turbine components due to the corrosive nature of the associated gas. To find an optimal design of the cycle, the comprehensive 4E analysis including Energy, Exergy, Environment and Economic analysis is carried out. The sensitivity analysis is employed to investigate the influence of the key parameters such as the compressor pressure ratio and fuel cost on the evaluation criteria of the system i.e., energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, total cost and environmental impact. Moreover, the net present value and payback period criteria are applied to analyze the whole system economically. The results of the proposed system modeling show that at the base condition for fixed output electricity of 1200 kW, values of the principal parameters are as the 27.6%, 35.8%, 6553 $/kW, 269020 kg/kW, 12.3e7 $, 3.8 year for energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, total cost, environmental impact, net present value and payback period, respectively. As another activity, Multi-objective optimization using the NSGAII method is performed to achieve the optimal value of three selective objective functions as well as decision variables. Results reveal that there is a conflict between objective functions (total cost and environmental impact) and the other one i.e., exergy efficiency. It indicates that any effort to increase the system efficiency causes relatively higher costs and environmental issues. The final optimum values of the objective functions i.e. total cost, environmental impact and exergy efficiency are found to be 5864.6 $/kW, 241374.5 kg/kW and 33.4%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3acorrosion 3aelectricity 3aenergy costs 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental impact 3aexergy 3agreenhouses 3aoils 0aAssociated gas 0aFlare gas recovery 0aExternal firing 0a4E analysis 0aRecuperative gas turbine cycle 0aOptimization1 aFarzaneh-Gord, Mahmood1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2078-20811 aMoghadam, Ali Jabari0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 266 p.115836-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1158363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245015200164300001300316520132400329592002801653650002001681650001801701650002301719650001601742650002701758650002301785650001201808650002201820650002301842650002601865650001601891650001101907650001801918650001701936650001501953650001701968650001601985650002302001650002202024700001902046700001802065700002402083700001902107773011702126856008202243852000902325655001202334IND60637039320221118060009.0190414e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063703932DNAL7 a10.1007/s10725-019-00484-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCohen, Itay10aPlant growth regulators improve drought tolerance, reduce growth and evapotranspiration in deficit irrigated Zoysia japonica under field conditions  ap. 9-17.  aAs water becomes a limited and costly resource, water conservation practices in turf grass management will become a necessity. Deficit irrigation (DI) is a common agricultural practice that enables reduction of water expense with minor yield loss. Plant growth regulators (PGRs) restrict plant growth and consequently affect evapotranspiration (ET) rate, soil water depletion and plant tolerance to drought. Our studies evaluated the physiological effects of the PGRs paclobutrazol (Pac) and uniconazole (Uni) in the warm weather turf grass Zoysia japonica under DI in field conditions. Our studies demonstrated that Pac and Uni reduced plant ET rate in greenhouse and field experiments. Uni, was more potent at a low concentration (25 mg L⁻¹) than Pac, with greater effect on reducing ET rates, plant vertical growth and biomass accumulation while enhancing tissue chlorophyll content. Under field conditions, both Pac and Uni lowered ET and clipping biomass and raised chlorophyll levels at DI. Additionally, results suggested that Uni increased leaf concentration of abscisic acid (ABA). We conclude that PGR application to the Zoysia turf grass simultaneously improved the clipping management and lowered turf grass water requirement, while maintaining high leaf appearance under deficit irrigation conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZoysia japonica 3aabscisic acid 3abiomass production 3achlorophyll 3aconservation practices 3adeficit irrigation 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aevapotranspiration 3afield experimentation 3agreenhouses 3aleaves 3apaclobutrazol 3aplant growth 3asoil water 3aturf grasses 3auniconazole 3awater conservation 3awater requirement1 aNetzer, Yishai1 aSthein, Ilana1 aGilichinsky, Michal1 aTel-Or, Elisha0 tPlant growth regulation.g2019 May, v. 88, no. 1 p.9-17dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl34166x0167-69037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-019-00484-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245007300172520107500245592002801320650003001348650001501378650002001393650002201413650000901435650002201444653003001466653001601496653003901512700002201551700002501573700001501598700002501613700001801638700002201656700002401678700002101702773011601723856008701839852000901926655001201935IND60779304220221120090851.0220906e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077930422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1158372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahlawan, Hilal10aDetection and identification of faults in a District Heating Network  aDistrict Heating Networks (DHNs) are composed of numerous pipes that can be threatened by faults that affect DHN operation and management. Thus, reliable diagnostic methodologies are essential to identify DHN health state and hinder DHN malfunctioning and performance deterioration. To this purpose, a novel diagnostic approach that couples a DHN simulation model with an optimization algorithm for detecting and identifying both thermal and hydraulic faults, i.e., water leakages, anomalous heat and pressure losses, is presented in this paper. In the current paper, the novel diagnostic approach is challenged at evaluating the health state of the DHN of the campus of the University of Parma, where different faults are artificially implanted, by using a digital twin of the DHN. The faulty datasets account for both single and multiple faults, as well as different fault types and causes. The novel diagnostic approach proves to correctly detect and identify all simulated faults, by also correctly estimating their magnitude even in the most challenging scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3aenergy conversion 3aheat 3asimulation models 0aDistrict heating networks 0aDiagnostics 0aFault detection and identification1 aFerraro, Niccolò1 aGambarotta, Agostino1 aLosi, Enzo1 aManservigi, Lucrezia1 aMorini, Mirko1 aSaletti, Costanza1 aRuggero Spina, Pier1 aVenturini, Mauro0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 266 p.115837-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1158373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01194naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245010100158300001800259520024100277592002800518650001300546650002300559650003600582650001400618650001000632700001900642700002100661773012900682856007200811852000900883655001200892IND60658035920221121231646.0190816e20061031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065803592DNAL7 a10.1039/b611212a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKluser, Evelyne10aMild and rational synthesis of palladium complexes comprising C(4)-bound N-heterocyclic carbenes  ap. 4495-4497.  aOxidative addition of pyridyl-functionalised 4-iodoimidazolium salts to palladium(0) gives catalytically active complexes in which the N-heterocyclic carbene is bound to the palladium(ii) centre in a non-classical bonding mode via C(4).  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbenes 3achemical reactions 3aheterocyclic nitrogen compounds 3apalladium 3asalts1 aNeels, Antonia1 aAlbrecht, Martin0 tChemical communications.g2006 Oct. 31, , no. 43 p.4495-4497dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b611212a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01645naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245008300162300001800245520041600263592002800679650001200707650001100719650002000730650001800750650002200768650001100790650001400801650002100815650001900836650001400855700002100869700002000890700002000910700002200930700002600952700002000978700001700998773012501015856007401140852000901214655001201223IND60633213520221121065559.0190319e20190318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063321352DNAL7 a10.1039/c8gc03015d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoroshenko, Alisa10aUsing in vivo nickel to direct the pyrolysis of hyperaccumulator plant biomass  ap. 1236-1240.  aThe effects of naturally occurring nickel in hyperaccumulator plants used for phytoremediation of contaminated soils on the microwave (MW) biomass pyrolysis are described for the first time.

They have their own traditional culture, customs, language and life style. In terms of tribal population, West Bengal takes 9ᵗʰ position among the different Indian states. Total tribal population of West Bengal is 5,296,953 which is 5.79 per cent of the total population of the state. In West Bengal, Purulia is reported to be the most backward and deprived tribal populated district in West Bengal. In this district, a total of 5,40,652 people belong to tribal community which consists of 18.46 per cent of the total population of the district (2ⁿᵈ highest percentage of tribal population after that of Jalpaiguri district consists of 18.89 per cent in West Bengal) as well as the 10.52 per cent of the total ST population of West Bengal. Tribes of Purulia have no fixed and permanent income. This district has ample resource of water but fish production is not much encouraging. Purposive sampling method has been used for the present study. There are total 20 blocks in Purulia district which can be divided into 3 zones according to tribal population- High, medium and low. Then three blocks (Hura, Arsha and Para) were selected purposively from each zone. Altogether 100 tribal households were taken as sample. For the purpose of the study, an interview schedule was prepared with the help of review of literature, field work and discussion with experts of social science to achieve the objective of the study. To achieve proper inference appropriate statistical tools like correlation, percentage analysis and RBQ were used with suitable graphs, charts and diagrams. Following the modified Kuppuswamy scale it is observed that majority of the respondents (77%) fall under upper-lower socioeconomic class, some of them (17%) fall under lower-middle socioeconomic class and rest of them (6%) fall under lower socioeconomic class. Among core constraints of the tribal fish farmers’, water scarcity has been more highlighted as Purulia is drought prone area. Suitable recommendations have been discussed after analysing the social, economic, personal, core and extension constraints faced by the tribes involved in fisheries in Purulia district, WB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHura 3adrought 3afish 3afish production 3aincome 3alifestyle 3asocioeconomic status 3awater shortages 3aIndia 0aCore constraints 0aExtension constraints 0aKuppuswamy scale 0aSocioeconomic class1 aSaha, Biswarup1 aOjha, S.

In the present study, the knock-out mutants of cytosolic GPDH (AtGPDHc2) and wild-type Arabidopsis plants were treated with 0, 50, 100, and 150 mmol L−1 NaCl to reveal the effects of AtGPDHc2 deficiency on salinity stress responses. The fluctuation in redox status, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant enzymes as well as the transcripts of genes involved in the relevant processes were measured. In the presence of 100 and 150 mmol L−1 NaCl treatments, AtGPDHc2-deficient plants exhibited a pronounced reduction in germination rate, fresh weight, root length, and overall biomass. Furthermore, loss of AtGPDHc2 resulted in a significant perturbation in cellular redox state (NADH/NAD+ and AsA/DHA) and consequent elevation of ROS and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) content. The elevated ROS level triggered substantial increases in ROS-scavenging enzymes activities, and the up-regulated transcripts of the genes (CSD1, sAPX and PER33) encoding the antioxidant enzymes were also observed. In addition, the transcript levels of COX15, AOX1A and GLDH in gpdhc2 mutants decreased in comparison to wild-type plants, which demonstrated that the deficiency of AtGPDHc2 might also has impact on mitochondrial respiration under salt stress. Together, this work provides some new evidences on illustrating the roles of AtGPDHc2 playing in response to salinity stress by regulating cellular redox homeostasis, ROS metabolism and mitochondrial respiration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aalpha-glycerophosphoric acid 3aantioxidant enzymes 3abiomass 3acatalytic activity 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agermination 3aglycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3ahomeostasis 3aknockout mutants 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3amitochondria 3areactive oxygen species 3asalt stress 3asodium chloride 3astress response 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aglycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) 0aredox homeostasis 0areactive oxygen species (ROS) 0arespiration1 aLiu, Meng,1 aWang, Feng,1 aDING, Dong1 aZHAO, Chang-jiang1 aHe, Lin,1 aLI, Zuo-tong1 aXU, Jing-yu0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2019 June, v. 18, no. 6 p.1266-1279dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

What began with fibers collected from nature (e.g., flax) is now made from a wide range of high-performance polymers that possess useful mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties. Despite these advances, electrically conducting fibers for the most part have remained elusive, with the exception of fibers based on inherently conducting polymers; to date, the electrical properties of conducting fibers deteriorate when repeatedly stretched and released. In a remarkable development, described on page 400 of this issue, Liu et al. (2) have made superelastic conducting fibers based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that can be stretched 1000% with almost no change in electrical conductivity, even after thousands of strain cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectrical conductivity 3afabrics 3aflax 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolymers 3asocioeconomic status0 tScience.g2015 July 24, v. 349, no. 6246 p.382-383dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aac74173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012400169300001800293520117800311592002801489650001701517650001101534650001601545650001101561650000901572650002001581650002001601650001301621650001601634651001001650700001401660773014101674856008101815852000901896655001201905IND60573300020221118222601.0170721e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057330002DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-015-1146-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoda, Katsuichiro10aUncertainty modeling and visualization for tsunami hazard and risk mapping: a case study for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake  ap. 2271-2285.  aThis study presents a rigorous computational framework for visualizing uncertainty of tsunami hazard and risk assessment. The methodology consists of three modules: (i) earthquake source characterization and stochastic simulation of slip distribution, (ii) tsunami propagation and inundation, and (iii) tsunami damage assessment and loss estimation. It takes into account numerous stochastic tsunami scenarios to evaluate the uncertainty propagation of earthquake source characteristics in probabilistic tsunami risk analysis. An extensive Monte Carlo tsunami inundation simulation is implemented for the 2011 Tohoku tsunami (focusing upon on Rikuzentakata along the Tohoku coast of Japan) using 726 stochastic slip models derived from eleven inverted source models. By integrating the tsunami hazard results with empirical tsunami fragility functions, probabilistic tsunami risk analysis and loss estimation are carried out; outputs from the analyses are displayed using various visualization methods. The developed framework is comprehensive, and can provide valuable insights in promoting proactive tsunami risk management and in improving emergency response capability.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acoasts 3aearthquakes 3amodels 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arisk management 3atsunamis 3auncertainty 3aJapan1 aSong, Jie0 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2016 Dec., v. 30, no. 8 p.2271-2285dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1436-32407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-015-1146-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245010400159300002000263520133000283592002801613650002201641650001601663650002701679650002801706650001701734650001201751650001901763650001301782650001401795650001301809650001101822650001501833650001801848700001701866700001901883700001701902700001501919700001401934700001601948700001801964773014901982856008102131852000902212655001202221IND60523472920221119125016.0160619e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052347292DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6467-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Kun10aEffects of returning NF concentrate on the MBR-NF process treating antibiotic production wastewater  ap. 13114-13127.  aThe optimization of the nanofiltration (NF) concentrate backflow ratio (R cb) and the influence of the NF concentrate on the performance of membrane bioreactor-nanofiltration (MBR-NF) process treating antibiotic production wastewater were investigated on a laboratory scale. The R cb was optimized at 60 % based on the removal rates of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and NH₄ ⁺-N by MBR. Data analyses indicated that salinity brought by NF concentrate is the major driver leading to the decrease of sludge activity, especially at a high R cb. EPS analysis showed that electric conductivity (EC), proteins in soluble microbial products (SMP), and SMP brought by NF concentrate are the dominant factors causing the severe membrane fouling in MBR. Furthermore, undegradable substances including fulvic acid-like and humic acid-like compounds accumulated in NF concentrate showed significant influence on fouling of NF. MBR could well degrade small MW compounds in NF concentrate, which confirmed the enhancement of organic removal efficiency by recycling the NF concentrate to MBR. The MBR-NF process showed a relatively stable performance at the R cb of 60 % (volume reduction factor (VRF) = 5), and the NF permeate could satisfy the water quality standard for fermentation process with a water recovery rate of 90.9 %.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3aantibiotics 3achemical oxygen demand 3aelectrical conductivity 3afermentation 3afouling 3ananofiltration 3aproteins 3arecycling 3asalinity 3asludge 3awastewater 3awater quality1 aCheng, Yutao1 aWang, Jianxing1 aZhang, Junya1 aLiu, Jibao1 aYu, Dawei1 aLi, Mingyue1 aWei, Yuansong0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 July, v. 23, no. 13 p.13114-13127dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6467-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010500163300001800268520100200286592002801288650002201316650001401338650001201352650002501364650001901389650001901408650002601427650001901453650000901472650000701481650001401488650001501502650001901517650001301536650002301549650001401572650001801586650001601604700001501620773015001635856008101785852000901866655001201875IND60585601220221118060225.0171111e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058560122DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-017-1313-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabari, Kh.10aCharacterization of a biodegrading bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, isolated from oil-contaminated soil  ap. 2583-2590.  aCrude oil and its derivatives because of different events and accidents may cause pollution to the environment.

In this study, the Bacillus subtilis was identified as the best biosurfactant-producing strain which has the ability to grow in environments with high salinity and temperature and pH > 5. The produced biosurfactant from B. subtilis is stable to changes in temperature and salt concentration and pH (in the range of 5–12).The B. subtilis also showed that they are able to biodegrade aliphatic alkanes.

Beyond the clear benefits of the tool to the interpretation, dissemination, and knowledge of the mentioned archaeological site and its surroundings, the novelty of this research is the implementation of the platform in alternative scenarios and purposes. In this way, the present work verifies how the access to multi-source and spatially geolocated information in the same tool (working as a geospatial database) allows the promotion of cross-sectional investigations in which different specialists intervene. This peculiarity is also considered useful to promote tourism with an interest beyond the purely historical/archaeological side. Likewise, the possibility of storing and managing a large amount of information in different formats facilitates the investigation in the contexts of excavations and archaeological or environmental works. In this sense, the use of this kind of tool for the study of cultural landscapes is especially novel. In order to better contextualize the potential of the virtual tour presented here, an analysis about the challenges and possibilities of implementing this tool in environments such as the Ulaca oppidum is performed. The selected site stands out for: (i) being in a unique geological, environmental and ecological context, allowing us to appreciate how human beings have modified the landscape over time; (ii) presenting numerous visible archaeological remains with certain conservation problems; and (iii) not having easy access for visitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3acase studies 3ahumans 3aspatial data 3atourism 3aIberian Peninsula 3aSpain1 aRodríguez Hernández, Jesús,1 aSáez Blázquez, Cristina 1 aTroitiño Torralba, Libertad 1 aSánchez-Aparicio, Luis Javier1 aFernández Hernández, Jesús 1 aHerrero Tejedor, Tomás Ramón1 aFabián García, José Francisco1 aPiras, Marco 1 aDíaz Sánchez, Carlos,1 aGonzález-Aguilera, Diego 1 aRuiz Zapatero, Gonzalo 1 aÁlvarez-Sanchís, Jesús R.0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Jan. 22, v. 14, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140305243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245014300208500001400351520133900365592002801704650002601732650002701758650002301785650002201808650001601830650001901846650001001865650001401875650003101889650001601920650001301936650001601949653002101965653001701986653001602003653001402019653001602033653002002049653002202069700002002091700002602111700002102137700002502158700002502183700003202208773011302240856008602353852000902439655001202448IND60720065720221120194249.0210201e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072006572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1254592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsim, Nilofar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4736-495810aWastes from the petroleum industries as sustainable resource materials in construction sectors: Opportunities, limitations, and directions  aNAL-light  aIncreasing growth of the petroleum industry has resulted in huge amounts of various waste materials, which need proper disposal and valorization. The complexity, slow rate, and high cost of various remediation methods for wastes from the petroleum industry and the potential of utilizing these wastes in construction sectors have attracted huge attention. To select the best utilization option for petroleum industry wastes, the composition, microstructure of waste materials, and their influence and mechanism on the targeted construction materials must be clarified. Such data may help researchers predict the physical and chemical properties of newly developed formulations and tailor them based on their required composition by using optimum admixture components and additional treatments. Despite research on the utilization of petroleum waste materials in the construction industry, they are relatively incremental and limited in scope and need more scientific attention considering the composition, structure, influence of various components on one another in admixture formulation, preparation mechanism, effect of treatments, eco-friendliness, and cost efficiency.

The use of computational methods can aid clinicians to observe body temperature using different cooling methods without the need of invasive techniques, and can thus be a valuable tool to assist clinical trials simulating different cooling options that can be used for treatment. In this work, we developed a finite element method (FEM) package using isoparametric linear three-dimensional elements which is applied to the solution of the continuum bioheat Pennes equation. Blood temperature changes were considered using a blood pool approach and a lumped analysis for intravascular catheter methods of blood cooling. Some analyses are performed using a three-dimensional mesh based on a complex geometry obtained from computed tomography medical images, considering a cooling blanket and an intravascular catheter. A comparison is made between the results obtained with the two techniques and the effects of each case in brain temperature reduction in a required period of time, maintenance of body temperature at moderate hypothermia levels and gradual rewarming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3ablood 3abrain 3acatheters 3aclinical trials 3acomputational methodology 3acomputed tomography 3acooling 3aequations 3afinite element analysis 3ageometry 3ahypothermia 3aischemia 3amodels 3atherapeutics 3athermoregulation 0aThermoregulation 0aHypothermia 0aBrain cooling 0aIntravascular catheter 0aFinite element method1 aWrobel, Luiz C.1 aRibeiro, Fernando L.B.0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2018 Dec., v. 78 p.122-130dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.08.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245015200179300001600331520107400347592002801421650002201449650001501471650001601486650002501502650001101527650002001538650002901558650001601587650001101603650001101614650001601625650001301641700002201654700002001676700003701696700002401733700003801757700001701795773010401812856008601916852000902002655001202011IND60087785820221122002709.0141102e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008778582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.07.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ado Livramento, Andréa10aIn vitro lymphocyte stimulation by recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen: A tool to detect the persistence of cellular immunity after vaccination  ap. 572-578.  aThe study of the human immune response to hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been hampered by the lack of an adequate model to evaluate the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) specific cell response. Thus, this study was conducted to perform an in vitro analysis of the antigenic properties of recombinant HBsAg and demonstrate the influence of variables such as culture time, antigen concentration and cell density on lymphocyte proliferation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the venous blood of vaccinated individuals, and in vitro cellular immune responses were evaluated using an HBsAg-specific proliferation assay. Lymphoproliferative responses were detected in culture systems, despite the lack of serum antibodies. Optimal results were obtained when lymphocytes were stimulated at a seeding density of 4×10⁶cells/mL, with 50ng/mL of recombinant HBsAg protein vaccine for 3 days. Data from the present study may contribute to the development of an adequate system to evaluate the cellular immune responses to HBsAg in vaccine recipients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis B virus 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3ahepatitis B antigens 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3alymphocyte proliferation 3alymphocytes 3amodels 3asowing 3avaccination 3avaccines1 aSampaio, Janaína1 aSchultz, Júnia1 aBatista, Keila Zaniboni Siqueira1 aTreitinger, Arício1 ade Cordova, Caio Maurício Mendes1 aSpada, Celso0 tJournal of virological methods.g2013 Nov., v. 193, no. 2 p.572-578dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.07.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01487naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245006100161300001800222520048200240592002800722650002300750650001700773650001800790650002000808650001300828700001900841700001800860700002100878700001700899700001800916773013100934856007501065852000901140655001201149IND60538526620221121041947.0160815e20120509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053852662DNAL7 a10.1021/ja30022772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrun, Matthias

Sensor excitation at 547 nm yields a glutamate-dependent emission spectrum between 550 and 700 nm that can be exploited for ratiometric sensing. On cells, the sensor displays a ratiometric change of 1.56. The high sensitivity toward glutamate concentration changes of the sensor and its exclusive extracellular localization make it an attractive tool for glutamate sensing in neurobiology.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3afluorescence 3aglutamic acid 3aneurophysiology 3aproteins1 aTan, Kui-Thong1 aGriss, Rudolf1 aKielkowska, Anna1 aReymond, Luc1 aJohnsson, Kai0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 May 09, v. 134, no. 18 p.7676-7678dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja30022773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245013200176520155400308592002801862650001301890650002601903650002101929650001001950650001001960650001301970650001201983650001501995653000802010653000802018653000902026653000902035653000802044653000802052653000802060653001002068653000802078653002102086653002202107653001702129653001502146653003702161700002202198700002202220700002202242700002102264700002002285700006002305773011602365856009002481852000902571655001202580IND60754477020221120183544.0211114e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075447702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2021.1051512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPontini, Lorenzo10aIn search for novel liver X receptors modulators by extending the structure–activity relationships of cholenamide derivatives  aN,N-Dimethyl 3β-hydroxychol-5-en-24-amide (DMHCA, 3) is the prototype of cholenamides, a class of steroidal LXR modulators characterized by the nucleus of Δ5-cholen-3β-ol and the presence of an amide moiety at C-24. DMHCA (3) has been reported to act as a gene-selective modulator able to fully induce ABCA1 expression whilst poorly up-regulate the expression of FASN and SREBP-1α genes. With the aim to widen the limited structure-activity relationships of DMHCA (3), herein we describe the synthesis and the biological evaluation of nine novel derivatives, resulting from a) the homologation of DMHCA’s side-chain to give N,N-dimethyl 3β-hydroxy-24a-homochol-5-en-24a-amide (4); b) the distal branching of the side-chain of 3 and 4 by introducing an ethyl group at C-23 and C-24, respectively; c) the replacement of the dimethyl amide moiety of all the derivatives with a carboxylic acid function. While broadening the structure-activity relationships of the class of cholenamides, we were successful in the discovery of (24R)-N,N-dimethyl-24-ethyl-3β-hydroxy-24a-homochol-5-en-24a-amide (6) as a novel LXR agonist with improved profile in term of selective gene modulation respect to the prototype DMHCA (3); indeed, 6 was able to up-regulate the expression of ABCA1 more than DMHCA (3), without to induce SREBP-1c, differently from DMHCA (3). Moreover, 6 induced the expression of FASN less than 3 and interestingly was a negative modulator towards SCD1 in contrast to DMHCA (3), which instead weakly induced the expression of this gene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3abiological assessment 3acarboxylic acids 3agenes 3aliver 3amoieties 3aphysics 3aprototypes 0aLBD 0aLDA 0aTBTU 0aHOBt 0aMOM 0aMPC 0aNMM 0aTBDPS 0aTLC 0aLiver X Receptor 0aNuclear receptors 0aCholenamides 0aOxysterols 0aStructure-activity relationships1 aPalazzoli, Pietro1 aMaggioni, Daniela1 aDamiano, Giuseppe1 aGiorgi, Gianluca1 aRusso, Vincenzo1 aMarinozzi, Maura1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5994-93900 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2021 Nov., v. 241 p.105151-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl20199x0009-30847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2021.1051513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009600162300001800258520158000276592002801856650000801884650003501892650001401927650001201941650001301953650001101966650000901977650002901986650001502015650001702030650001102047650000902058650001902067650001102086650001402097650002002111650001702131650000902148651000902157700001702166700002002183700001602203700001602219700001802235700001602253700001502269700001602284700001902300773015002319856008102469852000902550655001202559IND60585601420221118060345.0171111e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058560142DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-017-1327-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamani, H.10aContamination and ecological risk assessment of heavy metals in street dust of Tehran, Iran  ap. 2675-2682.  aHeavy metals are introduced in human tissue through breathing air, food chain and human skin. They can cause damage to the nervous system and internal organs. In the present study, sixty street dust samples were collected from the central area of Tehran and were digested in the laboratory to determine the content of Zn, Ni, Cd, Cr, Cu and Pb, using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The level of contamination with the analyzed metals was determined according to the following indices: geo-accumulation index (I gₑₒ), enrichment factor (EF), pollution index (PI), integrated pollution index (IPI) and potential ecological risk index (RI). The average concentration of heavy metals found was in the order of Zn > Cu > Pb > Ni > Cr > Cd. The average I gₑₒ values for Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn were 1.53, −1.88, 2.68, −0.67, 1.62 and 2.70, respectively. Among the investigated heavy metals, zinc and copper had the maximum average EF values and were placed into the “very severe enrichment” class. Potential ecological risk factor (E ᵣ) also indicated that Cd had the highest risk, and it was classified as of considerable potential ecological risk. Therefore, it is necessary to pay more attention to the appearance of Cd in the human environment. The calculated potential ecological risk index values also illustrated that the street dust samples presented a “moderate ecological risk.” The calculated IPI values showed that the pollution levels of the street dust samples ranged from high to extremely high.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abreathing 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3adust 3aenvironmental assessment 3afood chain 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3alead 3anervous system 3anickel 3apollution 3arisk assessment 3arisk factors 3azinc 3aIran1 aMahvi, A.

Besides the ultimate goal of inducing sterile protection in vaccinated individuals, the prevention of transmission by so-called transmission blocking vaccines (TBVs) is being regarded as an important feature of an efficient malaria eradication strategy. Recently, Plasmodium falciparum GAP50 (PfGAP50), a 44.6 kDa transmembrane protein that forms an essential part of the invasion machinery (glideosome) multi-protein complex, has been proposed as novel potential transmission-blocking candidate. Plant-based expression systems combine the advantages of eukaryotic expression with a up-scaling potential and a good product safety profile suitable for vaccine production. In this study we investigated the feasibility to use the transient plant expression to produce PfGAP50 suitable for the induction of parasite specific inhibitory antibodies. RESULTS: We performed the transient expression of recombinant PfGAP50 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves using endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) and plastid targeting. After IMAC-purification the protein yield and integrity was investigated by SDS-PAGE and Western Blot. Rabbit immune IgG derived by the immunization with the plastid-targeted variant of PfGAP50 was analyzed by immune fluorescence assay (IFA) and zygote inhibition assay (ZIA). PfGAP50 could be produced in both subcellular compartments at different yields IMAC (Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography) purification from extract yielded up to 4.1 μg/g recombinant protein per fresh leaf material for ER-retarded and16.2 μg/g recombinant protein per fresh leave material for plasmid targeted PfGAP50, respectively. IgG from rabbit sera generated by immunization with the recombinant protein specifically recognized different parasite stages in immunofluorescence assay. Furthermore up to 55 % inhibition in an in vitro zygote inhibition assay could be achieved using PfGAP50-specific rabbit immune IgG. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that the plant-produced PfGAP50 is functional regarding the presentation of inhibitory epitopes and could be considered as component of a transmission-blocking malaria vaccine formulation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aWestern blotting 3aaffinity chromatography 3aantibodies 3aburden of disease 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aepitopes 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aleaves 3amalaria 3amalaria vaccines 3aparasites 3aplasmids 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproduct safety 3arabbits 3arecombinant proteins 3aresearch and development 3atransmembrane proteins 3avaccination 3azygote1 aSpiegel, Holger1 aBoes, Alexander1 aScheuermayer, Matthias1 aReimann, Andreas1 aSchillberg, Stefan1 aFischer, Rainer0 tBMC biotechnology.g2015 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.108-108dBioMed CentralwJournal:19124x1472-67507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12896-015-0225-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03345naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010200171500002200273520155800295592002801853650001501881650002001896650001601916650001701932650002401949650001101973650002101984650002402005650001302029650002102042650001602063650001702079650001902096653000802115653000702123653000702130653000802137653000802145653000802153653000702161653001002168653000802178653000902186653000702195653002302202653001602225653002702241653002702268653002402295700002602319700002202345700001702367700002302384700001902407700002802426700002302454700001502477773009602492856008602588852000902674655001202683IND60567114420221118022715.0170710s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056711442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.04.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabbani, Gulam10aBinding of erucic acid with human serum albumin using a spectroscopic and molecular docking study  aPre-press version  aErucic acid (EA) is one of the key fatty acids usually found in canola oil, mustard oil and rapeseed oil. Consumption of EA in primates was found to cause myocardial lipidosis and cardiac steatosis. To have an insight of the effect of EA in humans, we performed in vitro interaction studies of EA with the primary plasma protein, human serum albumin (HSA). Spectroscopic (UV-vis and fluorescence) analysis of the EA-HSA interaction revealed a static mode of quenching, with binding constant Kb ∼104 reflecting high affinity of EA for HSA. The negative value of ΔG° for binding of EA to HSA in the fluorescence studies indicates the process to be spontaneous. Thermodynamic signatures of the EA-HSA interaction in the complex reflect dominance of hydrogen bonds. Despite predominance of hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions in the EA-HSA complex were found acting as a contributing factor in the binding of EA to HSA, observed as structural change in the far-UV CD spectra. Förster’s resonance energy transfer of the EA-HSA complex revealed a distance of 3.2nm between acceptor molecules (EA) and the donor Trp residue of HSA. To have a deeper insight of the structural dependence of the EA-HSA interaction in the complex, thermodynamic study was supplemented with molecular docking. The molecular docking analysis further highlighted the EA binding in the subdomain IIIA (Sudlow site II) of HSA. The information generated in the study reflects greater pharmacological significance of EA and highlights its importance in the clinical medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanola oil 3aenergy transfer 3aerucic acid 3afluorescence 3ahuman serum albumin 3ahumans 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobic bonding 3amedicine 3amolecular models 3amustard oil 3aspectroscopy 3athermodynamics 0aASA 0aCD 0aEA 0aFAs 0aΔH 0aHSA 0aKm 0aλmax 0aMRE 0aVmax 0aSA 0acircular dichroism 0aerucic acid 0aesterase-like activity 0afluorescence quenching 0ahuman serum albumin1 aBaig, Mohammad Hassan1 aJan, Arif Tasleem1 aLee, Eun-Ju,1 aKhan, Mohsin Vahid1 aZaman, Masihuz1 aGad, Abd-ElAziem Farouk1 aKhan, Rizwan Hasan1 aChoi, Inho0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.04.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03486naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245008400197300001600281500001900297500001100316520205200327592002802379596004402407650003302451650002202484650001102506650002002517650002802537650002002565650002302585650002502608650002202633650001002655650002402665650001902689650002102708650001702729651001402746700002502760700002502785773013602810856007302946852000903019655001203028IND60645168020221119152839.0190523e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064516802DNAL7 a10.1111/emr.123582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoehn, John D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0913-113310aFish and flow management in the Murray–Darling Basin: Directions for research  ap. 142-150.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aREVIEW  aEffective natural resource management requires knowledge exchange between researchers and managers to support evidence‐based decision‐making. To achieve this, there is a need to align research with management and policy needs. This project aimed to identify the flow‐related ecological knowledge needs for freshwater fish to better inform environmental water management in the Murray–Darling Basin, south‐eastern Australia. Our major objective was to provide an up‐to‐date assessment of scientific research and integrate this with the knowledge requirements of relevant managers to guide future research. We reviewed the contemporary scientific literature and engaged managers specifically responsible for delivering flows for fish outcomes via a questionnaire and workshop. Research on fishes of the MDB has generally evolved from single locations and/or times to larger spatio‐temporal scales, including multiple sites, rivers and catchments. There has also been a trend from single life stage studies to incorporation of multiple life stages and population processes. There remain, however, significant deficiencies in knowledge for most native species, many of which are threatened. Four agreed key knowledge gaps were derived from the literature review and managers’ suggestions: (i) population dynamics, (ii) movement, dispersal and connectivity, (iii) survival and recruitment to adults and (iv) recruitment drivers. To inform policy and management, managers desired timely advice, based on robust research and monitoring. Fish species of most relevance to managers were those highly regarded by community stakeholders and whose life histories and population dynamics are potentially influenced by flow. Populations of these mostly large‐bodied, angling species (e.g. Murray Cod, Golden Perch and Silver Perch) have declined, often due to river regulation and, in conjunction with managers’ priorities, are relevant candidates for research to support the management of flow to rehabilitate fish populations in the MDB.  aPublisher supplied data  cCommonwealth Environmental Water Office 3aMaccullochella peelii peelii 3aMacquaria ambigua 3abasins 3adecision making 3aenvironmental knowledge 3afreshwater fish 3aindigenous species 3ainformation exchange 3aissues and policy 3aperch 3apopulation dynamics 3aquestionnaires 3ariver regulation 3astakeholders 3aAustralia1 aBalcombe, Stephen R.1 aZampatti, Brenton P.0 tEcological management & restoration.g2019 May, v. 20, no. 2 p.142-150dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867073x1442-70017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/emr.123583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245015600172300001600328500001500344520159900359592002801958650002601986650001502012650001002027650000802037650001502045650001302060650001502073650001002088650002802098650002002126653002402146700002402170700002102194700002202215700001802237700002102255773010402276856008602380852000902466655001202475IND60087785920221122002601.0141102e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008778592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.07.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Cristina10aComparison of two nucleic acid extraction and testing systems for HCMV-DNA detection and quantitation on whole blood specimens from transplant patients  ap. 579-582.  a2019-12-06  aQuantitative detection of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA on whole blood is currently the primary choice for virological monitoring in transplant patients and for determining the appropriate antiviral strategy, however specific issues of variability remain in terms of extraction methods, amplification efficiency, and variability. This study compared the performance characteristics of two nucleic acid extraction and testing systems for HCMV-DNA quantitation, the artus® CMV QS-RGQ kit, associated with a fully automated DNA extraction and assay set up by Qiagen (system 1) and the Q-CMV Real Time Complete kit by Nanogen, associated with a semiautomated nucleic acid extraction system by Biomérieux (system 2) in 189 specimens from transplant patients and 10 from 2012 HCMV Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics (QCMD). The two systems exhibited a 80.4% concordance. Differences between the two systems were within ±1log₁₀copies/ml of the averaged log₁₀ results for 88.9% of the tested specimens. For all qualitatively discordant specimens, mean viral load was ≤3log₁₀copies/ml. Considering viral load measurement, system 1 gave earlier positives that system 2, with a 14.8% of specimens resulted positive at low viral loads with system 1 and negative with system 2. In QCMD specimens, difference was below 0.7log₁₀copies/ml for both the systems. In conclusion, the two systems provided reliable and comparable results. Some specific performance characteristic and automation could be taken into account in terms of less hands of time, fewer errors and reliability.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiagnostic techniques 3amonitoring 3ahands 3aDNA 3aautomation 3apatients 3aviral load 3ablood 3aHuman betaherpesvirus 5 3aquality control 0aHuman herpesvirus 51 aMantovani, Samantha1 aBalloco, Cinzia.1 aSidoti, Francesca1 aFop, Fabrizio1 aCavallo, Rossana0 tJournal of virological methods.g2013 Nov., v. 193, no. 2 p.579-582dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.07.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245009600165300001400261520142800275592002801703650002301731650001101754650002801765650001701793650001601810650001601826650001501842650001301857650002201870650001501892650002401907651001001931653001301941653001801954653001901972653001601991653002402007700001802031700001802049700001602067773010602083856008402189852000902273655001202282IND50065402220221119160540.0190318e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006540222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2013.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Xueli10aEffects of contrasting agricultural management on microbial residues in a Mollisol in China  ap. 13-17.  aMicrobial residue represents a significant amount of soil organic matter, and its component amino sugar can serve as time-integrated indicators that reflect chronic effects of agricultural management. We evaluated the influence of different land-use and fertilization treatments on the amounts and patterns of amino sugars (glucosamine and galactosamine) and muramic acid in a Mollisol (Udolls, USDA Soil Taxonomy System) in northeastern China. The treatments included: BL, bareland, without any vegetation; GL, restored grassland which allows plants to re-vegetate naturally; AL, arable land without any fertilizer; ALF, arable land with chemical fertilizer; and ALMF, arable land with chemical fertilizer and pig manure. The amino sugar concentrations differed significantly between various treatments after 26 years, with the order of ALMF>GL>ALF>AL>BL. This suggests that long-term contrasting management changed microbial residue accumulation in soil, which is strongly related to soil organic carbon content. The larger ratios of glucosamine to muramic acid in the GL plots than the AL and BL plots indicated a shift toward fungal-derived residues after 26 years of natural restoration. Our results suggested that different land-use and fertilization treatments clearly influenced amounts and patterns of microbial residues and their contribution to SOM accumulation, primarily due to differences in organic C inputs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aU.S. Soil Taxonomy 3aUdolls 3aagricultural management 3aarable soils 3afertilizers 3aglucosamine 3agrasslands 3aland use 3along term effects 3apig manure 3asoil organic carbon 3aChina 0aLand use 0aFertilization 0aMicroorganisms 0aAmino sugar 0aSoil organic matter1 aHan, Xiaozeng1 aZhang, Xudong1 aQiao, Yunfa0 tSoil & tillage research.g2013 June, v. 130 p.13-17dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2013.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02309naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245012600198300001600324500001900340500002000359520118400379592002801563650001501591650003001606650001501636650001401651650001001665650001801675650000901693650001701702700002201719773013601741856007301877852000901950655001201959IND60645168120221119152546.0190523e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064516812DNAL7 a10.1111/emr.123462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorgan, John W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2003-598310aMessage in a bottle: Inadvertent loss of seeds of native grassland species as a result of rudimentary long‐term storage  ap. 159-161.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMany practitioners are likely to have collected seeds with the intention of using that seed for conservation and/or restoration plantings, but have not got around to using the seed, sometimes for many years. Currently, it is not clear what species have short‐lived or long‐lived seed when stored under rudimentary conditions such as in paper bags or in a refrigerator. We report the germinability of 12 temperate native grassland species, comprising 16 populations, whose seeds were collected with the purpose of raising seedlings to plant into the wild, but whose seeds were subsequently stored at ~2–4°C for 25+ years. We conclude that most of the grassland species that we assessed do not have viable seed after 25 years when stored in such conditions; only two species germinated despite evidence that seed germinates well for most species when first collected. Inadvertent loss of seeds of as a result of long‐term storage is most likely in readily germinable species (e.g. members of the Asteraceae). The ways in which seeds are stored by practitioners deserves consideration given the risk of seed mortality with long‐term storage under rudimentary conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsteraceae 3aadministrative management 3agrasslands 3amortality 3apaper 3arefrigerators 3arisk 3astorage time1 aSalmon, Karina L.0 tEcological management & restoration.g2019 May, v. 20, no. 2 p.159-161dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867073x1442-70017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/emr.123463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010200166300001800268520127300286592002801559650002101587650001501608650001601623650001501639650002201654650002001676650004301696650001501739650002201754650001601776650002401792650002001816650002101836650003001857700001701887700001801904700003301922700002101955700001801976773010501994856008102099852000902180655001202189IND50069013620221122071505.0150208e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006901362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-013-9987-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiow, Rouh-San10aMolecular cloning and characterization of GDP-mannose-3′,5′-epimerase from Gracilaria changii  ap. 1309-1318.  aGDP-mannose-3′,5′-epimerase (GME) is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of GDP-L-galactose which is a building unit of agar and cell wall polysaccharides. GME catalyzes the formation of GDP-β-L-galactose and GDP-L-gulose from GDP-mannose. In this study, the gene and transcript encoding GME from the red alga Gracilaria changii (GcGME) were cloned. The structural gene sequence of GcGME is devoid of an intron. The cis-acting regulatory element involved in light response is the most abundant element at the 5′-flanking region of GcGME. The open reading frame of GcGME consists of 1,053 nucleotides with 351 amino acids. This cDNA was cloned into pET32a expression vector for recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli. High yield of soluble recombinant GcGME (55 kDa) was expressed upon isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside induction. The enzyme activity of recombinant GcGME was detected using thin layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. The transcript abundance of GcGME was the highest in G. changii and the lowest in Gracilaria salicornia corresponding to their agar contents. The characterization of GcGME from G. changii is important to facilitate the understanding of its role in agar production of this seaweed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aGracilaria 3aamino acids 3acell walls 3acomplementary DNA 3aenzyme activity 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amacroalgae 3amolecular cloning 3anucleotides 3aopen reading frames 3apolysaccharides 3astructural genes 3athin layer chromatography1 aTeoh, Seddon1 aTeo, Swee-Sen1 abin Abd.

The present study reports the development of a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for the quantitative determination of seven CFR-specified components in O5 and O5L – fluorescein and six brominated fluoresceins. The analytes were quantified using six-point calibration curves with data points (w/w) that ranged as follows: 20.0–70.0% for 4ʹ,5ʹ-dibromofluorescein; 9.8–44.1% for 2ʹ,4ʹ,5ʹ-tribromofluorescein; 1.01–15.2% for 2ʹ,4ʹ,5ʹ,7ʹ-tetrabromofluorescein; 0.10–3.12% for 2',4ʹ-dibromofluorescein; 0.10–3.06% for 2ʹ,5ʹ-dibromofluorescein; 0.11–2.85% for 4ʹ-bromofluorescein; and 0.10–2.02% for fluorescein. For all seven analytes, the HPLC instrument response was linear (R² > 0.999) over the tested concentration ranges and the limits of detection (0.01–1.55%) were well below the CFR-specified levels. Other validation data showed good analyte recovery (87.91–101.73%) as well as method precision measured by the relative standard deviation (0.53–1.56%). The new method was applied to the analysis of test portions from 15 batches of O5 and eight batches of O5L submitted to FDA for certification by domestic and foreign manufacturers. Compared to the thin-layer chromatography/spectrophotometric procedure currently used for routine batch-certification analyses, the new method was found to be more sensitive, simpler to implement, and significantly faster, requiring 25 minutes rather than six hours to analyse one sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aartificial colors 3abromination 3acertification 3achemical species 3acolor 3acompliance 3adetection limit 3afluorescein 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alakes 3aquantitative analysis 3astandard deviation 3athin layer chromatography 0aColor additive D&C Orange No. 5 0amonobromofluorescein 0adibromofluorescein 0atribromofluorescein 0atetrabromofluorescein 0aHPLC1 aLazo-Portugal, Rodrigo1 aPerez-Gonzalez, Marianita1 aWeisz, Adrian0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2019 Dec. 2, v. 36, no. 12 p.1800-1807dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl35737x1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2019.16647733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245009100156300001800247500001900265520132200284592002801606650003701634650000801671650002401679650002901703650004901732650001101781650001001792650001401802650001701816650001201833650002201845700001601867700002301883700001701906700005801923700006501981700005802046773014702104856007602251852000902327655001202336IND60733913020210417000000.0210414e20210331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073391302DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c013052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShu, Chan10aSynthesis and Thin Films of Thermally Robust Quartet (S = 3/2) Ground State Triradical  ap. 5508-5518.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHigh-spin (S = 3/2) organic triradicals may offer enhanced properties with respect to several emerging technologies, but those synthesized to date typically exhibit small doublet quartet energy gaps and/or possess limited thermal stability and processability. We report a quartet ground state triradical 3, synthesized by a Pd(0)-catalyzed radical–radical cross-coupling reaction, which possesses two doublet–quartet energy gaps, ΔEDQ ≈ 0.2–0.3 kcal mol–¹ and ΔEDQ2 ≈ 1.2–1.8 kcal mol–¹. The triradical has a 70+% population of the quartet ground state at room temperature and good thermal stability with onset of decomposition at >160 °C under an inert atmosphere. Magnetic properties of 3 are characterized by SQUID magnetometry in polystyrene glass and by quantitative EPR spectroscopy. Triradical 3 is evaporated under ultrahigh vacuum to form thin films of intact triradicals on silicon substrate, as confirmed by high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. AFM and SEM images of the ∼1 nm thick films indicate that the triradical molecules form islands on the substrate. The films are stable under ultrahigh vacuum for at least 17 h but show onset of decomposition after 4 h at ambient conditions. The drop-cast films are less prone to degradation in air and have a longer lifetime.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aair 3aambient temperature 3across-coupling reactions 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenergy 3aglass 3amagnetism 3apolystyrenes 3asilicon 3athermal stability1 aPink, Maren1 aJunghoefer, Tobias1 aNadler, Elke1 aRajca, Suchada1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0904-83291 aCasu, Maria Benedetta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5659-70401 aRajca, Andrzej1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8856-15360 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Mar. 31, v. 143, no. 14 p.5508-5518dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c013053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03794naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245014700168300001600315520198600331592002802317650001502345650001402360650001302374650001102387650001102398650001202409650001202421650001202433650002302445650001102468650001802479650002002497650003502517650001602552650001702568650002202585650001802607650001002625651001602635651001402651653001102665653001102676653001102687653001002698653001602708653002802724653001502752653001202767700002002779700002202799700002902821700003002850700001902880700002002899700002002919773012502939856008303064852000903147655001203156IND60558454120221123043211.0190318e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055845412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2016.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Klink, Roel10aEffects of grazing management on biodiversity across trophic levels–The importance of livestock species and stocking density in salt marshes  ap. 329-339.  aEuropean coastal salt marshes are important for the conservation of numerous species of specialist plants, invertebrates, breeding and migratory birds. When these marshes are managed for nature conservation purposes, livestock grazing is often used to counter the dominance of the tall grass Elytrigia atherica, and the subsequent decline in plant species richness. However, it remains unclear what is the optimal choice of livestock species and stocking density to benefit biodiversity of various trophic levels.To fill this knowledge gap, we set up a triplicate, full factorial grazing experiment with cattle and horse grazing at low and high stocking densities (0.5 or 1 animal ha−1) at the mainland coast of the Dutch Wadden Sea. Here, we present the results after 4 years and integrate these with previously published results from the same experiment to assess effects of livestock grazing on various trophic groups.Stocking density affected almost all measured variables: high stocking densities favoured plant species richness and suppression of E. atherica, whereas low stocking densities favoured abundances of voles, pollinators and flowers. Densities of different functional groups of birds showed no significant response to the regimes, but tended to be somewhat higher under 0.5 horse and 1 cattle ha−1.Choice of livestock species had fewer and smaller effects than stocking density. Horse grazing was detrimental to vole density, and showed an interactive effect with stocking density for Asteraceae flower abundance. Multidiversity, a synthetic whole-ecosystem biodiversity measure, did not differ among regimes. These results are discussed in the light of other results from the same experiment.Because of these contrasting effects on different trophic groups, we advise concurrent application of different grazing regimes within a spatial mosaic, with the inclusion of long-term abandonment. High density horse grazing, however, is detrimental to biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsteraceae 3aElytrigia 3abreeding 3acattle 3acoasts 3aflowers 3agrasses 3agrazing 3agrazing management 3ahorses 3ainvertebrates 3amigratory birds 3anatural resources conservation 3apollinators 3asalt marshes 3aspecies diversity 3astocking rate 3avoles 3aNetherlands 3aNorth Sea 0aCattle 0aHorses 0aPlants 0aBirds 0aButterflies 0aFlower-visiting insects 0aVegetation 0aWetland1 aNolte, Stefanie1 aMandema, Freek S.1 aLagendijk, D.D.Georgette1 aWallisDeVries, Michiel F.1 aBakker, Jan P.1 aEsselink, Peter1 aSmit, Christian0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 235 p.329-339dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2016.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01951naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245005500174300001600229520076900245592002801014650001401042650002001056650002201076650003601098650001701134650001701151650003201168650002901200650001401229700001501243700001201258700005501270773017101325856008401496852000901580655001201589IND60638238620221117235614.0190426e20190312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063823862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.8b005072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasan, Aobulikasimu10aJatrophane Diterpenoids from Euphorbia glomerulans  ap. 724-734.  aIn a phytochemical investigation of the whole plant of Euphorbia glomerulans, 17 new (1–17) and five known jatrophane diterpenoids (18–22) were identified.

The coating of C₃N₄ on ZnO significantly increases the photoelectrochemical anticorrosion performance of ZnO. When the amount of C₃N₄ added is 1 wt%, the C₃N₄@ZnO composite can provide the best photoelectrochemical anticorrosion capability for 304 stainless steel. This improved performance is attributed to the formation of an effective heterojunction electric field on the interface between C₃N₄ and ZnO, which improves the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, increases the lifetime of the photoinduced electrons, and enhances the photoelectrochemical anticorrosion performance of ZnO.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nitride 3acoatings 3aelectric field 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrons 3aphotochemistry 3astainless steel 3azinc oxide1 aChen, Zhuoyuan0 tRSC advances.g2014 Sept. 22, v. 4, no. 85 p.45397-45406dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra06641c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02144naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245015400188300001600342520064300358592002801001650002301029650001801052650002201070650001201092650001701104650001001121650003301131650001301164650006201177650002901239650002501268650004401293650003901337650004701376650003101423650003301454650003701487700002101524773009601545856004801641852000901689655001201698IND4479195520221119235502.0121003e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447919552DNAL7 a220095752pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-011-0777-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugimoto, Toshikazu10aIndigestible dextrin is an excellent inducer for α-amylase, α-glucosidase and glucoamylase production in a submerged culture of Aspergillus oryzae   ap. 347-351.  aα-Amylase activities of Aspergillus oryzae grown on dextrin or indigestible dextrin were 7·8 and 27·7 U ml−1, respectively.

We used inelastic and quasielastic neutron scattering to describe water dynamics in two different chalk samples that have similar pore volume (ranging from tens of micrometers to a few nanometers) but different water uptake properties. We observed distinct water populations, where the analysis of the quasielastic data shows that after the hydration process most of the water behaves as bulk water. However, the lack of quasielastic signal, together with the observation of a translational mode at 10 meV, imply that in chalk samples that take up less water confinement occurs mostly in the pore volume that is accessible with nitrogen adsorption measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3achalk 3aneutrons 3anitrogen 3aoils 3aremediation 3awater uptake1 aDalby, K.

A xanthine biosensor was fabricated using XOD/c-MWCNT/PANI/Pt electrode as a working electrode, Ag/AgCl (3M KCl) as standard electrode and Pt wire as auxiliary electrode connected through a potentiostat. The enzyme electrode was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The biosensor showed optimum response within 4s at pH 7.0 and 35°C, when polarized at 0.4V. The optimized xanthine biosensor showed linear response range of 0.6–58μM, with a detection limit of 0.6μM (S/N=3), and a correlation coefficient of 0.98. The biosensor was applied to determine xanthine in fish meat.

Integrating heat from a concentrating solar power (CSP) collector field increases the power output at low cost. This article considers five methods of solar heat addition in a double-flash geothermal plant. The most promising solution converts solar heat into electrical work with an efficiency of 24.3%. The economic feasibility and optimal sizing of the solar field and thermal stores are evaluated. A hybrid plant that increases power generation from 22 to 24 MWₑ has a Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of 0.07 ± 0.01 $/kWhₑ. Adding three hours of storage increases the LCOE to 0.08 ± 0.01 $/kWhₑ. Photovoltaic systems are considered to be a low-cost renewable technology, but an equivalent photovoltaic system with battery storage costs 0.15 ± 0.07 $/kWhₑ due to the high cost and replacement rate of batteries compared to thermal storage. The hybrid plant also has a lower LCOE than a conventional CSP plant. If the dispatchability that thermal storage provides is rewarded with higher electricity prices, calculations indicate storage becomes an attractive investment when discharged power receives 1.75 times the typical price of electricity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aeconomic feasibility 3aelectricity 3aelectricity costs 3ageothermal energy 3aheat 3apower generation 3apower plants 3aprices 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3asustainable technology 0aConcentrating solar power 0aThermal energy storage 0aGeothermal power 0aRetrofit 0aLevelized cost of energy 0aHybrid power generation1 aCastro, José,1 aMungas, Greg1 aKramer, Nick1 aKing, John1 aTurchi, Craig1 aZhu, Guangdong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3736-27880 tApplied energy.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 228 p.1837-1852dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.07.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245009300168300001600261520147700277592002801754650001301782650001601795650001101811650001401822650002401836650003401860650001601894650001701910650001101927650002001938650001401958650002501972650002901997650001902026700002402045700002202069773009502091856005502186852000902241655001202250IND4393330320221116220656.0150416e199909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439333032DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0006-341X.1999.00711.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, C. Y.10aEstimation of the Correlation Between Nutrient Intake Measures Under Restricted Sampling  ap. 711-717.  aFood frequency questionnaires (FFQs) are commonly used to assess dietary intake in epidemiologic research. To evaluate the FFQ reliability, the commonly used approach is to estimate the correlation coefficient between the data given in FFQ and those in food records (for example, 4âday food records [4DFR]) for nutrients of interest. However, in a dietary intervention study, a criterion for eligibility may be to select participants who have baseline FFQâmeasured dietary intake of percent energy from fat above a prespecified quantity. Other instruments, such as the 4DFR, may be subsequently administrated only to eligible participants. Under these circumstances, analysis without adjusting for the restricted population will usually lead to biased estimation of correlation coefficients and other parameters of interest. In this paper, we apply likelihoodâbased and multiple imputation (MI) methods to accommodate such incomplete data obtained as a result of the study design. A simulation study is conducted to examine finite sample performance of various estimators. We note that both the MI estimate and the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate based on a bivariateânormal model are not sensitive to departures from this normality assumption. This led us to investigate robustness properties of the ML estimator analytically. We present some data analyses from a dietary assessment study from the Women's Health Initiative to illustrate the methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiometry 3acorrelation 3aenergy 3aequipment 3aexperimental design 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood intake 3afood records 3amodels 3anutrient intake 3anutrients 3anutrition assessment 3anutritional intervention 3awomen's health1 aAnderson, Garnet L.1 aPrentice, Ross L.0 tBiometrics.g1999 Sept., v. 55, no. 3 p.711-717dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0006-341X.1999.00711.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03604naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245012400182300001600306520172100322592002802043650001302071650001302084650002502097650001902122650002502141650001702166650001902183650002302202650002702225650001902252650002202271650001902293650002302312650000902335650002202344650002502366650000902391650001602400650001402416650001102430650001502441650001402456650001302470653001902483653002502502653000902527653002502536653002702561700003002588700003902618700002502657700010702682773011802789856008602907852000902993655001203002IND60637978620221120133828.0191031e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063797862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.04.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShanmugam, Bhuvanesh Kumar10aBiodegradation of tannery dye effluent using Fenton's reagent and bacterial consortium: A biocalorimetric investigation  ap. 106-113.  aThe impact caused by dye effluent discharge on the environment is well known. The study explores a hybrid method of combining Fenton oxidation with biological treatment by a defined bacterial consortium for the biodegradation of an effluent containing toxic azo dye (acid blue 113). In actual treatment process, the fluctuation in toxic load and presence of other dyeing chemical inhibits the activity of the bacterial consortium. An effective pre-treatment of effluent would ensure the optimal degradation irrespective of its initial load. The pre-treatment of dye effluent with Fenton (H2O2 & Fe2+), considerably reduced the dye concentration by 40% and a maximum dye degradation of 85% (i.e., 45% by biodegradation) was achieved in shake flask. The biodegradation process was investigated in a bioreaction calorimeter (BioRc1e), the heat profile, bioenergetics data along with CER (Carbon dioxide emission rate) and OUR (Oxygen uptake rate) provided vital information for the effective commercial scale up. Enhanced degradation of up to 97% was achieved in BioRc1, the CER and OUR profile follows the power-time profile alluding that the heat generated is the resultant effect of bacterial metabolic activity. In real dye bath effluent the Fenton pre-oxidized biodegradation reaction showed a degradation efficacy of 89.5% and considerable COD reduction of 93.7%. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis revealed a better bacterial cell proliferation in pre-treated experiment and gas chromatography and mass spectrum analysis were used for prediction of metabolites. The unique combination of Fenton and the microbial consortia is a competitive technology for industrial effluent treatment processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aazo dyes 3abacteria 3abiochemical pathways 3abiodegradation 3abiological treatment 3acalorimeters 3acarbon dioxide 3acell proliferation 3achemical oxygen demand 3aculture flasks 3aenergy metabolism 3aflow cytometry 3agas chromatography 3aheat 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aindustrial effluents 3airon 3ametabolites 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aprediction 3atanneries 3atoxicity 0aBiocalorimeter 0aFenton pre-treatment 0aFACS 0aBacterial consortium 0aDye effluent treatment1 aEaswaran, Sivanesh Nanjan1 aMohanakrishnan, Anusha Subramanian1 aKalyanaraman, Chitra1 aMahadevan, Surianarayanan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7046-7042 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7046-70420 tJournal of environmental management.g2019 July 15, v. 242 p.106-113dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.04.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245015800167300001600325520160100341592002801942650002001970650002301990650002102013650002502034650002302059650002202082650001402104650002702118700001802145773013202163856008002295852000902375655001202384IND60651344320221117215925.0190711e20140325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065134432DNAL7 a10.3390/resources30203622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharpe, Samantha10aStrengthening Industrial Ecology’s Links with Business Studies: Insights and Potential Contributions from the Innovation and Business Models Literature  ap. 362-382.  aThe declining availability of natural resources and the environmental impacts of continued extraction of primary resources for production activities have forced greater focus on waste streams and recycling activities. Industrial ecology as a field of practice and theory has been closely related to sustainability issues, yet despite the development of much theory and specific tools and methodologies, the link between natural, industrial and economic systems is not convincing. Not only that, the need for delivering sustainable production and consumption practices is increasing, which is demanding new solutions to existing problems, particularly around the degree of novelty. The interaction of industrial ecology with business studies and industrial investment decision-making remains under-developed, and this is likely impacting on the adoption of more sustainable and resource-efficient practices. As such, this paper uses a constructive approach and explores how two areas of the literature can support the development of the industrial ecology field into strategic business practice: firstly, the innovation literature, particularly the emerging work on open innovation and sustainable innovation as a model to understand radical innovation processes and the creation and maintenance of networked systems of firms; secondly, the closely related area of business model (BM) innovation, specifically the emerging typologies of sustainable BMs and how these typologies can be developed and used as a route to positioning recycling activities at the strategic management level of the firm.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic systems 3aenvironmental impact 3aindustrial ecology 3anatural resources 3arecycling 3asustainable technology1 aAgarwal, Renu0 tResources.g2014 Mar. 25, v. 3, no. 2 p.362-382dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21558x2079-92767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources30203623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02167naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245013600133300001800269520104100287592002801328650001301356650001301369650002401382650002201406650001601428650001701444650001401461650001301475650001701488650001601505650001201521650001001533653002001543653001601563700002101579700001901600773015301619852000901772655001201781IND60705751920221119212103.0200807e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070575192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanpariya, L.

The highest heritability as well as genetic advance for grain yield per plant was observed by the cross RWP 2002-2 x LOK 1. Plant height, number of effective tillers per plant, number of grains per spike, flag leaf area and peduncle length of main spike showed the high values of heritability as well as genetic advance. Therefore, these characters are of great importance for the improvement of grain yield. Biparental programme may be fruitful in selection for achieving real estimates of additive x additive components of genetic variation because the estimates of heritability and genetic gain are of moderate to high magnitude in most of the crosses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum 3acrossing 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3agrain yield 3aheritability 3aleaf area 3apeduncle 3aplant height 3asowing date 3atillers 3awheat 0agenetic advance 0abread wheat1 aPansuriya, A.

It is necessary to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in lung cancer in order to develop more effective therapeutics for the treatment of this disease. Recent reports have shown that Wnt signaling pathway is important in a number of cancer types including lung cancer. However, the role of Frizzled-8 (Fzd-8), one of the Frizzled family of receptors for the Wnt ligands, in lung cancer still remains to be elucidated. Here in this study we showed that Fzd-8 was over-expressed in human lung cancer tissue samples and cell lines. To investigate the functional importance of the Fzd-8 over-expression in lung cancer, we used shRNA to knock down Fzd-8 mRNA in lung cancer cells expressing the gene. We observed that Fzd-8 shRNA inhibited cell proliferation along with decreased activity of Wnt pathway in vitro, and also significantly suppressed A549 xenograft model in vivo (p<0.05). Furthermore, we found that knocking down Fzd-8 by shRNA sensitized the lung cancer cells to chemotherapy Taxotere. These data suggest that Fzd-8 is a putative therapeutic target for human lung cancer and over-expression of Fzd-8 may be important for aberrant Wnt activation in lung cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell proliferation 3adrug therapy 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahumans 3alung neoplasms 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3areceptors 3asignal transduction1 aXu, Mei-lin1 aMa, Jie1 aZhang, Yi1 aXie, Cong-hua0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Jan. 6, v. 417, no. 1 p.62-66dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.11.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245011300212500001900325506007600344520161500420592002802035506003702063650001902100650001802119650001502137650002002152650002202172650001902194650001402213650001402227650001502241650001002256650004202266650002302308650001602331650001302347651001002360653001702370653001902387700002402406700002002430700002002450700002402470700002602494773009302520856008502613852000902698655001202707IND60690761520221207093913.0200508e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069076152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e006052doi7 aPMC59681722pmcid7 a298623662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeandro, Tânia10aStudy of methanogenic enrichment cultures of rock cores from the deep subsurface of the Iberian Pyritic Belt  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwo deep boreholes were drilled at 320 and 620 meters below surface in the Iberian Pyritic Belt (IPB) at Peña de Hierro (Huelva, Southwestern Spain). Cores were sampled and used for the establishment of enrichment cultures with methanogenic activity. The cultivable diversity of these enrichments was accessed using different cultivation techniques and several isolates were recovered in pure culture from various depths in both boreholes. Although no archaeal isolates were obtained in pure culture, strict anaerobes and facultative anaerobic bacteria belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were isolated and identified using the 16S rRNA gene sequence.Analysis of three selected enrichment cultures by amplification of both bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene followed by pyrosequencing revealed further information on the populations enriched. The archaeal sequences obtained from the methanogenic enrichment cultures belonged to the orders Methanosarcinales and Methanocellales. To best of our knowledge this is the first report of enrichment in members of the Methanocellales in a deep terrestrial subsurface ecosystem. Several bacterial populations, predominantly consisting of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, were also enriched. The prevalent microbial populations enriched as detected by pyrosequencing analysis, as well as the bacterial isolates cultivated were affiliated with known fermentative, sulfate reducing and acetogenic bacteria or methanogenic archaea. Our results show a great diversity in the microbial communities of the IPB deep subsurface.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aActinobacteria 3aBacteroidetes 3aFirmicutes 3aMethanocellales 3aMethanosarcinales 3aProteobacteria 3aacetogens 3aanaerobes 3aecosystems 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3asulfates 3aSpain 0aMicrobiology 0aEarth sciences1 aRodríguez, Núria,1 aRojas, Patricia1 aSanz, José L.,1 ada Costa, Milton S.1 aAmils, R.q(Ricardo),0 tHeliyon.g2018 Apr., v. 4, no. 4 p.e00605-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e006053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245006100161300001300222520157400235592002801809650001301837650002201850650001401872650001201886650001401898650002601912650003501938650001401973650001501987650001302002650000702015650001302022650001402035650001102049650001702060650001802077650002202095650001702117650001202134650001502146650002302161650001002184651000902194653001702203653002802220653002802248653001702276653001702293700001902310700001502329700001602344700001702360773010802377856007902485852000902564655001202573IND60481024520160819000000.0160201e20160126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048102452DNAL7 a10.1515/cerce-2015-00362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadeghi, A.10aSoil and Water Salinization in Ghaleh Ghazi Region, Iran  ap. 5-12.  aApproximately 34% of soils in Asia are influenced by salts. With about 25 million ha of saline and alkaline lands, about 15% of the country, Iran has the most saline lands in Asia after China, India, and Pakistan due to its geographical position, climate and human activities. This research was done due to determine the effective factors on soil and water salinization. At the first the boundaries of this region were characterized using GIS, then landuses were determined for field survey and also soil sampling in nine landuses were done according to both factors of planting pattern and water resources in each unit. The soil profile was prepared and soil samples were obtained from surface depths of (0 - 50 cm) and some factors such as soil texture EC, SAR, pH, CaCO₃, Cl and potassium were measured. For study of water resources some samples were obtained from 30 wells and also from upland runoff, then soil and water sample were analyzed and some parameters such as EC, SAR, Cl⁻ and pH were measured. Finally, according to data base, geological map, topography map, landuse map, soil and water measured data and also field studies, soil and water salinization schedule and region status were investigated. The results showed that important factors influencing water salinization in Ghaleh Ghazi region (Iran) are geological formations located in aquifer recharge and climate condition. Important factors of soil salinization in region are irrigation with saline water, improper irrigation method, unsuitable planting method, climate condition and landform.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acalcium carbonate 3achlorides 3aclimate 3adatabases 3afield experimentation 3ageographic information systems 3ahighlands 3airrigation 3aland use 3apH 3aplanting 3apotassium 3arunoff 3asaline water 3asoil profiles 3asoil salinization 3asoil texture 3asurveys 3atopography 3awater salinization 3awells 3aIran 0aSalinization 0aElectrical conductivity 0aSodium absorption ratio 0aGhaleh Ghazi 0aBandar Abbas1 aZehtabian, Gh.1 aMoradi, N.1 aNohegar, A.1 aKhosravi, H.0 tCercetări agronomice în Moldova.g2016 Jan. 26, v. 48, no. 3 p.5-12dDe Gruyter Openx2067-18657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/cerce-2015-00363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02178naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245014400178300001800322520116000340592002801500650002301528650002001551650001901571650001601590700002201606700002801628700002001656773010501676856008601781852000901867655001201876IND60583298020221118094301.0171010e20171010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058329802DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.7b016392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOleszko-Torbus, Natalia10aControl of the Crystalline Properties of 2-Isopropyl-2-oxazoline Copolymers in Condensed State and in Solution Depending on the Composition  ap. 7636-7645.  aCopolymers of 2-isopropyl- (iPrOx) and 2-n-propyl-2-oxazoline (nPrOx) were obtained, and attempts to control their crystallization both in condensed state and in solution were made. The homopolymer of nPrOx showed a weaker crystallization tendency than PiPrOx; nevertheless, the frequently encountered assumption that it is completely amorphous and is not able to crystallize was found to be unjustified. By increasing the amount of nPrOx in copolymers, their crystallization ability decreased both in the condensed state and in solution. The highest degree of crystallization was achieved for copolymer iPrOx/nPrOx of the composition 85:15 mol %, and χc values of ∼60% in condensed state and ∼45% in water were obtained. On the other hand, for the copolymer with 50 mol % of nPrOx no crystalline fraction was observed, even when it was subjected to mild thermal treatment, both in the condensed state and in solution. However, when copolymers were subjected to more rigorous external conditions, such as exposure to high, predefined temperature for a significantly extended time, the crystallization of seemingly amorphous copolymer could be forced.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3acrystallization 3aheat treatment 3atemperature1 aWałach, Wojciech1 aUtrata-Wesołek, Alicja1 aDworak, Andrzej0 tMacromolecules.g2017 Oct. 10, v. 50, no. 19 p.7636-7645dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.7b016393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245009300165300002000258520126700278592002801545650000801573650005201581650001601633650002601649650002001675650002601695650002101721650001801742650001501760650002101775653002501796653003001821653001201851653001501863653001501878653002301893700002001916700005601936700005801992700006002050773014202110856007902252852000902331655001202340IND60754966020221119162052.0211027e20211018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075496602DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c175742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Zhong Wei10a2D MOF-Based Photoelectrochemical Aptasensor for SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein Detection  ap. 49754-49761.  aA reliable and sensitive detection approach for SARS-CoV 2 is essential for timely infection diagnosis and transmission prevention. Here, a two-dimensional (2D) metal–organic framework (MOF)-based photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor with high sensitivity and stability for SARS-CoV 2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) detection was developed. The PEC aptasensor was constructed by a plasmon-enhanced photoactive material (namely, Au NPs/Yb-TCPP) with a specific DNA aptamer against S protein. The Au NPs/Yb-TCPP fabricated by in situ growth of Au NPs on the surface of 2D Yb-TCPP nanosheets showed a high electron–hole (e–h) separation efficiency due to the enhancement effect of plasmon, resulting in excellent photoelectric performance. The modified DNA aptamer on the surface of Au NPs/Yb-TCPP can bind with S protein with high selectivity, thus decreasing the photocurrent of the system due to the high steric hindrance and low conductivity of the S protein. The established PEC aptasensor demonstrated a highly sensitive detection for S protein with a linear response range of 0.5–8 μg/mL with a detection limit of 72 ng/mL. This work presented a promising way for the detection of SARS-CoV 2, which may conduce to the impetus of clinic diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aaptasensors 3acoordination polymers 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3aelectric current 3aglycoproteins 3ananosheets 3aoligonucleotides 0aphotoelectrochemical 0ametal−organic framework 0aplasmon 0aaptasensor 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aspike glycoprotein1 aZhao, Ting Ting1 aLi, Chun Mei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3168-29001 aLi, Yuan-Fang,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5710-44231 aHuang, Cheng Zhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1260-59340 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Oct. 18, v. 13, no. 42 p.49754-49761dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c175743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01971naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245016900177300001600346520071700362592002801079650002001107650002401127650002501151650001401176650002001190650001801210650001501228650001201243650001101255650001101266650002401277650001201301700002601313700002801339773012701367856008201494852000901576655001201585IND60089509420221116150644.0141102e20120106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008950942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.12.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatthanasurorot, Apiruck12aA mammalian like interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK-4), a TIR signaling mediator in intestinal innate immunity of black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon)  ap. 623-629.  aInterleukin-1 receptor associated kinase-4 (IRAK-4) has been identified as a central signal transduction mediator of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) pathways in vertebrate innate immunity. An IRAK-4 homologue was cloned from the black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) (PmIRAK-4) and it shares domains and structures with other IRAK-4s. It was found to be mainly expressed in the hemocytes and midgut but also to a lower extent in several other tissues in shrimp. The PmIRAK-4 responded to bacterial infection in the intestine by an enhancement of its expression level. These results indicate that PmIRAK-4 may play a role at least in the intestinal innate immunity of P. monodon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPenaeus monodon 3aToll-like receptors 3abacterial infections 3ahemocytes 3ainnate immunity 3ainterleukin-1 3aintestines 3amammals 3amidgut 3ashrimp 3asignal transduction 3atissues1 aSöderhäll, Kenneth,1 aJiravanichpaisal, Pikul0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Jan. 6, v. 417, no. 1 p.623-629dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.12.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04609naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245016300173520241200336592002802748650002802776650001602804650001402820650001902834650001002853650001802863650001602881650002602897650002902923650002002952650001602972650001602988650001703004650002003021650002103041650001903062650002103081650001803102650001403120650000903134650001103143650002903154650002003183650001603203651001003219653001303229653000903242653002803251653002003279653001503299700002103314700002003335700001803355700002503373700002303398700001703421700002703438700002103465700001903486700002103505700001803526700002603544700001903570700002103589700001903610700002303629773010503652856008503757852000903842655001203851IND60731389820221118190756.0210708e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073138982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2021.1064842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernardini, Ilaria14aThe new PFAS C6O4 and its effects on marine invertebrates: First evidence of transcriptional and microbiota changes in the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum  aThere is growing concern for the wide use ofperfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) because of its toxic effects on the environment and on human health. A new compound – the so called C6O4 (perfluoro ([5-methoxy-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]oxy) acetic acid) - was recently introduced as one of the alternative to traditional PFOA, however this was done without any scientific evidence of the effects of C6O4 when dispersed into the environment. Recently, the Regional Agency for the Protection of the Environment of Veneto (Italy) detected high levels of C6O4 in groundwater and in the Po river, increasing the alarm for the potential effects of this chemical into the natural environment. The present study investigates for the first time the effects of C6O4 on the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum exposed to environmental realistic concentrations of C6O4 (0.1 µg/L and 1 µg/L) for 7 and 21 days. Furthermore, in order to better understand if C6O4 is a valid and less hazardous alternative to its substitute, microbial and transcriptomic alterations were also investigated in clams exposed to 1 µg/L ofPFOA. Results indicate that C6O4 may cause significant perturbations to the digestive gland microbiota, likely determining the impairment of host physiological homeostasis. Despite chemical analyses suggest a 5 times lower accumulation potential of C604 as compared to PFOA in clam soft tissues, transcriptional analyses reveal several alterations of gene expression profile. A large part of the altered pathways, including immune response, apoptosis regulation, nervous system development, lipid metabolism and cell membrane is the same in C6O4 and PFOA exposed clams. In addition, clams exposed to C6O4 showed dose-dependent responses as well as possible narcotic or neurotoxic effects and reduced activation of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism. Overall, the present study suggests that the potential risks for marine organism following environmental contamination are not reduced by replacing PFOA with C6O4. In addition, the detection of both C6O4 and PFOA into tissues of clams inhabiting the Lagoon of Venice - where there are no point sources of either compounds - recommends a similar capacity to spread throughout the environment. These results prompt the urgent need to re-evaluate the use of C6O4 as it may represent not only an environmental hazard but also a potential risk for human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRuditapes philippinarum 3aacetic acid 3aapoptosis 3acell membranes 3aclams 3adose response 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental hazards 3aenvironmental protection 3agene expression 3agroundwater 3ahomeostasis 3ahuman health 3aimmune response 3alipid metabolism 3amicroorganisms 3aneurodevelopment 3aneurotoxicity 3apollution 3arisk 3arivers 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics 3axenobiotics 3aItaly 0aNew PFAS 0aC6O4 0aRuditapes philippinarum 0aGene expression 0aMicrobiota1 aMatozzo, Valerio1 aValsecchi, Sara1 aPeruzza, Luca1 aRovere, Giulia Dalla1 aPolesello, Stefano1 aIori, Silvia1 aMarin, Maria Gabriella1 aFabrello, Jacopo1 aCiscato, Maria1 aMasiero, Luciano1 aBonato, Marco1 aSantovito, Gianfranco1 aBoffo, Luciano1 aBargelloni, Luca1 aMilan, Massimo1 aPatarnello, Tomaso0 tEnvironment international.g2021 July, v. 152 p.106484-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.1064843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009400166520174700260592002802007650002702035650001602062650001302078650002102091650002202112650001402134650001402148650002002162650001002182650001402192650003502206650002202241650001502263650002302278650003802301651001002339653002702349653003902376653002602415653002102441700001202462700001602474700001802490700001802508700001202526700001602538700001402554773012102568856008502689852000902774655001202783IND60781837020221119075802.0220816e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078183702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2022.1051572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Jiamei10aSDH mutations confer complex cross-resistance patterns to SDHIs in Corynespora cassiicola  aSuccinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs) are one of the most frequently used fungicides in cucumber fields in China. Our previous studies indicated that the sensitivity profile of Corynespora cassiicola, the causal agent of Corynespora leaf spot, to different SDHIs varied greatly; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The 50% effective concentration (EC₅₀) values of boscalid, fluopyram, fluxapyroxad and isopyrazam in C. cassiicola collected from 2017 to 2020 shifted, with resistance frequencies of 79.83%, 78.43%, 83.19% and 49.86%, respectively. The sequence alignment of sdhB/C/D of resistant strains revealed that eight single amino acid mutations (B-H278Y/L, B-I280V, C-S73P, C-N75S, C-H134R, D-D95E and D-G109V), and three dual-mutations (B-I280V&C-S73P, B-I280V&C-N75S and C-S73P&C-N75S) conferred various SDHI resistance levels and cross-resistance profiles. The expression level of the sdhB/C/D gene and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity in the mutants were significantly altered by the presence of SDHIs, compared with the wild type strain. Additionally, molecular docking results suggested that the missense mutation influenced the crystal structure of SDH and subsequently interfered with the interaction bonds and bond distances among the target protein and chemicals. In brief, amino acid mutations altered the fungicide response of target gene expression, SDH activity and the binding features of SDH-ligand complexes and subsequently conferred multiple resistance levels and complex cross-resistance patterns to SDHIs in C. cassiicola. The evaluation of C. cassiicola resistance to SDHIs provided a significant foundation for efficient chemical development and integrated CLS management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynespora cassiicola 3aamino acids 3aboscalid 3across resistance 3acrystal structure 3acucumbers 3afluopyram 3agene expression 3agenes 3aleaf spot 3amedian effective concentration 3amissense mutation 3aphysiology 3asequence alignment 3asuccinate dehydrogenase (quinone) 3aChina 0aCorynespora cassiicola 0aSuccinate dehydrogenase inhibitors 0aResistance monitoring 0aBinding features1 aLi, Jin1 aMa, Dicheng1 aGao, Yangyang1 aCheng, Jiagao1 aMu, Wei1 aLi, Beixing1 aLiu, Feng0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2022 Aug., v. 186 p.105157-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2022.1051573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02248naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245008900164300001600253520119800269592002801467650002101495650002301516650003001539650002201569650001101591650001301602650001301615650001401628650001001642650001101652651001401663773013201677856008001809852000901889655001201898IND60651344520221117215939.0190711e20140414xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065134452DNAL7 a10.3390/resources30203952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGumley, Wayne13aAn Analysis of Regulatory Strategies for Recycling and Re-Use of Metals in Australia  ap. 395-415.  aThis article considers regulatory strategies that promote more efficient use of material inputs within the Australian economy, with particular focus on recycling and recovery of metals, drawing upon the concept of a “circular economy”. It briefly reviews the nature of regulation and trends in regulatory strategies within changing policy contexts, and then examines the regulatory framework applicable to the various phases in the life cycle of metals, ranging from extraction of minerals to processing and assimilation of metals into finished products, through to eventual disposal of products as waste. Discussion focuses upon the regulatory strategies applied in each phase and the changing roles of government and business operators within global distribution networks. It is concluded that the prevailing political agenda favoring deregulation and reduced taxation may be a major barrier to development of new styles of regulation and more effective use of taxation powers that is needed to support a more circular economy in metals. The implication for future research is the need to substantiate the outcomes of reflexive regulatory strategies with well-designed empirical studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular economy 3aempirical research 3ageographical distribution 3aissues and policy 3ametals 3aminerals 3apolitics 3arecycling 3ataxes 3awastes 3aAustralia0 tResources.g2014 Apr. 14, v. 3, no. 2 p.395-415dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21558x2079-92767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources30203953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245008900168500001900257520101600276592002801292650001301320650001201333650001801345650001801363650001101381653005201392653003001444653002501474653002701499653002301526700001201549700001701561700001401578700001401592700001301606700001501619700001301634700001901647700001601666773010601682856008701788852000901875655001201884IND60717693020221118022706.0201213e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071769302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1244072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wenda10aPerformance of DOuble Circulation Anaerobic Sludge bed reactor: Biomass self-balance  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe calcification of Anaerobic Granular Sludge is a serious problem in the application of anaerobic methanization biotechnology. Regular replacement of calcified sludge with exogenous sludge is an effective method, but it is costly and troublesome. A new DOuble Circulation Anaerobic Sludge bed reactor was developed for the enhanced production of endogenous sludge to self-balance the discharge of calcified sludge. The sludge washout rate was demonstrated to fall by 45% and the sludge proliferation rate was shown to rise by 230%, offsetting the regular discharge of calcified sludge. The zoogloea in 100 μm dimension was revealed to be the intermediate component of sludge. The sludge proliferation mode was proposed as follows: (i) Growth of sludge; (ii) Self-cracking of sludge to release fragmental sludge; (iii) Migration of fragmental sludge by self-floatation; (iv) Accumulation of suspended sludge in the sedimentation chamber; (v) Re-granulation of suspended sludge with the aid of Venturi effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZoogloea 3abiomass 3abiotechnology 3acalcification 3asludge 0aDOuble Circulation Anaerobic Sludge bed reactor 0aAnaerobic granular sludge 0aSludge calcification 0aIntermediate component 0aProliferation mode1 aYu, Tao1 aXu, Dongdong1 aLi, Wenji1 aPan, Chao1 aLi, Yiyu1 aZeng, Zhuo1 aKang, Da1 aShan, Shengdao1 aZheng, Ping0 tBioresource technology.g2021 Jan., v. 320 p.124407-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1244073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245012400161300002000285520151800305592002801823650002501851650001101876650001601887650001201903650001201915650001401927650001601941650001901957650001101976653003201987653002402019653002502043653003602068653003002104700001602134700001902150700006002169700001402229700005802243700005402301700005402355773014202409856007902551852000902630655001202639IND60754966120221119161943.0211027e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075496612DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c186732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Jianpeng10aControlled Assembly of Conjugated Ladder Molecules with Different Bridging Structures toward Optoelectronic Application  ap. 50197-50205.  aStructural design of organic π-conjugated small molecules allows the energy band structure and electronic properties of the molecules to be tuned as needed, which provides a feasible strategy for enhancing the performance of optoelectronic devices. The introduction of bridging structures is a common structural modification method to adjust the rigidity and coplanarity of the molecular backbone, thus affecting the molecular packing. However, patterning of organic single-crystalline microstructures based on conjugated ladder molecules with different bridging structures still remains challenging for large-area integration of optoelectronic devices. In this paper, a controlled dewetting process is applied to obtain organic single-crystalline arrays with precise positioning and a regular morphology based on two isomers with silicon–oxygen bridging and their two carbon–oxygen-bridged analogues. Molecules with different bridging structures show disparate packing models due to the difference of dihedral angles and ring tensions. A microwire-array ultraviolet photodetector based on the oxygen–silicon-bridging ladder molecule exhibits a high light on/off ratio of 24 and a responsivity of 0.63 mA W–¹ owing to the effective π–π stacking governed by the molecular planarity. This work not only provides a universal method for the integration of organic optoelectronic devices but also explains the effect of bridging structure engineering on molecular assembly and optoelectronic performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectronic equipment 3aenergy 3aexhibitions 3aisomers 3aladders 3amaterials 3amethodology 3amicrostructure 3amodels 0aladder conjugated molecules 0abridging structures 0acontrolled dewetting 0asingle-crystal microwire arrays 0aultraviolet photodetector1 aGao, Hanfei1 aFeng, Jiangang1 aZhang, Shou-Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6034-50411 aWang, Lin1 aZhao, Dongbing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2583-15751 aWu, Yuchen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3451-70621 aJiang, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4579-728X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 13, no. 42 p.50197-50205dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c186733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011200159300001600271520188200287592002802169650003202197650001702229650001502246650002002261650001502281650001402296650001602310650001702326650001602343650001202359651002002371700001802391700001902409773013302428856007302561852000902634655001202643IND60419342120221119234545.0151002e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041934212DNAL7 a10.1111/ajr.122312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Saravana10aClinical supervision of allied health professionals in country South Australia: A mixed methods pilot study  ap. 265-271.  aINTRODUCTION: Recent times have witnessed dramatic changes in health care with overt recognition for quality and safety to underpin health care service delivery. In addition to systems‐wide focus, the importance of supporting and mentoring people delivering the care has also been recognised. This can be achieved through quality clinical supervision. In 2010, Country Health South Australia Local Health Network developed a holistic allied health clinical governance structure, which was implemented in 2011. OBJECTIVE: This research reports on emergent findings from the evaluation of the clinical governance structure, which included mandating clinical supervision for all allied health staff. METHODS: A mixed method approach was chosen with evaluation of the impact of clinical supervision undertaken by a psychometrically sound instrument (Manchester Clinical Supervision Scale 26‐item version), collected through an anonymous online survey and qualitative data collected through semistructured interviews and focus groups. RESULTS: Overall, 189 allied health professionals responded to the survey. Survey responses indicated allied health professionals recognised the importance of and valued receiving clinical supervision (normative domain), had levels of trust and rapport with, and were supported by supervisors (restorative domain) and positively affected their delivery of care and improvement in skills (formative domain). Qualitative data identified enablers such as profession specific gains, improved opportunities and consistency for clinical supervision and barriers such as persistent organisational issues, lack of clarity (delineation of roles) and communication issues. CONCLUSION: The findings from this research highlight that while clinical supervision has an important role to play, it is not a panacea for all the ills of the health care system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallied health professionals 3afocus groups 3agovernance 3ahealth services 3ainterviews 3amentoring 3aoccupations 3arural health 3asupervisors 3asurveys 3aSouth Australia1 aOsborne, Kate1 aLehmann, Tanya0 tAustralian journal of rural health.g2015 Oct., v. 23, no. 5 p.265-271dAssociation for Australian Rural Nursesx1038-52827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajr.122313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009000173300001600263520141000279592002801689650000901717650002101726650002701747650002201774650001201796651001801808773014501826856008401971852000902055655001202064IND60123403820221120102629.0150325e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012340382DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2012.6634582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeador, Michael R.10aEffectiveness of Seining after Electrofishing to Characterize Stream Fish Communities  ap. 177-185.  aThe richness and composition of species collected uniquely to electrofishing and subsequent seining efforts were examined at 271 stream sites across the USA by using wadeable electrofishing methods (backpack or barge electrofishing) or boat electrofishing followed by seining. Seining after wadeable electrofishing resulted in the collection of new species at 42% of sites, whereas seining after boat electrofishing resulted in the collection of new species at 87% of sites. Mean percentage of total observed fish species richness that was collected uniquely by seining was 6% (representing one new species, on average) after wadeable electrofishing compared with 18% (four new species, on average) after boat electrofishing. Shannon–Wiener diversity index values were not significantly different between data from combined sampling (electrofishing and seining) and data from wadeable electrofishing (P = 0.490) but were significantly different between boat electrofishing and combined sampling (P = 0.004). Seining efforts after boat electrofishing can provide critical information that allows for a more complete characterization of the fish community. For sampling in wadeable streams, decisions regarding the use of seines should consider the effectiveness of electrofishing at a given site and the use of seines as an alternative primary sampling gear rather than as a supplement to electrofishing.  aPublisher supplied data 3afish 3afish communities 3anew geographic records 3aspecies diversity 3astreams 3aUnited States0 tNorth American journal of fisheries management.g2012 Feb. 1, v. 32, no. 1 p.177-185dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:19701x1548-86757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2012.6634583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245015900169300001800328520142300346592002801769650002501797650001801822650002501840650002201865650001701887650001201904650001301916650001101929650002101940650001301961650004401974650002202018650001902040650001702059700002302076700001902099700002302118700001902141700002702160700003202187700002902219700002602248700003402274700002602308700003102334700002102365700002502386773011802411856007502529852000902604655001202613IND60550334120171214000000.0160910e20140404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055033412DNAL7 a10.1021/jo402677w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeña-Rodríguez, Luis M.10aIsotopologue Profiling of Triterpene Formation under Physiological Conditions. Biosynthesis of Lupeol-3-(3′-R-hydroxy)-stearate in Pentalinon andrieuxii  ap. 2864-2873.  aThe biosynthesis of lupeol-3-(3′R-hydroxy)-stearate (procrim b, 1) was investigated in the Mexican medicinal plant Pentalinon andrieuxii by ¹³CO₂ pulse-chase experiments. NMR analyses revealed positional enrichments of ¹³C₂-isotopologues in both the triterpenoid and the hydroxystearate moieties of 1. Five of the six isoprene units reflected a pattern with [1,2-¹³C₂]- and [3,5-¹³C₂]-isotopologues from the respective C₅-precursors, IPP and DMAPP, whereas one isoprene unit in the ring E of 1 showed only the [3,5-¹³C₂]-connectivity of the original C₅-precursor, due to rearrangement of the dammarenyl cation intermediate during the cyclization process. The presence of ¹³C₂-isotopologues was indicative of [¹³C₂]acetyl-CoA being the precursor units in the formation of the fatty acid moiety and of the triterpene via the mevalonate route. The observed labeling pattern was in agreement with a chair-chair-chair-boat conformation of the (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene precursor during the cyclization process, suggesting that the lupeol synthase from P. andrieuxii is of the same type as that from Olea europea and Taraxacum officinale, but different from that of Arabidopsis thaliana. The study shows that ¹³CO₂ pulse-chase experiments are powerful in elucidating, under in vivo conditions and in a single experiment, the biosynthesis of complex plant products including higher terpenes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aOlea europaea 3aTaraxacum officinale 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3abiosynthesis 3acations 3aisoprene 3alupeol 3amedicinal plants 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganic chemistry 3aplant products 3astearic acid1 aYam-Puc, Alejandro1 aKnispel, Nihat1 aSchramek, Nicholas1 aHuber, Claudia1 aGraßberger, Christoph1 aRamírez-Torres, Fabiola G.1 aEscalante-Erosa, Fabiola1 aGarcía-Sosa, Karlina1 aHiebert-Giesbrecht, Mickel R.1 aChan-Bacab, Manuel J.1 aGodoy-Hernández, Gregorio1 aBacher, Adelbert1 aEisenreich, Wolfgang0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2014 Apr. 04, v. 79, no. 7 p.2864-2873dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo402677w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02328naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245010600212300001600318506007600334520087900410592002801289506003701317650002501354650001701379650002801396650001801424650001501442650001501457650001001472650001701482650000901499650002101508650002101529650001401550700002401564700001901588700001901607700002501626773012801651856008201779852000901861655001201870IND60089509520221207085315.0141102e20120113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008950952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.11.0992doi7 aPMC32591482pmcid7 a221552412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaskow, Belinda J.10aDiverse biological activities of the vascular non-inflammatory molecules – The Vanin pantetheinases  ap. 653-658.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Vanin genes are a family that encode pantetheinases involved in recycling Coenzyme A, catalysing the breakdown of intermediate pantetheine to vitamin B5 for reuse in CoA biosynthesis. The role of pantetheinase in this most fundamental of cellular processes, was substantially characterised by the 1970s. The next 20years saw little further interest in pantetheinase until various genetic studies implicated the Vanin locus in a range of normal and disease phenotypes, and a consequent interest in the other product of pantetheinase activity, cysteamine. This report seeks to bring together the early biochemical studies with recent biological data implicating cysteamine as a regulator of the oxidative state of a cell. Numerous studies now report a role for Vanin in inflammation, oxidative stress, cell migration and numerous diseases including cardiovascular disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioactive properties 3abiosynthesis 3acardiovascular diseases 3acell movement 3acoenzyme A 3acysteamine 3agenes 3ainflammation 3aloci 3aoxidative stress 3apantothenic acid 3aphenotype1 aMichael Proffit, J.1 aBlangero, John1 aMoses, Eric K.1 aAbraham, Lawrence J.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Jan. 13, v. 417, no. 2 p.653-658dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.11.0993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245009000162300001600252520168200268592002801950650001501978650001601993650001702009650001602026650002002042650001702062650002202079650001802101650001802119650001802137650001102155650002202166650001502188650002002203650001302223650001502236700001802251700001702269700002402286700001902310700001602329773010802345856007502453852000902528655001202537IND60529612920221119041018.0160717e20140107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052961292DNAL7 a10.1021/ac402338u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayampurath, Anoop10aComputational Framework for Identification of Intact Glycopeptides in Complex Samples  ap. 453-463.  aGlycosylation is an important protein modification that involves enzymatic attachment of sugars to amino acid residues. Understanding the structure of these sugars and the effects of glycosylation are vital for developing indicators of disease development and progression. Although computational methods based on mass spectrometric data have proven to be effective in monitoring changes in the glycome, developing such methods for the glycoproteome are challenging, largely due to the inherent complexity in simultaneously studying glycan structures with their corresponding glycosylation sites. This paper introduces a computational framework for identifying intact N-linked glycopeptides, i.e. glycopeptides with N-linked glycans attached to their glycosylation sites, in complex proteome samples. Scoring algorithms are presented for tandem mass spectra of glycopeptides resulting from collision-induced dissociation (CID), higher-energy C-trap dissociation (HCD), and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) fragmentation modes. An empirical false-discovery rate estimation method, based on a target-decoy search approach, is derived for assigning confidence. The power of our method is further enhanced when multiple data sets are pooled together to increase identification confidence. Using this framework, 103 highly confident N-linked glycopeptides from 53 sites across 33 glycoproteins were identified in complex human serum proteome samples using conventional proteomic platforms with standard depletion of the 7-most abundant proteins. These results indicate that our method is ready to be used for characterizing site-specific protein glycosylation in complex samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aamino acids 3aamino sugars 3ablood serum 3adata collection 3adissociation 3aelectron transfer 3aglycopeptides 3aglycoproteins 3aglycosylation 3ahumans 3amass spectrometry 3amonitoring 3apolysaccharides 3aproteome 3aproteomics1 aYu, Chuan-Yih1 aSong, Ehwang1 aBalan, Jagadheshwar1 aMechref, Yehia1 aTang, Haixu0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 Jan. 07, v. 86, no. 1 p.453-463dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac402338u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245013700165300002000302500001500322520208500337592002802422650002802450650001402478650001602492650001502508650002102523650001902544650001302563650001802576650002302594653001402617700002002631700002302651773012902674856008202803852000902885655001202894IND60576435420221118052007.0170804e20170706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057643542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b026682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiswas, Sourav10aUnique Multilayered Assembly Consisting of “Flower-Like” Ferrite Nanoclusters Conjugated with MWCNT as Millimeter Wave Absorbers  ap. 13998-14009.  a2019-12-06  aUnique multilayered assembly was designed here using polymeric blends containing “flower-like” ferrite nanoparticles conjugated with multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) for attenuating 99.999% of the incoming electromagnetic (EM) radiation. In comparison to a traditional single layered structure, this unique assembly is superior for myriad applications related to suppressing the incoming EM radiation, mostly by absorption. The three key requirementsimpedance wave matching, absorption, and multiple scattering from the heterogeneous structureswere accounted here by suitably modifying the nanomaterials. A bicomponent blend consisting of two immiscible polymers, polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF) and polycarbonate (PC), was used here to construct the multilayered assembly wherein selective localization of nanoparticles in one of the components, driven by thermodynamics, reduced the percolation threshold of the nanoparticles. In order to improve the impedance matching, MWCNTs were functionalized using the defect sites induced by harsh chemical treatment and incorporated in PC/PVDF blends as the inner layer of the multilayered assembly. The conjugation of flower-like Fe₃O₄ nanoclusters on the defect sites of the surface functionalized MWCNTs absorbs the incident EM waves due to the interfacial polarization of different heterogeneous structures. The value of total loss tangent, attenuation constant, and absorption coefficient supports absorption driven shielding in PC/PVDF blends. The efficient thermal dissipation together with high absorption led to fix this as the intermediate layer of the assembly. Finally, multiple scattering through the network of pristine MWCNTs was utilized as the outermost layer of the assembly, which guided the penetrated waves to interact with this layer resulting in maximum attenuation. This unique three-layered assembly, which exhibited a shielding effectiveness of −64 dB at 18 GHz for 0.9 mm thickness, powered by multifunctionality, offer amendable replacement of the existing solution related to EM absorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aferrimagnetic materials 3afluorides 3airon oxides 3aabsorption 3acarbon nanotubes 3athermodynamics 3apolymers 3ananoparticles 3achemical treatment 0aimpedance1 aPanja, Sujit S.1 aBose, Suryasarathi0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 July 06, v. 121, no. 26 p.13998-14009dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.7b026683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01462naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007800170300001600248520060000264592002800864650001700892650001300909650001000922650001800932773015200950856008501102852000901187655001201196IND60779099220221120093757.0220604e20220603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077909922DNAL7 a10.25226/bboc.v142i2.2022.a32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Grouw, Hein14aThe colourful journey of the Eurasian Collared Dove Streptopelia decaocto  ap. 164-189.  aIn the 18th and 19th centuries the Eurasian Collared Dove Streptopelia decaocto was widely considered to be the wild ancestor of the domesticated Barbary Dove (domestic S. risoria), and even following its recognition as a species its taxonomic status was a source of confusion. Since 1900, and the species' massive geographic expansion (both naturally and by introduction) the two taxa have occasionally met.

We have reported that p53 activates ARID3A transcription, and ARID3A overexpression induces G1 arrest. However, the role of ARID3A in the p53 pathway remains unclear. Here, we show that ARID3A cooperates with p53 to transcriptionally activate p21ᵂᴬF¹, a p53-target gene important for cell-cycle arrest. ARID3A bound to its binding sites in the p21ᵂᴬF¹ promoter in vivo and in vitro, and induced p21ᵂᴬF¹ transcription in U2OS cells expressing wild-type p53 but not Saos-2 cells lacking p53. The co-expression of ARID3A with p53 cooperates to activate p21ᵂᴬF¹ transcription and the stably transfected p21ᵂᴬF¹ promoter. Mutation of the ARID3A binding sites reduced the p21ᵂᴬF¹ promoter activity, and siRNA-based ARID3A knockdown suppressed the transcription of p21ᵂᴬF¹, but not the proapoptotic NOXA and PUMA in response to DNA damage. Furthermore, p53 knockdown decreased ARID3A transcription, and, conversely, ARID3A overexpression and knockdown resulted in an increase or decrease in p53 stability, respectively. These results indicate both cooperative and interdependent roles for ARID3A and p53 in the transcriptional activation of p21ᵂᴬF¹ in response to DNA damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aapoptosis 3abinding sites 3acell cycle 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3amutation 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptional activation1 aIchwan, Solachuddin J.A.1 aOtsu, Megumi1 aYamada, Shumpei1 aIseki, Sachiko1 aShimizu, Shihoko1 aIkeda, Masa-Aki0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Jan. 13, v. 417, no. 2 p.710-716dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01977naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001600135245005800151300001600209500002000225520103500245592002801280650001901308650002501327650001301352650001001365651001701375700001601392700001601408700001601424773013001440852000901570856007201579655001201651IND9202988120221119234559.0211024e199008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920298812DNAL7 a10.2307/32357882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMidgley, J.10aFine‐grain pattern in Southern Cape plateau forests  ap. 539-546.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRegeneration levels, size class distributions and a nearest neighbour technique were used to describe apreliminary dynamics frameworkfortheplateauforests. Taken over a large area, most of the canopy dominants have a negative exponential distribution of stems > 10 cm dbh per size class. In small (0.04 ha) plots, if present as more than one stem, most species are present as both canopy (> 25 cm dbh) and understorey (10–15 cm dbh) individuals. The canopy dominants maintain their rank in the bank of advance regeneration (> 5 cm height < 10 cm dbh). However, relative numbers of all regeneration of most canopy individuals are not strongly correlated with canopy closure or local abundance of conspecific adults. The mean area of nearest neighbour polygons of canopy individuals around saplings of the more common species are small. In conclusion, most species appearto be shade tolerant and locally persistent conferring a fine grain on this forest. We support recent questioning of universality of the gaps/non gaps paradigm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforest ecology 3anatural regeneration 3aplateaus 3ashade 3aSouth Africa1 aSeydack, A.1 aReynell, D.1 aMcKelly, D.0 tJournal of vegetation science.g1990 Aug., v. 1, no. 4 p.539-546dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl46820x1100-92337nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2307/32357883Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01917naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245009700164300001800261520088400279592002801163650001401191650002101205650004401226650001101270650001901281650001301300700002001313700002601333700003201359773010501391856008601496852000901582655001201591IND60583298320221118094258.0171010e20171010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058329832DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.7b016552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Bin10aSynthesis of Polyisobutylene Bottlebrush Polymers via Ring-Opening Metathesis Polymerization  ap. 7458-7467.  aPolyisobutylene (PIB)-based bottlebrush polymers were synthesized via ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of norbornene- and oxanorbornene-terminated PIB macromonomers (MM) initiated by Grubbs third-generation catalyst ((H₂IMes₂)(pyr)₂(Cl)₂RuCHPh) (G3). While both MMs reached greater than 97% conversion as measured by ¹H NMR, the rate of propagation of PIB norbornene was measured to be 2.9 times greater than that of PIB oxanorbornene MMs of similar molecular weight (MW). The slower rate of propagation of the oxanorbornene MM was attributed to interaction between the electron-rich oxygen bridge and the metal center of G3, which slowed but did not inhibit polymerization. Both types of MMs demonstrated controlled/“living” polymerization behavior, and brush polymers with MWs up to ∼700 kg/mol with narrow dispersity (Đ ≤ 1.04) were achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxygen 3apolymerization 3apolymers1 aAbel, Brooks A.1 aMcCormick, Charles L.1 aStorey, R.

We quantified 24 targeted PFAS, including 7 branched PFOS isomers, 2 branched PFOA isomers and 2 components of F-53B, in blood plasma. Five reproductive hormones, including total testosterone (TT), estradiol (E₂), follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and insulin like factor 3 (INSL3), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were measured in serum. Associations were first assessed by confounder-adjusted multiple linear regression while correcting for multiple comparisons. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) and adaptive elastic net (AENET) were further used to assess mixture effects and the adjusted exposure response (ER) relationship of individual PFAS.After adjusting for confounders, we found that PFAS mixture was significantly and inversely associated with E₂ and E₂/TT, with perfluoro-n-undecanoic acid (PFuDA) being the major contributor. Although the associations between PFAS mixture and other hormones were non-significant, certain individual PFAS presented significant associations. Notably, perfluoro-n-tridecanoic acid (PFTrDA) and perfluoro-n-dodecanoic acid (PFDoA) were found to be significantly and inversely associated with INSL3, a unique indicator of Leydig cells function. Meanwhile, significant positive associations were found between perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) and FSH and between PFuDA and LH. But the associations with branched isomers or F-53B were sporadic and inconsistent.Our findings provided the evidence that PFAS mixture may reduce E₂ level, and certain PFAS (i.e., PFTrDA and PFDoA) may have negative effects on Leydig cells function among young men. Additional studies are much needed to confirm our results and elucidate potential mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3ablood serum 3across-sectional studies 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental exposure 3aestradiol 3ainsulin 3aluteinizing hormone 3amales 3aperfluorotridecanoic acid 3aregression analysis 3asulfonic acids 3atestosterone 0aPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances 0aYoung adult men 0aMixture effects 0aEstradiol 0aInsulin-like factor 3 (INSL3)1 aLiu, Xiaotu1 aNian, Min1 aWang, Yuqing1 aQiu, Jin1 aYu, Hao1 aChen, Xiangfeng1 aZhang, Jun2 afor the Shanghai Birth Cohorteauthor0 tEnvironment international.g2021 July, v. 152 p.106496-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.1064963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03258naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245012800166300001800294500002000312520204900332592002802381650001102409650002002420650002002440650001002460650001102470650001302481650002102494650001402515650001702529650001602546650001202562700002002574700001602594700002202610700002502632773010302657856007902760852000902839655001202848IND60571786020221119111836.0170712e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057178602DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.126882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrocha, Lidia K.10aLinking the respiration of fungal sporocarps with their nitrogen concentration: variation among species, tissues and guilds  ap. 1756-1768.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTissue nitrogen (N) concentration has been correlated with respiration (RS) across plants of different life‐forms, functional and phylogenetic groups, plant organs and ectomycorrhizae of different fungal species. Nothing is known, however, if a similar relationship exists in other organisms like fungi. Here, we explored the N‐RS relationship across sporocarps of 93 fungal species that varied in their guilds (mutualistic, saprotrophic and parasitic) as well as ‘tissue’ types (caps and stipes). We hypothesized that RS, N and protein concentrations were higher for saprotrophic fungi than for either mutualistic or parasitic fungi and were higher for caps than for stipes. We also hypothesized that respiration of fungal guild could be predicted by the N concentration. Lastly, we predicted N and RS were phylogenetically conserved and that by subtracting metabolically inactive N in chitin, we could improve the N‐RS relationship. Sporocarp N concentration only explained 26% of the variation in RS across species. We found a significant difference in the N‐RS relationship among the three fungal guilds, but no difference between the two tissue types. Saprotrophic species had higher N concentration and respiration than mutualistic and parasitic fungal species. Sporocarp components differed with caps showing both higher respiration and higher N and protein concentrations than stipes. Overall, our results show that fungal sporocarp nitrogen concentration is phylogenetically conserved among fungal families and may prove to be a strong predictor of fungal guild. The positive N‐RS relationships existed for all fungal species (similar to plants), within fungal guilds (similar to plant functional groups), and fungal ‘tissue’ types (like plants’ organs). The clear linkage of fungal sporocarp respiration to total N concentration could help improve C and N cycling models in forest ecosystems by including estimates of fungal respiration based on fungal N concentration.

Using survey data collected at Colorado's stocked public reservoirs in 2009, we found that trout anglers’ net economic benefits were more than twice those of anglers fishing for species other than trout. Values estimated from the travel cost method produced angler-day consumer surpluses (willingness to pay [WTP]) of US$191.60 for trout anglers and $61.68 for nontrout anglers. Based on the contingent valuation method, the mean WTP was $196.48 for trout anglers and $73.84 for nontrout anglers, while the median WTP was $164.53 for trout anglers and $56.78 for nontrout anglers. Thus, the relative values of fishing for trout versus fishing for other species are robust to nonmarket valuation methods, and the two valuation methods show convergent validity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontingent valuation 3agame fish 3asport fishing 3asurpluses 3asurveys 3atravel 3atrout 3awater reservoirs 3awillingness to pay 3aColorado1 aNg, Kawa0 tNorth American journal of fisheries management.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 32, no. 2 p.202-210dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:19701x1548-86757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2012.6620893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245010900156300001600265520164600281592002801927650003201955650001101987650002701998650002402025650002002049650002502069650002102094650001602115650002202131650001702153650001202170650001102182651001502193700001902208700002102227700001902248773013302267856007302400852000902473655001202482IND60419342520221119234548.0151002e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041934252DNAL7 a10.1111/ajr.122342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPain, Tilley10aComparison of research experience and support needs of rural versus regional allied health professionals  ap. 277-285.  aOBJECTIVE: We compared the research experience or support needs of allied health professionals in rural versus regional cities to identify if they were the same or different. DESIGN: Descriptive study using a cross sectional survey. SETTING: This study was carried within Queensland Health's northern six health services. PARTICIPANTS: Queensland health staff classified as Health Practitioners. INTERVENTIONS: This survey was conducted as part of a research capacity building initiative within Queensland Health to increase AHPs’ participation in research in regional cities and rural areas of Queensland. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Questions in the survey identified demographics, research experience, need for research support, research knowledge and beliefs about research. Data were compared using Chi‐square and t‐tests. RESULTS: The total response rate was 54.5% with 18% of the HPs located in rural communities of less than 5000 people and the rest from the three major cities in northern Queensland. Rural HPs have less research experience in most research activities than regional city HPs and need more research support. Rural HPs have more qualitative research experience than regional city HPs and research is perceived positively by both. Barriers to conducting research were similar across both groups and included insufficient time, lack of staff and no statistical support. CONCLUSION: Rural HPs are younger and have less research experience than their counterparts working in regional cities. Therefore, building rural HP research capacity initiatives may require more access to facilitators such as the Research Fellows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallied health professionals 3acities 3ademographic statistics 3adescriptive studies 3ahealth services 3aqualitative analysis 3aresearch support 3arural areas 3arural communities 3arural health 3asurveys 3at-test 3aQueensland1 aPlummer, David1 aPighills, Alison1 aHarvey, Desley0 tAustralian journal of rural health.g2015 Oct., v. 23, no. 5 p.277-285dAssociation for Australian Rural Nursesx1038-52827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajr.122343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245013600168500001400304520154700318592002801865650001301893650002201906650002701928650001101955650003001966650002101996650001502017650001602032650001002048650001202058650001402070650001002084651001002094651001002104700001902114700002402133700002602157700002202183700002002205700002202225700002002247700002302267773012002290856007902410852000902489655001202498IND60732118320221119211530.0210326e20210318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073211832DNAL7 a10.3390/insects120302572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRicciardi, Renato 10aOld Parasitoids for New Mealybugs: Host Location Behavior and Parasitization Efficacy of Anagyrusvladimiri on Pseudococcuscomstocki  aNAL-light  aThe Comstock mealybug, Pseudococcus comstocki (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) is a primary pest of orchards in the North and Northwest of China. This pest appeared recently in Europe, including Italy, where it is infesting mainly vineyards as well as apple and pear orchards. The present study investigated the efficacy of Anagyrus vladimiri, a known biological control agent (BCA) of Planococcus ficus, on P. comstocki to evaluate a potential use for the management of this new pest. No-choice tests were conducted to quantify the parasitoid behavior against P. ficus and P. comstocki. The parasitoid successfully parasitized both species (parasitization rate: 51% and 67% on P. comstocki and P. ficus, respectively). The A.vladimiri developmental time (19.67 ± 1.12 vs. 19.70 ± 1.07 days), sex ratio (1.16 ± 1.12 vs. 1.58 ± 1.07) and hind tibia length of the progeny showed no differences when P. comstocki and P. ficus, respectively, were exploited as hosts. Two-choice tests, conducted by providing the parasitoid with a mixed population of P. ficus and P. comstocki, showed no host preference for either of the two mealybug species (23 vs. 27 first choices on P. comstocki and P. ficus, respectively). The parasitization rate (61.5% and 64.5% in P. comstocki and P. ficus, respectively) did not differ between the two hosts. Overall, our study adds basic knowledge on parasitoid behavior and host preferences and confirms the use of this economically important encyrtid species as an effective BCA against the invasive Comstock mealybug.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnagyrus 3aPlanococcus ficus 3aPseudococcus comstocki 3aapples 3abiological control agents 3ahost preferences 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3apears 3aprogeny 3asex ratio 3atibia 3aChina 3aItaly1 aZeni, Valeria 1 aMichelotti, Davide 1 aDi Giovanni, Filippo 1 aCosci, Francesca 1 aCanale, Angelo 1 aZang, Lian-Sheng 1 aLucchi, Andrea 1 aBenelli, Giovanni 0 tInsects.g2021 Mar. 18, v. 12, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects120302573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245010800164300001400272520113000286592002801416650002201444650002301466650001701489650001501506650001701521650001401538650000901552650002001561650001901581650002001600651001001620653002001630653002201650653002501672653002101697653002201718700001301740700001301753700001901766700001701785773008701802856008401889852000901973655001201982IND60546036620221122043729.0160903e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054603662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2014.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Lili10aStatus of phthalate esters contamination in agricultural soils across China and associated health risks  ap. 16-23.  aThe extensive utilization of phthalate-containing products has lead to ubiquitous contamination of phthalate esters (PAEs) in various matrices. However, comprehensive knowledge of their pollution in Chinese farmland and associated risks is still limited. In this study, 15 PAEs were determined in soils from agricultural fields throughout the Mainland China. The concentrations of Σ15PAEs were in the range of 75.0–6369 μg kg−1. Three provinces (i.e., Fujian, Guangdong and Xinjiang, China) showed the highest loadings of PAEs. Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was found as the most abundant component and contributed 71.5% to the ∑15PAEs. The major source of PAEs in arable soils was associated with the application of agricultural plastic films, followed by the activities for soil fertility. Furthermore, the non-cancer and carcinogenic risks of target PAEs were estimated. The hazard indexes (HIs) of PAEs in all samples were below 1 and the carcinogenic risk levels were all within 10−4. Results from this study will provide valuable information for Chinese agricultural soil management and risk avoidance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural soils 3aarable soils 3aphthalates 3aplastic film 3apollution 3arisk 3arisk management 3asoil fertility 3asoil management 3aChina 0aPhthalate ester 0aAgricultural soil 0aSpatial distribution 0aPotential source 0aHuman health risk1 aXu, Yang1 aXu, Chao1 aYun, Lingxiang1 aLiu, Weiping0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2014 Dec., v. 195 p.16-23dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2014.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245007600166300001600242520098000258536046001238592002801698596001301726596001501739596002701754596001101781650002101792650002501813650001501838650001701853650001001870650002001880650002601900650001701926653001601943653002601959653003501985700001602020700001702036773012502053856008602178852000902264655001202273IND60717459720221120173128.0210520e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071745972DNAL7 a10.1080/1040841X.2020.18197712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSang, Xiao10aResearch on endophytic fungi for producing huperzine A on a large-scale  ap. 654-664.  aHuperzine A (HupA) is an effective inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase and has attracted great interest as a therapeutic candidate for Alzheimer’s disease. However, the use of HupA is limited by resource scarcity as well as by its low yields from Huperzia serrata, its primary plant source. Recent studies have shown that this compound is produced by various endophytic fungi, thereby providing a promising alternative source, as fungi are much more amenable than plants owing to their simpler genetics and the ease of manipulation. In this review, we summarize the progress in research on the methods to increase HupA production, including fermentation conditions, fungal elicitors, gene expression, and the activation of key enzymes. This review provides guidance for further studies on HupA-producing endophytic fungi aimed at efficient HupA synthesis and accumulation, and offers new approaches for studies on the regulation of high-value bioactive secondary metabolites.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant No. 81803547], the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China [Grant No. 2018J01720], Innovative Research Teams Program II of Fujian Normal University in China [Grant No. IRTL1703, FZSKG2018013], the Public Service Platform for Industrialisation Development Technology of Marine Biological Medicine and Product of State Oceanic Administration [Grant No. FZHJ14].  aPublisher supplied data  a81803547  a2018J01720  aIRTL1703aFZSKG2018013  aFZHJ14 3aHuperzia serrata 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aendophytes 3afermentation 3afungi 3agene expression 3asecondary metabolites 3atherapeutics 0ahuperzine A 0aAlzheimer’s disease 0aacetylcholinesterase inhibitor1 aYang, Minhe1 aSu, Jingqian0 tCritical reviews in microbiology.g2020 Nov. 1, v. 46, no. 6 p.654-664dTaylor & FranciswJournal:14619x1549-78287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1040841X.2020.18197713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01807naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245012000161300001600281520096400297592002801261650002101289650001501310650001401325650001001339650001101349773011201360856004801472852000901520655001201529IND50063890920221116221250.0130325e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006389092DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-012-0800-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lei10aDetermining the transport mechanism of an enzyme-catalytic complex metabolic network based on biological robustness  ap. 433-441.  aUnderstanding the transport mechanism of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) is of critical importance to do further research on gene regulation. Due to the lack of intracellular information, on the basis of enzyme-catalytic system, using biological robustness as performance index, we present a system identification model to infer the most possible transport mechanism of 1,3-PD, in which the performance index consists of the relative error of the extracellular substance concentrations and biological robustness of the intracellular substance concentrations. We will not use a Boolean framework but prefer a model description based on ordinary differential equations. Among other advantages, this also facilitates the robustness analysis, which is the main goal of this paper. An algorithm is constructed to seek the solution of the identification model. Numerical results show that the most possible transport way is active transport coupled with passive diffusion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive transport 3aalgorithms 3aequations 3agenes 3amodels0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2013 Apr., v. 36, no. 4 p.433-441dSpringer-Verlagx1615-75917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-012-0800-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245007400206300001400280500001500294506007600309520088100385592002801266506003701294650002901331650002501360650001401385650001301399650001501412650002801427650001701455650001201472650001001484650001101494650003101505653002401536700001901560773013701579856008101716852000901797655001201806IND60626829320221207093117.0181230e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062682932DNAL7 a10.1007/s12275-019-8514-z2doi7 aPMC70908012pmcid7 a304567552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jung-Eun10aAnti-varicella-zoster virus activity of cephalotaxine esters in vitro  ap. 74-79.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHarringtonine (HT) and homoharringtonine (HHT), alkaloid esters isolated from the genus Cephalotaxus, exhibit antitumor activity. A semisynthetic HHT has been approved for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. In addition to antileukemic activity, HT and HHT are reported to possess potent antiviral activity. In this study, we investigated the effects of HT and HHT on replication of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in vitro. HT and HHT, but not their biologically inactive parental alkaloid cephalotaxine (CET), significantly inhibited replication of recombinant VZV-pOka luciferase. Furthermore, HT and HHT, but not CET, strongly induced down-regulation of VZV lytic genes and exerted potent antiviral effects against a VZV clinical isolate. The collective data support the utility of HT and HHT as effective antiviral candidates for treatment of VZV-associated diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHuman alphaherpesvirus 3 3aantiviral properties 3aalkaloids 3aleukemia 3aluciferase 3aantineoplastic activity 3aCephalotaxus 3aviruses 3agenes 3aesters 3agene expression regulation 0aHuman herpesvirus 31 aSong, Yoon-Jae0 tjournal of microbiology.g2019 Jan., v. 57, no. 1 p.74-79dThe Microbiological Society of KoreawJournal:jnl4619042x1225-88737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-019-8514-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03413naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002800145245013000173300001800303500002000321520206700341592002802408650001102436650001902447650001502466650003302481650001502514650001102529650001402540650001102554650001702565650001302582650002402595650002302619650001402642650001002656650001102666650001802677700001902695700003102714700001902745773010302764856007902867852000902946655001202955IND60571786220221119111821.0170712e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057178622DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.126602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavarro‐Cano, Jose A.10aSame nurse but different time: temporal divergence in the facilitation of plant lineages with contrasted functional syndromes  ap. 1854-1861.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPlant facilitation assembles functionally contrasted communities in dry lands. Nurse plants are often early colonizers with xerophytic traits that were mostly selected during the dry Quaternary (Quaternary syndrome), while beneficiary plants tend to be late‐successional species with mesophytic traits that evolved mainly during the more humid Tertiary (Tertiary syndrome). Integrating plant facilitation within the community assembly theory requires a better understanding of the ontogenetic development of the nursing abilities that benefit functionally contrasted species. We assessed whether the same nurse plant facilitates species with Quaternary and Tertiary syndromes in an ecosystem under severe abiotic stress conditions imposed by aridity and gypsum soil toxicity. We hypothesized that both functional types find suitable microsites for seedling establishment underneath the same nurse but their optimal regeneration niches are temporally segregated along the ontogenetic development of the nurse. We carried out a sowing experiment along a 40‐year ontogenetic gradient of the nurse shrub Ononis tridentata. Seeds from five Tertiary and five Quaternary species were sown and seedling emergence monitored. While the nurse age did not affect the seedling emergence of Quaternary species, it significantly increased that of Tertiary species. These results were corroborated for elder ontogenetic stages in non‐manipulated plants in the field. Juveniles of Quaternary species were able to grow beneath nurse plants along their whole ontogenetic gradient excepting beneath Ononis seedlings, while Tertiary species were only facilitated by mature nurses. Synthesis. Our results show that plant nursing abilities evolve ontogenetically in a different way for beneficiary Quaternary and Tertiary plant lineages. The finding of a plant species that plays a role as key assembler of early‐ and late‐successional species in plant dynamics broadens the scope of facilitation in the community assembly theory.

We applied the SIA data from remote sensing observations and SIT data from numerical model calculations. We found the large summer variability of SIA and SIT in AS and PS compared with those in winter. The opposite feature was seen in the BKSs. The annual declining rates of SIA and SIT were the largest in PS (−1.73 × 10⁴ km² yr⁻¹) and AS (−3.36 × 10⁻² m yr⁻¹), respectively. The SIA variability was modest for winter PS and the northern Canadian Arctic Archipelago of AS. The annual and winter SIA flux from PS to AS gradually increased in 1979–2020; the summer SIA flux accounted for 11% of the PS summer SIA decline. The annual and seasonal SIA outflow through the Fram Strait during 1979–2020 steadily increased while for annual and winter SIA export, the increase mainly occurred in 1979–2000; the summer SIA outflow was only 1.45% equivalent to the decrease in the entire Arctic summer SIA. We concluded that sea ice export was not a major impact factor on the seasonal and regional decline of SIA and SIT except for the individual years. The near surface air temperature (SAT) and sea surface temperature (SST) were responsible for the retreat and thinning of the sea ice. The dramatic increase in SAT in winter resulted in a strong decrease in winter sea ice in BKS. The outgoing longwave radiation had significant negative correlations with SIA and SIT and positive correlations with SAT and SST. The Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation, related to the North Atlantic Ocean’s SST anomalies, had significant negative correlations with SIA and SIT. The SIT had higher correlations with the atmospheric and oceanic factors compared with SIA, which indicates that SIT is important for predictions of Arctic sea ice and climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aclimate change 3adecline 3aexports 3amathematical models 3asea ice 3asummer 3asurface water temperature 3aterrestrial radiation 3awinter 3aArctic Ocean 3aArctic region 3aAtlantic Ocean1 aKe, Changqing 1 aCheng, Bin 1 aShen, Xiaoyi 1 aHe, Yue 1 aSha, Dexuan 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Feb. 14, v. 14, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140409043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01390naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245011500164300001800279520029700297592002800594650001200622650001200634650002100646650002300667650002300690650002500713650001200738700001700750700001100767700001200778700001600790700002200806773010600828856008500934852000901019655001201028IND60578992720180316000000.0170815e20151120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057899272DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.5b029262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Yang10aIntramolecular, Pd/Cu-Co-catalyzed P–C Bond Cleavage and Addition onto an Alkyne: A Route to Benzophospholes  ap. 5722-5724.  aUnder Pd(II)/CuI cocatalysis, o-diarylphosphinophenylalkynes cyclize in boiling toluene via C–P bond cleavage and arylphosphination of the CC bond.

It can cause severe bark cracking of trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata), but symptoms on the indicator, Arizona 861-S-1 Etrog (Citrus medica), are mild and transient, usually leaf epinasty (2–4). CVd-IV was detected for the first time in South Africa during the 2009 biennial indexing of mother trees maintained for the South African Citrus Improvement Scheme (CIS). Symptoms were observed on Etrog indicators budded with material from mother trees of DuRoi Valencia sweet orange (C. sinensis). Initially, leaf bend of a single leaf was noted on one plant, and later, petiole browning developed on all test plants. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR testing confirmed CVd-IV infection by amplification of a 286-bp PCR product representing the full-length CVd genome using the primers CVd-IV-F3 5′-GGTGGATACAACTCTTGGG-3′ (1) and CVd-IV-SL3 5′-GGGTAGTTTCTATCTCAG-3′ (N. Duran-Vila personal communication). Samples of 78 field and 30 nursery trees of DuRoi Valencia supplied over a 7-year period from the CIS were budded on Etrog and tested 3 months after inoculation. Ninety positive samples were obtained from trees up to 7 years old. These trees were on either Swingle citrumelo (P. trifoliata × C. paradisi) or rough lemon (C. jambhiri) rootstocks and no symptoms of bark-cracking or other abnormalities were noted on these trees. Following the initial interception, a comprehensive screening of the CIS gene source, consisting of 450 cultivars, was initiated and CVd-IV was detected in five other accessions: SB navel (C. sinensis) collected in 1984 in Kwa-Zulu Natal Province of South Africa, Gillemberg navel (C. sinensis) collected in 1986 in Limpopo Province, Tarocco midseason (C. sinensis) imported from Sicily in 1987, Fortuna mandarin (C. reticulata) imported from Spain in 1987, and Westin midseason (C. sinensis) imported from Brazil in 1994. None of these accessions are planted on a commercial scale and field observations are therefore not possible. PCR amplicons of all positive samples were bidirectionally sequenced and sequences submitted to GenBank. Sequence comparisons showed those obtained from DuRoi Valencia (JN903763), Tarocco (JN903764), and SB Navel (JN903765), and GenBank reference sequences AB054633 (Japan) and HM042747 (China) to be identical. Likewise, the South African sequences from Westin (JN903766) and Gillemberg (JN903767) were identical to reference sequences X14638 and NC_003539 (Israel) and GQ260216 (Iran). The Fortuna sequence (JN903762) differed by two base pairs from the latter group. On the basis of the entry dates of the accessions, it is probable that CVd-IV has been in South Africa since at least 1984, but was not detected during indexing because of the erratic symptom expression of CVd-IV on Etrog. Existing CVd-IV-contaminated field material will be monitored for possible disease expression, but thus far the trifoliate hybrid and rough lemon rootstocks do not show the same susceptibility as reported for P. trifoliata (4). The detection of CVd-IV in field and gene-source material emphasizes the importance of intensive and specific indexing to ensure distribution of pathogen-free citrus in South Africa.References: (1) L.

In this work, we introduce a proof-of-concept luminescence assay to detect RNA and to accomplish nucleolus imaging with the use of the supramolecular self-assembly of platinum(II) complexes. Noncovalent interactions between platinum(II) complexes and RNA can be induced by the introduction of a guanidinium group into the complexes, and accordingly, a high RNA affinity can be achieved. Interestingly, the aggregation affinities of platinum(II) complexes enable them to display remarkable luminescence turn-on upon RNA binding, which is a result of the strengthening of noncovalent Pt(II)···Pt(II) and π–π stacking interactions. The complexes exhibit not only intriguing spectroscopic changes and luminescence enhancement after RNA binding but also specific nucleolus imaging in cells. As compared to fluorescent dyes, the low-energy red luminescence and large Stokes shifts of platinum(II) complexes afford a high signal-to-background autofluorescence ratio in nucleolus imaging. Additional properties, including long phosphorescence lifetimes and low cytotoxicity, have endowed the platinum(II) complexes with the potential for biological applications. Also, platinum(II) complexes have been adopted to monitor the dynamics of the nucleolus induced by the addition of RNA synthesis inhibitors. This capability allows the screening of inhibitors and can be advantageous for the development of antineoplastic agents. This work provides a novel strategy for exploring the application of platinum(II) complex-based cell imaging agents based on the mechanism of supramolecular self-assembly. It is envisaged that platinum(II) complexes can be utilized as valuable probes because of the aforementioned appealing advantages.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell nucleolus 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescence 3aguanidinium 3aphosphorescence 3aplatinum 3aribosomal RNA 3aspectroscopy1 aLee, Lawrence Cho-Cheung1 aLo, Kenneth Kam-Wing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2470-59161 aYam, Vivian W.

The use of rifampicin and ciprofloxacin in combination with azithromycin, known for its inhibitory effects on the bacterial ribosome, can create potential synergistic effects on ribosomal subunit synthesis rates. In this work, combination antibiotic treatments gave a significant decrease in cell numbers following growth in the presence of ciprofloxacin or rifampicin with azithromycin compared to those grown with azithromycin or rifampicin alone. DNA, RNA and protein synthesis rates were reduced with single antibiotic treatments and showed further decreases when drug combinations were used. 70S ribosome levels were reduced with every antibiotic treatment. DNA gyrase subunits A and B showed significant decreases for double and triple antibiotic-treated samples. Ribosomal subunit synthesis rates were diminished for each different antibiotic combination. Turnover of 16S and 23S rRNA was also observed in each case and was stimulated by antibiotic combinations. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was reduced in all double selections, and no triply resistant mutants were found.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing) 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aazithromycin 3abiosynthesis 3aciprofloxacin 3acombination drug therapy 3amutants 3aprotein synthesis 3aribosomal RNA 3aribosomes 3arifampicin 3asynergism1 aChampney, W.

Validation of each such treatment is necessary for HACCP purposes. The utility of validation by reference to reduction in numbers of Escherichia coli naturally present on beef is questioned. This is because reductions of E. coli generally might be greater than reductions of the main target organism, E. coli O157:H7, which can be more acid tolerant. To investigate the effects of lactic acid sprays on the two types of E. coli on beef surfaces, slices of beef with cut muscle, fat or membrane surfaces were prepared. The surfaces were inoculated with a five strain cocktail of acid-adapted E. coli O157:H7 or with a not-acid-adapted strain of E. coli at number of 5, 1 or −1 log cfu/cm2. Inoculated slices were not treated or were sprayed with water or 2% or 5% lactic acid at 0.5 ml/cm2. For each slice of lactic acid-treated meat the numbers of E. coli or E. coli O157:H7 recovered on agars that allowed resuscitation of injured cells or did not allow resuscitation were similar. The differences in the log mean numbers (log A) and in the log total numbers (N) of bacteria recovered from slices that were not treated or treated with acid were calculated. Differences in log A and N for bacteria recovered from slices treated with water or acid were calculated also. Means of the differences indicated that each acid treatment gave similar reductions in the numbers of E. coli or E. coli O157:H7. However, reductions were somewhat greater with 5% than with 2% lactic acid. The findings suggest that the E. coli or E. coli O157:H7 that survived acid treatments of meat surfaces were protected from exposure to injurious concentrations of undissociated acid. Consequently, strains of E. coli that are or are not relatively tolerant of acid conditions will be inactivated to similar extents by solutions of lactic acid applied to beef surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aEuropean Union 3aHACCP 3aacid tolerance 3aacid treatment 3abacteria 3abeef 3adecontamination 3alactic acid 3amuscles 3aspraying 3aNorth America 0aEscherichia coli O157 0aAcid adaptation 0aLactic acid 0aBeef cuts 0aDecontamination1 aYang, X.1 aBadoni, M.1 aGill, C.O.0 tFood control.g2013 Nov., v. 34, no. 1 p.13-18dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.03.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006400147245010900211300001400320520125500334592002801589650001501617650001501632650002301647650000801670650001201678650001901690650001701709650002501726650002901751650002501780651001801805700002501823700002401848700001701872773009701889856008101986852000902067655001202076IND60531364120221120032251.0170713e20160601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053136412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2016.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahmud, Mallik Sezan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6874-904810aDetection of melt onset over the northern Canadian Arctic Archipelago sea ice from RADARSAT, 1997–2014  ap. 59-69.  aWe present an algorithm to detect melt onset over Arctic sea ice using high resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from RADARSAT. The algorithm is based on the temporal evolution of the SAR backscatter coefficient (σ°), using an ice type specific threshold approach that also corrects for incidence angle variation. Using 4457 RADARSAT images, the algorithm was applied over sea ice in the northern Canadian Arctic Archipelago that low spatial resolution microwave sensors have difficulty resolving, thus generating a new time series of melt onset from 1997 to 2014. Over the 1997–2014 period, the mean annual average melt onset date in the northern CAA was on year day 164 (mid–June) with a standard deviation of 4days. No significant trend for melt onset date was found over the 18-year period. An earlier (later) melt onset was associated with increased (decreased) solar energy absorption (r=0.64, significant at 95% confidence) and subsequently associated in lighter (heavier) September sea ice coverage in the northern CAA (r=0.62, significant at 95% confidence). RADARSAT estimates of melt onset were found to be in good agreement but more robust compared to passive microwave and scatterometer estimates over the northern CAA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aalgorithms 3aangle of incidence 3aice 3amelting 3aremote sensing 3asolar energy 3astatistical analysis 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atime series analysis 3aArctic region1 aHowell, Stephen E.L.1 aGeldsetzer, Torsten1 aYackel, John0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2016 June 01, v. 178 p.59-69dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2016.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245009700164520147700261592002801738650002401766650001101790650001701801650001901818650001701837650001401854650001201868650006501880650002501945650001701970650001001987651001101997651001102008651001302019651002402032700002002056773011802076856007502194852000902269655001202278IND60715298820221118010450.0201026e20201018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071529882DNAL7 a10.3390/land91003942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGräfe, Sebastian,10aImpacts of Future Crop Tree Release Treatments on Forest Carbon as REDD+ Mitigation Benefits  aSustainable forest management activities, such as future crop tree (FCT) release treatments, became part of the REDD+ strategy to avoid carbon emissions from forests. FCT release treatments are intended to achieve increased growth of FCTs by removing competitor trees. This initially leads to a reduction of the forest carbon pool and represents a carbon debt. We estimated that the time it takes for FCTs to offset the carbon debt through increased growth on experimental sites of 10 km² in Belize, Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. We further investigated whether the costs of treatment can be compensated by the generated financial carbon benefits. An average of 2.3 FCT per hectare were released through the removal of an average of 3.3 competitors per hectare. This corresponds to an average above ground biomass (AGB) deficit of 2.3 Mg FCT⁻¹. Assuming a 30% increase in growth, the FCT would need on average 130 years to offset the carbon loss. For carbon prices from US$ 5 to 100 Mg CO₂e⁻¹ an additional increment between 0.6 and 22.7 Mg tree⁻¹ would be required to cover the treatment costs of US$ 4.2 to 8.4 FCT⁻¹. Assuming a carbon price of US$ 10 Mg CO₂e⁻¹, the additional increment required would be between 5.8 and 11.4 Mg tree⁻¹, thus exceeding the biological growth potential of most individual trees. The release of FCTs does not ensure an increase in forest carbon stocks, and refinancing of treatment costs is problematic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon markets 3acarbon sinks 3aemissions 3aforests 3areducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation 3asustainable forestry 3atree release 3atrees 3aBelize 3aGuyana 3aSuriname 3aTrinidad and Tobago1 aKöhl, Michael,0 tLand.g2020 Oct. 18, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land91003943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245008100170300001800251520145900269592002801728650001701756650001401773650001001787650001501797650001101812650001201823773010901835856004801944852000901992655001202001IND4481796320221121005743.0120530e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448179632DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-012-0625-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTellería, María C.10aPalynological survey of the subtribe Elephantopinae (Asteraceae, Vernonieae)  ap. 1133-1139.  aDespite the taxonomic value of pollen morphology within the tribe Vernonieae, a detailed study of the pollen of the subtribe Elephantopinae is still lacking. The pollen morphology of ten species, representing three of the four genera of the subtribe, Elephantopus, Pseudoelephantopus and Orthopappus, was studied with LM, SEM, and TEM. The pollen of all the species studied was found to be echinolophate, although the differences in aperture features and both sculpture and exine structure allowed recognizing two pollen types. The species of Elephantopus (except for E. elongatus) and Pseudoelephantopus share the regular or more or less regular ridges pattern, the colporate condition but with the ectoapertures little developed, and the acaveate exine structure. From the sculpture and the apertures, the pollen of Caatinganthus harleyi was found to be similar to that of Elephantopus and Pseudoelephantopus. The pollen morphology of the monotypic Orthopappus, which is shared with that of E. elongatus, was further investigated for the first time. We found that it differs from that of the other species in having an irregular pattern of ridges, colporate condition but with a well-developed ectoapertures, and caveate exine. Additional studies of the exine structure and apertures features, coupled with molecular phylogeny, are needed to understand the evolution of pollen characters and re-evaluate the intergeneric relationships within the tribe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElephantopus 3aevolution 3aexine 3apalynology 3apollen 3asurveys0 tPlant systematics and evolution.g2012 June, v. 298, no. 6 p.1133-1139dSpringer-Verlagx0378-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00606-012-0625-5  aDNAL 7aarticle01681naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245018500168300001800353520047300371592002800844650001400872650001400886650002400900650001100924650001400935650002100949650002300970650002300993650001101016650002101027700001701048700002201065700002001087773010601107856008501213852000901298655001201307IND60578992920221116203507.0170815e20151120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057899292DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.5b029322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarmakar, Raju10aNi(II)-Catalyzed Highly Stereo- and Regioselective Syntheses of Isoindolinones and Isoquinolinones from in Situ Prepared Aldimines Triggered by Homoallylation/Lactamization Cascade  ap. 5650-5653.  aAn efficient route to isoindolinones and isoquinolinones has been achieved via a domino Ni-catalyzed homoallylation/lactamization from in situ prepared imines, derived from o-formyl benzoates and o-formyl arylacetates, with conjugated dienes promoted by diethylzinc.

Bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration technologies can produce heat and power whilst removing CO₂ indirectly from air, but it suffers low energy efficiency and poor economy. To improve the performance so that it can be practically used in industry, a series of research is done in this work. A bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration superstructure is put forward. Three representative schemes, including a biomass-fired power plant, a biomass-fueled integrated gasification combined cycle and a biomass-fueled integrated gasification fuel cell system are constructed and compared thermodynamically with the assistance of the commercial software Aspen Plus. It is found that the net electric efficiencies of the biomass-fired power plant, the biomass-fueled integrated gasification combined cycle and the biomass-fueled integrated gasification fuel cell are 30.7%, 44.5% and 50.5%. The electric power generation per unit biomass consumption of the three systems can be 1.37 kWh/kg, 1.98 kWh/kg and 2.31 kWh/kg. The costs of electricity produced by the three systems are 0.0584 $/kWh, 0.0497 $/kWh and 0.0493 $/kWh. The CO₂ mitigation rate per unit power generation of the three systems can be 0.943 kg/kWh, 0.629 kg/kWh and 0.567 kg/kWh. All these findings indicate that the biomass-fueled integrated gasification fuel cell system is promising for future clean power generation with negative CO₂ emission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3acomputer software 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aenergy efficiency 3afuel cells 3agasification 3aglobal warming 3aheat 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3apower generation 3apower plants 3aresearch 0aCarbon-negative 0aBioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration 0aModeling1 aWang, Luchao1 aWang, Ziliang1 aCao, Yang1 aHe, Boshu0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Feb. 20, v. 285 p.125424-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1254243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02186naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245012600175300001600301520087300317592002801190650001701218650001401235650002701249650002001276650000901296650002101305650001501326650002301341650001401364650001901378650001001397650001701407653002001424653001401444653002501458653001301483653001301496700002201509773012701531856008501658852000901743655001201752IND60477697520221120184039.0160105e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047769752DNAL7 a10.18474/0749-8004-47.2.1602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLundgren, Jonathan G.10aFunctional Responses to Food Diversity: the Effect of Seed Availability on the Feeding Behavior of Facultative Granivores  ap. 160-176.  aWe examined how diverse communities of carabid beetles and crickets in a perennial hayfield respond to seed availability numerically and in their feeding behavior. Although there were 3 distinct insect communities identified over the diel cycle, these communities were similar in plots supplemented with Setaria viridis (L.) P. Beauv. seeds and untreated plots. Gryllus pennsylvanicus Burmeister consumed plant material more frequently and ate more food in the fields with greater seed availability. However, they consumed prey with equal frequency in the 2 treatments. Allonemobius sp. consumed food less frequently than G. pennsylvanicus, and their diet was unaffected by seed availability. Availability of nonprey food resources may not affect soil insect communities in the short term, but some omnivores are quick to alter their diet to exploit nonprey resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllonemobius 3aCarabidae 3aGryllus pennsylvanicus 3aSetaria viridis 3adiet 3afeeding behavior 3aherbivores 3ainsect communities 3aomnivores 3aseed predation 3aseeds 3asoil insects 0adietary breadth 0agranivory 0agut content analysis 0aomnivory 0apredator1 aHarwood, James D.0 tJournal of entomological science.g2012 Apr., v. 47, no. 2 p.160-176dGeorgia Entomological Society, Inc.x0749-80047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18474%2F0749-8004-47.2.1603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245012100201300001600322500002000338520150300358592002801861596012201889596011602011596011502127650001502242650002602257650001302283650002102296650001802317650001502335650001902350650001202369651001102381651001502392700006302407700006302470773012002533856007402653852000902727655001202736IND60787918220221117221327.0220811e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078791822DNAL7 a10.1111/jpy.132582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBreitkreutz, Alana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7826-138810aLess Than the Sum of Its Parts: Blade Clustering Reduces Drag in the Bull Kelp, Nereocystis luetkeana (Phaeophyceae)  ap. 603-611.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNereocystis luetkeana is a large, canopy‐forming kelp that is commonly found in nearshore waters between Alaska and California. Despite regularly reaching lengths in excess of 30 m, this alga demonstrates a remarkable ability to endure hydrodynamically stressful environments without being dislodged by waves or currents. While morphological aspects of this kelp, including its long flexible stipe, have been shown to reduce drag, blade clustering has never been directly tested. In this study, we examined how the distinctive multi‐bladed morphology of Nereocystis thalli limits drag in flow. We measured drag on whole kelps in a large recirculating flume and quantified how drag was affected by serial removal of blades. We then compared measured drag with predictions of “additive drag”, which we defined as the sum of the drag that each blade experiences in isolation. We found that, on average, intact thalli experience only 37% of the predicted additive drag when subjected to a flow rate of 0.40–0.50 m · s⁻¹. Our results indicate that the subdivision of the photosynthetic area into multiple blades has a drag‐reducing effect on Nereocystis thalli. We found drag increases less than proportionally with the cumulative area, meaning the contribution of individual blades to overall drag decreases with increasing blade number. That is, as thalli develop, each additional blade incurs a reduced hydrodynamic cost, perhaps lending insight into how thalli can grow so large.  aPublisher supplied data  aDiscovery Grant to PTM (RGPIN‐2014‐06288, RGPIN‐20cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  aResearch Tools and Instruments Grant to PTM (EQPEQcNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  aUndergraduate Student Research Award to AB (2017)cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3aDurvillaea 3aNereocystis luetkeana 3aalgology 3ahydraulic flumes 3ahydrodynamics 3amacroalgae 3aphotosynthesis 3athallus 3aAlaska 3aCalifornia1 aColeman, Liam J.

In this paper we present the results of experimental studies of the surface mediated formation of PCDD/F at the conditions mimicking the combustion cool zone from a mixture of 1,2-dichlorobenzene (1,2-DCBz) and 2-monochlorophenol (2-MCP) over a model surface consisting of 5% CuO/Silica. The PCDD to PCDF ratio was found to be strongly dependent on the ratio of chlorinated benzenes to chlorinated phenols and oxygen content. The higher the 1,2-DCBz to 2-MCP ratio, the lower the PCDD to PCDF ratio. PCDFs are formed predominantly from chlorinated benzenes, while chlorinated phenols are responsible for majority of PCDDs. These laboratory results are in general agreement with full-scale measurement and can be used to improve predictive models of PCDD/F formation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDCB (herbicide) 3acombustion 3acupric oxide 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aphenols 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3asilica1 aDellinger, Barry1 aLomnicki, Slawo0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 Dec. 02, v. 48, no. 23 p.13864-13870dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes504253w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03257naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006100145245015800206300001600364500002000380520166800400592002802068596005902096596007502155650001502230650002302245650001902268650002602287650001702313650002402330650001802354650002202372650001302394650001002407650001202417650002602429650001502455650001102470650001702481700005002498700001702548700001802565773011602583856007902699852000902778655001202787IND60638237520221117235638.0190426e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063823752DNAL7 a10.1111/1744-7917.125752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jian‐Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1410-285510aCommunity structure, dispersal ability and functional profiling of microbiome existing in fat body and ovary of the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens  ap. 683-694.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe endosymbionts play vital roles in growth, development and reproduction in insects. Yeast‐like endosymbionts (YLSs) have been well studied in Nilaparvata lugens (N. lugens), but little is known about the tissue‐specific bacterial microbiomes, especially on the microbial intersection among internal tissues. Here, the correlation of microbial composition, structure, dispersal ability and functional profiling were illuminated in two tissues, the fat body and ovary in N. lugens. A total of 11 phyla and 105 genera were captured from all samples; Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the most predominant and accounted for more than 99% in all samples. However, the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria was significantly different in ovary and fat body through Fisher's Least Significant Difference test. Microbial diversity but not the richness index in the two tissues exhibited significant difference. Furthermore, the microbial community structure of the ovary and fat body were primarily determined by tissue quality. Firmicutes showed strong dispersal ability between ovary and fat body based on the quantitative null model assessing, indicating the frequent interaction of these microbiomes in the two tissues. In addition, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways of microbial participation were delineated. The ten most abundant pathways counted for over 46% of the annotation and were shared between the two tissues, mainly containing Energy Metabolism and Amino Acid Metabolism/Biosynthesis. The results will provide insights into the correlation of microbial community structure between ovary and fat body of N. lugens.  aPublisher supplied data  a31772185cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2012BAD19B01cNational Key Technology Research and Development Program 3aFirmicutes 3aNilaparvata lugens 3aProteobacteria 3aamino acid metabolism 3abiosynthesis 3acommunity structure 3aendosymbionts 3aenergy metabolism 3afat body 3agenes 3ainsects 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3amodels 3areproduction1 aYu, Na1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9366-99041 aXu, Xi‐Xia1 aLiu, Ze‐Wen0 tInsect science.g2019 Aug., v. 26, no. 4 p.683-694dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3869360x1672-96097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1744-7917.125753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01855naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245011800166300001800284520058900302592002800891650001500919650002500934650001500959650001700974650002300991650002301014650001001037650003301047650002101080650002501101700001801126700002001144700002001164700002301184700001801207700002001225773010601245856008501351852000901436655001201445IND60578993020221116203801.0170815e20151120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057899302DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.5b029342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujii, Ryuya10aBiosynthetic Study on Antihypercholesterolemic Agent Phomoidride: General Biogenesis of Fungal Dimeric Anhydrides  ap. 5658-5661.  aTo elucidate the general biosynthetic pathway of fungal dimeric anhydrides, a gene cluster for the biosynthesis of the antihy-percholesterolemic agent phomoidride was identified by heterologous expression of candidate genes encoding the highly reducing polyketide synthase, alkylcitrate synthase (ACS), and alkylcitrate dehydratase (ACDH).

Blending of LDPE/LLDPE (70/30wt/wt) with 5–20wt% of TPS and 3wt% of PE-grafted maleic anhydride (PE-g-MA) is performed in a twin-screw extruder, followed by the blowing process. Differential scanning calorimetric results indicate starch has more pronounced effect on crystallization of LLDPE than LDPE. Scanning electron micrograph shows a fairly good dispersion of TPS in PE matrices. Fourier transfer infrared spectra confirm compatibility between polymers using PE-g-MA as the compatibilizer. Storage modulus, loss modulus and complex viscosity increase with incorporation of starch. Tensile strength and elongation-at-break decrease from 18 to 10.5MPa and 340 to 200%, respectively when TPS increases from 5 to 20%. However, the required mechanical properties for packaging applications are attained when 15wt% starch is added, as specified in ASTM D4635. Finally 12% increase in water uptake is achieved with inclusion of 15wt% starch.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalorimetry 3acrystallization 3aloss modulus 3amaleic anhydrides 3amixing 3apackaging 3apolyethylene 3astarch 3astorage modulus 3atensile strength 3athermoplastics 0aLDPE 0aLLDPE 0aThermoplastic starch 0aBlend 0aFilm 0aProperties1 aBagheri, Rouhollah1 aMasoomi, Mahmood0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2015 Mar. 30, v. 119 p.126-133dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.11.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245011900196500002000315520179100335592002802126596005702154596005702211596005702268650003302325650001102358650001502369650002702384650001602411650000902427650001102436650001502447651001102462700005902473700006002532773012602592856007302718852000902791655001202800IND60752122820221122031719.0210929e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075212282DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.143702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUnami, Koichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6910-109410aStatistical analysis of flash flood events for designing water harvesting systems in an extremely arid environment  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA water harvesting system for research purposes has been established in the Lisan Peninsula of the Dead Sea in the middle of the Jordan Rift Valley, where no authorized guideline is available for designing water harvesting systems. Rainfall and runoff, which occurred as flash floods, were observed at the downstream end of a gorge with a 1.12 km² barren catchment area from October 2014 through July 2019. Due to the extremely arid environment, runoff from the catchment is ephemeral, and the flash flood events can be clearly distinguishable from each other. Thirteen flash flood events with a total runoff volume of more than 100 m³ were successfully recorded during the five rainy seasons. Pearson and Spearman correlations between duration, total rainfall depths at two points, total runoff volume, maximum runoff discharge, bulk runoff coefficient, total variation in runoff discharge and maximum variation in runoff discharge of each flash flood event were examined, revealing no straightforward relationship between rainfall and runoff. The performance of the conventional SCS runoff curve number method was also deficient in reproducing any rainfall–runoff relationship. Therefore, probability distribution fitting was performed for each random variable, focusing on the lognormal distribution with three parameters and the generalized extreme value distribution. The maximum goodness‐of‐fit estimation turns out to be a more rational and efficient method in obtaining the parameter values of those probability distributions rather than the standard maximum likelihood estimation, which has known disadvantages. Results support the design of the water harvesting system and provide quantitative information for designing and operating similar systems in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  a16KT0018cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a19KK0167cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a26257415cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3adry environmental conditions 3afloods 3aguidelines 3alognormal distribution 3aprobability 3arain 3arunoff 3awatersheds 3aJordan1 aMohawesh, Osama1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0611-70881 aFadhil, Rasha M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6273-65640 tHydrological processes.g2021 Sept., v. 35, no. 9 p.e14370-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3938466x0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.143703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245007200203506007600275520137900351592002801730506003701758650001601795650001701811650001801828650002101846650001001867650001001877650001501887650001801902650001101920650001101931650001401942650001901956650001201975650002901987650002602016700002202042700002202064773011902086856007702205852000902282655001202291IND60660539720221207050036.0190823e20190728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066053972DNAL7 a10.3390/plants80802522doi7 aPMC67241442pmcid7 a313577002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThines, Bryan 10aCircadian Network Interactions with Jasmonate Signaling and Defense  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPlants experience specific stresses at particular, but predictable, times of the day. The circadian clock is a molecular oscillator that increases plant survival by timing internal processes to optimally match these environmental challenges. Clock regulation of jasmonic acid (JA) action is important for effective defenses against fungal pathogens and generalist herbivores in multiple plant species. Endogenous JA levels are rhythmic and under clock control with peak JA abundance during the day, a time when plants are more likely to experience certain types of biotic stresses. The expression of many JA biosynthesis, signaling, and response genes is transcriptionally controlled by the clock and timed through direct connections with core clock proteins. For example, the promoter of Arabidopsis transcription factor MYC2, a master regulator for JA signaling, is directly bound by the clock evening complex (EC) to negatively affect JA processes, including leaf senescence, at the end of the day. Also, tobacco ZEITLUPE, a circadian photoreceptor, binds directly to JAZ proteins and stimulates their degradation with resulting effects on JA root-based defenses. Collectively, a model where JA processes are embedded within the circadian network at multiple levels is emerging, and these connections to the circadian network suggest multiple avenues for future research.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3abiosynthesis 3abiotic stress 3acircadian clocks 3afungi 3agenes 3aherbivores 3ajasmonic acid 3aleaves 3amodels 3apathogens 3aphotoreceptors 3atobacco 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aParlan, Emily  V.1 aFulton, Elena  C.0 tPlants.g2019 July 28, v. 8, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants80802523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001300141245020500154520147300359592002801832650002501860650001701885650002901902650002101931650001301952650001301965650002801978650001302006650001702019700001502036700001702051700001902068773011802087856007502205852000902280655001202289IND60715299020221118130803.0201026e20201020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071529902DNAL7 a10.3390/land91003962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yue 14aThe Influence of Innovation Resources in Higher Education Institutions on the Development of Sci-Tech Parks’ Enterprises in the Urban Innovative Districts at the Stage of Urbanization Transformation  aInnovation is an inevitable way to enhance regional competitiveness, promote urbanization and achieve sustainable development. The sci-tech park is one of the main land use types in the construction of a new town and the critical space carriers of urbanization. This study focuses on the correlation between higher education institutions (HEIs) innovation and sci-tech enterprises (STEs) development, and the Hangzhou West Hi-tech Corridor as a case study. Innovation indicators of HEIs related to teaching staff, talent cultivation, scientific research quality, academic influence, and university-enterprise cooperation, as well as development indicators of STEs related to aggregation degree, development level, and innovation level are selected. The results show that HEI innovation is significantly positively correlated with STE development. The number of senior titled teachers, average number of citations per paper, and number of invested enterprises exhibit a strong positive correlation with STE development indicators. Regarding the correlation between HEI innovation and STE development, academic research HEIs and professional application HEIs are stronger than vocational skill HEIs. This study is conducive to improving land use efficiency and a sustainable development level of urban innovative districts. Suggestions are provided to support the researches and practices of urban innovative spatial planning and advancement of the urbanization process.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3aeducational institutions 3ahigher education 3aland use 3aplanning 3asustainable development 3ateachers 3aurbanization1 aYang, Yue 1 aXu, Weishun 1 aChen, Qiuxiao 0 tLand.g2020 Oct. 20, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land91003963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012300159520213700282592002802419650001502447650001602462650000902478650002002487650002302507650001502530650001402545650001402559650002602573650001902599650002502618650002202643650001502665650002202680650001602702700002202718700002202740700002102762700001902783700001902802773012802821856007502949852000903024655001203033IND60766966420221117200848.0220211e20220121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076696642DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140305182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrewer, Kiara 10aPredicting the Chlorophyll Content of Maize over Phenotyping as a Proxy for Crop Health in Smallholder Farming Systems  aSmallholder farmers depend on healthy and productive crop yields to sustain their socio-economic status and ensure livelihood security. Advances in South African precision agriculture in the form of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide spatially explicit near-real-time information that can be used to assess crop dynamics and inform smallholder farmers. The use of UAVs with remote-sensing techniques allows for the acquisition of high spatial resolution data at various spatio-temporal planes, which is particularly useful at the scale of fields and farms. Specifically, crop chlorophyll content is assessed as it is one of the best known and reliable indicators of crop health, due to its biophysical pigment and biochemical processes that indicate plant productivity. In this regard, the study evaluated the utility of multispectral UAV imagery using the random forest machine learning algorithm to estimate the chlorophyll content of maize through the various growth stages. The results showed that the near-infrared and red-edge wavelength bands and vegetation indices derived from these wavelengths were essential for estimating chlorophyll content during the phenotyping of maize. Furthermore, the random forest model optimally estimated the chlorophyll content of maize over the various phenological stages. Particularly, maize chlorophyll was best predicted during the early reproductive, late vegetative, and early vegetative growth stages to RMSE accuracies of 40.4 µmol/m⁻², 39 µmol/m⁻², and 61.6 µmol/m⁻², respectively. The least accurate chlorophyll content results were predicted during the mid-reproductive and late reproductive growth stages to RMSE accuracies of 66.6 µmol/m⁻² and 69.6 µmol/m⁻², respectively, as a consequence of a hailstorm. A resultant chlorophyll variation map of the maize growth stages captured the spatial heterogeneity of chlorophyll within the maize field. Therefore, the study’s findings demonstrate that the use of remotely sensed UAV imagery with a robust machine algorithm is a critical tool to support the decision-making and management in smallholder farms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3achlorophyll 3acorn 3adecision making 3aforestry equipment 3alivelihood 3aphenology 3aphenotype 3aprecision agriculture 3aremote sensing 3asocioeconomic status 3aspatial variation 3avegetation 3avegetative growth 3awavelengths1 aClulow, Alistair 1 aSibanda, Mbulisi 1 aGokool, Shaeden 1 aNaiken, Vivek 1 aMabhaudhi, T.,0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Jan. 21, v. 14, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140305183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03799naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245018400173520216200357592002802519650001502547650002202562650001902584650001902603650001002622650002202632650001702654650002502671650002502696650001402721650002202735650002202757651002002779651001102799651001902810653002902829653001602858653001702874653003102891653002802922653001802950700002202968700002202990700002403012700002503036773013903061856008403200852000903284655001203293IND60745885520221119020556.0220103e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074588552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2021.1072662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcDonough, Molly M.10aPhylogenomic systematics of the spotted skunks (Carnivora, Mephitidae, Spilogale): Additional species diversity and Pleistocene climate change as a major driver of diversification  aFour species of spotted skunks (Carnivora, Mephitidae, Spilogale) are currently recognized: Spilogale angustifrons, S. gracilis, S. putorius, and S. pygmaea. Understanding species boundaries within this group is critical for effective conservation given that regional populations or subspecies (e.g., S. p. interrupta) have experienced significant population declines. Further, there may be currently unrecognized diversity within this genus as some taxa (e.g., S. angustifrons) and geographic regions (e.g., Central America) never have been assessed using DNA sequence data. We analyzed species limits and diversification patterns in spotted skunks using multilocus nuclear (ultraconserved elements) and mitochondrial (whole mitogenomes and single gene analysis) data sets from broad geographic sampling representing all currently recognized species and subspecies. We found a high degree of genetic divergence among Spilogale that reflects seven distinct species and eight unique mitochondrial lineages. Initial divergence between S. pygmaea and all other Spilogale occurred in the Early Pliocene (~ 5.0 million years ago). Subsequent diversification of the remaining Spilogale into an “eastern” and a “western” lineage occurred during the Early Pleistocene (~1.5 million years ago). These two lineages experienced temporally coincident patterns of diversification at ~0.66 and ~0.35 million years ago into two and ultimately three distinct evolutionary units, respectively. Diversification was confined almost entirely within the Pleistocene during a timeframe characterized by alternating glacial-interglacial cycles, with the origin of this diversity occurring in northeastern Mexico and the southwestern United States of America. Mitochondrial-nuclear discordance was recovered across three lineages in geographic regions consistent with secondary contact, including a distinct mitochondrial lineage confined to the Sonoran Desert. Our results have direct consequences for conservation of threatened populations, or species, as well as for our understanding of the evolution of delayed implantation in this enigmatic group of small carnivores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMephitidae 3aPleistocene epoch 3aPliocene epoch 3aclimate change 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genome 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3asecondary contact 3aspecies diversity 3aCentral America 3aMexico 3aSonoran Desert 0aUltra-conserved elements 0aMitogenomes 0aSpecies tree 0aPleistocene climate change 0aMexican Transition Zone 0aNorth America1 aFerguson, Adam W.1 aDowler, Robert C.1 aGompper, Matthew E.1 aMaldonado, Jesus E.,0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2022 Feb., v. 167 p.107266-dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2021.1072663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03516naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002700150245008200177300001600259520213600275592002802411650001702439650001102456650002002467650001002487650003502497650001602532650001202548650001202560650001302572650001302585650002602598650000902624650003702633650001802670650001702688650002702705650001002732700002002742700002202762700002602784700002102810700002102831773008702852856008602939852000903025655001203034IND4475675320221119162528.0141111e20110115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447567532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2010.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmirinejad, Ali Ashraf10aAssessment and mapping of spatial variation of soil physical health in a farm  ap. 292-303.  aProductivity rating systems are important tools to quantitatively assess soil health. In precision farming such information is required for planning appropriate soil and crop management strategies. In order to demonstrate a proper procedure for assessing the soil physical health of a farm, an experiment was conducted in a rice–wheat field. Spatial variability analysis of soil physical properties measured on a rectangular grid (30m×45m) was carried out by using geostatistical analyst extension of Arc GIS software. Indicators for soil physical health assessment included bulk density (BD), field saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfₛ), available water retention capacity (AWRC), organic carbon content (OC) and non capillary porosity (NCP). Rating values of soil physical parameters were different for wheat and rice as the optimum physical environment for both systems were different. Physical rating index (PI) at each sampling point was determined by multiplying the rating values for all five parameters. Results revealed that for BD, Kfₛ, OC and soil physical health index (PI), major and minor ranges of semivariogram varied between 300–380m and 55–90m, respectively. Whereas for NCP and AWRC, they were relatively short (major range between 114–140m and minor around 60m). Results also revealed that BD and PI for both surface and subsurface layers showed strong spatial dependence whereas the rest of the parameters showed moderate spatial dependence. Rating maps of mentioned parameters for wheat and rice cultivations were prepared as series of coloured contours by using kriging or other appropriate interpolation techniques and suitable semivariogram models. Overall soil physical health of the farm was medium to good for paddy cultivation but was not suitable for succeeding wheat crop mainly because of increased BD and reduced Kfₛ, NCP and AWRC of the farm during wheat growth. Correlations between PI and grain yield of both wheat and rice were fairly good (r²=0.67). The results thus supported earlier findings that good soil physical health is essential for optimum sustained crop production.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3acarbon 3acrop management 3afarms 3ageographic information systems 3agrain yield 3akriging 3apaddies 3aplanning 3aporosity 3aprecision agriculture 3arice 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asoil analysis 3asoil quality 3awater holding capacity 3awheat1 aKamble, Kalpana1 aAggarwal, Pramila1 aChakraborty, Debashis1 aPradhan, Sanatan1 aMittal, Raj Bala0 tGeoderma.g2011 Jan. 15, v. 160, no. 3-4 p.292-303dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2010.09.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03490naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245011500206300001400321500001500335520185700350592002802207650002002235650001202255650003002267650001002297650001002307650001202317650001902329650002502348650000902373650002902382650001902411650001502430650001902445650001502464650004302479651001302522651001702535653002102552653002002573653001102593653001802604653002002622653001602642653000902658700001502667700001902682700001802701700001802719773009702737856008102834852000902915655001202924IND60531364420221120025707.0170713e20160601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053136442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2016.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDetsch, Florian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2755-533210aSeasonal and long-term vegetation dynamics from 1-km GIMMS-based NDVI time series at Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania  ap. 70-83.  a2019-12-06  aVegetation dynamics in the Kilimanjaro region, Tanzania, are subject to (i) global climate change and (ii) local land-cover change resulting from natural or anthropogenic disturbance. While recent climate models predict rising temperatures over East Africa throughout the 21st century, effects of land-use change on the local-scale water budget and, related therewith, on vegetation response are much more diverse. In addition, sea surface temperature anomalies in the Pacific (El Niño Southern Oscillation, ENSO) and Indian Ocean (Indian Ocean Dipole, IOD) are known to severely impact rainfall patterns and vegetation activity in the study area and possibly reinforce each other. Here we present long-term and seasonal vegetation dynamics derived from a GIMMS-based NDVI record resampled to 1km spatial resolution and covering a 30-year period (1982–2011). In the long term, most of the upper mountain regions showed positive trends which was mainly attributed to vegetation recovery after disastrous fires during the outgoing 20th century. Along the western mountainside, by contrast, strong negative trends emerged as a consequence of fire-driven downward migration of Erica bush along the upper slopes and massive land conversion processes affecting the lower slopes. On the seasonal scale, a strong dependence of the regional vegetation on the effects of ENSO/IOD teleconnections became evident. Similar to previous findings on rainfall, the most beneficial effects occurred during concurrent El Niño/IOD events, while the impacts of La Niña were far less pronounced. To sum up, the newly created 1-km NDVI record proved capable of capturing long-term and seasonal vegetation patterns, which particularly applies for large-scale teleconnections, and thus provides an invaluable archive of decadal-scale vegetation dynamics in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland use change 3aEl Nino 3asurface water temperature 3aErica 3afires 3aLa Nina 3aclimate change 3atime series analysis 3arain 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate models 3aland cover 3aremote sensing 3avegetation 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aTanzania 3aIndian Ocean 0aFire disturbance 0aTeleconnections 0aTrends 0awater balance 0aMt.

In mountainous areas, meteorological stations and observation data are very limited, making it difficult to accurately understand the response of precipitation to global climate change. Based on ECMWF Reanalysis v5 precipitation products, Berkeley Earth global temperature, and typical atmospheric circulation indexes, we integrated a gradient descent-nonlinear regression downscaling model, cross wavelet transform, and wavelet correlation method to analyze the precipitation response in Tianshan to global climate change. This study provides a high-resolution (90 m × 90 m) precipitation dataset in Tianshan and confirms that global warming, the North Pacific Pattern (NP), the Western Hemisphere Warm Pool (WHWP), and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) are related to the humidification of Tianshan over the past 40 years. The precipitation in Tianshan and global temperature have a resonance period of 8–15 months, and the correlation coefficient is above 0.9. In Tianshan, spring precipitation is determined mainly by AMO, North Tropical Atlantic Sea Level Temperature, Pacific Interdecadal Oscillation (PDO), Tropical North Atlantic Index, WHWP, NP, summer by NP, North Atlantic Oscillation, and PDO, autumn by AMO, and winter by Arctic Oscillation. This research can serve the precipitation forecast of Tianshan and help in the understanding of the regional response to global climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorth Atlantic Oscillation 3aatmospheric circulation 3aautumn 3adata collection 3ahumidification 3amodels 3amountains 3asea level 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3awavelet 3awinter 3aArctic region1 aXu, Jianhua 1 aLi, Dahui 1 aChen, Yaning 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Jan. 21, v. 14, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140305193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03711naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001200149245012400161520186700285592002802152650001602180650002202196650002502218650001102243650001502254650001702269650001202286650001002298650003002308650001802338650001702356650001202373650001402385650001302399650001402412651001902426653001402445653002102459653001802480653002802498653001302526653001302539653001302552653001602565653001702581653000802598653000802606653000902614653001302623653001402636653000702650653000902657653000702666700001202673700001602685700001402701700001502715700001702730700001602747700001602763700001702779773012402796856008402920852000903004655001203013IND60745885620221119020038.0211129e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074588562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2021.1072682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Cui10aReconstruction of the evolutionary biogeography reveal the origins and diversification of oysters (Bivalvia: Ostreidae)  aOysters (Bivalvia: Ostreidae Rafinesque, 1815) live in the intertidal and shallow subtidal areas worldwide. Despite their long evolutionary histories, abundant fossil records, global distribution, and ecological significance, a systematic time-dependent biogeographical analysis of this family is still lacking. Using combined mitochondrial (COI and 16S rRNA) and nuclear (18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, H3 and ITS2) gene makers for 80% (70/88) of the recognized extant Ostreidae, we reconstructed the global phylogenetic and biogeographical relationships throughout the evolutionary history of oysters. The result provided a holistic view of the origin, migration and dispersal patterns of Ostreidae. The phylogenetic results and fossil evidence indicated that Ostreidae originated from the circum-Arctic region in the Early Jurassic. The widening of the Atlantic Ocean and changes in the Tethys Ocean further facilitated their subsequent diversification during the Cretaceous and the Palaeogene periods. In particular, Crassostrea and Saccostrea exhibited relatively low dispersal abilities and their major diversifications were consistent with the tectonic events. Environmental adaptations and reproductive patterns, therefore, should play key roles in the formation of oyster distribution patterners, rather than the dispersal ability of their planktonic larvae. The diversity dynamics inferred by standard phylogenetic are consistent with the fossil record, however, further systematic classification, especially for fossil genus Ostrea, would enhance our understanding on extant and fossil oysters.

We evaluated the host preference and feeding success of immature A. maculatum for 3 potential host species, the Carolina anole (Anolis carolinensis Voigt), the bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus Linnaeus), and the hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus Say and Ord). To determine host preference, ticks were given an option of two different hosts at a time. No ticks fed on anoles in the host preference study and no significant difference in preference could be determined for rats compared with quail. In a separate experiment to study feeding success, we placed ticks directly onto 10 individual animals of these same species. No ticks fed on anoles. Larvae did not statistically differ in number of days to engorge when feeding on rats (5.7 d) compared with quail (5.6 d). Nymphs, however, took significantly longer to engorge on rats (8.2 d) than on quail (7 d). Engorged larvae from rats and quail were not statistically different in weight, whereas nymphs that engorged on rats were significantly heavier (15.8 mg) than those from quail (13.2 mg). Engorged larvae and nymphs did not significantly differ in their molting success between hosts. Results of this study suggest that anoles were not good hosts for immature stages of A. maculatum. No clear host preference was identified for quail or cotton rats, although differences in time-to-engorgement and engorged specimen weights were noted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmblyomma maculatum 3aAnolis carolinensis 3aColinus virginianus 3aHepatozoon 3aRickettsia parkeri 3aSigmodon hispidus 3ahost preferences 3ahosts 3ahumans 3aimmatures 3alarvae 3amolting 3anymphs 3apathogens 3aquails 3arats 3aticks 3aUnited States 0aAmblyomma maculatum 0afeeding 0ahosts 0acotton rat 0aquail1 aGoddard, Jerome1 aVarela-Stokes, Andrea S.0 tJournal of entomological science.g2012 July, v. 47, no. 3 p.221-226dGeorgia Entomological Society, Inc.x0749-80047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18474%2F0749-8004-47.3.2213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011000167300001400277520186900291592002802160650001402188650001102202650003002213650001602243650002002259650001402279650001502293650002902308650001002337650001502347650003502362650001202397650002302409650001502432651001802447653000902465653001702474653001502491653001702506653001502523653002202538653001902560700001702579700001702596700001702613700001902630700001602649700001602665700001802681773010502699856008502804852000902889655001202898IND60536106920221120204131.0190215e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053610692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2014.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarlow, K.E.10aCitizen science reveals trends in bat populations: The National Bat Monitoring Programme in Great Britain  ap. 14-26.  aBats play an important role in ecosystems and are highly relevant as indicators of environmental change. Long-term monitoring of bat populations is therefore fundamental to verifying environmental change over time. Although in the past, significant declines in bat populations have been reported across Europe, only limited data are available from systematic monitoring schemes over long periods. In this study we use data from the National Bat Monitoring Programme, a citizen science scheme drawing on over 3500 volunteers, to estimate changes in populations across Great Britain for 10 bat species or species groups between 1997 and 2012. We demonstrate uniquely how data collected on relative abundance and activity of bats by volunteers at 3272 sites using standardised, multiple survey methods (counts at roosts and bat detector surveys using tuneable, heterodyne detectors) can be successfully utilised to produce statistically robust population indices for a large proportion of a country’s bat fauna. All trends calculated, with the exception of one species (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), had sufficient power to detect Red Alert level declines. Our results reveal a generally favourable picture for bats over the monitoring period; all species showed a stable or increasing trend from at least one survey type, although for four species where there were multiple trends from different survey types, the trend directions did not agree (Myotis nattereri, Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Eptesicus serotinus). This study demonstrates that use of volunteer programmes can be successful in monitoring bat populations, provided that key features including standardised survey methods and volunteer training are incorporated. Some species that are more difficult to detect and identify may however require specialist surveillance techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEptesicus 3aMyotis 3aPipistrellus pipistrellus 3aRhinolophus 3adata collection 3adetectors 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental indicators 3afauna 3amonitoring 3anatural resources conservation 3asurveys 3avolunteer training 3avolunteers 3aGreat Britain 0aBats 0aBiodiversity 0aChiroptera 0aConservation 0aIndicators 0aPopulation trends 0aSurvey methods1 aBriggs, P.A.1 aHaysom, K.A.1 aHutson, A.M.1 aLechiara, N.L.1 aRacey, P.A.1 aWalsh, A.L.1 aLangton, S.D.0 tBiological conservation.g2015 Feb., v. 182 p.14-26dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2014.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011600168300001600284520129200300592002801592650001501620650001401635650001401649650003001663650001301693650001901706650001701725650001901742650001501761650001301776700001201789700001601801700001201817700001601829700001701845700001601862700001701878700001301895700005201908700005801960773008702018856008502105852000902190655001202199IND60754476220221120204246.0211123e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075447622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2021.10.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shuaizhen10aBifunctional two-dimensional nanocomposite for electromagnetic wave absorption and comprehensive anti-corrosion  ap. 520-529.  aThe intense requirement for bifunctional electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorbing materials is becoming the urgent focus and upgraded exploration for advanced application of absorbing EMW device in complex and extreme environments. Based on high dielectric loss capacity and superior chemistry inertness of graphite nanosheets, a two-dimensional (2D) graphite nanosheet decorated with graphite encapsulating soft-magnetic Ni₃Fe nanocapsules was designed and exploited by introducing novel nitrogen catalyst in one-pot non-balance evaporating strategy. Through modulating the impedance matching and further optimal mass ratio, a minimum reflection loss (RL) of −35.8 dB at 7.35 GHz with an absorber thickness of 3.5 mm and a wide effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 5.5 GHz (RL ≤ −10 dB), which almost covered whole Ku-band, were realized with an absorber thickness of 2 mm. Combining the prominent EMW absorption, this 2D nanocomposite showed excellent comprehensive anti-corrosion ability to maintain the original microstructure in acidic, neutral and alkaline salty corrosion conditions. The successful exploration of 2D anticorrosive EMW absorber provides a significant insight for rational fabrication of futural bifunctional EMW absorbing devices in complex circumstances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acatalysts 3acorrosion 3aelectromagnetic radiation 3agraphene 3amicrostructure 3ananocapsules 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3anitrogen1 aMa, Lin1 aLei, Zixuan1 aHua, An1 aZhang, Anqi1 aSong, Yuhang1 aLiu, Fuchun1 aGeng, Dianyu1 aLiu, Wei1 aMa, Song1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7794-46061 aZhang, Zhidong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6203-01710 tCarbon.g2022 Jan., v. 186 p.520-529dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.10.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011300171500002200284520109600306592002801402650002401430650001201454650001401466650001901480650001801499650001101517650001401528650001201542650002101554650002101575650001201596650002101608650001701629650001301646650001101659653003901670653003201709653003001741700001601771700001601787700001901803700001201822700001601834773009601850856008601946852000902032655001202041IND60567113720221118022755.0170710s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056711372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.04.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Guanglei10aStructural Characterization and immunomodulatory activity of a novel polysaccharide from Pteridium aquilinum  aPre-press version  aPAP1-A, a novel heteropolysaccharide with an average molecular mass of 1.35×105Da, was isolated from Pteridium aquilinum using a combination of chromatography by DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow and Sepharose 4B. The monosaccharide component of PAP1-A was L-rhamnose, L-arabinose, L-fucose, D-xylose, D-mannose, D-glucose and D-galactose in the molar ration of 1.82: 1.53: 1.42: 1.31: 5.24: 1: 12.35. The predicted structure of PAP1-A was established to be a complex polysaccharide with a main chain consisted of α-(1→4)-linked galactose partially substituted at O-6 position, with the (1→2)-linked xylose, (1→3)-linked arabinose, (1→3)-linked rhamnose, (1→3,6)-linked mannose, and (1→6)-linked mannose, as branches. Fucose, glucose, mannose, and rhamnose were located at the termini of the branches. The immunomodulatory activity assay showed that PAP1-A could significantly promote the RAW264.7 cells proliferation and induce the production of NO from RAW264.7 cells. Therefore, PAP1-A shows as a potent immunomodulator with potential applications in the medical and food industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPteridium aquilinum 3aagarose 3aarabinose 3achromatography 3afood industry 3afucose 3agalactose 3aglucose 3aimmunomodulation 3aimmunomodulators 3amannose 3amolecular weight 3anitric oxide 3arhamnose 3axylose 0aPteridium aquilinum Polysaccharide 0aStructural Characterization 0aImmunobiological activity1 aWang, Kuiwu1 aZhang, Hong1 aSun, Hongxiang1 aWu, Bin1 aJu, Xianyan0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.04.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01961naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245011500165300001800280500001900298520083900317592002801156650001601184650002901200650001201229650001101241700002101252700001401273700005801287700005801345773014701403856007601550852000901626655001201635IND60733912220221122031208.0210414e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073391222DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c004402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWagner, Clifton L.10aRedox Activity of Pyridine-Oxazoline Ligands in the Stabilization of Low-Valent Organonickel Radical Complexes  ap. 5295-5300.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLow-valent organonickel radical complexes are common intermediates in cross-coupling reactions and metalloenzyme-mediated processes. The electronic structures of N-ligand supported nickel complexes appear to vary depending on the actor ligands and the coordination number. The reduction products of a series of divalent (pyrox)Ni complexes establish the redox activity of pyrox in stabilizing electron-rich Ni(II)–alkyl and −aryl complexes by adopting a ligand-centered radical configuration. The reduced pyrox imparts an enhanced trans-influence. In contrast, such redox activity was not observed in a (pyrox)Ni(I)–bromide species. The excellent capability of pyrox in stabilizing electron-rich Ni species resonates with its proclivity in promoting the reductive activation of C(sp³) electrophiles in cross-coupling reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3across-coupling reactions 3aligands 3anickel1 aHerrera, Gabriel1 aLin, Qiao1 aHu, Chunhua T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8172-22021 aDiao, Tianning1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3916-83720 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 143, no. 14 p.5295-5300dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c004403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245015800168300002000326520189400346592002802240650001502268650002202283650001902305650001202324650002202336650001902358650001602377650001602393650002702409650002202436650001602458650002002474650001602494650001502510650001102525650001402536650001302550650001402563650000902577650001902586650001502605650001402620650001102634650001102645650002102656650002702677650002702704650001402731650001502745700001802760700001902778700001702797700002302814773014902837856008102986852000903067655001203076IND60523472420221119124819.0160619e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052347242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6429-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrazeres, Ana R.10aSustainable treatment of different high-strength cheese whey wastewaters: an innovative approach for atmospheric CO2 mitigation and fertilizer production  ap. 13062-13075.  aRaw cheese whey wastewater (CWW) has been treated by means of FeCl₃ coagulation-flocculation, NaOH precipitation, and Ca(OH)₂ precipitation. Three different types of CWW were considered: without cheese whey recovery (CWW₀), 60 % cheese whey recovery (CWW₆₀), and 80 % cheese whey recovery (CWW₈₀). Cheese whey recovery significantly influenced the characteristics of the wastewater to be treated: organic matter, solids, turbidity, conductivity, sodium, chloride, calcium, nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. Initial organic load was reduced to values in the interval of 60–70 %. Application of FeCl₃, NaOH, or Ca(OH)₂ involved additional chemical oxygen demand (COD) depletions regardless of the CWW used. Under optimum conditions, the combination of 80 % cheese whey recovery and lime application led to 90 % reduction in COD. Turbidity (99.8%), total suspended solids (TSS) (98–99 %), oils and fats (82–96 %), phosphorus (98–99 %), potassium (96–97 %), and total coliforms (100 %) were also reduced. Sludge generated in the latter process showed excellent settling properties. This solid after filtration and natural evaporation can be used as fertilizer with limitations due to its saline nature. In an innovative, low-cost, and environmentally friendly technology, supernatant coming from the Ca(OH)₂ addition was naturally neutralized in 4–6 days by atmospheric CO₂ absorption without reagent addition. Consequently, a final aerobic biodegradation step can be applied for effluent polishing. This technology also allows for some atmospheric CO₂ mitigation. Time requirement for the natural carbonation depends on the effluent characteristics. A precipitate rich in organic matter and nutrients and depletions of solids, sodium, phosphorus, magnesium, Kjeldahl, and ammoniacal nitrogen were also achieved during the natural carbonation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiodegradation 3acalcium 3acalcium hydroxide 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonation 3acheese whey 3achemical oxygen demand 3acoliform bacteria 3aevaporation 3aferric chloride 3afertilizers 3afiltration 3alipids 3amagnesium 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aoils 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asludge 3asodium 3asodium hydroxide 3asustainable technology 3atotal suspended solids 3aturbidity 3awastewater1 aRivas, Javier1 aPaulo, Úrsula1 aRuas, Filipa1 aCarvalho, Fátima,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 July, v. 23, no. 13 p.13062-13075dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6429-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245013600169300001400305506002800319520159000347592002801937506003701965650002302002650002402025650003802049650001102087650001202098650001802110700001702128700001702145773015502162856009002317852000902407655001202416IND60785577820221207125916.0200314e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078557782DNAL7 a10.24843/Pastura.2018.v08.i01.p042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahlan, M10aEFFECT OF VARIOUS TYPES OF ORGANIC FERTILIZER ON PRODUCTIVITY OF Panicum maximum, Setaria splendida, AND Pennisetum purpureum GRASS  ap. 13-19.  aResource is Open Access  aForage is the main feed that contains almost all the nutrients needed by ruminants. This study aimed to determine the productivity of Panicum maximum, Setaria splendida Stapf, and Pennisetum purpureum grass were given organic fertilizer and knew the best organic fertilizer for each type of grass. The study used a completely randomized design in split plot pattern. The first factor (main plot) consists of three types of grass; Panicum maximum, Setaria splendida, and Pennisetum purpureum. The second factor (sub plot / subplot) is a type of organic fertilizer; without fertilizer, manure, compost, and vermicompost. Each treatment was repeated three times so that it consisted of 36 experimental units. The results showed that the interaction between the treatment of the type of organic fertilizer with the type of grass occurred in the variable number of tillers and the dry weight of the stem. The types of compost in significant can increase the number of tillers, the number of leaves, the dry weight of the stems, the dry weight of the leaves, and the total dry weight of forage, compared to without fertilizer. The type of grass has a significant effect on all observed variables. Based on the results of the study it can be concluded that the interaction between the treatment of the type of organic fertilizer with the type of grass affects the number of tillers and the dry weight of the stem, the three types of grass have different productivity, while among the organic fertilizers provided, compost gives the best results.

This reduction in growth rate, due to the diversion of cellular resources from making essential proteins, is called cost. Cellular resources depend upon the macromolecular content of the cell. Cost phenomenon lies in the process of transcription and translation. The effect of an upshift in the nutritional content of the medium on the cost process of natural lac proteins is not looked upon. Which process of gene expression, transcription, or translation is more important for the cost process is not clear. The current study indicated that cost process is not associated with the upshift mechanism. Cost process was not observed in presence of rifampicin but was detected in existence of chloramphenicol. The current study will help in better understanding of the cost process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3achloramphenicol 3agene expression 3agrowth retardation 3anutrient content 3aproteins 3arifampicin 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics)0 tArchives of microbiology.g2014 Apr., v. 196, no. 4 p.289-294dSpringer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-014-0967-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02186naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010700172300001600279520095700295592002801252650002201280650002001302650001501322650001901337650001601356651001701372653001501389653001601404653002301420653002001443653002101463700005201484700002101536700002101557700002101578773009901599856008101698852000901779655001201788IND60531364620221120032226.0160723e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053136462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2016.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDebats, Stephanie R.12aA generalized computer vision approach to mapping crop fields in heterogeneous agricultural landscapes  ap. 210-221.  aSmallholder farms dominate in many parts of the world, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa. These systems are characterized by small, heterogeneous, and often indistinct field patterns, requiring a specialized methodology to map agricultural land cover. Using a variety of sites in South Africa, we present a new approach to mapping agricultural fields, based on efficient extraction of a vast set of simple, highly correlated, and interdependent features, followed by a random forest classifier. We achieved similar high performance across agricultural types, including the spectrally indistinct smallholder fields as well as the more easily distinguishable commercial fields, and demonstrated the ability to generalize performance across large geographic areas. In sensitivity analyses, we determined multi-temporal information provided greater gains in performance than the addition of multi-spectral bands available in DigitalGlobe Worldview-2 imagery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acomputer vision 3aland cover 3aremote sensing 3asmall farms 3aSouth Africa 0aLand cover 0aAgriculture 0aSub-Saharan Africa 0aComputer vision 0aMachine learning1 aLuo, Dee1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0796-43341 aEstes, Lyndon D.1 aFuchs, Thomas J.1 aCaylor, Kelly K.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2016 June 15, v. 179 p.210-221dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2016.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245015800207300001200365506007600377520129700453592002801750596008201778596009301860506003701953650002001990650002102010650001602031650001502047650001402062650001702076650002202093650001502115650001702130650001002147650001802157650004302175650003202218650000902250650004302259650001202302650003902314650001302353650001402366700001302380700002102393700001602414700001302430700001802443773010602461856008102567852000902648655001202657IND60664393720221207084611.0190910e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066439372DNAL7 a10.1186/s12896-015-0221-12doi7 aPMC46476532pmcid7 a265724872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Fangyuan10aMouse Resistin (mRetn): cloning, expression and purification in Escherichia coli and the potential regulative effects on murine bone marrow hematopoiesis  ap. 105.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Resistin (Retn) is a cytokine which has a controversial physiological role regarding its involvement with obesity and type II diabetes mellitus. Recently, murine Retn was found to be a possibly potential regulator of hematopoiesis in mice shown in the screening results of a set of gene chips which mapped the expression level of murine genes during regeneration of impaired bone marrow (BM) by 5-fluorouracil. RESULTS: Recombinant mice Retn was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using ion exchange chromatography. Totally 11.4 mg rmRetn was obtained from 500 ml culture with endotoxin level less than 1.0 EU/ug. The purity of recombinant murine Resistin reached to at least 97.6 % via SDS-PAGE analysis and HPLC. The protein possessed chemotaxis effects in the mouse aortic endothelial cells in vitro in transwell analysis. In vitro, rmRetn could up regulate the CFU number of mice BM and after rmRetn was administered, the cell number of murine bone marrow was significantly increased in vivo after chemotherapy. Finally, rmRetn was found able to protect mice from the chemotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil. CONCLUSIONS: The discovery demonstrated a new function of murine Retn and suggested that it could potentially accelerate bone marrow regeneration post chemotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data  a134119a8100cScience and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality  a20134Y176cYoung Scientific Research Project of Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA microarrays 3aEscherichia coli 3abone marrow 3achemotaxis 3acytokines 3adrug therapy 3aendothelial cells 3aendotoxins 3afluorouracil 3agenes 3ahematopoiesis 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aion exchange chromatography 3amice 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aresistin 3ascreening1 aGao, Jin1 aMalisani, Alyssa1 aXi, Xiaowei1 aHan, Wei1 aWan, Xiaoping0 tBMC biotechnology.g2015 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.105-105dBioMed CentralwJournal:19124x1472-67507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12896-015-0221-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245008900185300001600274520130600290592002801596650002101624650001001645650001001655650001001665650001301675650002701688650001601715650002401731650001401755650002201769650001201791650002801803650005101831650005201882650002101934650003701955650001001992650001802002650002802020650002402048650001402072650003902086650002702125650002202152651001002174651001002184700001902194700001802213700001602231700001902247773009202266856004802358852000902406655001202415IND4480754420221119162557.0121003e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448075442DNAL7 a226844692pmid7 a10.1007/s12250-012-3214-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xing-xiao10aComplete genome sequence analysis of duck circovirus strains from Cherry Valley duck  ap. 154-164.  aTo investigate molecular epidemiology of DuCV in Cherry Valley ducks in China, the complete genomes of six DuCV strains, which were detected from Cherry Valley ducks in China between 2007 and 2008, were sequenced. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis were carried out to compare these six strains with another 27 DuCV strains from Mulard duck, Muscovy duck, Pekin ducks and Mule duck. The analysis showed that the six DuCV strains exhibited typical genetic features of the family of DuCV, such as a stem-loop structure, three major open reading frames (Rep, Cap and ORF3), four intergenic repeats and the conserved motifs for rolling circle replication and for the dNTP binding domain located in the Rep protein. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the complete genome and Cap gene of these strains together with those that have been previously published demonstrated two distinct DuCV genotypes. The DuCV strains with complete genomes containing 1988 and 1989 nucleotides clustered in genotype A, whereas the strains with complete genomes containing 1991, 1992, 1995 and 1996 nucleotides lay in genotype B. The six DuCV strains from Cherry Valley ducks were divided into the two groups. The results of the study provides some insight into the variation of DuCVs in Cherry Valley ducks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCairina moschata 3aPekin 3aducks 3agenes 3agenotype 3amolecular epidemiology 3anucleotides 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 2aAnimals 2aBird Diseasesxvirology 2aCircoviridae Infectionsxveterinaryxvirology. 2aCircovirusxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA, Viralxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDucks 2aGenome, Viral 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPhylogeny 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology 3aChina 0aChina1 aLiu, Shao-ning1 aXie, Zhi-jing1 aKong, Yi-bo1 aJiang, Shi-jin0 tVirologica Sinica.g2012 June, v. 27, no. 3 p.154-164dSpringer-Verlagx1674-07697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12250-012-3214-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013300168300001600301520094700317592002801264650001001292650001701302650001201319650001601331650001001347650001101357650002001368650003101388650001401419653001301433653002601446653002301472653003101495653001601526700001801542700001601560700001801576700001301594700001801607773010801625856008601733852000901819655001201828IND60540862620221122222828.0190318e20150315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054086262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.10.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Hongyan10aTheranostic magnetoliposomes coated by carboxymethyl dextran with controlled release by low-frequency alternating magnetic field  ap. 209-217.  aThe aim of this work was to construct carboxymethyl dextran (CMD)-coated magnetoliposomes (MLs), another stealth MLs alternative to PEGylated MLs, for theranostic application. Particularly, the on-demand release of CMD-MLs under low-frequency alternating magnetic field (LF-AMF) was studied. We found that as-prepared MLs exhibited good stability and high drug loading ability for doxorubicin (DOX). Cytotoxicity assay against human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells showed that the DOX-loaded CMD-MLs were less toxic than free DOX due to the sustained release of DOX. However, the release of DOX-loaded CMD-MLs was enhanced by low-frequency alternating magnetic field without hyperthermia generation. The MLs also acted as an efficient T2-weighted contrast agent during in vitro MRI measurements. The above results provide useful information on in vivo diagnostic/therapeutic efficacy of DOX-loaded CMD-MLs for some cancers, such as brain cancers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3acytotoxicity 3adextran 3adoxorubicin 3afever 3ahumans 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3aneoplasms 0aLiposome 0aCarboxymethyl dextran 0aControlled release 0aMagnetic resonance imaging 0aDoxorubicin1 aChen, Wansong1 aSun, Xiaoyi1 aLiu, You-Nian1 aLi, Juan1 aWang, Jianxiu0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2015 Mar. 15, v. 118 p.209-217dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.10.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245008100170520149100251592002801742650001501770650003601785650002401821650001101845650001201856650002101868650001301889650002601902650001301928650001701941650002301958651001001981700002301991700001902014773012702033856007402160852000902234655001202243IND60652550220221119083330.0190713e20180802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065255022DNAL7 a10.3390/su100827172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTormo-Carbó, Guillermina10aBusiness Ethics as a Sustainability Challenge: Higher Education Implications  aRecent financial scandals worldwide have intensified concern for business (and especially accounting) ethics. Hence, under an overall economic and social sustainability approach, it is crucial to improve the effectiveness of business ethics and corporate social responsibility (CSR) education, in terms of its impact on business students&rsquo; awareness of ethical issues. However, stand-alone business ethics/CSR courses are uncommon in Spanish universities. Accordingly, this paper aims at examining the influence of ethics courses on students&rsquo; awareness of business ethics in unfriendly environments. We test our hypotheses, through hierarchical regression, in a sample of 551 management students of a Spanish university. Our results suggest that business ethics/CSR courses increase awareness of the importance of ethics in: (i) business courses, (ii) recognizing accounting ethical implications, and (iii) workplace decisions. Our findings also show that a joint interactive effect of gender (female students) and age (older students) increases the impact of business ethics/CSR courses on students&rsquo; awareness of the importance of: (i) ethics in workplace decisions, and (ii) the recognition of accounting ethical implications. Our results also support the relevance of different learning styles and the convenience of adapting ethics/CSR teaching methods depending on students&rsquo; characteristics. Research and practical implications are derived from our findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccounting 3acorporate social responsibility 3aeducational methods 3aethics 3afemales 3ahigher education 3alearning 3asocial sustainability 3astudents 3auniversities 3aworking conditions 3aSpain1 aSeguí Mas, Elies,1 aOltra, Víctor0 tSustainability.g2018 Aug. 02, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100827173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03595naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245010400174300001600278520207500294592002802369650002502397650001702422650001602439650001602455650002502471650000902496650001702505650001502522650003202537650002102569650000702590650001302597650002002610650001502630650001602645650002002661650002502681650001602706700002602722700002602748700002802774700002702802700002402829700003502853773011102888856008102999852000903080655001203089IND60114256920221120231449.0141118e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011425692DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-014-2295-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStefanović, Andrea B.10aImpact of ultrasound on egg white proteins as a pretreatment for functional hydrolysates production  ap. 979-993.  aThe objective of this study was to investigate the effects of different ultrasound pretreatment on enzymatic hydrolysis of egg white proteins (EWPs) by Alcalase as well as evaluating some functional and antioxidant properties of hydrolysates obtained by various proteases treatment and ultrasound technology. The effects of chosen ultrasound pretreatment parameters including frequency of ultrasonic waves (35 and 40 kHz), temperature (25 and 55 °C), time of pretreatment (15–60 min) and pH of egg white solution (7.00–10.00) were examined. It appeared that controlled ultrasound treatment can improved the hydrolysis process compared with untreated samples, but optimization of the power and length of sonication was important. The optimal ultrasound pretreatment at calorimetric power of 21.3 W and frequency of 40 kHz for 15 min at 25 °C and with naturally basic egg white (pH 9.25) resulted in increased initial rate and equilibrium degree of Alcalase hydrolysis by about 139.8 and 13.86 % compared with the control, respectively. EWP hydrolysates with ≈27.0 % degree of hydrolysis obtained with heat pretreatment and ultrasound pretreatments under optimal conditions were further separated by sequential ultrafiltration into 4 hydrolysate fractions (<1, 1–10, 10–30 and >30 kDa) which were investigated for protein content, peptide yield and antioxidant activity. The hydrolysis after heat pretreatment generated more peptides <1 kDa (19.04 ± 1.02 %) than ultrasound pretreatment did (11.90 ± 0.53 %), whereas the proportion of peptides <10 kDa were higher in the second case (28.80 ± 0.07 vs. 20.46 ± 0.39 %). The fraction obtained by the ultrasound pretreatment containing peptides with a molecular weight between 1 and 10 kDa demonstrated the strongest ABTS radical scavenging efficacy among the fractions (97.54 ± 0.30) with IC₅₀ value of 4.31 mg/mL. Compared with single-enzyme processes, the two-stage enzymatic processes did not significantly improve both antioxidant and functional hydrolysates’ properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acalorimetry 3aegg albumen 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aheat 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apeptides 3aprotein content 3asubtilisin 3atemperature 3aultrafiltration 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics1 aJovanović, Jelena R.1 aGrbavčić, Sanja Ž.1 aŠekuljica, Nataša Ž.1 aManojlović, Verica B.1 aBugarski, Branko M.1 aKnežević-Jugović, Zorica D.0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2014 Dec., v. 239, no. 6 p.979-993dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-014-2295-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01768naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245006500161300001400226520083400240592002801074650001401102650001301116650003401129700001401163700001701177700005701194773014201251856007601393852000901469655001201478IND60603296220221120130348.0180713e20180110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060329622DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b104792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jianfeng10aPhotoconductance from Exciton Binding in Molecular Junctions  ap. 70-73.  aWe report on a theoretical analysis and experimental verification of a mechanism for photoconductance, the change in conductance upon illumination, in symmetric single-molecule junctions.

Using a scanning tunneling microscopy break junction technique, we measure the conductance histograms of perylene tetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) molecules attached to Au-electrodes, in the dark and under illumination, and show a significant and reversible change in conductance, as expected from the theory. Finally, we show how our description of the photoconductance leads to a simple design principle for enhancing the performance of molecular switches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrons 3alighting 3ascanning tunneling microscopy1 aWang, Kun1 aXu, Bingqian1 aDubi, Yonatan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8988-49350 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Jan. 10, v. 140, no. 1 p.70-73dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b104793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245010300163300001800266520171500284592002801999650002002027650002502047650001102072650002002083650001102103650002402114650001702138650001302155650002202168650002102190651001002211653003402221653003502255653002102290653003002311653001002341700001402351773011502365856008602480852000902566655001202575IND60557365720221122224448.0190321e20170110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055736572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.09.2212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Ben10aIndustrial structure, energy-saving regulations and energy intensity: Evidence from Chinese cities  ap. 1539-1547.  aExploring the drivers of declining energy intensity is necessary in order to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy in China. To date, studies have typically adopted case analysis to link enterprise features and energy-saving performance. The impact of internal industrial configuration in terms of size and ownership structure on aggregate energy intensity remains to be examined. To fill this research gap, this paper tests the impact of the internal structure of industries on city-level energy intensity, by employing a unique panel dataset of 283 cities for the period 2005 to 2010. The Driscoll-Kraay method and instrumental variable are used to treat residual cross-sectional dependence and endogeneity, respectively. Results suggest that small-scale enterprises exerts a negative effect on energy intensity. A 1% increase in the output-value proportion of small-sized firms will lead to a decrease in total energy intensity of 0.067%. In contrast, the same change by medium enterprises will raise energy intensity by 0.031%. A negative and/or non-significant coefficient suggests that for most energy-intensive large and state-owned enterprises, China's 2006 top-down energy-saving regulation has been quite effective in targeting key energy-intensive enterprises in China. The findings reveal that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) can act as promoters of, rather than barriers to, low-carbon policy implementation in China. Given that the effectiveness of energy-saving regulation will be undermined as a result of diluted regulatory strength in each enterprise, market-oriented energy price reform is proposed as a fundamental driver for guaranteeing a continual decline in energy intensity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abusiness enterprises 3acities 3adata collection 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy costs 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3apublic ownership 3aChina 0aEnterprise size and ownership 0aState-owned enterprises (SOEs) 0aEnergy intensity 0aEnergy-saving regulations 0aChina1 aYu, Yihua0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Jan. 10, v. 141 p.1539-1547dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.09.2213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245010800173300001600281520126700297592002801564650002101592650001901613650001701632650002401649650001901673650002301692650001301715650002101728650002001749650002601769650001301795650002401808650001301832650001101845650000701856650001301863650001101876653002901887653002201916653002601938653001601964653002001980700001502000700001502015700002102030773009102051856008902142852000902231655001202240IND60606529620221121193433.0180726e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060652962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.07.1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lijuan10aSpecific and sustainable bioelectro-reduction of carbon dioxide to formate on a novel enzymatic cathode  ap. 228-234.  aTo specifically convert waste CO2 into renewable chemicals, enzymatic electrosynthesis (EES) of formate from CO2 reduction was investigated in a bioelectrochemical system (BES). A novel cathode with immobilized enzyme and electropolymerized mediator-regenerator was fabricated for such bioelectrocatalytic EES. Formate dehydrogenase from Candida boidinii (CbFDH) was set as a new model enzyme in BES. Modified Nafion micelles with appropriate pore size were found to be suitable for immobilization of CbFDH and protection of its enzymatic activity and lifetime at optimal pH of 6.0. The enzymatic electrosynthesis activity of immobilized CbFDH was characterized systematically. Quite a small overpotential was required in the bioelectrochemical EES reaction. A two-electron transfer process was confirmed in the CbFDH-catalyzed reduction of bicarbonate to formate. With electro-polymerized neutral red (PolyNR) as a NADH (mediator)-regenerator, efficient formate production could be achieved at a maximum rate of 159.89 mg L⁻¹ h⁻¹ under poised potential of −0.80 V (vs. SHE). The immobilized CbFDH and electropolymerized PolyNR on an enzymatic cathode contributed greatly to sustainable EES, giving energy-rich formate as the only catalysis product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida boidinii 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3abicarbonates 3abioelectrochemistry 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalytic activity 3acathodes 3aelectrosynthesis 3aenzyme activity 3aformate dehydrogenase 3aformates 3aimmobilized enzymes 3amicelles 3amodels 3apH 3aporosity 3awastes 0aCarbon dioxide reduction 0aFormate synthesis 0aFormate dehydrogenase 0aNeutral red 0aNafion micelles1 aLiu, Junyi1 aOng, Jacky1 aLi, Sam Fong Yau0 tChemosphere.g2016 Nov., v. 162 p.228-234dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.07.1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245011500181300001600296520155300312592002801865650004201893650002901935650002001964650001401984650001801998650002202016650001302038650002702051650000902078650002502087650002802112650003502140650002302175650002502198650002002223650001802243650001302261650002702274650003602301650001402337650003602351650002802387700001802415700002202433700002002455700002302475700001902498700003202517700001502549700002202564700002102586773010802607856004802715852000902763655001202772IND50063337620221121022620.0130324e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006333762DNAL7 a231244302pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-012-2002-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jiaxin10aPhenotypic diversity and association mapping for fruit quality traits in cultivated tomato and related species  ap. 567-581.  aAssociation mapping has been proposed as an efficient approach to assist in the identification of the molecular basis of agronomical traits in plants. For this purpose, we analyzed the phenotypic and genetic diversity of a large collection of tomato accessions including 44 heirloom and vintage cultivars (Solanum lycopersicum), 127 S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme (cherry tomato) and 17 Solanum pimpinellifolium accessions. The accessions were genotyped using a SNPlex™ assay of 192 SNPs, among which 121 were informative for subsequent analysis. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) of pairwise loci and population structure were analyzed, and the association analysis between SNP genotypes and ten fruit quality traits was performed using a mixed linear model. High level of LD was found in the collection at the whole genome level. It was lower when considering only the 127 S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme accessions. Genetic structure analysis showed that the population was structured into two main groups, corresponding to cultivated and wild types and many intermediates. The number of associations detected per trait varied, according to the way the structure was taken into account, with 0–41 associations detected per trait in the whole collection and a maximum of four associations in the S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme accessions. A total of 40 associations (30 %) were co-localized with previously identified quantitative trait loci. This study thus showed the potential and limits of using association mapping in tomato populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme 3aSolanum pimpinellifolium 3acherry tomatoes 3acultivars 3afruit quality 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aloci 3apopulation structure 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aChromosome Mapping 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aFruitxgenetics 2aGenome, Plant 2aGenotype 2aLinkage Disequilibrium 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgenetics. 2aPhenotype 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aQuantitative Trait Loci1 aRanc, Nicolas1 aMuños, Stéphane1 aRolland, Sophie1 aBouchet, Jean-Paul1 aDesplat, Nelly1 aLe Paslier, Marie-Christine1 aLiang, Yan1 aBrunel, Dominique1 aCausse, Mathilde0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2013 Mar., v. 126, no. 3 p.567-581dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-012-2002-8  aDNAL 7aarticle01981naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009600159300002000255520092000275592002801195650002401223650002001247650001601267650001501283650001601298650001901314700001301333700001301346700001401359700001801373700001401391773014301405856007401548852000901622655001201631IND60671225620221122232505.0191002e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067122562DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta06734k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jingjing12aA wearable and highly sensitive CO sensor with a macroscopic polyaniline nanofiber membrane  ap. 24333-24337.  aA wearable CO sensor based on a macroscopic membrane which consists of polyaniline (PANI) coated electrospun nanofibers is reported.

Sensors based on the macro-PANI nanofiber membrane are constructed, displaying a rapid response (20 s) to CO with a high detection limit (2.5 ppb) at room temperature. Furthermore, by replacing the nanofiber template with natural cotton fibers, a sensing material towards wearable sensors is manufactured and excellent sensing responses are also detected.

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an important staple food crop, feeding half of the population around the globe. Developing new rice varieties with desirable agronomic traits is necessary for sustaining global food security. The use of genome editing technologies for developing rice varieties is pre-requisite in the present scenario. Among the genome editing technologies developed for rice crop improvement, base editing technology has emerged as an efficient and reliable tool for precise genome editing in rice plants. Base editing technology utilizes either adenosine or cytidine base editor for precise editing at the target region. A base editor (adenosine or cytidine) is a fusion of catalytically inactive CRISPR/Cas9 domain and adenosine or cytidine deaminase domain. In this review, authors have discussed the different adenine and cytosine base editors developed so far for precise genome editing of rice via base editing technology. We address the current progress, advances, limitations, as well as future perspectives of the base editing technology for rice crop improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aOryza sativa 3aadenine 3aadenosine 3acytidine 3acytidine deaminase 3acytosine 3afood security 3agenome 3arice 3astaple crops1 aSahoo, Lingaraj0 tPlant cell reports.g2021 Apr., v. 40, no. 4 p.595-604dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl33565x0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-020-02656-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02039naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245016600170300001600336520072100352592002801073650001101101650001301112650002401125650001201149650001801161653003001179653001401209653001401223653003201237700001901269700001801288700001601306700001701322700002001339700002001359700002401379773013901403856007801542852000901620655001201629IND60522110420221120051909.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052211042DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1998-5-6172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlein, Hans-Friedrich10aHydrido(acylphenolato)cobaIt(III)-Verbindungen mit Trimethylphosphan-Liganden / Hydrido(acylphenolato)cobalt(III) Compounds Containing Trimethylphosphane Ligands  ap. 587-598.  aSalicylaldehyde derivatives and related β-hydroxo aldehydes CHO-CR=CR′-OH react with CoMe(PMe₃)₄ via oxidative substitution to form low-spin d⁶ complexes mer-CoH(CO-CR=CR-O)(PMe₃)₃.

Wound and wound infections are also major health problem. Nowadays, medicinal plants play a major role in treatment of infectious diseases and wound healing and they are easily available and more affordable as compared to synthetic compounds. The aim of this study is therefore, to investigate the antibacterial and wound healing activities of 80% methanol extract of Hibiscus micranthus leaves using disc diffusion methods and rat excision model respectively. METHODS: In vitro antibacterial screening was carried out against S. aureus, S.pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis bacterial strains using disc-well diffusion assay. Would healing activity was done in rats divided into four groups each consisting of six animals. Group I was served as a negative control (ointment base), Group II served as a positive control Nitrofurazone (NFZ 0.2% ointment), Groups III and IV was treated 5 and 10% extracts respectively. The acute oral toxicity test and skin sensitivity test were also performed before conducting the actual study. The extract was analyzed for secondary metabolites using standard methods. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical screening have revealed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, tannins, steroids, phenols, diterpines, anthraquinones and the absence of glycosides, terpinoides and triterpines. Based on acute oral toxicity test the extract was found to be safe up to a dose of 2 g/kg. In addition, acute dermal toxicity test indicated no sign of skin irritation. The leaves extract exhibited varying degrees of sensitivity with zones of inhibition ranging from 14.00 ± 0.333 (S.pyogenes) to 22.67 ± 1.202 mm (S.aureus). It was found that S. aureus and S. pneumonia (p < 0.05) were the most sensitive to the extracts of the leaves at concentrations of 800 μg/ml and 400 μg/ml respectively followed by P. aeuruginosa [(18.33 ± .333 mm) (p < 0.05)] at a concentration of 400 μg/ml. However, E. coli and P. mirabilis were found to be resistant to the extract at any of the applied doses. In the wound healing study, the 5 and 10% w/w extract exhibited significant wound contraction rate of 99.30% and 99.13% as compared to NFZ ointment and simple ointment base treated groups from 6th to 16th day, respectively (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that the methanol extract of the leaves exhibited a potential antibacterial activity against the tested microorganisms and wound healing activity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aHibiscus 3aProteus mirabilis 3aalkaloids 3aalternative medicine 3aanthraquinones 3aantibacterial properties 3adermal exposure 3adeveloping countries 3adietary exposure 3aexcision 3aflavonoids 3ainfectious diseases 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3amethanol 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aointments 3aphenols 3apneumonia 3arats 3asaponins 3ascreening 3asecondary metabolites 3askin irritation 3asteroids 3atannins 3atissue repair 3atoxicity testing1 aMishra, Bharat1 aTsegaw, Asegedech1 aShewamene, Zewdneh0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2017 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.337-337dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-017-1841-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245008700181300001800268500001500286520169700301592002801998650002202026650000902048650002602057650003102083650002402114650002602138650001702164650002202181650003302203650005202236650001102288650001702299650001002316650001902326650002102345650001302366653001302379700001802392700001502410700001602425700001702441700001902458773009602477856008102573852000902654655001202663IND60114257120221121002227.0141118e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011425712DNAL7 a252361582pmid7 a10.1007/s00299-014-1679-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lili10aIdentification of rice Di19 family reveals OsDi19-4 involved in drought resistance  ap. 2047-2062.  a2019-12-04  aKEY MESSAGE: The OsDi19 proteins functioned as transcription factors and played crucial roles in response to abiotic stress. Overexpression of OsDi19 - 4 in rice increased drought tolerance by enhancing ROS-scavenging activity. Many transcription factors play crucial roles in plant responses to abiotic stress. Here, comprehensive sequence analysis suggested that the drought-induced 19 (Di19) gene family in rice genome contain seven members, and these proteins contained a well-conserved zinc-finger Di19 domain. Most OsDi19 proteins were mainly targeted to the nucleus and have transactivation activity in yeast. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that most OsDi19 proteins could form protein dimers. Expression analysis demonstrated that the OsDi19 genes were differentially and abundantly expressed in vegetative tissues, but expressed little in reproductive tissues and some of the OsDi19 genes were markedly induced by abiotic stresses and hormones in qRT-PCR analysis and microarray data. Overexpression of one stress-responsive gene, OsDi19-4, in rice resulted in significantly increased tolerance to drought stress compared with the wild type plants. Moreover, obviously increased ROS-scavenging ability was detected in the OsDi19-4-overexpressing plants under normal and drought stress conditions. These results suggested that the increased stress tolerance of OsDi19-4-overexpressing plants may be attributable to the enhanced ROS-scavenging activity. Taken together, these studies provide a detailed overview of the rice Di19 gene family, and suggest that the OsDi19 family may play crucial roles in the plant response to abiotic stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3asequence analysis 3arice 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation 3agene overexpression 3amicroarray technology 3afluorescence 3adrought tolerance 3atwo hybrid system techniques 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3ayeasts 3awater stress 3agenes 3aplant response 3astress tolerance 3ahormones 0aproteins1 aYu, Changchun1 aChen, Cong1 aHe, Chunlan1 aZhu, Yingguo1 aHuang, Wenchao0 tPlant cell reports.g2014 Dec., v. 33, no. 12 p.2047-2062dSpringer-Verlagx0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-014-1679-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100001900197245012300216300001600339506007600355520131500431592002801746506003701774650002801811650002001839650002501859650001601884650003201900650002401932650001901956650001901975650002801994650001602022650001302038650002302051650001402074650002402088650002002112650001102132653002502143653002002168653001202188653002002200653003802220700001102258700002202269700002202291700006202313773007702375856009002452852000902542655001202551IND60562518020221207133950.0170626e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056251802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.12.0282doi7 aPMC47558782pmcid7 a268286872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yingyue10aMicellar and structural stability of nanoscale amphiphilic polymers: Implications for anti-atherosclerotic bioactivity  ap. 230-240.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAtherosclerosis, a leading cause of mortality in developed countries, is characterized by the buildup of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) within the vascular intima, unregulated oxLDL uptake by macrophages, and ensuing formation of arterial plaque. Amphiphilic polymers (AMPs) comprised of a branched hydrophobic domain and a hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) tail have shown promising anti-atherogenic effects through direct inhibition of oxLDL uptake by macrophages. In this study, five AMPs with controlled variations were evaluated for their micellar and structural stability in the presence of serum and lipase, respectively, to develop underlying structure-atheroprotective activity relations. In parallel, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore the AMP conformational preferences within an aqueous environment. Notably, AMPs with ether linkages between the hydrophobic arms and sugar backbones demonstrated enhanced degradation stability and storage stability, and also elicited enhanced anti-atherogenic bioactivity. Additionally, AMPs with increased hydrophobicity elicited increased atheroprotective bioactivity in the presence of serum. These studies provide key insights for designing more serum-stable polymeric micelles as prospective cardiovascular nanotherapies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aatherosclerosis 3abioactive properties 3ablood serum 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3adeveloped countries 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alow density lipoprotein 3amacrophages 3amicelles 3amolecular dynamics 3amortality 3apolyethylene glycol 3astorage quality 3asugars 0aAmphiphilic polymers 0aAtherosclerosis 0aMicelle 0aSerum stability 0aStructure–activity relationship1 aLi, Qi1 aWelsh, William J.1 aMoghe, Prabhas V.1 aUhrich, Kathryn E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7273-75280 tBiomaterials.g2016 Apr., v. 84 p.230-240dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.12.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01684naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002200183245005900205300001400264506007600278520053300354592002800887506003700915650001600952650001200968650001100980650002100991650001401012700002401026700005701050773014201107856007601249852000901325655001201334IND60603296520221207123646.0180713e20180110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060329652DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b105292doi7 aPMC60920152pmcid7 a290955982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGockel, Samuel N.10aCu-Catalyzed Three-Component Carboamination of Alkenes  ap. 58-61.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCopper-catalyzed intermolecular carboamination of alkenes with α-halocarbonyls and amines is presented with 42 examples.

Furthermore, DES anti-proliferative agents do not counteract the upstream oxidative stress that triggers the SMC proliferation cascade. In this study, we investigate biocompatible amphiphilic macromolecules (AMs) that address high oxidative lipoprotein microenvironments by competitively binding oxidized lipid receptors and suppressing SMC proliferation with minimal cytotoxicity. To determine the influence of nanoscale assembly on proliferation, micelles and nanoparticles were fabricated from AM unimers containing a phosphonate or carboxylate end-group, a sugar-based hydrophobic domain, and a hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) domain. The results indicate that when SMCs are exposed to high levels of oxidized lipid stimuli, nanotherapeutics inhibit lipid uptake, downregulate scavenger receptor expression, and attenuate scavenger receptor gene transcription in SMCs, and thus significantly suppress proliferation. Although both functional end-groups were similarly efficacious, nanoparticles suppressed oxidized lipid uptake and scavenger receptor expression more effectively compared to micelles, indicating the relative importance of formulation characteristics (e.g., higher localized AM concentrations and nanotherapeutic stability) in scavenger receptor binding as compared to AM end-group functionality. Furthermore, AM coatings significantly prevented platelet adhesion to metal, demonstrating its potential as an anti-platelet therapy to treat thrombosis. Thus, AM micelles and NPs can effectively repress early stage SMC proliferation and thrombosis through non-cytotoxic mechanisms, highlighting the promise of nanomedicine for next-generation cardiovascular therapeutics.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadhesion 3ablood platelets 3acell adhesion 3acell proliferation 3acoatings 3acytotoxicity 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3ahypersensitivity 3alipoproteins 3amicelles 3ananomedicine 3ananoparticles 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3apolyethylene glycol 3areceptors 3arisk 3asmooth muscle 3atherapeutics 3athrombosis 3atranscription (genetics) 0aBioactive polymers 0aMicelles 0aNanoparticles 0aRestenosis 0aThrombosis1 aLewis, Daniel R.1 aPetersen, Latrisha K.1 aMoghe, Prabhas V.1 aUhrich, Kathryn E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7273-75280 tBiomaterials.g2016 Apr., v. 84 p.219-229dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.12.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01617naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245010100166300001400267520053100281592002800812650001000840650001400850650002200864650001000886650001900896650000900915650001400924650002400938650001000962700001800972700002300990700002601013700001901039700002201058773009401080856004801174852000901222655001201231IND4450699520221120165734.0121003e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445069952DNAL7 a10.3103/S00954527110100752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorshikov, I.

Here, we present a geographically extensive baseline survey that examine the concentrations of nine metals (Ag, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) and one metalloid (As) in superficial sediments from 28 sites spread over three islands of French Polynesia. We used Principal Component Analysis, Pearson's correlation, hierarchical cluster analysis and generalized linear mixed-effect models on Pollution Load Index to investigate site contamination and metal(loid) associations. At most sites, metal(loid) concentrations were below commonly applied sediment quality guidelines. However, a few sites located near farming activities, river discharges and urbanized areas showed concentrations above these guidelines. This study provides critical baseline values for metal(loid) contaminants in this region and in coral-reef areas in general, and spur decreased discharge of metal(loid) contaminants in the anthropogenised areas of French Polynesia.  aPublisher supplied data 3acluster analysis 3acorals 3amarine pollution 3ametalloids 3apollution load 3aprincipal component analysis 3arivers 3asediments 3asurveys 3aurbanization 3aFrench Polynesia 0aMetals 0aPacific Ocean 0aSouth Pacific Islands 0aMonitoring1 aMetian, Marc1 aBustamante, Paco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3877-93901 aHédouin, Laetitia0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2020 June, v. 155 p.111175-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.1111753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245011200151520143200263592002801695650001501723650001101738650000901749650001801758650002501776650002301801650002901824650001301853650001101866651001001877700001501887700001901902700001301921700001201934700001601946700001701962773012601979856007302105852000902178655001202187IND60652004720221119175243.0190712e20170703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065200472DNAL7 a10.3390/su90711612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wei10aCarbon Reduction Potential of Resource-Dependent Regions Based on Simulated Annealing Programming Algorithm  aIn recent years, developing countries, especially resource-dependent regions, have been facing the paradox of ensuring both emissions reduction and economic development. Thus, there is a strong political desire to forecast carbon emissions reduction potential and the best way to achieve it. This study constructs a methodology to assess carbon reduction potential in a resource-dependent region. The Simulated Annealing Programming algorithm and the Genetic algorithm were introduced to create a prediction model and an optimized regional carbon intensity model, respectively. Shanxi Province in China, a typical resource-dependent area, is selected for the empirical study. Regional statistical data are collected from 1990 to 2015. The results show that the carbon intensity of Shanxi Province could drop 18.78% by 2020. This potential exceeds the 18% expectation of the Chinese Government in its ‘13th Five-Year Work Plan’ for Controlling Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Moreover, the carbon intensity of the province could be further reduced by 0.97 t per 10,000 yuan GDP. The study suggests that the carbon emissions of a resource-dependent region can be reduced in the following ways; promoting economic restructuring, upgrading coal supply-side reform, perfecting the self-regulation of coal prices, accelerating the technical innovation of the coal industry, and establishing a flexible mechanism for reducing emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acarbon 3acoal 3acoal industry 3adeveloping countries 3aempirical research 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3apolitics 3aprices 3aChina1 aLi, Guomin1 aZhang, Rongxia1 aSun, Wen1 aWu, Wen1 aJin, Baihui1 aCui, Pengfei0 tSustainability.g2017 July 03, v. 9, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90711613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245015600164300001600320500001900336520097300355592002801328650001801356650001201374650001101386650002101397650002101418650000901439650001201448650001401460651001501474700001801489700001901507700002601526700001701552700003601569773014401605856008401749852000901833655001201842IND60689290020221117173439.0200421e20030101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068929002DNAL7 a10.1080/096374803100016223142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHels, Ole10aEstimated nutrient intakes and adequacies in Bangladesh change when newer values for vitamin A, iron and calcium in commonly consumed foods are applied  ap. 457-465.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA food consumption survey was conducted in rural Bangladesh in January–March 1996 using a 24-h food weighing method. Intakes and adequacies of energy, vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and calcium were estimated for 81 children (aged 24–71 months) and 182 women (aged 18–45 years) using three sets of food composition tables. The local food composition table was modified with newer values for nutrient contents of foods identified as important for the contribution of vitamin A and iron. Significant differences in estimated dietary intakes and adequacies were found for vitamin A and iron when different sets of food composition values were used. This study shows that up-to-date chemical analyses of foods selected on the basis of a high frequency of consumption and a large contribution of the nutrients in focus is a useful approach in improving the quality of food composition tables, resulting in greater accuracy of estimates of nutrient intakes and adequacies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3acalcium 3aenergy 3afood composition 3afood consumption 3airon 3asurveys 3avitamin A 3aBangladesh1 aKidmose, Ulla1 aLarsen, Torben1 aHassan, N.q(Nazmul),1 aTetens, Inge1 aHaraksingh Thilsted, Shakuntala0 tInternational journal of food sciences and nutrition.g2003 Jan. 1, v. 54, no. 6 p.457-465dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2066x1465-34787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096374803100016223143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005300146245015800199300002000357520160500377592002801982596009802010596010602108596010602214650002102320650001402341650001702355650003402372650002502406650001702431650001302448650000902461650001702470650001902487650002402506650001902530650003102549700005502580700001302635700001402648700001402662700001802676773017302694856008102867852000902948655001202957IND60792552720221120220231.0220907e20220824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079255272DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.2c018322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6788-073010aToward Balanced Piezoelectric and Mechanical Performance: 3D Printed Polyvinylidene Fluoride/Carbon Nanotube Energy Harvester with Hierarchical Structure  ap. 13063-13071.  aWith rapid consumption of fossil energy and its impact on the environment, the desire for clean energy is gradually increasing around the world, and piezoelectric polymers have received extensive attention owing to their capability to harvest discrete mechanical energy in the environment. However, the existing piezoelectric devices are mostly low-dimensional fibers or films, making it difficult to achieve a good balance between mechanical robustness and piezoelectric output. Herein, a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) scaffold with a hierarchical porous structure and geometry was fabricated by chemical-foaming-assisted fused deposition modeling (FDM). Chemical foaming was triggered by the heat accompanied during FDM molding, where a microporous structure was formed inside the part without affecting the geometric design to realize strain accumulation in normal space. Moreover, the conductive MWCNT formed discontinuous and parallel morphology around the pores, which not only promotes the polling process and formation of electrets, but also avoids the electrical breakdown caused by the formation of the conductive network. Accordingly, the combined effect of hierarchical structure and incorporation of MWCNT leads to a balanced piezoelectric (open circuit voltage of 8.46 V and short circuit current of 157 nA) and mechanical performance (compressive modulus of 14.07 MPa). These excellent properties all demonstrate the potential capabilities of the developed piezoelectric nanogenerators in the field of self-powered nanosensors and portable devices.  aPublisher supplied data  a51933007cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2019CL10cKey Laboratory of Material Corrosion and Protection of Sichuan Provincedhttps://doi.org/NA  a2021CL19cKey Laboratory of Material Corrosion and Protection of Sichuan Provincedhttps://doi.org/NA 3acarbon nanotubes 3achemistry 3aclean energy 3aelectric potential difference 3aenvironmental impact 3afossil fuels 3ageometry 3aheat 3aporous media 3aprocess design 3asensors (equipment) 3athermoplastics 3athree-dimensional printing1 aZheng, Lang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2865-712X1 aSong, Li1 aHan, Ying1 aYang, Yan1 aTan, Changbin0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 Aug. 24, v. 61, no. 35 p.13063-13071dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c018323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245007400206300001800280506007600298520125300374592002801627506003701655650002101692650002201713650003301735650002601768650001301794650001501807650001901822650001101841650002801852653002201880653002001902653002401922653002301946700002901969700002001998700002202018700001802040773017402058856007902232852000902311655001202320IND60178623320221207112028.0150604e20140610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017862332DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14045961112doi7 aPMC40607202pmcid7 a249121822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Mingyong10aScalable production of mechanically tunable block polymers from sugar  ap. 8357-8362.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDevelopment of sustainable and biodegradable materials is essential for future growth of the chemical industry. For a renewable product to be commercially competitive, it must be economically viable on an industrial scale and possess properties akin or superior to existing petroleum-derived analogs. Few biobased polymers have met this formidable challenge. To address this challenge, we describe an efficient biobased route to the branched lactone, β-methyl-δ-valerolactone (βMδVL), which can be transformed into a rubbery (i.e., low glass transition temperature) polymer. We further demonstrate that block copolymerization of βMδVL and lactide leads to a new class of high-performance polyesters with tunable mechanical properties. Key features of this work include the creation of a total biosynthetic route to produce βMδVL, an efficient semisynthetic approach that employs high-yielding chemical reactions to transform mevalonate to βMδVL, and the use of controlled polymerization techniques to produce well-defined PLA–PβMδVL–PLA triblock polymers, where PLA stands for poly(lactide). This comprehensive strategy offers an economically viable approach to sustainable plastics and elastomers for a broad range of applications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiodegradability 3achemical industry 3aglass transition temperature 3amechanical properties 3aplastics 3apolyesters 3apolymerization 3asugars 3asustainable development 0arubbery polyester 0ablock copolymer 0abiobased production 0amevalonate pathway1 aSchneiderman, Deborah K.1 aBates, Frank S.1 aHillmyer, Marc A.1 aZhang, Kechun0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 June 10, v. 111, no. 23 p.8357-8362dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14045961113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013500159300002000294500001900314520111100333592002801444650002301472650001801495650001301513650001801526650001301544650001401557650002301571650001701594650001401611700001901625700001901644700002001663700001601683700001801699773012501717856007401842852000901916655001201925IND60707679620221123041724.0200820e20200814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070767962DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra01540g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Nitika10aModified graphene supported Ag–Cu NPs with enhanced bimetallic synergistic effect in oxidation and Chan–Lam coupling reactions  ap. 30048-30061.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHerein, well dispersed Ag–Cu NPs supported on modified graphene have been synthesized via a facile and rapid approach using sodium borohydride as a reducing agent under ambient conditions. Dicyandiamide is selected as an effective nitrogen source with TiO₂ as an inorganic material to form two kinds of supports, labelled as TiO₂–NGO and NTiO₂–GO. Initially, the surface area analysis of these two support materials was carried out which indicated that N-doping of GO followed by anchoring with TiO₂ has produced support material of larger surface area. Using both types of supports, ten nano-metal catalysts based on Ag and Cu were synthesized. Benefiting from the bimetallic synergistic effect and larger specific surface area of TiO₂–NGO, Cu@Ag–TiO₂–NGO is found to be a highly active and reusable catalyst out of other synthesized catalysts. It exhibits excellent catalytic activity for oxidation of alcohols and hydrocarbons as well as Chan–Lam coupling reactions. The nanocatalyst is intensively characterized by BET, SEM, HR-TEM, ICP-AES, EDX, CHN, FT-IR, TGA, XRD and XPS.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3adicyandiamide 3agraphene 3ananocatalysts 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3asodium borohydride 3asurface area 3asynergism1 aChoudhary, Anu1 aManpreet Kaur,1 aSharma, Chandan1 aPaul, Satya1 aGupta, Monika0 tRSC advances.g2020 Aug. 14, v. 10, no. 50 p.30048-30061dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra01540g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03568naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245019600171300001600367520179700383592002802180650002402208650001502232650001702247650001902264650001502283650001302298650001802311650001602329650001602345650003102361650001002392650001602402650001402418650002602432650002102458650002602479650004302505650001302548650002002561650002102581653001302602653001702615653003402632653001502666653002902681700001602710700001602726700002002742700001602762700001702778773010102795856008502896852000902981655001202990IND60553296920221121041157.0161021e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055329692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2014.03.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassan, Aishlin10aSelenium promotes adipogenic determination and differentiation of chicken embryonic fibroblasts with regulation of genes involved in fatty acid uptake, triacylglycerol synthesis and lipolysis  ap. 858-867.  aSelenium (Se) has been utilized in the differentiation of primary pig and rat preadipocytes, indicating that it may have proadipogenic potential; however, some studies have also demonstrated that Se has antiadipogenic activity. In this study, chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEFs) were used to investigate the role of Se in adipogenesis in vitro and in ovo. Se supplementation increased lipid droplet accumulation and inhibited proliferation of cultured CEFs isolated from 6-day-old embryos dose-dependently. This suggests that Se may play a role in cell cycle inhibition, thereby promoting the differentiation of fibroblasts to adipocytes. Se did not stimulate adipogenic differentiation of CEFs isolated from 9- to 12-day-old embryos, implying a permissive stage of adipogenic determination by Se at earlier embryonic ages. Microarray analysis comparing control and Se treatments on CEFs from 6-day-old embryos and confirmatory analysis by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that genes involved in adipocyte determination and differentiation, fatty acid uptake and triacylglycerol synthesis were up-regulated. In addition, up-regulation of an anti-lipolytic G0/G1 switch gene 2 and down-regulation of a prolipolytic monoglyceride lipase may lead to inhibition of lipolysis by Se. Both osteogenic and myogenic genes were down-regulated, and several genes related to oxidative stress response during adipogenesis were up-regulated. In ovo injection of Se at embryonic day 8 increased adipose tissue mass by 30% and caused adipocyte hypertrophy in 17-day-old chicken embryos, further supporting the proadipogenic role of Se during the embryonic development of chickens. These results suggest that Se plays a significant role in several mechanisms related to adipogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacylglycerol lipase 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3aadipose tissue 3acell cycle 3achickens 3aembryogenesis 3afatty acids 3afibroblasts 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahypertrophy 3alipolysis 3amicroarray technology 3aoxidative stress 3aquantitative analysis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aselenium 3astress response 3atriacylglycerols 0aSelenium 0aAdipogenesis 0aChicken embryonic fibroblasts 0aMicroarray 0aEmbryonic adipose tissue1 aAhn, Jinsoo1 aSuh, Yeunsu1 aChoi, Young Min1 aChen, Paula1 aLee, Kichoon0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2014 Aug., v. 25 p.858-867dElsevier Inc.x0955-28637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2014.03.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245014300159520145900302592002801761650002701789650002201816650001101838650002001849650002001869650001701889650002301906650001401929650001201943650001001955650001501965650001101980650002501991650001902016650002302035650001902058650001702077650001202094650001602106650001802122700002502140773012602165856007302291852000902364655001202373IND60652004820221119175143.0190712e20170704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065200482DNAL7 a10.3390/su90711682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPölling, Bernd14aThe Location Matters: Determinants for “Deepening” and “Broadening” Diversification Strategies in Ruhr Metropolis’ Urban Farming  aConsumer-oriented diversification activities, such as direct sale (“deepening”) as well as tourism services and care farming (“broadening”), are common business strategies of farms within urban areas. This empirical study investigates determinants of urban farming’s diversification decisions by analyzing a dataset of 123 farmers in German Ruhr Metropolis. Binary logit models are used here as econometric method to determine characteristics influencing the decision to diversify. Farm characteristics, which encourage the implementation of “deepening” strategies, are: larger farm sizes, high-value production, organic farming, and livestock production. By contrast, the consumer-oriented “broadening” strategies tourism services and care farming prevail on smaller farms and on farms with horses and higher grassland shares. Agricultural extension services increase the odds to diversify. The results of the conducted binary logistic regressions show increasing odds and predicted probabilities for “deepening” and “broadening” activities when approaching the city. Farms’ location advantages close to cities can be used best when applying consumer-oriented “deepening” or “broadening” strategies; namely, direct sale or other short supply chains, tourism services, and care farming. Viable business strategies of urban farming support a forward-looking integration into urban economy, society, and decision-making.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural extension 3abusiness planning 3acities 3adata collection 3adecision making 3aeconometrics 3aempirical research 3afarm size 3afarmers 3afarms 3agrasslands 3ahorses 3alivestock production 3alogit analysis 3aorganic production 3asocial farming 3asupply chain 3atourism 3aurban areas 3aurban farming1 aMergenthaler, Marcus0 tSustainability.g2017 July 04, v. 9, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90711683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245016000182300001600342520157200358592002801930650002701958650002501985650002702010650001102037650001102048650002002059650001002079650001302089650001602102650001502118650001002133650001002143650002002153650000902173650001102182650001102193650002202204651002002226653001402246653001402260653001202274700001502286773013902301856008102440852000902521655001202530IND60650459520221122204100.0190710e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065045952DNAL7 a278294832pmid7 a10.1017/S00074853160008212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, G.H.10aLong-term changes in the numbers of Helicoverpa punctigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in a cotton production landscape in northern New South Wales, Australia  ap. 174-187.  aTwo noctuid moths, Helicoverpa punctigera and Helicoverpa armigera, are pests of several agricultural crops in Australia, most notably cotton. Cotton is a summer crop, grown predominantly in eastern Australia. The use of transgenic (Bt) cotton has reduced the damage caused by Helicoverpa spp., but the development of Bt resistance in these insects remains a threat. In the past, large populations of H. punctigera have built up in inland Australia, following autumn-winter rains. Moths have then migrated to the cropping regions in spring, when their inland host plants dried off. To determine if there have been any long-term changes in this pattern, pheromone traps were set for H. punctigera throughout a cropping landscape in northern New South Wales from 1992 to 2015. At least three generations of moths were caught from spring to autumn. The 1st generation (mostly spring migrants) was the most numerous. Trap captures varied between sites and decreased in time, especially for moths in the 1st generation. Nearby habitat type influenced the size of catch and there was some evidence that local weather also influenced the numbers of moths caught. There was no correlation between trap catches in the cropping region and rainfall in the inland. In addition, there was little evidence that Bt cotton has reduced the abundance of H. punctigera at landscape scale. The apparent decline in the number of presumably Bt susceptible moths arriving each spring in the cropping regions from inland habitats is of concern in relation to the management of Bt resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aHelicoverpa punctigera 3aautumn 3acotton 3acrop production 3acrops 3ahabitats 3ahost plants 3alandscapes 3amoths 3apests 3apheromone traps 3arain 3aspring 3asummer 3atransgenic plants 3aNew South Wales 0aabundance 0aBt cotton 0aweather1 aTann, C.R.0 tBulletin of entomological research.g2017 Apr., v. 107, no. 2 p.174-187dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46143x1475-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00074853160008213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013400169300001600303520158000319592002801899650001801927650002001945650001101965650001201976650001901988650001602007650001302023650001002036650001502046650001802061650001102079650001102090650001202101650001102113700002302124700002002147700002202167700002202189773008502211856008102296852000902377655001202386IND60123806120221122030613.0150404e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012380612DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-014-9837-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnneville, Orlane10aBlue-Green Algae in a “Greenhouse Century”? New Insights from Field Data on Climate Change Impacts on Cyanobacteria Abundance  ap. 441-458.  aClimate warming is likely to impact phytoplankton communities by providing a habitat in which cyanobacteria have competitive advantage over other phytoplankton taxa. We used extreme hot weather periods to investigate the potential impact of climate change on cyanobacteria abundance in three large and deep peri-alpine lakes, Lakes Geneva, Annecy, and Bourget. Between 2000 and 2011, there were four extreme warm weather periods: spring and summer 2003, autumn 2006 and winter 2007. We found that the consequences of extreme air temperatures on cyanobacteria abundance and phytoplankton composition depend on the time of year in which the extreme temperatures occur. In all three lakes studied, a warm summer did not clearly promote cyanobacteria blooms, whereas a warm autumn promoted cyanobacteria growth in the mesotrophic Lakes Geneva and Bourget, but not in the oligotrophic Lake Annecy. A warm winter was associated with high cyanobacteria abundance and a high contribution of cyanobacteria to total phytoplankton biomass. Our results reinforce the idea that lakes have an ecological memory by showing that a warm winter can influence subsequent seasonal succession in the cyanobacteria community. In both mesotrophic lakes studied, cyanobacteria abundance was strongly influenced by phosphorus concentrations and winter air temperatures. We conclude that although extreme hot weather periods can be used to analyze various aspects of the impacts of climate change, they are of limited value in forecasting the structure of phytoplankton communities in a warmer future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aair temperature 3aautumn 3abiomass 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouses 3ahabitats 3alakes 3aphosphorus 3aphytoplankton 3aspring 3asummer 3aweather 3awinter1 aDomaizon, Isabelle1 aKerimoglu, Onur1 aRimet, Frédéric1 aJacquet, Stephan,0 tEcosystems.g2015 Apr., v. 18, no. 3 p.441-458dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-014-9837-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011500155520133900270592002801609650001701637650002201654650002501676650001901701650002901720651001401749700001701763700002001780773012601800856007301926852000901999655001202008IND60652004920221119175139.0190712e20170704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065200492DNAL7 a10.3390/su90711672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNg, Ai Sian10aToward a Theoretical Framework for Studying Climate Change Policies: Insights from the Case Study of Singapore  aThe world decided in December 2015 to take actions to reduce global warming. To contribute toward this goal, this research examines possible policy levers for inclusion in the climate change ratification plan. A case study of the measures taken by the Republic of Singapore, a low-lying 719.2 km2 island without natural resources in Asia, is conducted. Being vulnerable to climate change impact and yet having to balance her people’s needs and economic progress with limited resources, the measures taken by this small country could offer policy insights for small states and states without access to alternative energy sources. This research analyzes the online policy documents posted by eleven organizations to answer the main research question of identifying policy levers as theoretical constructs to form a framework that can be used to study climate change policies. A qualitative data analysis software, QSR NVivo 10, is used to classify the proposed nodes developed by the researchers using a system perspective integrating the insights from the key international climate change frameworks with the theoretical concepts from the model of pro-environmental behavior. The findings can offer insights toward developing a new contextual influence framework, which can help strengthen policy development and outcome measurement.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3aenvironmental policy 3aglobal warming 3arenewable energy sources 3aSingapore1 aLwin, May O.1 aPang, Augustine0 tSustainability.g2017 July 04, v. 9, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90711673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001200166245013400178300001600312520107700328592002801405650001501433650002101448650001401469650001501483650001101498650002501509650001801534650001201552650001001564650004101574650001501615650001801630650001501648650001601663650001301679650001001692650001001702653001901712653002101731700001201752700001301764700001401777700001301791700001101804700001201815700001201827700001401839700001101853773013901864856008102003852000902084655001202093IND60650459620221122204046.0190710e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065045962DNAL7 a276284972pmid7 a10.1017/S00074853160008332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, G.10aChemical investigations of volatile kairomones produced by Hyphantria cunea (Drury), a host of the parasitoid Chouioia cunea Yang  ap. 234-240.  aIn tritrophic ‘plants–herbivores–natural enemies’ systems, there are relatively few reports concerning the role(s) of kairomones in pupal parasitism. Chouioia cunea Yang (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), an endoparasitic chalcid wasp, parasitizes pupae of the fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea Drury). The role of host-related kairomones was investigated using electroantennogram (EAG) and behavioral techniques. Chemicals from some host stages (pupae) and host by-products (frass), induced arrestment behavior of female parasitoids, while chemicals from prepupae, were inactive. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis of volatiles collected from pupae, frass and prepupae using solid-phase microextration revealed seven compounds with carbon chain lengths ranging from C₄ to C₂₀. All of the chemicals elicited significant EAG responses in C. cunea. Y-tube olfactometer bioassays demonstrated a significant positive response of mated female C. cunea to 1-dodecene. These data provide a better understanding of the host location mechanisms of pupal parasitoid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEulophidae 3aHyphantria cunea 3abioassays 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3aelectroantennography 3aendoparasites 3afemales 3afrass 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3akairomones 3aolfactometers 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aprepupae 3apupae 3awasps 0aChouioia cunea 0apupae parasitoid1 aPan, L.1 aZhao, Y.1 aZhang, X.1 aWang, F.1 aYu, Y.1 aFan, W.1 aLiu, Q.1 aZhang, S.1 aLi, M.0 tBulletin of entomological research.g2017 Apr., v. 107, no. 2 p.234-240dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46143x1475-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00074853160008333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006800150245014300218500001900361520103900380592002801419650001501447650001801462650001501480650001901495650001701514650001501531650001401546650002301560650001501583653001701598653002901615653001901644653002101663653004601684700003401730700003201764700003301796700003101829773011801860856008501978852000902063655001202072IND60730687920221116144342.0210408e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073068792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.1120452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCuellar-Martinez, Tomasa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2515-124910aInfluence of agricultural system transition on trace element contamination in salt marsh and seagrass sediments from a coastal Ramsar site  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVegetated coastal ecosystems have an important role as contaminant filters. Temporal variations in concentrations, enrichment factors (EF), and fluxes of trace elements (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn) were evaluated in ²¹⁰Pb-dated sediment cores from salt marsh and seagrass ecosystems at San Quintín Bay (Mexican northern Pacific). Trace element contamination was negligible in seagrass sediments, but minor to severe, depending on the element, in salt marsh cores, owing to higher organic carbon and fine sediment contents. EF temporal variation in salt marsh cores was attributed to agriculture technology changes (e.g. installation of greenhouses, and improved irrigation and fertilization systems). Trace element flux ratios increased during the past 100 years, likely caused by steadily increasing sediment accumulation rates promoted by land-use changes in the catchment. The conservation of salt marsh areas is important to preserve their function as contaminants biofilters and the health of adjacent ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilters 3aecotoxicology 3airrigation 3aorganic carbon 3asalt marshes 3aseagrasses 3asediments 3atemporal variation 3awatersheds 0a210Pb-dating 0aTrace element enrichment 0aZostera marina 0aSpartina foliosa 0aCalifornia Current Large Marine Ecosystem1 aRuiz-Fernández, Ana Carolina1 aSanchez-Cabeza, Joan-Albert1 aPérez-Bernal, Libia Hascibe1 aSandoval-Gil, José Miguel0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2021 May, v. 214 p.112045-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:1984x0147-65137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.1120453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01892naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245008700162300001800249520090100267592002801168650000801196650001601204650000901220650001401229650002001243650002101263650001901284650001401303700002501317700002401342773010401366856007501470852000901545655001201554IND60531286220221118050853.0160723e20130924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053128622DNAL7 a10.1021/bi400549s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDa Costa, Jason
B.10aThermodynamics and Kinetics of Adaptive Binding in the Malachite Green RNA Aptamer  ap. 6575-6583.  aAdaptive binding, the ability of molecules to fold themselves around the structure of a ligand and thereby incorporating it into their three-dimensional fold, is a key feature of most RNA aptamers. The malachite green aptamer (MGA) has been shown to bind several closely related triphenyl dyes with planar and nonplanar structures in this manner. Competitive binding studies using isothermal titration calorimetry and stopped flow kinetics have been conducted with the aim of understanding the adaptive nature of RNA–ligand interaction. The results of these studies reveal that binding of one ligand can reduce the ability of the aptamer pocket to adapt to another ligand, even if this second ligand has a significantly higher affinity to the free aptamer. A similar effect is observed in the presence of Mg²⁺ ions which stabilize the binding pocket in a more ligand bound-like conformation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3acalorimetry 3aions 3amagnesium 3amalachite green 3aoligonucleotides 3athermodynamics 3atitration1 aAndreiev, Aurelia I.1 aDieckmann, Thorsten0 tBiochemistry.g2013 Sept. 24, v. 52, no. 38 p.6575-6583dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi400549s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245011100164300001600275520166600291592002801957650002401985650001102009650001102020650002002031650001402051650002202065650001302087650001202100650003102112650001402143650001102157650002002168650003602188650001402224650002402238650003702262653003702299653001202336653002502348700002002373700001702393700002702410700001802437773011702455856007702572852000902649655001202658IND60568246120221120121647.0170721e20170801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056824612DNAL7 a10.1089/chi.2016.02752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoran-Lev, Hadar10aInverse Correlation between Helicobacter pylori Colonization and Pediatric Overweight: A Preliminary Study  ap. 267-271.  aBackground: Helicobacter pylori, one of the most common bacterial pathogens in humans, is generally acquired during childhood. The inverse correlation between H. pylori colonization and obesity that was found in adults has not been investigated in depth in children. Our aim was to assess the correlation between overweight and obesity and H. pylori colonization in a pediatric population.Methods: H. pylori colonization in 70 symptomatic children was determined after antral biopsies during esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Data on anthropometric measurements, sociodemographic characteristics, and medical history were recorded.Results: The participants' mean age was 12.41 ± 3.16 years, 58% were females, and 24% were obese or overweight (BMI >85th percentile). The H. pylori colonization rate was 31%. There were no significant differences between the H. pylori-infected and H. pylori-noninfected groups in terms of age, gender, or clinical and sociodemographic characteristics. Nevertheless, the prevalence of overweight and obesity was significantly lower in children with H. pylori colonization compared to children with normal histology (31% in the noninfected group compared to 11% in the infected group, p = 0.04). The mean fat percentage was 24.3 ± 8.8 and 19.4 ± 6.9, respectively (p = 0.02).Conclusions: The findings of this prospective study are in agreement with previous studies and demonstrate an inverse relationship between H. pylori colonization and overweight or obesity among symptomatic children. A larger prospective, multiethnic investigation is warranted to more definitively determine the extent of this association.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aadults 3abiopsy 3abody mass index 3achildhood 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3afemales 3agastrointestinal endoscopy 3ahistology 3ahumans 3amedical history 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3apathogens 3aprospective studies 3asociodemographic characteristics 0aHelicobacter pylori colonization 0aobesity 0apediatric population1 aLubetzky, Ronit1 aMandel, Dror1 aYerushalmy-Feler, Anat1 aCohen, Shlomi0 tChildhood obesity.g2017 Aug. 01, v. 13, no. 4 p.267-271dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:23081x2153-21767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/chi.2016.02753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03093naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100001800136245010800154300001400262520181600276592002802092650001902120650001002139650001102149650001002160650001202170650001302182650000902195650001402204650001802218650001902236650001702255650000902272650001102281650002102292650002002313650003202333650001202365650001002377651001402387700002402401700001902425773010002444856007002544852000902614655001202623IND60693942020221122171610.0200509e20000301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069394202DNAL7 a10.1071/MU98532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalmer, Carol10aMound Characteristics and Behaviour of the Orange-footed Scrubfowl in the Seasonal Tropics of Australia  ap. 54-63.  aSeventeen site characteristics associated with the location of incubation mounds of the Orange-footed Scrubfowl Megapodius reinwardt were measured for three habitat types: monsoon forest, regeneration forest and a sandy coastal vine thicket adjacent to an intertidal zone. The three habitats differed with respect to shrub cover, litter cover, canopy cover and several tree measurements. Mound sites differed from random sites with respect to several variables, and these differences can be attributed to the litter-collecting activities of the birds, which disrupt the vegetation on and near the mounds. Internal mound temperatures were recorded over a 12 month period in 10 active mounds, two disused mounds and at two control sites. Active mound temperatures in all three habitats were similar despite significant mound site differences, particularly with respect to canopy cover and incident solar radiation. Whereas the decomposition of litter was the primary source of heat for the mounds in the monsoon and regeneration forests, both solar radiation and microbial decomposition contributed to the heat of the mounds in the sandy coastal vine thicket. Soil temperatures in disused mounds and at control sites decreased with the onset of monsoonal rains, but active mound temperatures remained stable during this period. Behavioural observations were recorded over a 19-week period for a pair of Orange-footed Scrubfowl at an active mound. The collection and incorporation of leaf litter into the mound increased significantly as monsoonal rains intensified. The birds were most active during the early morning period. Hatchlings and juvenile birds were observed in the study area throughout the eight months of field work and one colour banded bird was observed defending two mounds on several occassions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3abirds 3acanopy 3acolor 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aheat 3ajuveniles 3alittoral zone 3amonsoon season 3aplant litter 3arain 3ashrubs 3asoil temperature 3asolar radiation 3atree and stand measurements 3atropics 3avines 3aAustralia1 aChristian, Keith A.1 aFisher, Alaric0 tEmu.g2000 Mar. 1, v. 100, no. 1 p.54-63dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3957316x1448-55407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MU98533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02398naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012100156520125800277592002801535650001701563650001601580650003501596650001501631650001301646650002301659650001101682650001501693650001501708650001101723651002801734651001201762700002201774700002001796773012601816856007301942852000902015655001202024IND60652005020221119174955.0190712e20170704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065200502DNAL7 a10.3390/su90711692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrau, Leonie10aOn the Annual Cycle of Meteorological and Geographical Potential of Wind Energy: A Case Study from Southwest Germany  aWind energy in Germany has experienced high growth rates over the last few years. The set political target in the German federal state of Baden-Wuerttemberg is to raise the share of wind energy in the overall electricity supply to 10% by 2020. To achieve this goal, detailed information on wind energy potential in Baden-Wuerttemberg is necessary. This study assesses the geographical wind energy potential (GP) in Baden-Wuerttemberg giving a guideline to identify suitable locations for wind energy utilization. The focus of this investigation lies in assessing GP for the mean annual meteorological wind energy potential (MP) as well as for the mean MP in December and August providing information on the seasonal behavior of wind power availability. A GIS-based approach is employed to identify sites without geographical restrictions and with sufficient MP at hub heights of 100 m, 140 m, and 200 m. The study finds that (1) the number of possible sites for wind energy utilization is strongly limited by geographical restrictions, (2) GP is highly dependent on MP and, therefore, (3) GP varies highly throughout a year since MP depends on the seasonal pattern of wind speed in Central Europe, showing high values in winter and low values in summer.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aelectricity 3ageographic information systems 3aguidelines 3apolitics 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3awind power 3awind speed 3awinter 3aCentral European region 3aGermany1 aJung, Christopher1 aSchindler, Dirk0 tSustainability.g2017 July 04, v. 9, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90711693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01766naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002600136245007600162300001600238520067900254592002800933650001800961650001000979650000900989650001900998650002701017650001001044650001501054650001101069650001401080650001101094650001301105650001701118650001601135651001401151700002201165773010201187856007001289852000901359655001201368IND60693942120221122171556.0200509e20001101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069394212DNAL7 a10.1071/MU98542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpennemann, Dirk H.R.14aThe Avian Dispersal of Olives Olea europaea: Implications for Australia  ap. 264-273.  aAround the Mediterranean olives are an important food source for birds, and are now emerging as a significant component of the diet of some Australian frugivores. Attempts over the past 200 years to establish an olive oil industry in Australia have led to many neglected olive groves which have become havens for frugivorous birds. Worldwide, olives have proved to be a successful invader of disturbed lands, with birds as the principal seed vectors. A proliferation of new olive orchards in the 1990s and the effect of naturalisation on the size of olive drupes has the potential, with help from the avian fauna, to accelerate the dispersal of this woody weed in Australia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOlea europaea 3abirds 3adiet 3adisturbed land 3afats and oils industry 3afauna 3afrugivores 3agroves 3aolive oil 3aolives 3aorchards 3astone fruits 3awoody weeds 3aAustralia1 aAllen, L.

The pyranoside ring of the zinc complexes adopted axial-rich skew boat conformations. The reactivities of the two glycosyl donors were investigated by performing a series of glycosylations in the presence or absence of Zn²⁺ ions. These glycosylations suggested a decrease in reactivity when binding Zn²⁺. The conformational effect of binding Zn²⁺ was therefore studied using a third glycosyl donor, unable to undergo conformational changes when binding Zn²⁺. From competition experiments, it was observed that the binding-induced conformational change increased the reactivity slightly compared to the glycosyl donor unable to undergo a conformational change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglycosylation 3aions 3amoieties 3aorganic compounds 3azinc1 aPedersen, Christian Marcus1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4661-48950 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2019 Oct. 04, v. 84, no. 21 p.13242-13251dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.9b008303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03802naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006400155245011300219300001400332520222900346592002802575650000802603650001202611650002002623650002002643650002102663650001902684650002002703650002202723650001102745650002702756650001402783650001202797650001302809650001302822650002402835650001302859650003502872650001302907653001902920653002402939653003502963653002402998700002203022700005603044773009703100856009003197852000903287655001203296IND60614370220221118032207.0190318e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061437022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPremachandra, H.K.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6469-208310aEffectiveness of SNPs for parentage and sibship assessment in polygamous yellowtail kingfish Seriola lalandi  ap. 24-31.  aSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been used for quantitative traits and evolutionary studies, but only recently have they been applied to identify family relationships and construct pedigrees. Pedigree assignments can be challenging for mass spawning, polygamous marine species due to the large number of half-sib families arising from mass spawning, and small size of larvae, so genetic markers are required in order to achieve a highly accurate pedigree assignment. In the present study, sibship and parentage in yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) were obtained from SNPs and the results were compared with those obtained from DNA microsatellite data. The accuracies of pedigrees formed using COLONY and a more recently developed program, Sequoia, the latter designed to optimize speed of processing large data sets, were compared. We also considered the impact of choosing SNPs with varying minor allele frequencies (MAF from 0.05 to 0.50), varying the actual numbers of SNPs used in a given analysis (from 50 to 1000+) and varying assigned SNP genotyping error rates (0% to 10%). Accuracy of assignment, relative to DNA microsatellites, tended to increase with increasing MAF, and increased, up to a point, with increasing SNP number, but did not change with assigned genotyping error rates up to 10%. Both COLONY and Sequoia analyses, with moderate number of SNPs (500 SNPs) and MAF values (0.20–0.30), were able to predict full-sib pairs of which >95% were also predicted by DNA microsatellites, i.e. the concordance between SNP and microsatellite pedigrees was high; processing speeds were faster with Sequoia albeit with some minor reductions in accuracy. When parental data were included in the analyses, 98% of the individuals assigned to parents using SNPs were also assigned to the same parents using DNA microsatellites. Overall, the present study provides guidance as to the parameters (minor allele frequencies, number of SNPs, SNP genotyping error rates) that optimize accuracy, and once optimized, SNPs can be used efficiently for sibship and parentage assignments for polygamous species such as yellowtail kingfish in comparison to pedigrees obtained from traditional microsatellite markers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aSequoia 3aSeriola lalandi 3adata collection 3afamily relations 3agene frequency 3agenetic markers 3agenotyping errors 3alarvae 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparentage 3aparents 3apedigree 3apolygamy 3aquantitative traits 3asiblings 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aspawning 0aMicrosatellite 0aPedigree assignment 0aSingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aYellowtail kingfish1 aNguyen, Nguyen H.1 aKnibb, Wayne1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2593-03030 tAquaculture.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 499 p.24-31dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.09.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245013800178500001900316520169500335592002802030650001802058650003502076650002002111650001202131650001102143650001502154650000902169650002102178650001902199650001102218650001102229650001402240650001302254650001602267650000902283651001102292653001302303653002502316653001502341653001802356653002102374700003902395700002502434700003102459700002502490700003402515773010602549856008802655852000902743655001202752IND60693585520221118091901.0200607e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069358552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.1112152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrito, Geysa Barreto10aEvaluation of the bioavailability of potentially toxic metals in surface sediments collected from a tropical river near an urban area  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the bioavailability of the metals cadmium, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc from sediment samples collected in the Paraguaçu river between the cities of Cachoeira and São Félix in the state of Bahia in Brazil. The method used was the acid extraction of volatile sulfides and metals extracted simultaneously (AVS-SEM) as described in the literature. For the extraction of sulfide, an argon drag system was used after acidification of the samples with HCl, releasing the volatile sulfides collected in the basic solution. Its determination was made by molecular absorption spectrophotometry using the methylene blue method. For quantification of the metals, the sediment with acid was filtered and the residual solution was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP MS) in which the elements that were associated with the sulfide were released in solution. The bioavailability evaluation was done by the relation between the sum of the concentrations of the metals in solution (SEM) and the concentration of sulfide in each sample (AVS). When the ∑SEM/AVS ratio is >1, the medium is considered contaminated by the high bioavailability of the metals to other environmental compartments. In the samples collected in the Paraguaçu river in two campaigns, with an ∑SEM/AVS ratio of 0.007 to 1.082, the last value being the only critical>1, while the other quantities in the metallic phase were not available for a biota. By comparing the metal concentration data with the internationally established tolerance limits, all the values found were below the critical values, presenting no toxic risks to the surrounding ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3acopper 3aecosystems 3alead 3amarine pollution 3amethylene blue 3anickel 3arivers 3asediments 3atoxicity 3aurban areas 3azinc 3aBrazil 0aSediment 0aInorganics compounds 0aUrban area 0aContamination 0aParaguaçu River1 ada Silva Júnior, Jucelino Balbino1 aDias, Luise Carvalho1 ade Santana Santos, Adilson1 aHadlich, Gisele Mara1 aFerreira, Sérgio Luís Costa0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2020 July, v. 156 p.111215-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.1112153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02074naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009000170520094900260592002801209653001301237653002501250653001501275653002801290700002101318700002801339700002101367700002101388700001901409700002401428700002101452700002101473700002001494773010401514856008501618852000901703655001201712IND60656922820221119144622.0191121e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065692282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2019.1086362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConsonni, Dario10aGender differences in pleural mesothelioma occurrence in Lombardy and Piedmont, Italy  aHigher mesothelioma rates in men (vs women) reflect more frequent and more intense asbestos exposure.

Built on waste recycling, ecological industry chain is an important way to realize the sustainable development of economy and society. This paper establishes a three stage evolutionary game model of ecological industry chain. By mathematically analyzing the equilibrium points of replicator dynamics equations, we get the evolutionary stable strategies.

The RO membranes, which are defective in a dry state, were caulked with different polymeric materials to seal the defects; then, the permeation and separation properties were characterized using pure and mixed gases. A benchmark (Nafion®−117) membrane was selected for its superior selectivity towards helium over carbon dioxide, and the performances of the caulked RO membranes were compared. The experimental results show that the ideal selectivity of He/CO2 in the pure gas tests is in the range 20–55, while the permeance of helium is in the range 8–40 GPU depending on the caulking material. A quaternary mixture of CH4, N2, CO2, and He was used to evaluate the separation performance of the novel membrane, which was compared with that of the benchmark membrane. This study confirms that the proposed novel approach for membrane fabrication is technically practical to recover and enrich helium from CO2-containing natural gas streams.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3agases 3ahelium 3amethane 3anatural gas 3apolyamides 3areverse osmosis 3athin film composite membranes 0aHelium enrichment 0aHe/CO2 separation 0aThin-film composite membranes 0aMultilayer composite membranes1 aQahtani, Mohammad S.1 aQasem, Eyad A.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2018 May 01, v. 553 p.180-188dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2018.02.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245009500170500001900265520147900284592002801763650002101791650001201812650001501824650001601839650001101855650001901866650001601885650001501901650001701916650001501933650001701948650001701965650001601982650001701998650001602015653002402031653001602055700006002071700002402131773014102155856008402296852000902380655001202389IND60730688220221116144330.0210708e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073068822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cimid.2021.1016422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohammadi, Saman10aEvaluation of some acute phase proteins in cattle naturally infected with Babesia bigemina  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBovine babesiosis due to Babesia bigemina infection induces systemic inflammation, evidenced by increased sialic acid (SA) levels and declined cholinesterase activity. The current study was undertaken to assess further indicators of the systemic inflammation in the naturally infected cattle. To this end, serum levels of some selected acute phase-proteins (APPs) including serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin (Hp), ceruloplasmin (Cp), and fibrinogen were measured. Additionally, sensitivity and specificity of the APPs were calculated by receiver operating characteristic curve. The correlation among APPs, SA and cholinesterase activity were also assessed. Our previous blood specimens were used to measure APPs. Briefly, the diseased animals were divided into two groups according to the parasitemia: 12 mildly (20 % <) and 8 severely (20 %>) infected animals. Moreover, 10 healthy animals as the control were included. The levels of all APPs were measured to be significantly elevated in a parasitemia burden-dependent fashion as compared to the control. Furthermore, all the APPs showed 100 % specificity, but only SAA and Cp had 100 % sensitivity. A strong and positive correlation was calculated between the APPs and SA; however, cholinesterase activity was inversely correlated with AAPs and SA. In conclusion, inﬂammatory reactions play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of bovine babesiosis and APPs can be considered as the potential indicators of inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBabesia bigemina 3aamyloid 3ababesiosis 3ablood serum 3acattle 3acholinesterase 3aferroxidase 3afibrinogen 3ahaptoglobins 3aimmunology 3ainflammation 3amicrobiology 3aparasitemia 3apathogenesis 3asialic acid 0aAcute phase protein 0aB. bigemina1 aMohammadi, Vahid1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8660-41791 aEsmaeilnejad, Bijan0 tComparative immunology, microbiology, and infectious diseases.g2021 June, v. 76 p.101642-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12359x0147-95717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2021.1016423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010300158520210700261592002802368650001202396650002202408650002102430650002302451650001502474650001202489650001502501650001502516650002802531650001702559651001002576700001302586700001602599700001802615773012602633856007302759852000902832655001202841IND60652005320221119175123.0190712e20170725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065200532DNAL7 a10.3390/su90812702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Tiantian10aMeasuring the Coordinated Development of Ecological and Economic Systems in Hengduan Mountain Area  aWith the expansion of the concept of sustainable development, it has become increasingly important to investigate the means for achieving sustainable eco-economic development. On the basis of Landsat imagery of Hengduan Mountain area of China acquired in 1990, 2000, and 2010, we analyzed the coordination relationships, evolution characteristics, and aggregation modes of the economy and ecology in this region using ecosystem service value (ESV) and ecological economic harmony (eco-economic harmony, EEH) models. The following results were obtained. (1) There was a significant transition in land cover, wherein grassland increased the most and farmland decreased the most, by 1.18 × 104 km2 and 9.41 × 103 km2, respectively. These trends were related to urban expansion and the implementation of ecological measures; (2) From 1990 to 2000, there was a deterioration in the ecological system, whereas after 2000, the ecosystem improved due to implementation of the Chinese government’s “Returning Farmland to Forest (Grassland)” scheme, thereby illustrating the importance of forest to ecosystem stability; (3) Spatially, the EEH index showed a dual-core structure centered on a low conflict zone and potential crisis zone, which signified that there was a trend of coordinated development between the economy and ecology; however, this was not stable; (4) There were four types of EEH evolution zones—low conflict, potential crisis, slight improvement, and significant improvement zones—of which the improvement zones accounted for 55.15% of the area, thereby indicating that over time the economy has played a positive role in shaping the ecological environment; (5) The spatial aggregation modes of EEH evolution were band coordinated mode, group uncoordinated mode and group improvement mode, which meant the relationship of ecology and economy was always in lowest coordinated state in a banded form, in uncoordinated state and a significant increase in a block form, respectively. These modes were intended to provide a reference for the sustainable development in southwest China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aagricultural land 3aeconomic systems 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aforests 3agrasslands 3aland cover 3asustainable development 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aPeng, Li1 aWang, Qiang1 aLiu, Shaoquan0 tSustainability.g2017 July 25, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90812703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03724naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012000166300001400286500001900300520228100319592002802600650001302628650002002641650002402661650001602685650001102701650001202712650001202724650002102736650001102757650001202768650002302780650002102803650001502824650002902839650001402868650001502882650001302897650001602910700001302926700001702939700001802956700002102974773014202995856008403137852000903221655001203230IND60689290720221117173338.0200421e20040201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068929072DNAL7 a10.1080/096374803100016424572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLabayen, I.10aTime-course changes in macronutrient metabolism induced by a nutritionally balanced low-calorie diet in obese women  ap. 27-35.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe use of low-calorie diets is a common strategy for body-weight reduction purposes, but the time-course of the metabolic changes induced by moderately energy-restricted, otherwise balanced, diets is still poorly known. The aim of this nutritional intervention design was to study in obese women the effect of a balanced low-calorie diet on the metabolic rate, and metabolic fuel utilization changes during the weight loss process through the application of breath tests with stable isotope-labeled tracers. Seven obese (body mass index >30 kg/m²) women were assigned to a 10-week dietary hypoenergetic intervention regime supplying 55% of energy as carbohydrate, 30% as fat and 15% as protein. Metabolic rate and substrate utilization were evaluated for 6 h in separate occasions during the weight loss program by indirect calorimetry and after ¹³C-labeled glucose, triolein and leucine administration. Body weight loss after 10 weeks was 4.2±1.1 kg, while the percent body fat decrease was about 5%. Slimming was accompanied by a marked decrease in fasting leptin (about 25%). Postprandial carbohydrate utilization after the administration of a test meal with the same macronutrient distribution as the experimental low-energy diet was decreased (24.1%, P<0.05) as a consequence of the dietary restriction, which was associated with lower insulin plasma levels (P<0.05). Although protein and lipid oxidation were not significantly different after weight reduction (day 1 versus day 70), the metabolic utilization of these substrates tended to increase. Moreover, marginally significant indications obtained on days 15 and 45 suggest that the weight and body composition changes are attributable to a shift in endogenous and exogenous glucose utilization in favor of lipid burning. The breath tests determinations, which were performed on different occasions along the experimental trial, confirmed that the cumulative ¹³C output decreased for labeled tracers with time, being only statistically significant for the glucose utilization between days 15 and 45. In summary, the weight and fat mass losses were associated with a lower carbohydrate oxidation, which were probably compensated by an increase in lipid oxidation without major changes in protein mobilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody fat 3abody mass index 3abody weight changes 3acalorimetry 3aenergy 3aglucose 3ainsulin 3aisotope labeling 3aleptin 3aleucine 3alipid peroxidation 3alow calorie diet 3ametabolism 3anutritional intervention 3aoxidation 3atest meals 3atriolein 3aweight loss1 aDiez, N.1 aParra, M.

However, evidence from epidemiological studies is still limited. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the epidemiological evidence for long-term effects of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) on dementia/Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our inclusion criteria for eligible studies were: longitudinal cohort study design, no overlap in study population, age of study subject ≥50 years, detailed description of exposure assessment for PM2.5, outdoor assessment of exposure to PM2.5, usage of a clear definition of dementia/AD, and accessibility of sufficient information for meta-analysis. Six databases were searched for eligible studies. The random-effect model was used to synthesize the associations between PM2.5 and dementia. After exclusion of all irrelevant studies, we analyzed the results of four cohort studies conducted in Canada, Taiwan, the UK, and the US during 2015–2018 among more than 12 million elderly subjects aged ≥50 years (N = 12,119,853). Our meta-analysis reveals that exposure to a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was significantly and positively associated with dementia (pooled HR = 3.26, 95% CI: 1.20, 5.31). In subgroup analyses, exposure to a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was found to be positively associated with AD (pooled HR = 4.82, 95% CI: 2.28, 7.36). Analysis of current epidemiological research on PM2.5 and dementia confirmed that exposure to PM2.5 was positively associated with a higher risk for dementia. However, it is to be noted that the included studies mainly relied on claim-based diagnosis and showed large differences in methods of exposure assessment, hence further epidemiological studies with well validated outcomes and with standardized exposure assessment models are required to ascertain the relationship between PM2.5 and dementia/AD.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAir pollution 0aAlzheimer's disease 0aDementia 0aParticulate matter 0aSystemic review1 aLin, Yuting,1 aHwang, Bing-Fang1 aNakayama, Shoji F.1 aTsai, Chon-Haw1 aSun, Xian-Liang1 aMa, Chaochen1 aJung, Chau-Ren0 tEnvironmental research.g2019 Oct., v. 177 p.108638-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.1086383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245015100154300001800305520123400323592002801557650002201585650002501607650001701632650002201649650002201671650001901693650001301712650002201725650001201747700002001759700001901779700002101798700003001819700002101849700001801870700001601888700001901904773010401923856007502027852000902102655001202111IND60531286620221118050902.0160723e20130924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053128662DNAL7 a10.1021/bi400770d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagao, Ryo10aCrystal Structure of Psb31, a Novel Extrinsic Protein of Photosystem II from a Marine Centric Diatom and Implications for Its Binding and Function  ap. 6646-6652.  aPsb31 is a fifth extrinsic protein found in photosystem II (PSII) of a centric diatom, Chaetoceros gracilis. The protein has been shown to bind directly to PSII in the absence of other extrinsic proteins and serves in part as a substitute for PsbO in supporting oxygen evolution. We report here the crystal structure of Psb31 at a resolution of 1.55 Å. The structure of Psb31 was composed of two domains, one major, N-terminal four helical domain and one minor, flexible C-terminal domain. The four helices in the N-terminal domain were arranged in an up–down–up–down fold, which appeared unexpectedly to be similar to the structure of spinach PsbQ, in spite of their low sequence homology. This suggests that the centric diatom PSII contains another PsbQ-type extrinsic protein in addition to the original PsbQ protein found in the organism. On the other hand, the C-terminal domain of Psb31 has a unique structure composed of one loop and one short helix. Based on these structural analysis and chemical cross-linking experiments, residues responsible for the binding of Psb31 to PSII intrinsic proteins were suggested. The results are discussed in relation to the copy number of extrinsic proteins in higher plant PSII.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aChaetoceros gracilis 3acrosslinking 3acrystal structure 3aoxygen production 3aphotosystem II 3aproteins 3asequence homology 3aspinach1 aSuga, Michihiro1 aNiikura, Ayako1 aOkumura, Akinori1 aKoua, Faisal

CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1), a core oscillator component of circadian rhythms that affect metabolic pathways in plants, has been implicated in flowering time control in species of Brassica. CCA1 gene sequences from three Brassica rapa inbred lines, showing either early flowering or late flowering phenotypes, were analyzed and a high level of sequence variation was identified, especially within the fourth intron. Using this information, three PCR primer sets were designed and tested using various inbred lines of B. rapa. The usage of InDel markers was further validated by evaluation of flowering time and high resolution melting (HRM) analysis. Both methods, PCR and HRM, validated the use of newly developed markers. Additional sequence analyses of Brassica plants with diploid (AA, BB, or CC) and allotetraploid genomes further confirmed a large number of sequence polymorphisms in the CCA1 gene, including insertions/deletions in the fourth intron. Our results demonstrated that sequence variations in CCA1 can be used to develop valuable trait-related molecular markers for Brassica crop breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallopolyploidy 3adiploidy 3aphenotype 3asequence diversity 3aDNA primers 3acole crops 3aflowering date 3apolymerase chain reaction 3abiochemical pathways 3aagronomic traits 3ainbred lines 3aBrassica rapa 3amelting 3acircadian rhythm 3aintrons 3agenetic markers 0agenes 0aflowering time 0aPCR markers 0aCCA1 0aplant breeding 0asequence variation1 aLi, Xiaonan1 aLee, Seong Ho1 aNou, Ill-Sup1 aLim, Y.

To understand the potential effects it has on type 2 diabetes (T2D), the glycolipid metabolism and gut microbiota regulation of phenolic-rich extracts from noni fruit (NFEs) were investigated. The results indicated that NFE could remarkably ameliorate hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and glycolipid metabolism via the adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway in T2D mice. Furthermore, metagenomic sequencing results revealed that NFE intervention modulated the gut microbiota composition in T2D mice, characterized by increased abundance of unclassified_o_Bacteroidales, Alistipes, Prevotella, Lactobacillus, and Akkermansia and decreased abundance of Oscillibacter, Desulfovibrio, and significantly decreased the pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism, translation, amino acid metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism. Taken together, the results provided new evidence that the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic activities of NFE in T2D were likely attributed to the activation of the liver AMPK pathway and modulation of gut microbiota.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesulfovibrio 3aLactobacillus 3aMorinda citrifolia 3aPrevotella 3aadenosine 3aamino acid metabolism 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3afood chemistry 3aglycemic effect 3aglycolipids 3ahyperglycemia 3ainsulin resistance 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aliver 3ametagenomics 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoxidative stress 3aphenolic compounds 3aprotein kinases 3atherapeutics 0atype 2 diabetes 0agut microbiota 0ahypoglycemic 0ahypolipidemic 0anoni fruit extract 0aphenolics1 aZhang, Lin1 aZhang, Qingyang1 aZhang, Jiachao1 aLiu, Sixin1 aLi, Congfa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1034-31331 aWang, Lu0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2022 Feb. 17, v. 70, no. 9 p.2876-2888dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c074413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012500168300001400293500001900307520161500326592002801941650001501969650001101984650001801995650002002013650001002033650002402043650002802067650001802095650000902113650001602122650001502138650000902153650000902162650002402171650001502195650001202210650000802222651001502230700001602245700001502261700001402276700001502290700001902305700001402324773014202338856008402480852000902564655001202573IND60689290820221120025511.0200421e20040201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068929082DNAL7 a10.1080/096374803100016424662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashizume, M.10aAnaemia in relation to low bioavailability of dietary iron among school-aged children in the Aral Sea region, Kazakhstan  ap. 37-43.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study investigates anaemia related to the sufficiency of dietary iron intake of school-aged children in the Kzyl-Orda region of Kazakhstan. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 97 school-aged children living in Kzyl-Orda. Blood samples were collected for measuring haemoglobin. Dietary intake data were obtained from 24-h dietary recalls. Iron bioavailability was estimated with algorithms adjusting for absorption enhancers (meat, fish and poultry, and vitamin C) and inhibitors (tea and phytates) consumed in the same meal. The median total iron intakes were adequate compared with the median basal iron requirement; however, the median bioavailable iron intakes were well below the median absorbed iron requirement. Available iron was 6.9–7.2% of the total iron intake after adjusting for the absorption enhancers, and was reduced by 3.1–4.4% after adjusting for both enhancers and inhibitors. After adjustment for energy intake, higher iron intake was significantly associated with a decreased prevalence of anaemia (odds ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.16–0.93; P=0.034). Some evidence suggested an association between bioavailable iron intake after adjustment of absorption enhancers and inhibitors (odds ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.18–1.01; P=0.053). In conclusion, low bioavailability of dietary iron seems related to anaemia in the region. Although iron fortification or supplementation programmes can be useful for promoting the anaemia prevention control programme, further efforts for nutritional education suited for family level dietary practice are necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aanemia 3aascorbic acid 3abioavailability 3ablood 3aconfidence interval 3across-sectional studies 3aenergy intake 3afish 3afood intake 3ahemoglobin 3airon 3ameat 3anutrition education 3aodds ratio 3apoultry 3atea 3aKazakhstan1 aShimoda, T.1 aSasaki, S.1 aKunii, O.1 aCaypil, W.1 aDauletbaev, D.1 aChiba, M.0 tInternational journal of food sciences and nutrition.g2004 Feb. 1, v. 55, no. 1 p.37-43dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2066x1465-34787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096374803100016424663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245019100160300001200351520119000363592002801553650001101581650001101592650001301603650001501616650001401631650001301645650001701658773009701675856007101772852000901843655001201852IND60693942520221122171618.0200509e19990301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069394252DNAL7 a10.1071/MU990012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJurisevic, Mark A.10aStructural Change of Begging Vocalisations and Vocal Repertoires in Two Hand-raised Australian Passerines, the Little Raven Corvus mellori and White-winged Chough Corcorax melanorhamphos  ap. 1-8.  aChange in vocal structure during development was investigated in two large Australian passerines, a corvid, the Little Raven Corvus mellori and a corcoracid, the White-winged Chough Corcorax melanorhamphos. Begging calls in both species were harsh vocalisations covering a wide frequency range. The major ontogenetic change in begging call structure was in pulse duration. Little Raven begging calls increased in pulse duration with increasing age while White-winged Chough begging calls decreased in duration. In both species pulse duration of begging calls gradually approached the duration of other vocalisations such as alarm, distress and contact calls given by fledglings and juveniles. The vocalisations of the White-winged Chough included both noisy (harsh), pure harmonic and tone vocalisations, while the vocalisations of the Little Raven showed less variation, with most vocalisations having a combined noisy and harmonic structure. In both species, begging calls were very similar in structure to other vocalisations produced in later stages of development, suggesting that the production of begging vocalisations may be important in the development of adult vocalisations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorvus 3aadults 3adistress 3afledglings 3ajuveniles 3aontogeny 3avocalization0 tEmu.g1999 Mar. 1, v. 99, no. 1 p.1-8dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3957316x1448-55407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MU990013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02561naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012000159520142100279592002801700650001701728650002001745650001201765650002501777650002901802650001801831650001301849650002401862650001101886650001401897650001901911650001801930651001101948700002001959773012601979856007302105852000902178655001202187IND60652005520221119175034.0190712e20170807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065200552DNAL7 a10.3390/su90813872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Rong-Song10aDevelopment of an Evaluation System for Sustaining Reservoir Functions—A Case Study of Shiwen Reservoir in Taiwan  aReservoirs serve as important facilities, providing a stable source of public water in Taiwan. As construction of new reservoirs becomes more difficult, it is essential to ensure sustainable functionality of reservoirs in the future. To this end, this study proposes a system for reservoir sustainability evaluation. The evaluation system consists of social justice, environmental protection, and economic development containing 12 indicators which are grouped into six categories: flood control, sediment management, water resources allocation, river ecology, water quality, and benefit and fairness. Moreover, evaluation system operational procedures to supplement planning and decision-making processes are proposed, and applied in a case study of the Shiwen reservoir planning in Taiwan. The planned reservoir in this case study is rated as “Good”, nearly “Excellent”, in sustainability as evaluated with the Sustainability Confidence Index (SCI). Additionally, Analytic Network Process (ANP) results indicate that the flood control capacity and sediment management are the first and second most important indicators for the reservoir. If desilting operations had been conducted, the SCI values would have increased from 3.3 to 3.7, warranting an “Excellent” rating for the reservoir. The case study demonstrates that decision-makers can apply the proposed system when managing reservoir evaluations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aecology 3aeconomic development 3aenvironmental protection 3aflood control 3aplanning 3aresource allocation 3arivers 3asediments 3asocial justice 3awater quality 3aTaiwan1 aTsai, Chan-Ming0 tSustainability.g2017 Aug. 07, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90813873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012300170520156000293592002801853653002501881653002401906653001001930653002901940700001701969700001801986700001702004700001602021700001402037773010402051856008502155852000902240655001202249IND60656923220221119144313.0191121e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065692322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2019.1086402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shao-hui10aUrinary trichloroacetic acid and high blood pressure: A cross-sectional study of general adults in Shijiazhuang, China  aExposure to trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) and its parent chemicals potentially linked to cardiovascular disease. However, the association between TCAA and blood pressure (BP) has not been studied to date. The purpose of this study was to examine the potential association between urinary TCAA levels and BP in a Chinese population. We measured BP parameters (including systolic BP, diastolic BP and pulse pressure) and TCAA concentrations in the urine of 569 adults from a primary health care clinic in Shijiazhuang, China. Logistic and linear regressions were used to investigate the relationships between the urinary TCAA levels and BP parameters. To evaluate the robustness of the results, we conducted sensitivity analyses by re-analysing data after excluding urine samples with extreme specific creatinine values. We found that urine TCAA levels were positively associated with systolic BP and pulse pressure based on trend tests after adjusting for potential confounders (both p for trend < 0.05). Finally, only the association of TCAA with systolic BP remained significant in the sensitivity analyses (p < 0.05). Our results suggested that TCAA exposure was associated with increased BP in adults. Because urinary TCAA has been proposed as a valid biomarker of disinfection by-product (DBP) ingestion through disinfected drinking water, our results further suggest that exposure to drinking water DBPs may contribute to high BP in humans. Additional research is needed to confirm these findings and to evaluate opportunities for intervention.  aPublisher supplied data 0aTrichloroacetic acid 0aHigh blood pressure 0aAdult 0aDisinfection by-products1 aGuo, Ai-jing1 azhao, Wei-xin1 aGu, Jia-ling1 aZhang, Rong1 aWei, Ning0 tEnvironmental research.g2019 Oct., v. 177 p.108640-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.1086403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05061naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245015400172300001500326520308900341592002803430650003303458650002903491650001603520650002703536650001603563650001603579650002003595650001603615650000903631650002003640650003103660650001003691650002703701650001603728650001803744650002103762650002003783650001203803650001403815650001703829650001503846650001403861650002203875650001903897650001903916650002103935653002203956653001603978653001403994653003304008653002104041700002204062700002304084700001504107700002004122700005704142773011304199856009004312852000904402655001204411IND60614370620221118032236.0190318e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061437062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.09.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Wenhao10aMetformin attenuates lipid accumulation in hepatocytes of blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala) via activation of AMP-activated protein kinase  ap. 90-100.  aCurrently, there is a trend to use high-fat diets in intensive aquaculture that is accompanied with incidence of fatty liver when dietary lipid level surpasses an upper limit. So, it is necessary to develop appropriate strategies to reduce the risk of fatty liver in commercial fish farming. Studies in mammals have revealed a correlation between fatty liver and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, which has been recognized as a key modulator of lipid metabolism. Considering the frequent occurrence of fatty liver in blunt snout bream farming, an in-vitro study was designed to evaluate the efficiency of metformin, as a stimulator of AMPK, in activation of AMPK and its subsequent effects on lipid metabolism in primary hepatocytes. Fish hepatocytes were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 ml−1 in 6-well tissue culture plates and treated with three different media including: 1) Leibovitz's L-15 medium [L15] as control, 2) high-fat medium [L15 + 400 μM oleic acid], and 3) metformin medium [L15 + 400 μM oleic acid+200 μM metformin]. After 48 h of culture, the cells and supernatant were collected for analysis. The results showed significant (P < .05) enhancement of cell triglyceride and total cholesterol concentrations in the high-fat group over control, and metformin addition significantly reduced the values. Also, the high-fat group exhibited significantly higher aspartate aminotransferase activity than both control and metformin groups. The lowest AMPK and phospho-AMPK protein expression was found in the high-fat group while metformin addition significantly up-regulated their expression levels. Mitochondrial and peroxisomal oxidation rates in the high-fat group were significantly lower than control while similar oxidation rates were observed for metformin treated and control groups. The high-fat group showed significantly lower CPT I activity than control, and metformin inclusion increased the activity. Expression of genes associated with lipid metabolism such as PPARα, CPT I, AOX, PGC-1α and TFAM was suppressed in the high-fat group, and metformin supplementation up-regulated their expression levels. The opposite trend was true for the expression of ACC2 gene. Also, the results showed down-regulation of FAS and SREBP-1C genes in the high-fat medium group, and metformin addition resulted in further reduction of their expression level. The lowest activities of mitochondrial complexes (I-III) were found in the high-fat group and metformin prevented high-fat-induced reduction of mitochondrial complexes activity. Notably increased concentrations of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde were found in the high-fat group, and metformin treatment reduced their concentrations. Moreover, metformin group exhibited higher glutathione peroxidase activity than the high-fat group. The findings in this study showed clearly that metformin activated AMPK in blunt snout bream hepatocytes, which contributed to enhanced lipid metabolism and attenuated lipid deposition in the cells incubated with high-fat medium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aMegalobrama amblycephala 3aaquaculture 3aaspartate transaminase 3acholesterol 3adietary fat 3aenzyme activity 3afatty liver 3afish 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahepatocytes 3ahigh fat diet 3alipid metabolism 3amalondialdehyde 3amammals 3ametformin 3amitochondria 3aoleic acid 3aoxidation 3aprotein synthesis 3arisk reduction 3atissue culture 3atriacylglycerols 0aBlunt snout bream 0aFatty liver 0aMetformin 0aAMP-activated protein kinase 0aLipid metabolism1 aRahimnejad, Samad1 aTocher, Douglas R.1 aLu, Kangle1 aZhang, Chunxiao1 aSun, Yunzhang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4268-82910 tAquaculture.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 499 p.90-100dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.09.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245012700181300001600308520130400324592002801628650001401656650001901670650002601689650002601715650001501741650001701756650001101773650001401784650003201798650002301830650001601853653003701869653003001906653002001936653002501956653002301981700001402004773013902018856008102157852000902238655001202247IND60650460220221123011118.0190710e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065046022DNAL7 a277024182pmid7 a10.1017/S00074853160008942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaws, A.N.10aDensity mediates grasshopper performance in response to temperature manipulation and spider predation in tallgrass prairie  ap. 261-267.  aSpecies interactions are often context-dependent, where outcomes require an understanding of influences among multiple biotic and abiotic factors. However, it remains unclear how abiotic factors such as temperature combine with important biotic factors such as density-dependent food limitation and predation to influence species interactions. Using a native grassland – grasshopper – wolf spider model food chain in tallgrass prairie, we conducted a manipulative field experiment to examine how predator–prey interactions respond to manipulations of temperature, grasshopper density, and food chain length. We find that grasshopper performance responses to temperature and predator treatments were density dependent. At high densities, grasshopper survival decreased with increased temperature when no spiders were present. When spiders were present, grasshopper survival was reduced, and this effect was strongest in the cooled treatment. In contrast, grasshopper survival did not vary significantly with spider presence or among temperature treatments at low grasshopper densities. Our results indicate that context-dependent species interactions are common and highlight the importance of understanding how and when key biotic and abiotic factors combine to influence species interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLycosidae 3abiotic factors 3aenvironmental factors 3afield experimentation 3afood chain 3agrasshoppers 3amodels 3apredation 3apredator-prey relationships 3atallgrass prairies 3atemperature 0aKonza Prairie Biological Station 0aPhoetaliotes nebrascensis 0aRabidosa rabida 0aspecies interactions 0adensity dependence1 aJoern, A.0 tBulletin of entomological research.g2017 Apr., v. 107, no. 2 p.261-267dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46143x1475-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00074853160008943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03259naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245014000163300001600303520166000319592002801979650000802007650001402015650002002029650001002049650001602059650001602075650001202091650001302103650001402116650002102130650002102151650000902172650001802181650001402199650001902213653002702232653003702259653001202296653002702308653003402335653006402369700001502433700001302448700001402461700001402475700001502489700001702504773010202521856008502623852000902708655001202717IND60553297820221122020307.0161021e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055329782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2014.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Rui12aA RARE of hepatic Gck promoter interacts with RARα, HNF4α and COUP-TFII that affect retinoic acid- and insulin-induced Gck expression  ap. 964-976.  aThe expression of hepatic glucokinase gene (Gck) is regulated by hormonal and nutritional signals. How these signals integrate to regulate the hepatic Gck expression is unclear. We have shown that the hepatic Gck expression is affected by Vitamin A status and synergistically induced by insulin and retinoids in primary rat hepatocytes. We hypothesized that this is mediated by a retinoic acid responsive element (RARE) in the hepatic Gck promoter. Here, we identified the RARE in the hepatic Gck promoter using standard molecular biology techniques. The single nucleotide mutations affecting the promoter activation by retinoic acid (RA) were also determined for detail analysis of protein and DNA interactions. We have optimized experimental conditions for performing electrophoresis mobility shift assay and demonstrated the interactions of the retinoic acid receptor α (RARα), retinoid X receptor α (RXRα), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) in the rat nuclear extract with this RARE, suggesting their roles in the regulation of Gck expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that recombinant adenovirus-mediated overexpression of RARα, HNF4α and COUP-TFII, but not RXRα, significantly increased their occupancy in the hepatic Gck promoter in primary rat hepatocytes. Overexpression of RARα, HNF4α and COUP-TFII, but not RXRα, also affected the RA- and insulin-mediated Gck expression in primary rat hepatocytes. In summary, this hepatic Gck promoter RARE interacts with RARα, HNF4α and COUP-TFII to integrate Vitamin A and insulin signals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3achromatin 3aelectrophoresis 3agenes 3aglucokinase 3ahepatocytes 3ainsulin 3amutation 3aovalbumin 3aprecipitin tests 3apromoter regions 3arats 3aretinoic acid 3avitamin A 3avitamin status 0aHepatic Gck expression 0aRetinoic acid responsive element 0aInsulin 0aRetinoic acid receptor 0aHepatocyte nuclear factor 4α 0aChicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II1 aZhang, Rui1 aLi, Yang1 aZhu, Bing1 aChen, Wei1 aZhang, Yan1 aChen, Guoxun0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2014 Sept., v. 25 p.964-976dElsevier Inc.x0955-28637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2014.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04229naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245012200170300001400292520237800306592002802684650002802712650002002740650003202760650001702792650001802809650001502827650001802842650001702860650002702877650001602904650002302920650001902943650001902962650001102981650002502992650001203017650002703029650001803056650002203074650001603096650001103112650001603123653001703139653001603156653001903172653001603191653003603207700001403243700001503257700001403272700001403286700001703300700001403317700001703331700002203348700001303370773009703383856009003480852000903570655001203579IND60614370720221118032325.0190318e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061437072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJana, B.B.10aDoes solar heated structure mimicking greenhouse effective to impede winter growth reduction of some tropical fishes?  ap. 51-60.  aWinter reduction of fish growth is one of the major concerns in aquaculture. Using the principle of greenhouse mediated raised temperature, the issue has been addressed by examining the growth responses of some tropical fishes in polyculture (rohu, mrigal, bata, Japanese punti, grass carp, common carp, magur, freshwater prawn) and two stocking ratios (80:20 and 20:80) with surface and column feeder (catla, silver carp, rohu, Japanese punti and bata) and bottom feeder (mrigal and common carp). Advanced fry of these fishes were introduced separately in solar heated greenhouse and in open polyhouse (13 × 1.5 × 2 m3) placed in triplicate in a pond and reared for 120 or 98 days during the winter for two consecutive years. The rate of survival (20–83%) and net weight gained by different species of fish were distinctly higher in closed set up (0.22–2.95 g/day) than in open (4–66%; 0.11–1.80 g/day) ones in both trials. Among the species, warmth induced net weight gain was maximal for Japanese punti (196 g), followed by rohu (159 g), mrigal (115 g), grass carp (104 g), bata (36 g) and freshwater prawn (28 g) in polyculture. The frequency distribution of harvested fishes was skewed towards large fishes in solar heated greenhouse and smaller ones in open units. Water temperature ranged from 21.6–28.1 °C and 17.2–23.7 °C in the closed and open units, whereas mean temperature remained 4.5–5 °C higher in the former than in latter. There was no marked differences in total alkalinity (219–231 mg/l), inorganic carbon (289–417 mg/l), organic carbon (4.27–4.52 mg/l), dissolved oxygen (6.61–6.75 mg/l), total dissolved solids (420.48–423.74 mg/l) and conductivity (549.83–563.29 μs/cm) between the closed and open enclosures, and remained within the range for fish culture. The score values of the sum total of the integrated ecological conditions revealed that ~ 5 °C rise in water temperature during winter enhanced as high as 36% increased yield of fish (2546 kg/ha) over open units mediated through microbial driven augmented manure mineralization leading to increased primary productivity, zooplankton abundance and ecological integrity. In essence, the solar heated greenhouse would be of considerable use for circumventing the retarded growth during winter in tropical fishes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aCyprinus carpio 3aHypophthalmichthys molitrix 3aLabeo rohita 3aMacrobrachium 3aalkalinity 3aanimal growth 3afish culture 3afrequency distribution 3agreenhouses 3agrowth retardation 3amineralization 3aorganic carbon 3aoxygen 3aprimary productivity 3arearing 3atotal dissolved solids 3atropical fish 3awater temperature 3aweight gain 3awinter 3azooplankton 0aIndian carps 0aFish growth 0aOrganic carbon 0aTemperature 0aFertilizer mineralization index1 aNandy, S.1 aLahiri, S.1 aBag, S.K.1 aGhosh, P.1 aBhakta, J.N.1 aGhosh, D.1 aBiswas, J.K.1 aBhattacharjee, A.1 aJana, S.0 tAquaculture.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 499 p.51-60dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002500141245014500166500001400311520158200325592002801907650001801935650002101953650002801974650001602002650001702018650001802035650001402053650001502067650000902082650001902091650001002110650001402120651001202134700002802146700002202174700001902196700002302215700002102238700002602259700002902285700002502314773011902339856007602458852000902534655001202543IND60702218520221122205858.0200717e20200513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070221852DNAL7 a10.3390/ani100508372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Galán, Ana 14aThe Addition of Lactobacillus spp., Enrofloxacin or Doxycycline Negatively Affects the Viability of Mycoplasma bovis in Diluted Bovine Semen  aNAL-light  aMycoplasma bovis is an important etiologic agent of bovine mycoplasmosis in cattle. Different transmission routes have been described, including those related to reproduction. The presence of mycoplasma in semen has led to its appearance in infection-free areas through artificial insemination (AI). Semen was recently reported to be the initial source of two M. bovis mastitis outbreaks in two closed dairy herds in Finland. This questions the effectiveness of the antimicrobials currently used in semen extenders to control the pathogens in contaminated semen. They should be re-evaluated, or alternative measures to antimicrobials should be tested to obtain M. bovis-free semen. This in vitro study aimed to assess different strategies to reduce the risk of transmission of M. bovis through AI technologies. The viability of M. bovis (PG45, NCTC 10131) in bull semen diluted (DS) in a Tris-citrate-fructose solution was tested, after the addition of enrofloxacin, doxycycline or a Lactobacillus spp.-based probiotic. The data show the susceptibility of the pathogen to the addition of 0.125 μg/mL of enrofloxacin or 0.0625 μg/mL of doxycycline and to the addition of the probiotic at a concentration of 3.24 × 10⁶ colony forming units (CFU)/mL or 3.24 × 10⁸ CFU/mL in DS. The Tris-citrate-fructose medium negatively affected the viability of M. bovis, although this effect was lower than that observed after the addition of the probiotic and antimicrobials (p < 0.05). Our results may support new strategies for reducing the risk of M. bovis transmission through AI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus 3aMycoplasma bovis 3aartificial insemination 3adoxycycline 3aenrofloxacin 3amycoplasmosis 3apathogens 3aprobiotics 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3asemen 3aviability 3aFinland1 aGómez-Martín, Ángel 1 aBataller, Esther 1 aGomis, Jesús 1 aSánchez, Antonio,1 aGadea, Joaquín 1 aVieira, Luis  Alberto1 aGarcía-Roselló, Empar 1 aDe la Fe, Christian 0 tAnimals.g2020 May 13, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani100508373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245014500162300002000307520127700327592002801604596009801632596009501730596012101825650002201946650001701968650001301985650000901998650001902007650002502026650001702051650001902068650002102087650002402108700001602132700002002148700001702168700001602185700005602201700001502257700005202272700005302324773017302377856008102550852000902631655001202640IND60792553720221120220123.0220907e20220826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079255372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.2c020662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Youbo10aMechanically Robust, Heat-Resistant, and Reprocessable Polyethylene Vitrimers Cross-Linked by β-Hydroxy Ester Bonds via Reactive Processing  ap. 13126-13135.  aThe development of vitrimers, dynamic covalent bonds cross-liked polymers via the associative exchange mechanism, offers a feasible way to address the recycling issue of traditional chemically cross-linked polyethylene (PE). However, it is still a great challenge to simultaneously achieve recyclability and high performance through a route that is environmentally friendly and easy to scale up. In this work, low-density (LD) PE vitrimers cross-linked by β-hydroxy ester bonds were successfully obtained via reactive processing between polyethylene-co-glycidyl methacrylate (PE-GMA) and decanedioic acid (DA). The high reaction efficiency of epoxy and carboxy groups leads to a high gel content of 84.51%. The activation energy (Eₐ) of the transesterification reaction is calculated to be 111.33 kJ·mol–¹. Thanks to the high Eₐ and cross-link density, the obtained (LD) PE vitrimer exhibits a superior tensile strength of 20.41 MPa and an elongation at break of 800.16%, which is one of the highest values among the currently reported PE vitrimers fabricated by reactive processing. Moreover, the (LD) PE vitrimers have good creep resistance, heat resistance, and electrical insulation, thus showing a great potential to be used in the field of cable insulation.  aPublisher supplied data  a51803130cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aNAcCentral University Basic Research Fund of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100018594  aKFJJ2005cChongqing University Key Laboratory of Micro/Nano Materials Engineering and Technologydhttps://doi.org/NA 3aactivation energy 3acrosslinking 3aepoxides 3agels 3aheat tolerance 3ainsulating materials 3apolyethylene 3aprocess design 3atensile strength 3atransesterification1 aMao, Hongda1 aZhang, Tingting1 aGuo, Zhenyou1 aBai, Dongyu1 aBai, Hongwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4927-64221 aZhang, Qin1 aXiu, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6388-02181 aFu, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5191-33150 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 Aug. 26, v. 61, no. 35 p.13126-13135dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c020663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245016600182300001600348520153000364592002801894650002701922650002501949650001101974650002001985650002002005650001002025650001202035650001002047650001602057650001502073650001902088650001002107650002002117650001002137650002002147650001302167650001102180650002202191651002002213653001402233653001402247653001202261700001502273773013902288856008102427852000902508655001202517IND60650460420221123011020.0190710e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065046042DNAL7 a278760992pmid7 a10.1017/S00074853160009122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, G.H.10aBroad-scale suppression of cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), associated with Bt cotton crops in Northern New South Wales, Australia  ap. 188-199.  aThe cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, is a major pest of many agricultural crops in several countries, including Australia. Transgenic cotton, expressing a single Bt toxin, was first used in the 1990s to control H. armigera and other lepidopteran pests. Landscape scale or greater pest suppression has been reported in some countries using this technology. However, a long-term, broad-scale pheromone trapping program for H. armigera in a mixed cropping region in eastern Australia caught more moths during the deployment of single Bt toxin cotton (Ingard®) (1996–2004) than in previous years. This response can be attributed, at least in part, to (1) a precautionary cap (30% of total cotton grown, by area) being applied to Ingard® to restrict the development of Bt resistance in the pest, and (2) during the Ingard® era, cotton production greatly increased (as did that of another host plant, sorghum) and H. armigera (in particular the 3ʳᵈ and older generations) responded in concert with this increase in host plant availability. However, with the replacement of Ingard® with Bollgard II® cotton (containing two different Bt toxins) in 2005, and recovery of the cotton industry from prevailing drought, H. armigera failed to track increased host-plant supply and moth numbers decreased. Greater toxicity of the two gene product, introduction of no cap on Bt cotton proportion, and an increase in natural enemy abundance are suggested as the most likely mechanisms responsible for the suppression observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3acotton 3acotton industry 3acrop production 3acrops 3adrought 3agenes 3ahost plants 3alandscapes 3amixed cropping 3amoths 3anatural enemies 3apests 3apheromone traps 3atoxicity 3atoxins 3atransgenic plants 3aNew South Wales 0aabundance 0aBt cotton 0aweather1 aTann, C.R.0 tBulletin of entomological research.g2017 Apr., v. 107, no. 2 p.188-199dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46143x1475-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00074853160009123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02382naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245011800164300002000282520103200302592002801334650000801362650002301370650002201393650002601415650001401441650002101455650002201476650001101498650001701509650001401526700001301540700001601553700001601569700001901585700001401604700005801618700005901676773013701735856007901872852000901951655001201960IND60675048720221122024124.0191104e20190930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067504872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b014962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsawa, Takashi10aSynthesis of 2′-C,4′-C-Methyleneoxy-Bridged Thymidine Derivatives and Properties of Modified Oligonucleotides  ap. 13336-13344.  a2′,4′-Bridged nucleic acid (2′,4′-BNA) analogues are used for therapeutic oligonucleotides, owing to their excellent hybridizing ability with complementary RNA and high resistance toward enzymatic degradation.

Herein, we designed and synthesized 7′-methyl derivatives of methyleneoxy-bridged 2′-deoxyribonucleic acid (MoDNA), possessing a five-membered bridge with 6′-oxygen atom via radical cyclization for the bridge construction. The synthesized monomers were incorporated into the oligonucleotides by solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis. The MoDNA-modified oligonucleotides showed high affinity toward single-stranded RNA and double-stranded DNA, as well as excellent resistance toward nuclease compared with the corresponding natural oligonucleotide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3achemical structure 3acomplementary RNA 3acyclization reactions 3anucleases 3aoligonucleotides 3aorganic compounds 3aoxygen 3atherapeutics 3athymidine1 aKim, Han1 aShoji, Misa1 aSaijo, Miku1 aDohi, Masakazu1 aIto, Yuta1 aObika, Satoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6842-68121 aHari, Yoshiyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3903-73400 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2019 Sept. 30, v. 84, no. 21 p.13336-13344dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.9b014963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002500180245007300205300001800278506007600296520147400372592002801846506003701874650000801911650002201919650001101941650002001952650001701972650001101989650001302000650003302013650001302046650001602059700002102075773010402096856007502200852000902275655001202284IND60531287020221207142212.0160723e20130924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053128702DNAL7 a10.1021/bi400952m2doi7 aPMC39196582pmcid7 a239849502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEginton, Christopher12aA Large Solvent Isotope Effect on Protein Association Thermodynamics  ap. 6595-6600.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSolvent reorganization can contribute significantly to the energetics of protein–protein interactions.

At 20 °C, the dimerization reaction, which is thermodynamically coupled to binding of a small ligand, bio-5′-AMP, is characterized by a Gibbs free energy of −7 kcal/mol. This modest net dimerization free energy reflects underlying, very large opposing enthalpic and entropic driving forces of 41 ± 3 and −48 ± 3 kcal/mol, respectively. The thermodynamics have been interpreted as indicating coupling of solvent release to dimerization. In this work, this interpretation has been investigated by measuring the effect of replacing H₂O with D₂O on the dimerization thermodynamics. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements performed at 20 °C reveal a solvent isotope effect of −1.5 kcal/mol on the Gibbs free energy of dimerization. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the reaction in D₂O indicates enthalpic and entropic contributions of 28 and −37 kcal/mol, respectively, considerably smaller than the values measured in H₂O. These large solvent isotope perturbations to the thermodynamics are consistent with a significant contribution of solvent release to the dimerization reaction.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aGibbs free energy 3abiotin 3adeuterium oxide 3adimerization 3aenergy 3aisotopes 3aprotein-protein interactions 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aBeckett, Dorothy0 tBiochemistry.g2013 Sept. 24, v. 52, no. 38 p.6595-6600dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi400952m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002400141245008200165500001400247520117600261592002801437650002201465650002301487650001401510650001701524650001101541650001201552650002301564650001001587650002301597650001301620650002601633650001001659650000801669700003001677700003001707700002901737700003101766700002501797700002901822700002901851773011901880856007601999852000902075655001202084IND60702218820221122205918.0200717e20200513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070221882DNAL7 a10.3390/ani100508432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanul-Solis, Jorge 10aMitigation of Rumen Methane Emissions with Foliage and Pods of Tropical Trees  aNAL-light  aMethane produced by enteric fermentation contributes to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere. Methane is one of the GHG resulting from anthropogenic activities with the greater global warming contribution. Ruminant production systems contribute between 18% and 33% of methane emissions. Due to this, there has been growing interest in finding feed alternatives which may help to mitigate methane production in the rumen. The presence of a vast range of secondary metabolites in tropical trees (coumarins, phenols, tannins, and saponins, among others) may be a valuable alternative to manipulate rumen fermentation and partially defaunate the rumen, and thus reduce enteric methane production. Recent reports suggest that it is possible to decrease methane emissions in sheep by up to 27% by feeding them saponins from the tea leaves of Camellia sinensis; partial defaunation (54%) of the rumen has been achieved using saponins from Sapindus saponaria. The aim of this review was to collect, analyze, and interpret scientific information on the potential of tropical trees and their secondary metabolites to mitigate methane emissions from ruminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3aSapindus saponaria 3acoumarins 3afermentation 3aleaves 3amethane 3amethane production 3arumen 3arumen fermentation 3asaponins 3asecondary metabolites 3asheep 3atea1 aCampos-Navarrete, María 1 aPiñeiro-Vázquez, Angel 1 aCasanova-Lugo, Fernando 1 aBarros-Rodríguez, Marcos 1 aChay-Canul, Alfonso 1 aCárdenas-Medina, José 1 aCastillo-Sánchez, Luis 0 tAnimals.g2020 May 13, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani100508433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245008700160300001400247500001900261520118100280592002801461650001201489650002901501650001401530650002501544650001901569650001201588650001501600650002101615650000901636700001601645773014201661856007901803852000901882655001201891IND60689291420221123035800.0200421e20030101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068929142DNAL7 a10.1080/0963748031619762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRashmi, S.10aEffect of processing on nutritionally important starch fractions in rice varieties  ap. 27-36.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the present study the effect of processing on starch fractions (rapidly digestible starch (RDS), slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch) were measured, using controlled enzymic hydrolysis with pancreatin and amyloglucidase, in six rice varieties; namely, BT rice, Gauri rice, Sona masoori, parboiled rice, Salem parboiled rice, and steamed rice. The processes studied were pressure cooking, boiling, steaming and straining. Rapidly available glucose (RAG) was also measured to derive a Starch Digestion Index (SDI). Cooking of rice by different methods decreased the amylose content. The degree of gelatinization ranged from 56 to 95, with pressure cooking resulting in the maximum degree. The starch fractions varied depending on the cooking method. Significant inverse correlations were seen between RDS and SDS (r=0.40, P&lt;0.05), and between amylose and SDI (r=0.60, P&lt;0.01). RAG and RDS related positively (r=0.90, P&lt;0.01). The SDI of rice varieties cooked by the boiling and straining method were significantly higher (P&lt;0.05). The results emphasize that cooking methods influence the nutritionally important starch fractions in rice varieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylose 3adigestible carbohydrates 3adigestion 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3agelatinization 3aglucose 3apancreatin 3aresistant starch 3arice1 aUrooj, Asna0 tInternational journal of food sciences and nutrition.g2003 Jan. 1, v. 54, no. 1 p.27-36dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2066x1465-34787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0963748031619763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004500092040001800137100002900155245007200184300001300256520152300269592002801792650002001820650002301840650001301863650000901876650001101885650002101896700001501917700002001932700001901952700001901971700001801990700001502008773009202023856009102115852000902206655001202215IND4447553820221121062336.0141110e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444755382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2010.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman Khan, Md.

In this study, tensile tests of hemp fibre were conducted using a universal tensile strength testing machine. Fibres used in the experiment were from hemp grown at target seeding rates of 50, 100 and 350 plants m⁻². The effects of target seeding rate on the fibre fineness and tensile properties of hemp fibre were examined. Before the tensile tests, diameters and finenesses of the fibres were measured. In the tensile tests, the clamping length of fibre specimen was 35 mm, and the load-elongation curves of fibre specimens were recorded. The tensile properties of fibre (specific tensile strength, maximum strain, apparent modulus and work of rupture) were derived from the curves. Increasing the target seeding rate from 50 to 350 plants m⁻², decreased the average fibre diameter from 0.28 to 0.25 mm, decreased the average fibre fineness from 150 to 88 tex; increased the average specific fibre tensile strength from 22.9 to 44.0 cN tex⁻¹; decreased the work of rupture from 9.3 to 5.7 mJ. All the properties measured were highly variable. However, the frequencies distribution of the data showed a cluster for most properties. For example, the majority of fibres had fineness within the range of 0–50 tex, had specific tensile strength within the range of 0–20 cN tex⁻¹, and had work of rupture within the range of 0–5 mJ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCannabis sativa 3acomposite polymers 3afineness 3ahemp 3asowing 3atensile strength1 aChen, Ying1 aBelsham, Tamara1 aLaguë, Claude1 aLandry, Hubert1 aPeng, Qingjin1 aZhong, Wen0 tBiosystems engineering.g2011 Jan., v. 108, no. 1 p.9-17dElsevier Ltdx1537-51107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2010.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03658naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024004100138040001800179100002400197245013500221506002800356506003600384506007600420506003100496520149700527592002802024596008302052596006402135596004502199506003702244650002402281650002702305650002502332650001902357650002702376650001802403650002302421650001602444650001602460650002102476650001102497650001702508650001102525650001902536650001102555650001602566650002102582650002302603653002402626653001602650653002302666653001302689653000902702653001402711700002402725700002102749700001902770773009802789856008802887903002402975852000902999655001203008IND60693586520221207143353.0200804e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069358652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.1123972chorus7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.1123972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeterson, Donnie L.10aEcological fitting: Chemical profiles of plant hosts provide insights on selection cues and preferences for a major buprestid pest  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aSpecific cues used by emerald ash borer (EAB, Agrilus planipennis) to select hosts are largely unknown. Attractants are likely general and the use of novel host plants provides an opportunity to investigate the commonality of these cues. We examined volatile profiles emitted by five plants that can host EAB and estimated their importance in explaining known oviposition preferences.Foliage volatiles were collected from potted black ash (Fraxinus nigra), Manchurian ash (F. mandshurica), blue ash (F. quadrangulata), white fringetree (Chionanthus virginicus), and olive (Olea europaea) and analyzed using GC-MS.Fifty-nine compounds were detected including eight green leaf volatiles (GLV), 12 monoterpenes, and 21 sesquiterpenes. Ordination plots show separation of species by full foliage profiles, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and known antennally active compounds, but GLVs were similar across hosts. Random Forest (RF) analysis revealed eight compounds that separated plant species with an error rate of ~19%, consisting mostly of sesquiterpenes.Similarity of GLV profiles among known hosts suggests they serve as general cues for host selection. Manchurian ash, a resistant host, produced the highest quantities and variety of sesquiterpenes indicating that some of these chemicals may be antixenotic. All compounds identified by RF have been implicated as deterrents or attractants to woodborers in other studies and should be investigated for adult antennal activity and attraction.  aPublisher supplied data  cAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009168  cNgee Ann Polytechnicdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100011632  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAgrilus planipennis 3aChionanthus virginicus 3aFraxinus mandshurica 3aFraxinus nigra 3aFraxinus quadrangulata 3aOlea europaea 3aactive ingredients 3aattractants 3ahost plants 3ahost preferences 3aimagos 3ainsect pests 3aleaves 3amonoterpenoids 3aolives 3aoviposition 3asesquiterpenoids 3avolatile compounds 0aAgrilus planipennis 0aChionanthus 0aEcological fitting 0aFraxinus 0aOlea 0aVolatiles1 aBöröczky, Katalin1 aTumlinson, James1 aCipollini, Don0 tPhytochemistry.g2020 Aug., v. 176 p.112397-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.1123973Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013400172520171900306592002802025653004702053653000902100653000902109653001902118653001702137653000802154653000902162653000902171653000902180653000902189653000902198653001002207653001002217653001002227653001002237653000902247653000902256653000902265653001202274653001102286653000902297653001002306653000902316653001002325653001002335653001102345653001002356653001002366653000902376700001902385773010402404856008502508852000902593655001202602IND60656923820221119144412.0191121e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065692382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2019.1086482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDomingo, José L.10aHuman exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) through drinking water: A review of the recent scientific literature  aPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of water-soluble chemical compounds with an important number of applications, which have been widely used during the last 60 years. Two of them, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), are the most known and well investigated. As for many other organic substances that are of environmental concern, the diet is the main route of human exposure to PFAS. However, in certain cases drinking water may also mean a significant contribution to human exposure, and to a lesser extent, dust and air (indoor exposure). In recent years, the environmental persistence of PFAS, their biomagnification in food webs, as well as their potential accumulation and toxicity, have generated a notable interest, which has been evidenced by the considerable number of publications in this regard. Recently, we carried out a wide revision on the levels of PFAS in food and human dietary intake. In the current review, we have summarized the recent information (last 10 years) published in the scientific literature (Scopus and PubMed) on the concentrations of PFAS in drinking water and the human health risks derived from the regular water consumption, when available. A large amount of data belongs to PFOS and PFOA and corresponds to studies mainly conducted in countries of the European Union, USA and China, although no information is available for most countries over the world. According to the toxicological information about PFAS that is so far available, the current health risks for the regular consumers of municipal/tap water do not seem to be of concern according to the levels considered as acceptable for various regulatory institutions.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) 0aPFOS 0aPFOA 0aDrinking water 0aHealth risks 0aPFC 0aPFAS 0aPFOA 0aPFOS 0aPFBA 0aPFBS 0aPFHxS 0aPFHxA 0aPFPeA 0aPFHpA 0aPFNA 0aPFDA 0aPFPA 0a6:2FTSA 0aPFUnDA 0aPFCA 0aPFPeS 0aPFSA 0aPFDoA 0aPFBuS 0aTHPFOS 0aPFTDA 0aPFOSA 0aPFAA1 aNadal, Martí,0 tEnvironmental research.g2019 Oct., v. 177 p.108648-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.1086483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03659naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005400153245011800207500001900325520199400344592002802338650002502366650002202391650001502413650001502428650001202443650002502455650001602480650002002496650001102516650000902527650002502536650001702561650002502578651001002603653001802613653002302631653001402654653003002668653001702698700005202715700005902767700006102826700005802887773012302945856008803068852000903156655001203165IND60725383020221121014848.0210301e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072538302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.1083232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7293-888010aContrasting adaptive strategies by Caragana korshinskii and Salix psammophila in a semiarid revegetated ecosystem  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSalix psammophila and Caragana korshinskii are pioneer species used for revegetating farmlands on the Loess Plateau. Understanding the water-use strategies and physiological characteristics of these two species are important for evaluating their adaptability in water-limited ecosystems. We used stable isotopes (D and ¹⁸O), physiological parameters (e.g. midday and predawn leaf water potential and stomatal conductance (ψₘd, ψₚd and gₛ, respectively)) and foliar δ¹³C to analyse water sources, isohydric/anisohydric behaviour, and water-use efficiency (WUE), respectively, of these two shrub species. Our results show that S. psammophila relied on water (mean 60%) from the intermediate soil layer (30-80 cm from the surface) during the dry period (May and June), while C. korshinskii relied on water from the deep soil layer (80-100 cm) (mean 52%). Both species shifted to using water from the shallow layer (0-30 cm) during the wet period (July and August) (mean 61% for S. psammophila and 51% for C. korshinskii). These root water uptake patterns are consistent with C. korshinskii’s physiological performance, which in turn is consistent with a description that C. korshinskii is an anisohydric species as evidenced by a steeper slope of the relationship between ψₘd and ψₚd (σ, 1.88), and a larger difference between ψₘd and ψₚd (Δψ, -1.66 ± 0.10 MPa). In contrast, S. psammophila could be described as an isohydric species (0.82 for σ and -0.77 ± 0.02 MPa for Δψ). Surprisingly, despite being anisohydric, C. korshinski showed greater long-term WUE than isohydric S. psammophila, particularly during the dry season. Insofar as water availability is concerned, these results show that the environmental adaptability of C. korshinskii may generally be more ecologically plastic than that of S. psammophila. Our study serves as a reference for evaluating the persistence of shrub species in relation to the management and restoration of ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaragana korshinskii 3aSalix psammophila 3adry season 3aecosystems 3aforests 3aleaf water potential 3ameteorology 3apioneer species 3ashrubs 3asoil 3astomatal conductance 3awater uptake 3awater use efficiency 3aChina 0aLoess plateau 0aWater-use strategy 0a18O and D 0aIso/anisohydric behaviour 0aFoliar δ13C1 aWang, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2697-48021 aKnighton, James1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4162-996X1 aEvaristo, Jaivime1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1387-229X1 aWassen, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9735-21030 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 300 p.108323-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.1083233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02106naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009600160300002000256520099200276592002801268650001101296650002201307650001901329650001101348650002401359650001501383650001901398650001301417650000801430700002401438700002201462700001801484700002201502773012501524856007401649852000901723655001201732IND60665721820221119222212.0190912e20140909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066572182DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra03800b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRothballer, Jan10aOrigin and effect of In–Sn ordering in InSnCo₃S₂: a neutron diffraction and DFT study  ap. 42183-42189.  aThe solid solution In₂₋ₓSnₓCo₃S₂ is attractive due to a variety of interesting properties depending on the In/Sn content, i.e. half metal ferromagnetic Sn₂Co₃S₂, low dimensional metal In₂Co₃S₂, and semiconducting thermoelectric InSnCo₃S₂. For the latter, crystal structure effects and a metal to insulator transition are not only related to electron counting but also to ordering of In and Sn within and between Co Kagomé nets. These observations have not been adequately understood to date. The degree of ordering is now evaluated from neutron diffraction data to distinguish In and Sn. The origin and effects on crystal and electronic structures are studied by DFT calculations on a superstructure model. Relations of local bonding (electron localization function ELF and Bader's AIM theory), In/Sn site preference, crystal structure distortions, and the opening of the gap are explored. Results are generalised from predictions on isoelectronic compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3acobalt 3acrystal structure 3aferromagnetism 3amodels 3aneutron diffraction 3aprediction 3asemiconductors 3asulfides 3atin1 aBachhuber, Frederik1 aRommel, Stefan M.1 aSöhnel, Tilo1 aWeihrich, Richard0 tRSC advances.g2014 Sept. 09, v. 4, no. 79 p.42183-42189dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra03800b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245008900198300001600287500002000303520156600323592002801889596005201917650002901969650002001998650001402018650002102032650000902053650002402062650001202086650001202098650002502110650000902135700001802144700001802162700002002180773011002200856007302310852000902383655001202392IND60747099220221122231943.0210811e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074709922DNAL7 a10.1111/eth.132092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichardson, Jon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5839-931510aAdjustment of egg laying by both hosts and intraspecific brood parasites in a beetle  ap. 720-730.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBrood parasites lay their eggs in the nests of other females, thereby shifting the costs of offspring care onto others. Given that care is costly, potential hosts should evolve mechanisms to avoid brood parasitism. Meanwhile, brood parasites should evolve mechanisms to circumvent host defences. Here we investigate whether hosts or intraspecific brood parasites adjust their egg laying behaviour as a mechanism to reduce or increase the effectiveness of brood parasitism. We use the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides as our study system, in which hosts and brood parasites lay their eggs in the soil around a carcass controlled by the host. To test whether females adjust their egg laying behaviour when breeding as a host or brood parasite, we used an experimental design with three treatments: hosts, where focal females bred alongside a smaller female; brood parasites, where focal females bred alongside a larger female; and controls, where focal females bred alone. We used focal females from a narrowly defined size range to control for potential effects of body size. We found that hosts delayed the start of egg laying, which may allow them to recognise brood parasitic offspring that arrive too early. Meanwhile, brood parasites laid their eggs over an extended period, which may increase the chances that their egg laying overlapped with the host. Our results suggest that adjusting egg laying behaviour is a mechanism used by both hosts and brood parasites that may contribute to the differences in reproductive success shown in prior studies.  aPublisher supplied data  aL002558/1cNatural Environment Research Council 3aNicrophorus vespilloides 3aanimal behavior 3abody size 3abrood parasitism 3aeggs 3aexperimental design 3afemales 3aprogeny 3areproductive success 3asoil1 aDobson, Sarah1 aFord, Lucy E.1 aSmiseth, Per T.0 tEthology.g2021 Sept., v. 127, no. 9 p.720-730dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39008x0179-16137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eth.132093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245015500163300001800318500001900336520141800355592002801773650002201801650002101823650002301844650001801867650002501885650001501910650002801925650001001953650001201963650002101975650001701996650001902013653001802032653001402050653001602064653001302080700002302093700001902116700002002135700002102155700001702176700001802193773018402211856007502395852000902470655001202479IND60692032920221119095835.0200502e20040101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069203292DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.68.15572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTAGUCHI, Hidenori10aCloning of the Ruminococcus albus cel5D and cel9A Genes Encoding Dockerin Module-containing Endoglucanases and Expression of cel5D in Escherichia coli  ap. 1557-1564.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAn EcoRI chromosomal DNA fragment of Ruminococcus albus F-40 that conferred endoglucanase activity on Escherichia coli was cloned. An open reading frame (ORF1) and another incomplete reading frame (ORF2) were found in the EcoRI fragment. The ORF2 was completed using inverse PCR genome walking technique. ORF1 and ORF2, which confront each other, encoded cellulases belonging to families 5 and 9 of the glycoside hydrolases and were designated cel5D and cel9A respectively. The cel5D gene encodes 753 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 83,409. Cel5D consists of a signal peptide of 24 amino acids, a family-5 catalytic module, a dockerin module, and two family-4 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs). The cel9A gene encodes 936 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 104,174, consisting of a signal peptide, a family-9 catalytic module, a family-3 CBM, and a dockerin module. The catalytic module polypeptide (rCel5DCat) derived from Cel5D was constructed, expressed, and purified from a recombinant E. coli. The truncated enzyme hydrolyzed cellohexaose, cellopentaose, and cellotetraose to yield mainly cellotriose and cellobiose with glucose as a minor product, but the enzyme was less active toward cellotriose and not active toward cellobiose, suggesting that this enzyme is a typical endoglucanase. rCel5DCat had a Km of 3.9 mg/ml and a Vmax of 37.2 μmol/min/mg for carboxymethycellulose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aEscherichia coli 3aRuminococcus albus 3abiotechnology 3acarbohydrate binding 3acellobiose 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3agenes 3aglucose 3amolecular weight 3apolypeptides 3asignal peptide 0aendoglucanase 0acellulase 0acellulosome 0adockerin1 aHagiwara, Daisuke,1 aGENMA, Tsutomu1 aKARITA, Shuichi1 aKimura, Tetsuya,1 aSAKKA, Kazuo1 aOHMIYA, Kunio0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2004 Jan. 1, v. 68, no. 7 p.1557-1564dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.68.15573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009000170300001600260520128800276592002801564650001501592650002201607650001301629650002401642650002101666650002601687650002901713650001801742650001901760650001301779650001701792653002601809653001601835653001801851653002201869653002201891700002101913700002201934700002001956773012501976856008502101852000902186655001202195IND60541200420221119203218.0190318e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054120042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2015.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReyes, José F.10aField testing of an automatic control system for variable rate fertilizer application  ap. 260-265.  aAn automatic system to control variable rate of fertilizer application was implemented and tested in an experimental spring wheat crop. The system included a micro-controller, a LCD display, a proportional flow control electro-valve, a rotational speed sensor and a hydraulic motor mounted on the shaft of the fertilizer dispenser of a drilling machine. The control software used a fertilizer rate prescription map previously determined from a map of soil fertility. The system was tested in a small field of 0.6ha using an experimental design of four randomized treatments and three repetitions. In order to develop the application rate map, 21 samples were previously taken for analysis of soil fertility. The treatments tested the application of a constant rate and variable rate of physical mixture (PM) of 16% of N and 42% of P, and a constant rate and variable rate of Basacote Starter® (BS), which is a controlled release fertilizer. The amount of fertilizer used in the field was measured and compared in each case with the prescribed rate for spatial resolutions of 1m, 2m, 3m, 4m and 5m and a width of 3.5m. The error of application rate was between 20% and 29% at 1m resolution and decreased to values between 12% and 14% at 5m resolution for the whole set of treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3acomputer software 3adrilling 3aexperimental design 3afertilizer rates 3afield experimentation 3aslow-release fertilizers 3asoil analysis 3asoil fertility 3asoil map 3aspring wheat 0aPrecision agriculture 0aFertilizing 0aVariable rate 0aAutomatic control 0aPrescription maps1 aEsquivel, Wilson1 aCifuentes, Daniel1 aOrtega, Rodrigo0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2015 Apr., v. 113 p.260-265dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2015.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015100157300002000308520136800328592002801696650002601724650002201750650002101772650002101793650002701814650001101841650001301852650001601865650001701881650001301898650001701911700001201928700001601940700002401956700002101980700001902001700002402020700001502044700002002059700002102079700002002100700001902120700001802139700002002157773014302177856007402320852000902394655001202403IND60671222720221120182135.0191002e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067122272DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta06501a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Deping10aModulating molecular aggregation by facile heteroatom substitution of diketopyrrolopyrrole based small molecules for efficient organic solar cells  ap. 24349-24357.  aIn conjugated polymers and small molecules of organic solar cells, aggregation induced by intermolecular interactions governs the performance of photovoltaics. However, little attention has been paid to the connection between molecular structure and aggregation within solar cells based on soluble small molecules. Here we demonstrate modulation of intermolecular aggregation of two synthesized molecules through heteroatom substitution to develop an understanding of the role of aggregation in conjugated molecules. Molecule 1 (M1) based on 2-ethylhexyloxy-benzene substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTP) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) displays strong aggregation in commonly used organic solvents, which is reduced in molecule 2 (M2) by facile oxygen atom substitution on the BDTP unit confirmed by absorption spectroscopy and optical microscopy, while it successfully maintains molecular planarity and favorable charge transport characteristics. Solar cells based on M2 exhibit more than double the photocurrent of devices based on M1 and yield a power conversion efficiency of 5.5%. A systematic investigation of molecular conformation, optoelectronic properties, molecular packing and crystallinity as well as film morphology reveals structure dependent aggregation responsible for the performance difference between the two conjugated molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical interactions 3acrystal structure 3aelectric current 3alight microscopy 3amolecular conformation 3aoxygen 3apolymers 3asolar cells 3asolar energy 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy1 aLiu, Bo1 aWang, Suhao1 aHimmelberger, Scott1 aLinares, Mathieu1 aVagin, Mikhail1 aMüller, Christian,1 aMa, Zaifei1 aFabiano, Simone1 aBerggren, Magnus1 aSalleo, Alberto1 aInganäs, Olle1 aZou, Yingping1 aZhang, Fengling0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 Dec. 1, v. 3, no. 48 p.24349-24357dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta06501a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245009300169500001900262520165800281592002801939650001201967650001501979650001601994650001202010650001602022650002302038650001402061650001602075650001002091650001702101650001502118650001502133653002402148653001402172653001802186653002002204653001602224700006402240773013702304856008802441852000902529655001202538IND60725383120221121015005.0210301e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072538312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.1083242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiri, Abbas14aThe effectiveness of a single Tamarix tree in reducing aeolian erosion in an arid region  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAlthough the effectiveness of windbreaks in reducing wind speed and sediment transport is highly dependent on the efficiency of individual elements, few field studies have evaluated the effectiveness of single plants typical of arid areas such as Tamarix. A series field experiments were conducted in the Niatak area of Sistan to assess the effectiveness of a single Tamarix tree in reducing wind speed and sediment flux. Wind speed was measured on five occasions at 32 positions around the tree and at heights of z/h = 0.13, 0.5, 1.1, and 2 (where h is the height of the tree). Sediment flux was measured over three dust storm events at 15 positions and at heights of z/h = 0.13, 0.5, 1.1, and 1.8. The results showed a reduction of wind speed and sediment flux of 80–90% at x/h = 1, decreasing to about 5–8% at x/h = 12. There was an acceleration of about 12–20% in wind speed and about 25–35% in sediment flux around the sides of the tree. The tree sheltered a zone of x/h = 7–9 downwind and the pattern of the sediment transport reduction closely conformed to that of the wind speed reduction. The greatest reduction of wind speed and sediment flux was observed on the leeside of the tree at x/h = 0.5 and, 1 and close to the ground surface. The results confirm the effectiveness of Tamarix trees in reducing wind speed and sediment flux, and thus its suitability as a potential control on erosion and sediment transport. Based on the results, designing a windbreak with an optimum inter-rows distance of x/h = 7 and inter-plant spacing of less than 0.5 h is suggested in order to provide maximum control of aeolian erosion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTamarix 3aarid zones 3adust storms 3aforests 3ameteorology 3asediment transport 3asediments 3atree height 3atrees 3awind erosion 3awind speed 3awindbreaks 0aSingle Tamarix tree 0aWindbreak 0aSediment flux 0aAeolian erosion 0aArid region1 aDavidson-Arnott, R.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3890-22910 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 300 p.108324-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.1083243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001300142245012800155300001400283520109200297592002801389650001901417650002001436650001401456650001101470650002601481650003001507650001001537650002101547650002101568650001201589650001901601650002801620650001301648700001901661700002101680700001801701700006001719700005901779773014201838856007601980852000902056655001202065IND60603294220221121045843.0180713e20180110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060329422DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b101072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yu10aHydroxide Ligands Cooperate with Catalytic Centers in Metal–Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction  ap. 38-41.  aConverting CO₂ into fuels via photochemical reactions relies on highly efficient and selective catalysts. We demonstrate that the catalytic active metal center can cooperate with neighboring hydroxide ligands to boost the photocatalytic CO₂ reduction. Six cobalt-based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with different coordination environments are studied at the same reaction condition (photosensitizer, electron donor, water/organic mixed solvent, and visible light). In pure CO₂ at 1.0 atm, the MOFs bearing μ-OH– ligands neighboring the open Co centers showed CO selectivities and turnover frequencies (TOFs) up to 98.2% and 0.059 s–¹, respectively. More importantly, their TOFs reduced only ca. 20% when the CO₂ partial pressure was reduced to 0.1 atm, while other MOFs reduced by at least 90%. Periodic density functional theory calculations and isotope tracing experiments showed that the μ-OH– ligands serve not only as strong hydrogen-bonding donors to stabilize the initial Co–CO₂ adduct but also local proton sources to facilitate the C–O bond breaking.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acobalt 3acoordination polymers 3adensity functional theory 3afuels 3ahydrogen bonding 3aisotope labeling 3aligands 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotosensitizing agents 3asolvents1 aHuang, Ning-Yu1 aShen, Jian-Qiang1 aLiao, Pei-Qin1 aChen, Xiao-ming,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3353-79181 aZhang, Jie-Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2614-27740 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Jan. 10, v. 140, no. 1 p.38-41dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b101073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013700163300001600300500001500316520142300331592002801754650002001782650001001802650003901812650004801851650002001899650001001919650002001929650001701949650001401966650002401980650001402004653003902018700002102057700001602078700001802094700001402112700001602126700001302142773010402155856004802259852000902307655001202316IND50062227920221123015508.0130324e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006222792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-011-0738-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Lihong14aThe Effects of Vital Wheat Gluten and Transglutaminase on the Thermomechanical and Dynamic Rheological Properties of Buckwheat Dough  ap. 561-569.  a2019-12-06  aThe improvement of the processing properties of gluten-free cereals is a challenging issue for cereal technologists. Vital wheat gluten (VWG), transglutaminase (TGase), or combinations of the two have been successfully used to improve the processing properties of food materials. In this study, a Mixolab system and a rheometer were used to investigate the effects of TGase on the thermomechanical and dynamic rheological properties of buckwheat flour dough (BF dough) and a buckwheat flour dough containing 15% VWG (BF-VWG dough). The results indicated that the addition of 1.0% TGase decreased the water absorption and significantly increased the stability, storage modulus (G′), and complex modulus (|G*|) of the BF dough. The presence of 15% VWG had a synergistic effect, enhancing the effectiveness of the TGase in improving the thermomechanical and dynamic rheological properties of the BF-VWG dough. Quantification of the free amino groups showed that the amino groups were more effectively bonded in the BF-VWG dough than in the BF dough when the TGase level exceeded 1.0%. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis confirmed that the TGase promoted the formation of protein complexes. These data indicate that the combination of VWG and TGase can be used to improve the properties of buckwheat flour for buckwheat-based food production.  aPublisher supplied data 3astorage modulus 3adough 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3afood processing 3aflour 3afood production 3awheat gluten 3asynergism 3agel electrophoresis 3abuckwheat 0aconfocal scanning laser microscopy1 aCheng, Yongqiang1 aQiu, Shuang1 aTatsumi, Eizo1 aShen, Qun1 aLu, Zhanhui1 aLi, Lite0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2013 Feb., v. 6, no. 2 p.561-569dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-011-0738-9  aDNAL 7aarticle01710naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245009100162300001800253500001900271520050600290592002800796650002100824650002500845650001800870650001500888650002300903650002600926653004200952653003100994653004601025700002101071773018401092856007501276852000901351655001201360IND60692033020221119095255.0200502e20040101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069203302DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.68.15652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMITANI, Nobuhito10aExpression of a Single-chain Antibody against Indole-3-acetic Acid in Escherichia coli  ap. 1565-1568.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA hybridoma cell line that produces a monoclonal antibody specific for indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was prepared.

The Fe₂O₃ nanospindles act as a sacrificial template to oxidize SnCl₂ to form a layer of SnO₂ on the original Fe₂O₃ core surface and the following hydrolysis of SnCl₄ on the as-generated SnO₂ further produces SnO₂ nanoparticles (NPs) to solidate the mh-SnO₂ shell, resulting in the formation of a hierarchical structure on the surface. The surface morphology of mh-SnO₂ NCs could be easily controlled by varying the synthesis parameters. The resulting mh-SnO₂ NCs possess superior lithium storage properties with an exceptionally good cycling performance and an excellent rate capability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aferric oxide 3ahydrolysis 3alithium 3ananoparticles 3aporous media 3aredox reactions 3atin dioxide1 aGuan, Bo1 aZhang, Lingyu1 aSu, Zhongmin1 aXie, Haiming1 aWang, Chungang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 Nov. 3, v. 3, no. 44 p.22021-22025dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta06521f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03538naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245011200173300001300285520158200298592002801880650002101908650001901929650001101948650000801959650001101967650001401978650002301992650001402015650001602029650001202045650002602057650001002083650001802093650002002111650001502131650001202146650000902158650002402167650002302191650001802214650001502232650002302247650001002270650001902280650001302299650002002312650002002332651001002352653003102362653001602393653002302409653003602432653002802468653002002496700002402516700002702540700001502567700002502582700002902607773012202636856008502758852000902843655001202852IND60541200520221119203053.0190318e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054120052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2015.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbrisqueta, Isabel10aStem water potential estimation of drip-irrigated early-maturing peach trees under Mediterranean conditions  ap. 7-13.  aIn the last decade deficit irrigation strategies allowed growers to deal with water shortages, while monitoring stem water potential (Ψstem) is deemed essential for maximising fruit yield and quality. However, because of the intensive labour involved in measuring Ψstem, alternative methods are desirable. The experiment described was conducted in Murcia (Spain) with adult peach trees (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch cv. Flordastar) submitted to different drip irrigation treatments, measuring Ψstem with a pressure chamber and the soil water content with a neutron probe. Agro-meteorological variables were recorded. Seasonal patterns of stem water potential provide a useful diagnostic tool for irrigation management in peach trees. Rainfall events and the meteorological conditions prevailing in autumn pointed to the resilient nature of the peach cultivar studied. Fitting Ψstem by linear regression analysis as a function of soil and atmosphere yielded a significant correlation, with the soil water content being the main contributor to estimating Ψstem. Linear regression analysis highlighted the importance of considering plant water status as a function of the peach tree cultivar, the atmospheric conditions in which it develops and the soil water conditions resulting from irrigation. A multiple linear regression equation based on soil water content in the soil profile, mean daily air vapour pressure deficit (VPDm) and growing degree hours (GDH) data explained 72% of the variance in Ψstem, and is proposed as an alternative to the field measurement of Ψstem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEarth atmosphere 3aPrunus persica 3aadults 3aair 3aautumn 3acultivars 3adeficit irrigation 3aequations 3afruit yield 3agrowers 3airrigation management 3alabor 3alinear models 3amicroirrigation 3amonitoring 3apeaches 3arain 3aregression analysis 3aseasonal variation 3asoil profiles 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3atrees 3avapor pressure 3avariance 3awater potential 3awater shortages 3aSpain 0aDrip-irrigation management 0aPeach trees 0aSoil water content 0aStem water potential estimation 0aVapour pressure deficit 0aWater relations1 aConejero, Wenceslao1 aValdés-Vela, Mercedes1 aVera, Juan1 aOrtuño, Ma Fernanda1 aRuiz-Sánchez, Ma Carmen0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2015 June, v. 114 p.7-13dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2015.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245009200174300001400266520122000280592002801500650001101528650002001539650001701559650002001576650003701596650001201633650001901645650001001664650001101674650003601685651001401721653002101735653002101756653002101777653002901798653002701827653001301854653001101867653001401878653001201892653001101904653001201915700002101927773011401948856008202062852000902144655001202153IND60621438720221118040046.0181117s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062143872DNAL7 a10.1177/15648265020233S1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeurenberg-Yap, Mabel10aValidity of Deuterium Oxide Dilution for the Measurement of Body Fat among Singaporeans  ap. 34-37.  aBody fat percent (BF%) was measured in 108 adult Chinese, 76 Malays, and 107 Indians in Singapore by densitometry, deuterium oxide dilution (hydrometry), dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and a chemical four-compartment model (BF%4c). The hydration of the fat-free mass (FFM) was calculated. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 69 years and their body mass index ranged from 16 to 40 kg/m². BF%4c for the various subgroups were: Chinese females (33.5 ± 7.5%), Chinese males (24.4 ± 6.1%), Malay females (37.8 ± 6.3%), Malay males (26.0 ± 7.6%), Indian females (38.2 ± 7.0%) and Indian males (28.1 ± 5.5%). Biases were found between BF%4c and BF% measured by 2-compartment models (hydrometry, densitometry, DXA), with systematic underestimation by DXA and densitometry. On a group level hydrometry had the lowest bias while DXA gave the highest bias. When validated against BF%4c, 2-compartment models were found to be unsuitable for accurate measures of body fat due to high biases at the individual level and the violation of assumptions of constant hydration of FFM and density FFM among the ethnic groups. On a group level the best 2-compartment model for measuring body fat was found to be hydrometry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abody mass index 3adensitometry 3adeuterium oxide 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3afemales 3alean body mass 3amales 3amodels 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aSingapore 0abody composition 0abody fat percent 0atotal body water 0adeuterium oxide dilution 0afour compartment model 0avalidity 0aethnic 0aSingapore 0aChinese 0aMalays 0aIndians1 aDeurenberg, Paul0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 23, no. 3_suppl1 p.34-37dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/15648265020233S1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006400139245009000203300001600293500002000309520195400329592002802283596008802311650002702399650002002426650001502446650002002461650001102481650001102492700002502503700002302528700002302551700005902574773011002633856007302743852000902816655001202825IND60747099420221122222209.0210811e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074709942DNAL7 a10.1111/eth.132052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorgeaud, Christèle1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4029-840610aVervet monkeys socialize more when time budget constraints are experimentally reduced  ap. 682-696.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn species that live in stable groups, successful management of time budget (i.e., the proportion of time involved in different behaviours) and social relationships has been proposed to be a key variable affecting individual fitness. Such management is limited by time constraints, which are group size and season dependancy. However, the link between time budget constraints and grooming patterns as a means to service social relationships has never been studied experimentally. Here, we reduced the time constraints of three wild vervet monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops pygerythrus) groups by offering them high quality food for 60 min in the morning. We conducted 10 trials in summer and 10 trials in winter. We found that vervet monkeys indeed reduced the proportion of time spent foraging during the rest of those days compared to control days and increased the proportion of grooming time spread over more bouts. Individuals that did not get access to the food still participated as much in grooming as those that did eat. In accordance with our expectations, social network analysis revealed a larger grooming network on supplementation days: vervet monkeys used their extra time to socialize with more different group members. Furthermore, following our predictions, the effect of provisioning was usually stronger during the winter season (when food was scarce and days shorter) than during the summer, and the number of conflicts decreased during supplementation days. Finally, despite the fact that adults and juveniles of all three groups increased their proportion of time spent grooming during supplementation days, few group and age differences emerged in the way vervet monkeys manage their time budget. Interestingly, some of these differences seem to be independent of group size. In conclusion, vervet monkeys seize the opportunity to increase the proportion of time spent in social behaviours if time budget constraints are reduced.  aPublisher supplied data  cSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&#x00F6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung 3aCercopithecus aethiops 3aanimal behavior 3agroup size 3asocial networks 3asummer 3awinter1 aJankowiak, Béatrice1 aAellen, Mélisande1 aDunbar, Robin I.M.1 aBshary, Redouan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7198-84720 tEthology.g2021 Sept., v. 127, no. 9 p.682-696dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39008x0179-16137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eth.132053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02964naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015600167300001600323520155300339592002801892650002701920650001001947650001301957650001901970650001701989650002502006650001902031650001402050650001002064650002202074650001502096650001502111650000902126650002302135650002202158650002502180650001602205650001402221650002002235700002302255700001802278773010802296856008102404852000902485655001202494IND60114252420221120221416.0141118e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011425242DNAL7 a10.1007/s13127-014-0177-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArbabi, Tayebeh10aMitochondrial evidence for genetic diversity and low phylogeographic differentiation in the Marsh Warbler Acrocephalus palustris (Aves: Acrocephalidae)  ap. 409-417.  aWe analyzed the levels of genetic variability in a long-distance migratory reed warbler, the Marsh Warbler Acrocephalus palustris, by using nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI; 611 nucleotides [nt]). We obtained sequences from 229 individuals from ten sampling sites that include breeding, wintering, and migrating birds. Overall, 44 haplotypes were detected, which reflect high levels of genetic variation in this species, but most of this variation corresponds to individual differences within collecting sites. We also analyzed 829 nt of cytochrome b (cyt b) from 49 selected individuals of different sampling sites to evaluate the reliability of the COI results. Our analyses based on both mtDNA loci could not detect any population subdivision or phylogeographic structure, indicating high levels of gene flow between breeding sites (Nm = 13.69). The split between the Marsh Warbler and its sister species, the Eurasian Reed Warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus, could be dated for the Lower Pliocene (about 3.8 million years ago). The time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) among Marsh Warbler haplotypes was estimated as 0.45 million years, indicating their bottleneck during the last glacial periods. Low nucleotide diversity, a shallow phylogenetic tree, a star-like haplotype network, and a unimodal mismatch distribution point to a sudden increase of the effective population size (probably after the last glaciation period) and a recent range expansion likely from a single refuge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcrocephalus palustris 3abirds 3abreeding 3abreeding sites 3acytochrome b 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3afounder effect 3agene flow 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3aglaciation 3ahaplotypes 3aloci 3amigratory behavior 3amitochondrial DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3anucleotides 3aphylogeny 3apopulation size1 aGonzález, Javier,1 aWink, Michael0 tOrganisms, diversity, & evolution.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 4 p.409-417dSpringer-Verlagx1439-60927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13127-014-0177-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245010800163300002000271520152700291592002801818650004401846650003501890650002601925650001601951650001601967650001201983650004401995650003102039650001902070650002102089650000902110700001502119700005802134700002102192700006302213773014902276856007602425852000902501655001202510IND60603294420221121045829.0180713e20171220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060329442DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b101122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlater, Benjamin10aMissing Linker Defects in a Homochiral Metal–Organic Framework: Tuning the Chiral Separation Capacity  ap. 18322-18327.  aEfficient chiral separation remains a very challenging task due to the identical physical and chemical properties of the enantiomers of a molecule. Enantiomers only behave differently from each other in the presence of other chiral species. Homochiral metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have received much attention for their promising enantioseparation properties. However, there are still challenges to overcome in this field such as high enantiomeric separation. Structural defects play an important role in the properties of MOFs and can significantly change the pore architecture. In this work, we introduced missing linker defects into a homochiral metal–organic framework [Zn₂(bdc)(l-lac)(dmf)] (ZnBLD; bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, l-lac = l-lactic acid, dmf = N,N′-dimethylformamide) and observed an increase in enantiomeric excess for 1-phenylethanol of 35% with the defective frameworks. We adjusted the concentration of monocarboxylic acid ligand l-lactic acid by varying the ratio of Zn²⁺ to ligand from 0.5 to 0.85 mmol. Additionally, a defective framework was synthesized with propanoic acid as modulator. In order to elucidate the correlation between defects and enantiomeric excess, five characterization techniques (FTIR, TGA, ¹H NMR, ICP, and PXRD) were employed. Full width at half-maximum analysis (fwhm) was performed on the powder X-ray diffraction traces and showed that the higher concentration of monocarboxylic acid MOFs were isostructural but suffered from increased fwhm values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acoordination polymers 3aenantiomers 3alactic acid 3aligands 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphysicochemical properties 3apropionic acid 3athermogravimetry 3azinc1 aWang, Zeru1 aJiang, Shanxue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3859-33451 aHill, Matthew R.1 aLadewig, Bradley P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2135-19130 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Dec. 20, v. 139, no. 50 p.18322-18327dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b101123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01604naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245007600167300001600243520053600259592002800795650001300823650001200836650001200848650001100860650001200871653002700883653003300910653002000943653001200963700002000975700002300995773015001018856007701168852000901245655001201254IND60522107620221121022850.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052210762DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1998-04082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTripathi, Upendra M13aAn Aluminium-Oxide-Isopropoxide Cluster with Peripheral Ammonia Ligands  ap. 434-437.  aThe reaction of toluene solutions of aluminium isopropoxide with ammonia gas, without exclusion of moisture, affords high yields of a decanuclear aluminium-oxide-isopropoxide-ammonia cluster of the composition [Al₁₀O₆(OiPr)₁₈(NH₃)₈].

To monitor the internal flow rate, ensuring it remains at an acceptable level and maintains the desired capture zone size in the aquifer, Point Velocity Probes (PVPs) were adapted for the task. The modified PVP was assessed for its performance in a mock-HRX Well setting, which consisted of a laboratory sand column, similar in diameter to the HRX Well cartridges that would house the PVP in the field, with flow directed along the longitudinal axis of the probe. Experiments were conducted to assess 1) the effects of friction between the fluid and the probe surface, which could bias a velocity measurement low, and 2) the effect of gas in the porous medium, potentially generated by some reactive media, on PVP signals and measurements of velocity. It was determined that PVP length exerted no discernable effect on the quality of the PVP performance. However, the effects of gas in the porous medium were varied. Compared to velocity estimates assuming a fully saturated porous medium, the bias to velocity measurements was negative if gas was limited to locations near a PVP's injection-detection array, such as might occur by inadvertent bubble injection during the tracer pulses. The bias was positive if the gas was generated uniformly throughout the porous medium, such as might occur in a reactive porous medium like granular iron, or one featuring vigorous biological activity. A field trial of the HRX Well was subsequently undertaken with internal PVPs. The PVPs identified a missing seal that was later retrofit, and documented flow in the HRX Well at velocities in the range of 1.3 to 4.0 m/d, which compared well with expectations based on a site model that predicted velocities of 1.3 to 2.3 m/d. The results of this study demonstrate that HRX Wells perform hydraulically as designed, and that PVPs are effective devices for tracking flow rates within them in near real-time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abioactive properties 3afield experimentation 3afriction 3agroundwater 3airon 3amodels 3aporous media 3asand 3aseals 3avelocimetry 0aHRX Well 0aPoint velocity probe 0aPVP 0aPassive remediation 0aTrichloroethene 0aColumn testing 0aField experiment1 aDevlin, J.F.1 aOsorno, T.C.1 aDivine, Craig0 tJournal of contaminant hydrology.g2021 Mar., v. 238 p.103772-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl42311x0169-77227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2021.1037723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04020naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006700145245015400212300001800366500002000384520205000404592002802454596004502482596004502527596004502572596002602617596003902643650001502682650001502697650001902712650001902731650000902750650001202759650003902771650002102810650001202831650002302843650001802866650000702884650002602891650000902917650001702926650002302943651001402966700002002980700007103000700006603071700006003137700006103197773012003258856007903378852000903457655001203466IND60747099620221122195710.0210811e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074709962DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.138532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartins, Catarina S.

However, CO₂ fertilization responses in field conditions have seldom included methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O), particularly in natural and mature forests, which are expected to have an important role in climate change mitigation. Herein, we aimed to capture the effect of elevated CO₂ (eCO₂; ambient vs. +150 ppm) on long‐term temporal dynamics of CH₄ and N₂O fluxes, followed by identification of climo‐edaphic factors explaining feedback responses. To achieve this, continuous monitoring of greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes using a manual chamber technique, over a 3‐year period was implemented in a mature dryland Eucalypt forest FACE (EucFACE) facility in Australia. The relationship between CH₄ and N₂O fluxes with rainfall indices and soil properties was also explored since they directly impact the microbial communities in the soil responsible for CH₄ and N₂O net emissions. Our results showed that in 3 years of eCO₂ treatment, the amount and frequency of rainfall predicted GHG emissions in this native forest. We also found a significant reduction in CH₄ sink (15%–25%) for some of the years as well as an overall treatment effect index reduction in N₂O emissions under eCO₂. Higher frequency of rain events with lower intensity led to highest CH₄ sink followed by lowest N₂O emissions due to fewer wet–dry cycles. Of all the environmental variables included, soil moisture, rainfall and pH were the main predictors of net CH₄ and N₂O emissions. Methane flux was also strongly influenced by soil texture. Our findings highlight the need to account for reduced forest CH₄ sink under eCO₂ in dryland ecosystems, which has implications for GHG budget predictions under future climate conditions.

However, traditional stem cell-based gene therapies are hampered by our current inability to control when the therapeutic genes are actually turned on, thereby resulting in detrimental side effects. Here, we report the novel application of magnetic core–shell nanoparticles for the dual purpose of delivering and activating a heat-inducible gene vector that encodes TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs). By combining the tumor tropism of the AD-MSCs with the spatiotemporal MCNP-based delivery and activation of TRAIL expression, this platform provides an attractive means with which to enhance our control over the activation of stem cell-based gene therapies. In particular, we found that these engineered AD-MSCs retained their innate ability to proliferate, differentiate, and, most importantly, home to tumors, making them ideal cellular carriers. Moreover, exposure of the engineered AD-MSCS to mild magnetic hyperthermia resulted in the selective expression of TRAIL from the engineered AD-MSCs and, as a result, induced significant ovarian cancer cell death in vitro and in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3aanimal ovaries 3acell death 3afever 3agene therapy 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3aligands 3ananoparticles 3aovarian neoplasms 3astem cells 0aMagnetic core–shell nanoparticles 0aHyperthermia 0aStem cell therapy 0aGene therapy 0aCancer therapy1 aShah, Shreyas1 aPasquale, Nicholas J.1 aGarbuzenko, Olga B.1 aMinko, Tamara1 aLee, Ki-Bum0 tBiomaterials.g2016 Mar., v. 81 p.46-57dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.11.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03367naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002100188245006900209300001200278506007600290520157000366592002801936506003701964650002702001650002102028650001502049650001702064650001802081650002202099650002502121650001102146650001202157650002002169650001202189650002202201650003702223650001302260650004302273650003402316650002002350650001002370650001102380650002302391700001502414700001602429700002602445700002002471700002502491700001702516700002202533773013102555856008202686852000902768655001202777IND60574610620221207124601.0210514e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057461062DNAL7 a286837382pmid7 aPMC55011142pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-017-1860-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElyasiyan, Uriel10aAnti-diabetic activity of aerial parts of Sarcopoterium spinosum  ap. 356.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Sarcopoterium spinosum (S. spinosum) is used by Bedouin medicinal practitioners for the treatment of diabetes. While the anti-diabetic activity of S. spinosum root extract was validated in previous studies, the activity of aerial parts of the same plants has not been elucidated yet. The aim of this study was to clarify the glucose lowering properties of the aerial parts of the shrub. METHODS: Anti-diabetic properties were evaluated by measuring the activity of carbohydrate digesting enzymes, glucose uptake into 3 T3-L1 adipocytes, and insulin secretion. Insulin signaling cascade was followed in L6 myotubes using Western blot and PathScan analysis. RESULTS: Activity of α-amylase and α-glucosidase was inhibited by extracts of all S. spinosum organs. Basal and glucose-induced insulin secretion was measured in Min6 cells and found to be enhanced as well. Glucose uptake was induced by all S. spinosum extracts, with roots found to be the most effective and fruits the least. The effect of S. spinosum on Akt phosphorylation was minor compared to insulin effect. However, GSK3β and PRAS40, which are downstream elements of the insulin cascade, were found to be highly phosphorylated by S. spinosum extracts. Inhibition of PI3K and Akt, but not AMPK and ERK, abrogated the induction of glucose uptake by the aerial parts of the shrub. CONCLUSION: The aerial organs of S. spinosum have anti-diabetic properties and may be used as a basis for the development of dietary supplements or to identify new agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSarcopoterium spinosum 3aWestern blotting 3aadipocytes 3aaerial parts 3aalpha-amylase 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aalternative medicine 3afruits 3aglucose 3aglycemic effect 3ainsulin 3ainsulin secretion 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amyotubes 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aroots 3ashrubs 3atau-protein kinase1 aNudel, Adi1 aSkalka, Nir1 aRozenberg, Konstantin1 aDrori, Elyashiv1 aOppenheimer, Rachela1 aKerem, Zohar1 aRosenzweig, Tovit0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2017 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.356-356dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-017-1860-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01477naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245008100159300001800240500001400258520029300272592002800565650002000593650001800613650001600631650001300647653001300660653001200673653002400685653002100709700001700730700001600747700001600763700002200779700002200801773018400823856007501007852000901082655001201091IND60692033520221119095210.0200502e20040101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069203352DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.68.15842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSHI, Qing-Wen10aNew 2(3→20)Abeotaxane and 3,11-Cyclotaxane from Needles of Taxus cuspidata  ap. 1584-1587.  aNAL-light  aTwo new taxoid metabolites, 2α,7β,10β-triacetoxy-5α,13α-dihydroxy-2(3→20)abeotaxa-4(20),11-dien-9-one (1) and 2α-acetoxy-5α-cinnamoyloxy-9α,10β-dihydroxy-3,11-cyclotax-4(20)-en-13-one (2), were isolated from the methanol extract of needles of the Japanese yew, Taxus cuspidata.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaxus cuspidata 3abiotechnology 3ametabolites 3amethanol 0aTaxaceae 0aneedles 0a2(3→20)abeotaxane 0a3,11-cyclotaxane1 aLI, Zuo-Ping1 aZhao, Ding,1 aGU, Ji-Shun1 aORITANI, Takayuki1 aKiyota, Hiromasa,0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2004 Jan. 1, v. 68, no. 7 p.1584-1587dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.68.15843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03599naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001700160245011600177300001800293520216300311592002802474650002102502650001802523650002002541650002102561650001502582650000702597650001602604650002802620650003402648650001202682650002502694650000902719650002902728650003302757650002402790650002802814650004602842700001502888700001802903700001302921773010502934856008103039852000903120655001203129IND4477018820221120165653.0120502e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447701882DNAL7 a219340112pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2011-014822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngel, C. R.10aEffects of a monocomponent protease on performance and protein utilization in 7- to 22-day-old broiler chickens  ap. 2281-2286.  aA study was conducted with an exogenous monocomponent protease added to corn–soybean meal diets fed to straight-run Ross 708 broilers from 7 to 22 d of age. Broilers were randomly placed into 42 battery pens (5 birds/pen) and allocated to 6 treatments with 7 replicates. A positive control diet (PC; 22.5% CP) and a low protein basal diet (20.5% CP) were formulated. Low protein diets (LP) comprised 98.67% of low protein basal diet and 1.33% Celite (indigestible marker and filler; Celite Corp., Lompoc, CA). Protease [75,000 PROT units/g; 1 PROT unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that releases 1 µmol of p-nitroaniline from 1 µM of substrate (Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroaniline per minute at pH 9.0 and 37°C] was added at the expense of Celite (0 mg/kg, LP0; 100 mg/kg, LP100; 200 mg/kg, LP200; 400 mg/kg, LP400; and 800 mg/kg, LP800) to create the LP diets (20.25% CP). At 22 d of age, ileal contents were collected from all birds for apparent CP and amino acid (AA) digestibility determinations. Broilers fed the PC diet were 7.5% heavier (P < 0.05) compared with those fed the LP0 diet. Birds fed the LP diets containing protease regardless of concentration grew as well as the birds fed the PC diet. Feed conversion was impaired (P < 0.05) in birds fed the LP0 and the LP100 diets compared with those fed the PC diet, but no difference was found between birds fed the PC diet and those fed diets containing more protease (LP200, LP400, and LP800). Digestibility of CP was increased (P < 0.05) in broilers fed the LP-supplemented diets compared with those fed either the PC or LP0 diets, but it was similar between those fed LP diets with any protease concentration. Digestibility of AA was not different between the PC and LP0 diets. The protease used in this study restored live performance and digestibility of CP (6.1%). When benefits in AA digestibility occurred, they were similar at all protease inclusions and averaged as follows: Arg, 3.5%; Ile, 3.2%; Lys, 5.4%; Thr, 7.8%; Asp, 6.5%; His, 3.3%; Cys, 4.6%; and Ser, 5.5%. Methionine was increased only at 400 and 800 mg/kg (6.5%) and Val was increased only at 200 and 800 mg/kg (5%).  aPublisher supplied data 3abroiler chickens 3adigestibility 3afeed conversion 3alow protein diet 3amethionine 3apH 3aproteinases 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aAniline Compoundsxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aChickensxphysiology 2aDiet 2aDiet, Protein-Restricted 2aDietary Proteinsxmetabolism 2aDietary Supplements 2aDigestionxdrug effects 2aSerine Proteasesxadministration & dosage1 aSaylor, W.1 aVieira, S.

In normal digestion 20% to 40% of the ingested ¹³C label is recovered in breath CO₂. We aimed to identify the proportions of ingested label excreted in stool as well as breath following ingestion of ¹³C-MTG by children with impaired exocrine pancreatic function and healthy controls. ¹³C enrichment of breath samples was measured by continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) and the cumulative percent dose recovered (cPDR) in 10 hours was calculated. Total ¹³C of a fecal fat extract from each stool was measured by combustion-IRMS, and ¹³C enrichment and concentration of the tert.-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) derivative of octanoic acid was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) after hydrolysis of the fat extract. Stool 5-day cPDR was calculated. Mean breath cPDR was 33% for children with cystic fibrosis and 45% for controls. Mean cPDR in stool by combustion-IRMS and GC/MS, respectively, was 0.7% and 0.3% for children with cystic fibrosis and 1.4 and 4.2% for controls.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreath tests 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3achildren 3acystic fibrosis 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrolysis 3aisotope labeling 3alipid metabolism 3anutrient intake 3aoctanoic acid 3astable isotopes 3atriacylglycerols 0amixed triacylglycerol breath test 0aMTG 0astable isotope 0a13C breath test 0achildren with cystic fibrosis1 aLing, Simon1 aPreston, Thomas1 aWeaver, Lawrence0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 23, no. 3_suppl1 p.48-52dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/15648265020233S1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01908naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245003700167300001400204520089300218592002801111650001301139650001301152650001401165650002401179650001801203650001801221650000901239653002001248653002201268653001201290653002101302700001801323773011401341856008201455852000901537655001201546IND60621439120221118040249.0181117s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062143912DNAL7 a10.1177/15648265020233S1102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, Heinz14aThe Future of ¹³C-Breath Tests  ap. 53-56.  a¹³C-breath tests are widely applied as a tool to investigate metabolic processes and infectious diseases, but most of them have not yet entered into clinical practice. In order to promote the introduction of more ¹³C-breath tests into clinical routine application we evaluated the tests so far known with respect to some reasonable criteria, which are valued by one of three marks. The sum Σ of these marks is assumed as a measure of the total value of the respective ¹³C-breath test. In this way we arrived at 10 tests with a Σ value of 10 or more points which seem to have an especially high potential to successfully enter into clinical practice. This is particularly true for the ¹³C-breath tests with urea, aminopyrine, acetate, galactose, caffeine, octanoic acid, and phenylalanine as substrates. Measures are proposed for promoting the clinical application of such tests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3acaffeine 3agalactose 3ainfectious diseases 3aoctanoic acid 3aphenylalanine 3aurea 0a13C-breath test 0amedical diagnosis 0adisease 0adigestive system1 aWetzel, Klaus0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 23, no. 3_suppl1 p.53-56dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/15648265020233S1103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245009000167500001900257520132600276592002801602650001701630650001201647650001701659650001301676650001301689650001001702650001201712650001701724650001101741650001701752650001501769650001601784650002901800650001801829653002301847653002101870653001501891653002501906653001001931653001001941700005301951773012302004856008402127852000902211655001202220IND60725383720221121022730.0210503e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072538372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2021.1533652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Lingtong10aMale gametophyte development in flowering plants: A story of quarantine and sacrifice  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOver 160 years ago, scientists made the first microscopic observations of angiosperm pollen. Unlike in animals, male meiosis in angiosperms produces a haploid microspore that undergoes one asymmetric division to form a vegetative cell and a generative cell. These two cells have distinct fates: the vegetative cell exits the cell cycle and elongates to form a tip-growing pollen tube; the generative cell divides once more in the pollen grain or within the growing pollen tube to form a pair of sperm cells. The concept that male germ cells are less active than the vegetative cell came from biochemical analyses and pollen structure anatomy early in the last century and is supported by the pollen transcriptome data of the last decade. However, the mechanism of how and when the transcriptional repression in male germ cells occurs is still not fully understood. In this review, we provide a brief account of the cytological and metabolic differentiation between the vegetative cell and male germ cells, with emphasis on the role of temporary callose walls, dynamic nuclear pore density, transcription repression, and histone variants. We further discuss the intercellular movement of small interfering RNA (siRNA) derived from transposable elements (TEs) and reexamine the function of TE expression in male germ cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngiospermae 3acallose 3agametophytes 3ahaploidy 3ahistones 3amales 3ameiosis 3anuclear pore 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3aquarantine 3aspermatozoa 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 0aPollen development 0aMale gametophyte 0aGerm cells 0aTransposable element 0asiRNA 0aLAT521 aWang, Tai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2752-697X0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2021 Mar.,  Apr., v. 258-259 p.153365-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2021.1533653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245014600171300001800317500001500335520098900350592002801339650001401367650001201381650001501393650002101408650002301429650002101452650001301473650001301486650002601499650001201525653002501537700001801562700002201580700002101602700001801623700001801641700001701659773013701676856005501813852000901868655001201877IND4468809720221123034605.0120815e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446880972DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2012.03060.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuley, Esmeray14aThe impact of applying natural clinoptilolite (zeolite) on the chemical, sensory and microbiological changes of vacuum packed sardine fillets  ap. 1977-1985.  a2019-12-06  aDifferent doses (1% and 5%) of natural zeolite were applied to determine quality changes in vacuum packaged sardine fillets during 19 days at 4 ± 1 °C. Zeolite had an effect to improve sensory quality of sardine especially for removing off‐odour. The acceptable shelf life of vacuum packaged sardine was 8 days for control and 12 days for groups treated with 1% and 5% zeolite. The zeolite application resulted in significant reduction in total volatile basic nitrogen values, except for group treated with 5% zeolite at 15 days. Although the effect of zeolite depended on dose and specific storage days, application of zeolite had no effect on free fatty acid analysis. The use of zeolite significantly reduced ammonia and biogenic amine accumulation, especially for histamine and tyramine. The result of the study showed that the efficacy of zeolite as natural antimicrobials was high and lower dose of zeolite has to be applied to get maximum preservation effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahistamine 3aammonia 3ashelf life 3afree fatty acids 3asensory properties 3avacuum packaging 3azeolites 3asardines 3aanti-infective agents 3afillets 0aantimicrobial agents1 aOzogul, Fatih1 aDurmuş, Mustafa,1 aGokdogan, Saadet1 aKacar, Cigdem1 aOzogul, Yesim1 aUcar, Yilmaz0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2012 Sept., v. 47, no. 9 p.1977-1985dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2012.03060.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245015600155300002000311520160900331592002801940650001701968650001601985650001402001650001402015650002002029650001702049650001602066650000902082650001302091650001102104650001302115650001402128650000702142650001502149650003302164650001702197650001602214700001702230700001902247700001902266773014302285856007402428852000902502655001202511IND60671223420221120202029.0191002e20151103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067122342DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta06563a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOh, Wen-Da12aA novel quasi-cubic CuFe₂O₄–Fe₂O₃ catalyst prepared at low temperature for enhanced oxidation of bisphenol A via peroxymonosulfate activation  ap. 22208-22217.  aA facile eco-friendly co-precipitation synthesis at low temperature was employed to fabricate CuFe₂O₄–Fe₂O₃ for the oxidation of bisphenol A (BPA) via peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. The formation mechanism of CuFe₂O₄–Fe₂O₃ at low temperature is proposed. The FESEM and BET characterization studies revealed that the CuFe₂O₄–Fe₂O₃ catalyst has a quasi-cubic morphology and specific surface area of 63 m² g⁻¹. The performance of CuFe₂O₄–Fe₂O₃ as a PMS activator was compared with those of other catalysts and the results indicated that the performance was in the following order: CuFe₂O₄–Fe₂O₃ > CuFe₂O₄ > CoFe₂O₄ > CuBi₂O₄ > CuAl₂O₄ > Fe₂O₃ > MnFe₂O₄. A kinetic model with mechanistic consideration of the influence of pH, PMS dosage and catalyst loading was developed to model the degradation of BPA. The intrinsic rate constant (kᵢ) was obtained from the kinetic study. The relationship between the pseudo first-order rate constant and kᵢ was established. The trend of kᵢ revealed that increasing the catalyst loading decreased the BPA removal rate due to the initial preferential production of the weaker radical (i.e. SO₅˙⁻) for BPA degradation and Fe²⁺ quenching of SO₄˙⁻ at higher catalyst loading. The influence of water matrix species (i.e. Cl⁻, NO₃⁻, HCO₃⁻, PO₄³⁻ and humic acid) on the BPA degradation rate was also investigated. The CuFe₂O₄–Fe₂O₃ catalyst exhibited excellent stability and can be reused several times without significant deterioration in performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abicarbonates 3abisphenol A 3acatalysts 3achlorides 3acoprecipitation 3aferric oxide 3ahumic acids 3airon 3akinetics 3amodels 3anitrates 3aoxidation 3apH 3aphosphates 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aDong, ZhiLi,1 aHu, Zhong-Ting1 aLim, Teik-Thye0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 Nov. 3, v. 3, no. 44 p.22208-22217dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta06563a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013500159300002000294520112400314592002801438650001101466650001101477650001501488650002201503650001901525650001101544650002601555650001801581650002201599650002301621650001301644650001701657650001901674650000901693700002001702700001701722700002101739700001801760773012401778856007401902852000901976655001201985IND60665722620221119220826.0190912e20140815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066572262DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra03913k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, Sudip K.10aSolution-processed reduced graphene oxide in light-emitting diodes and photovoltaic devices with the same pair of active materials  ap. 35493-35499.  aWe have introduced organic-dispersed reduced graphene oxides (rGO) in light-emitting diodes and photovoltaic devices. Both the devices were based on a conjugated polymer and inorganic nanoparticles. While we used a derivative of poly(para-phenylenevinylene) (MEH-PPV) as the organic semiconductor, zinc diffused copper indium disulphide (CIZS) quantum dots have been used as the inorganic counterpart that were based on nontoxic elements. We have shown that the device architecture in relation to rGO determines the functionality of a device based on the hybrid materials. A layer of rGO acted as a hole transport layer in MEH-PPV/CIZS heterojunction LEDs. On the other hand, the carbon allotrope added to MEH-PPV:CIZS bulk-heterojunction quenched photoluminescence of the components through a photoinduced electron-transfer process thereby dissociating photogenerated excitons yielding PV properties. The power conversion efficiency maximized at an optimum rGO concentration. The results show the role of reduced graphene oxides with the same pair of active materials in light-emitting diodes and photovoltaic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acopper 3adisulfides 3aelectron transfer 3agraphene oxide 3aindium 3alight emitting diodes 3ananoparticles 3aphotoluminescence 3aphotovoltaic cells 3apolymers 3aquantum dots 3asemiconductors 3azinc1 aBhaumik, Saikat1 aMaji, Tanmoy1 aMandal, Tarun K.1 aPal, Amlan J.0 tRSC advances.g2014 Aug. 15, v. 4, no. 67 p.35493-35499dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra03913k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006800147245009200215520113700307592002801444650002001472650002401492650001001516650001101526650001601537650001501553650001801568650000901586650001401595650001701609650001701626650001601643653002601659653001701685653001601702653001001718653002001728653000801748653000801756653000701764653000801771653000801779653001001787653001001797653001101807700005701818700001701875700002301892700005801915773012201973856008102095852000902176655001202185IND60730464120221118091828.0211030e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073046412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1112592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuerrero-Castillo, Pedro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0288-623110aAgro-industrial waste seeds from Peruvian Pouteria lucuma as new source of phytosterols  aPouteria lucuma fruit is commonly used to prepare desserts, but it is also sold as pulp or flour. Then, huge amounts of its seeds are produced as agro-industrial waste, frequently eliminated. This study aims at analyzing the presence of all metabolites in Pouteria lucuma seed oil (LSO) by GC-MS and GC-FID. Several compounds were tentatively identified, such as fatty acids, fatty alcohols, carotenes, phytosterols and tocopherols from LSO. A representative result was the high amount of β-sitosterol with 851.49 ± 1.29 mg/100 g of LSO, followed by stigmasterol with 75.42 ± 1.02 mg/100 g. Fatty acids with the highest content were oleic acid (13.57 ± 1.50 g/100 g of LSO), 9E-octadecenoic acid (6.85 ± 1.15 g/100 g of LSO), palmitic acid (5.44 ± 1.18 g/100 g of LSO) and stearic acid (2.12 ± 1.03 g/100 g of LSO). Therefore, metabolites tentatively identified in Pouteria lucuma seed oil have been linked to healthy properties based on a high amount of β-sitosterol present. This evidence could determine this agro-industrial waste with having beneficial properties, thus providing great added value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPouteria lucuma 3aagricultural wastes 3aflour 3afruits 3ametabolites 3aoleic acid 3apalmitic acid 3apulp 3aseed oils 3astearic acid 3astigmasterol 3atocopherols 0aAgro-industrial waste 0aPhytosterols 0aMetabolites 0aGC-MS 0aPouteria lucuma 0aHF1 0aHF2 0aHE 0aLSO 0aFAs 0aFAMEs 0aGC-MS 0aGC-FID1 aReyes, Sarita1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0311-26251 aAcha, Otilia1 aSepulveda, Beatriz1 aAreche, Carlos1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5246-13680 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 June, v. 144 p.111259-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1112593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005500145245011400200300001800314500002000332520118100352592002801533596004801561596003401609650002001643650002701663650001401690650001901704650001201723650001401735650001501749650001101764650001201775650001401787650001601801651001101817700006001828700006501888773012001953856007902073852000902152655001202161IND60747100020221118100140.0210811e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074710002DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.138462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Carl1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3285-037910aElevated temperatures drive the evolution of armour loss in the threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus  ap. 1735-1744.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWhile there is evidence of genetic and phenotypic responses to climate change, few studies have demonstrated change in functional traits with a known genetic basis. Here we present evidence for an evolutionary adaptive response to elevated temperatures in freshwater populations of the threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus. Using a unique set of historical data and museum specimens, in combination with contemporary samples, we fitted a Bayesian spatial model to identify a population‐level decline in the number of lateral bony plates, comprising anti‐predator armour, in multiple populations of sticklebacks over the last 91 years in Poland. Armor loss was predicted by elevated temperatures and is proposed to be a correlated response to selection for reduced body size. This study demonstrates a change in a functional trait of known genetic basis in response to elevated temperature, and illustrates the utility of the threespine stickleback as a model for measuring the evolutionary and ecological impacts of environmental change across the northern hemisphere.

Here, we report on the effects of the annealing temperature of solution-processed SnO₂ ESLs on the performance of perovskite solar cells. We find that the cells using low-temperature annealed SnO₂ (LT-SnO₂) ESLs outperform the cells using high-temperature annealed SnO₂ (HT-SnO₂) ESLs, exhibiting higher open circuit voltages and fill factors. Structural, electrical, optical, and electrochemical characterizations reveal the origin of the performance differences: LT-SnO₂ produces better film coverage, wider band gap, and lower electron density than that of HT-SnO₂. The confluence of these properties results in more effective transportation of electrons and blocking of holes, leading to lower interface recombination. Therefore, LT-SnO₂ ESLs are preferred for manufacturing perovskite solar cells on flexible substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrons 3alead 3amanufacturing 3asolar cells 3atemperature 3atin dioxide1 aZhao, Dewei1 aCimaroli, Alexander J.1 aGrice, Corey R.1 aQin, Pingli1 aLiu, Qin1 aXiong, Liangbin1 aYan, Yanfa1 aFang, Guojia0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 Nov. 24, v. 3, no. 47 p.24163-24168dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta06574g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01837naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245011600161300001800277500001900295520042400314592002800738650001500766650001800781650001200799650001400811650001500825650001700840650001600857650002000873650001300893653002100906653001600927653002000943653002300963653002300986700002101009700001801030700001901048700002301067700002101090773018401111856007501295852000901370655001201379IND60692033920221119095159.0200502e20040101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069203392DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.68.15982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKUMAGAI, Hitomi10aEnhanced Calcium Absorption in the Small Intestine by a Phytate-removed Deamidated Soybean Globulin Preparation  ap. 1598-1600.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSoybean globulins were deamidated after removing phytate using ion-exchange resins, and then hydrolyzed by digestive enzymes.

A continuous labeling experiment, followed by proteolytic digestion and MS analysis, generates a large amount of data, containing information on protein conformation and conformational dynamics. Lacking appropriate computational methods, information hidden inside the isotope distribution is often omitted and not extracted. In this work, a computational model is described to simulate the determined isotope pattern for each proteolytic peptide at each labeling time. Optimizing the model with experimental data yields conformational protection as well as protein unfolding/folding kinetics. With this method, complete extraction of protein dynamics information in the HDX–MS data is achieved. Information derived from the method is reliable as the model is mostly based on first-principles with very few assumptions. It is demonstrated that the protein dynamics information extracted from one or two labeling time points approaches or exceeds the information derived from an entire deuterium uptake time course by the traditional method. Application of the computational method to an IgG1 antibody under mild denaturing conditions indicates that the unfolding of each immunoglobulin domain can be explained by a simple two-state unfolding process, with different unfolding rate for each domain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abioinformatics 3acomputational methodology 3adeuterium 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aisotopes 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3apeptides 3aprotein unfolding 3aproteolysis0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Apr. 20, v. 92, no. 9 p.6486-6494dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b057243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245020800161300002000369520169000389592002802079650004402107650002202151650001402173650002402187650001202211650002602223650002202249650002302271650003702294650002102331650001202352650001302364650001302377650002202390650003302412650002102445650002102466650000902487650001502496700002202511773012402533856007402657852000902731655001202740IND60665722820221119220644.0190912e20140828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066572282DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra03928a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhullar, Sadhika10aNon-hydrothermal synthesis, structural characterization and thermochemistry of water soluble and neutral coordination polymers of Zn(ii) and Cd(ii): precursors for the submicron-sized crystalline ZnO/CdO  ap. 39204-39213.  aEight new water soluble and neutral one-dimensional, V-shaped coordination polymers (CPs) of Zn(ii) (1–4) and Cd(ii) (5–8) with a general formula of {[M₂(bpxa)₂(adc)₂]·xH₂O}ₙ (where M(ii) = Zn(ii) or Cd(ii); bpxa = N,N-bis(pyridylmethyl)alkyl amine; adc = acetylene dicarboxylate; x = 0 or 2) are reported. These are synthesized in good yields from the self-assembly reaction of M(OAc)₂ (where M = Zn or Cd), bpxa and the corresponding acid in methanol at ambient conditions. Based on the crystal structures of 1–3 and 6–8 by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies and a subtle change in the N-alkyl group in the tridentate ligands has provided structural diversity in these CPs with respect to binding differences of the adc linker and the presence (or absence) of π–π interactions as well as the presence (or absence) of lattice water molecules, which further shows hydrogen bonding interactions between the CP chains forming supramolecular networks. These features are unique for the CPs reported in this work. All these CPs are characterized by elemental analysis and FTIR spectroscopy. The thermal stabilities of these CPs are studied by thermogravimetric analysis and variable temperature (−100 °C to +150 °C) PXRD experiments. For a proof of concept, using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), one CP of each metal (3 and 7, respectively) has been shown to be a suitable precursor for generating submicron-sized crystalline ZnO or CdO at 400 °C or 250 °C, respectively. Some of the CPs were also studied for their photoluminescence properties in the solid state at room temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacetylene 3aambient temperature 3acadmium 3acoordination polymers 3acrystal structure 3adicarboxylic acids 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahydrogen bonding 3aligands 3amethanol 3amoieties 3aphotoluminescence 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermogravimetry 3awater solubility 3azinc 3azinc oxide1 aMandal, Sanjay K.0 tRSC advances.g2014 Aug. 28, v. 4, no. 74 p.39204-39213dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra03928a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245009300163300001800256520122700274592002801501650005001529650001501579650002001594650002101614650001501635650000901650650003101659650001101690650003301701700002201734773011101756856007501867852000901942655001201951IND60529078620221120085329.0160717e20120717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052907862DNAL7 a10.1021/ac301005t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeverly, Angela A.,10aElectrochemical Determination of Trihalomethanes in Water by Means of Stripping Analysis  ap. 6110-6115.  aA protocol has been developed and evaluated for the determination of trihalomethanes (THMs) at the submicromolar concentration level in water. This method is based on a three-step stripping analysis that utilizes a single electrochemical cell and that entails (a) direct electrochemical reduction of a trihalomethane at a silver cathode to form halide ions in an aqueous sample containing tetraethylammonium benzoate, (b) capture of the released halide ions as a silver halide film on the surface of a silver gauze anode, and (c) cathodic reduction and quantitation of the silver halide film by means of differential pulse voltammetry. Using this procedure, we have determined THMs individually; bromoform and chloroform have been successfully quantitated in 30 min and with a detection limit of 3.0 μg L–¹ (12 nM) and 6.0 μg L–¹ (50 nM), respectively. In addition, we have employed our methodology to determine the total trihalomethane (TTHM) content in a prepared water sample at a level commensurate with the maximum allowable annual average of 80 μg L–¹ mandated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. We have compared our TTHM results to those obtained by an independent testing laboratory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3achloroform 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aions 3alaboratory experimentation 3asilver 3atetraethylammonium compounds1 aPeters, Dennis G.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 July 17, v. 84, no. 14 p.6110-6115dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac301005t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03490naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002400188245012500212300001100337506007600348520204500424592002802469506003702497650002602534650001002560650001602570650001002586650001202596650000902608650001202617650001002629650001402639650001402653650001302667650001802680650002602698650001102724650001102735651001302746700002802759700001902787773011102806856008202917852000902999655001203008IND60590585720221207101623.0191016e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059058572DNAL7 a293619652pmid7 aPMC57823662pmcid7 a10.1186/s13071-018-2654-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGebretsadik, Daniel10aEight-year trend analysis of malaria prevalence in Kombolcha, South Wollo, north-central Ethiopia: a retrospective study  ap. 55.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Malaria is one of the most serious public health problems in the world, and is a major public health problem in Ethiopia. Over the past years, the disease has been consistently reported as the first leading cause of outpatient visits, hospitalization and death in health facilities across the country. This study aimed to assess malaria prevalence trend in the Kombolcha Health Centre. METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out in the Kombolcha Health Centre, north-central Ethiopia. Malaria cases reported from 2009 to 2016 were carefully reviewed from the laboratory record books. Interventions that had been taken in each year were collected from the district health bureau and head of Kombolcha Health Centre using checklists. RESULTS: A total of 27,492 blood films were examined from malaria-suspected patients in the Kombolcha Health Centre from 2009 to 2016. Malaria was confirmed and reported in 2066 (7.52%) of the examined blood films with 258 mean annual cases of. Minimum and maximum cases were reported in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax accounted 60.2% and 35.5% of the cases, respectively. Male patients were more affected (n = 1407; 68.1%) than female ones (n = 659; 31.89%). The highest malaria prevalence (n = 1440; 69.69%) was seen in the 15–45 years age group, followed by those 5–14 years old (n = 303; 14.67%), and finally patients under five years old (n = 217; 10.5%). Malaria cases were at a peak in spring and reduced in the winter season. CONCLUSION: Although the current malaria control strategies are effective in decreasing the morbidity and mortality, malaria is still among major public health problems in Ethiopia. Plasmodium falciparum is the dominant species in the study area. However, in recent years P. vivax cases are increasing, indicating that attention should also be given to this species. The efficacy of chloroquine for P. vivax should be evaluated in the study area. Control activities should be continued and scale up.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3ablood 3achloroquine 3adeath 3afemales 3ahead 3amalaria 3amales 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apatients 3apublic health 3aretrospective studies 3aspring 3awinter 3aEthiopia1 aFeleke, Daniel Getacher1 aFiseha, Mesfin0 tParasites & vectors.g2018 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.55-55dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-2654-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245010600200300002000306500001900326520171500345592002802060650001302088650001802101650002502119650001302144650001702157650001602174650002102190650002502211650002102236653002902257653001802286653001802304653002302322653002702345700005302372700005302425700001702478700005302495700005802548773014102606856007802747852000902825655001202834IND60729857920221120052203.0210303e20210217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072985792DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c218422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Mengmeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9171-497810aFacile Preparation of Continuous and Porous Polyimide Aerogel Fibers for Multifunctional Applications  ap. 10416-10427.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHigh-performance aerogel fibers with high porosity, ultralow density and thermal conductivity, and good flexibility are attractive candidates for the next generation of effective thermal insulation, efficient personal thermal management, and other functional applications. However, most previously reported aerogel fibers suffered from either limited working temperatures, weak mechanical properties, or complex manufacturing processes. In the present work, a facile wet-spinning technique combined with freeze-drying was developed to fabricate strong polyimide aerogel fibers (PAFs) based on organo-soluble polyimide. Attributed to the unique “porous core–dense sheath” morphology, the PAFs exhibited excellent mechanical properties with an optimum tensile strength of 265 MPa and an initial modulus of 7.9 GPa at an ultimate elongation of 65%, representing the highest value for aerogel fibers reported so far. Moreover, the PAFs possess high porosity (>80%) and high specific surface area (464 m² g–¹), which render the woven PAF fabrics with excellent thermal insulation properties within a wide temperature range (−190 to 320 °C) and potential applications for thermal insulation under harsh environments. Additionally, a series of functionalized aerogel fibers or their fabrics based on PAFs, including phase-change fabrics with a thermoregulation function and electromagnetic shielding (EMI) textiles with a high EMI SE value, have been successfully fabricated for expanding their potential applications. Overall, this novel aerogel fiber sheds light on a promising direction for developing the next generation of high-performance thermal insulation and multifunctional fibers and textiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerogels 3afreeze drying 3ainsulating materials 3aporosity 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atensile strength 3athermal conductivity 3athermoregulation 0aorgano-soluble polyimide 0aaerogel fiber 0ahigh strength 0athermal insulation 0amultifunctional fabric1 aGan, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1486-58331 aDong, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2762-91271 aFang, Yuting1 aZhao, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8609-41131 aZhang, Qinghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1750-23840 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Feb. 17, v. 13, no. 8 p.10416-10427dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c218423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245019300170300001600363520179400379592002802173650003102201650001002232650002602242650001602268650001902284650001802303650001702321650001202338650001702350650001602367650001202383650002202395650001402417650001602431653002602447653001302473653003302486700001702519773016502536856008402701852000902785655001202794IND60689848320221120192307.0200621e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068984832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2020.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Young-gyun10aLife history characteristics of the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), under fluctuating conditions of temperature or relative humidity  ap. 606-611.  aFrankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) is a major insect pest of greenhouse crops such as leaf vegetables, flowers and vegetable fruits worldwide. The life history characteristics of F. occidentalis were investigated at control temperature and humidity (27.3 ± 0.54 °C, 79.9 ± 2.79% RH) (mean ± SD), a 10 °C-range fluctuation in temperature (27.1 ± 5.28 °C, 81.5 ± 4.03% RH), a 20 °C-range fluctuation in temperature (26.5 ± 10.09 °C, 80.4 ± 5.76% RH), a 20%-range fluctuation in humidity (26.8 ± 0.37 °C, 80.7 ± 9.55% RH) and a 30%-range fluctuation in humidity (27.3 ± 0.41 °C, 76.3 ± 15.28% RH). Overall, the life history traits of F. occidentalis were more negatively affected by fluctuating environmental conditions. The impact of temperature fluctuation was more severe than that of humidity fluctuation. Additionally, the degree of impact increased as the fluctuation range of the temperature increased, while the reverse trend was observed with humidity fluctuations. With the 20 °C-range fluctuation in temperature, F. occidentalis died at the 1st instar larval stage. The offspring’s sex ratio was significantly higher at the 20%- and 30%-range fluctuations in humidity (0.47 and 0.49, respectively) compared to the control (0.35) and at the 10 °C-range fluctuation in temperature (0.33). From the fertility life table analysis, the intrinsic rate of increase (r) was higher at the 30%-range fluctuation in humidity and control conditions as 0.218 and 0.205, respectively. At the 10 °C-range fluctuation in temperature conditions, r was significantly lower as 0.169. High fluctuations in temperature and low fluctuations in humidity appear to be the best conditions for controlling F. occidentalis populations in greenhouses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrankliniella occidentalis 3acrops 3aenvironmental factors 3agreenhouses 3ainsect control 3ainsect larvae 3ainsect pests 3ainstars 3alife history 3alife tables 3aprogeny 3arelative humidity 3asex ratio 3atemperature 0aFluctuating condition 0aHumidity 0aLife history characteristics1 aYi, Chun-ho,0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2020 June, v. 23, no. 2 p.606-611dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied EntomologywJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2020.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010300170300001800273520104200291592002801333650001401361650002701375650002301402650002401425650002401449650001101473650001501484650001501499650000901514700006201523700001901585700002101604700001701625700001901642700002401661700002001685773011101705856008101816852000901897655001201906IND60602883720221119064141.0180711e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060288372DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-018-1875-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenkatesh, Abhijit10aCellulose nanofibril-reinforced composites using aqueous dispersed ethylene-acrylic acid copolymer  ap. 4577-4589.  aIn order to explore the reinforcing capabilities of cellulose nanofibrils, composites containing high contents of cellulose nanofibrils were prepared through a combination of water-assisted mixing and compression moulding, the components being a cellulose nanofibril suspension and an aqueous dispersion of the polyolefin copolymer poly(ethylene-co-acrylic acid).

Enzymatic hydrolysis (EH) is a promising technology for the recovery of protein from excess sludge, and ultrasound has been identified as a potential method to assist in sludge disintegration. Ultrasonic pretreatment was combined with alkaline protease hydrolysis to extract protein from excess sludge produced by A²/O treatment (S1) and an oxidation ditch treatment (S2), and the extraction effects and changes in sludge dewatering performance were studied. The effects of the six factors ultrasonic power density, ultrasonication time, enzyme dose, pH, hydrolysis temperature and hydrolysis time were analyzed. The results showed that the ultrasound-enhanced enzymatic method could effectively extract sludge protein. Although the extraction efficiencies for the different municipal sludges were different, their extraction conditions were relatively similar. Considering the protein extraction rate and sludge dewatering performance, the selected extraction conditions were as follows: ultrasonic power density, 1 W/mL; ultrasonication time, 20 min; enzyme dose, 3500 U/g; pH 11; hydrolysis temperature, 60 °C; and hydrolysis time, 3 h. Under these conditions, the protein extraction rate (Rₚ) of S1 and S2 reached 55.9% and 52.3%, respectively. Moreover, the improvement in sludge dewatering performance (Dw) of S1 and S2 was 49.5% and 52.4%, respectively. Comparison of the protein, polypeptide, and amino acid contents obtained from ultrasound-assisted enzymatic hydrolysis (UEH), EH, and ultrasonic hydrolysis (UH) further demonstrated the beneficial effect of ultrasound application on enzymatic hydrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo.182102210194cthe key scientific and technological project of Henan province 3aamino acids 3adewatering 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzymatic treatment 3ahydrolysis 3aoxidation 3apH 3apollution 3apolypeptides 3aproteinases 3aresearch 3asludge 3atemperature 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics1 aQin, Lei1 aGao, Jianlei1 aNan, Ruiqi1 aGao, Jingqing0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 May, v. 27, no. 15 p.18317-18328dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08208-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245009900206300001800305520140400323592002801727596009801755596010901853596011001962596008202072650001502154650001202169650002002181650001402201650001402215650001302229650002002242650001402262650001102276650001002287650001602297653002402313653001302337653001802350653002202368700001502390700001702405700001402422700001302436700001702449700005302466773014502519856008602664852000902750655001202759IND60782575020221117162155.0220711e20220629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078257502DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c023452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Mingxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1563-984610aCatalytic Steam Reforming of Benzene as a Bio-tar Model Compound over Ni–Fe/TiO₂ Catalysts  ap. 8930-8939.  aBio-tar formed during biomass gasification can cause the blockage or corrosion of pipelines and devices. Catalytic reforming through Ni-based catalysts is a potential method to achieve tar elimination, while carbon deposition is the main obstacle. In this study, the steam reforming of benzene was investigated over modified Ni/TiO₂ catalysts, and the effects of metal promoters, reaction temperatures, and steam-to-carbon (S/C) molar ratios were explored. The results indicated that the Fe promoter was promising to simultaneously achieve the H₂-rich gas production and suppress the carbon deposition over the catalyst. When the reaction temperature was 800 °C and the S/C molar ratio was 1.00, the benzene conversion ratio and the H₂ yield, respectively, reached 96.31% and 102.53 mmol/gbₑₙzₑₙₑ. Ni–Fe alloys were generated after the modification with the Fe promoter, which improved the dispersion of Ni components. Besides, the adsorption of H₂O molecules was enhanced which favored the formation of lattice oxygen and accelerated the reforming of benzene. Furthermore, the accumulation of lattice oxygen promoted the oxidation of amorphous carbon and suppressed the formation of graphitic carbon, thereby protecting the active Ni sites from the coverage of the carbon layer. Therefore, the resistance of carbon deposition of the Fe-modified Ni/TiO₂ catalyst was improved.  aPublisher supplied data  a51922040cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2020DF01cMinistry of Education of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002338  a2021MS025cMinistry of Education of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002338  a2020RC5008cHunan Science and Technology Planning Projectdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aadsorption 3abenzene 3abiogasification 3acatalysts 3acorrosion 3agraphene 3agreen chemistry 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3asteam 3atemperature 0acatalytic reforming 0apromoter 0aNi−Fe alloy 0acarbon deposition1 aLiu, Zishu1 aZhang, Xinyu1 aDi, Jinyi1 aZhao, Li1 aLi, Mingxiao1 aLu, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4340-18030 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2022 June 29, v. 10, no. 27 p.8930-8939dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c023453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03570naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006600153245008300219300001800302520203600320592002802356650000802384650001602392650003002408650002002438650002702458650001102485650001002496650001702506650001502523650002202538650001102560650002302571650001502594650001102609651001102620651001602631653001002647653002302657653001802680653002502698653001902723653001602742700002302758700003002781700002302811773012102834856008802955852000903043655001203052IND60609881720221117020455.0220914e20181215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060988172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.2382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarrido-Perez, Jose M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5071-789X10aAir stagnation in Europe: Spatiotemporal variability and impact on air quality  ap. 1238-1252.  aThis paper characterizes the spatiotemporal variability of air stagnation over the Euro-Mediterranean area for the 1979–2016 period by using a simplified air stagnation index (ASI) based on daily precipitation as well as near-surface and upper wind speed data. We have also undertaken the first comparison of stagnation as derived from meteorological reanalysis and observations, finding a reasonably good agreement between both datasets. The main differences arise from the surface wind speed, as this field depends on the local setting of the observational sites and imperfect parameterizations within the reanalysis model. Since air stagnation has considerable spatial heterogeneity over the region, we have regionalized the monthly frequency of stagnant days, resulting five regions with consistent temporal patterns: Scandinavia (SCAN), Northern-Europe (NEU), Central-Europe (CEU), South-West (SW) and South-East (SE). The northern regions (SCAN and NEU), which are affected by moderately strong near-surface winds and ample precipitation, present low frequency and temporal variability in stagnation compared to the southern regions (SW and SE). The winters and summers with the highest stagnation frequency often concur with positive 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies over the regions, with the exception of negative anomalies and a displacement of the extratropical jet to the south in the case of SCAN and NEU during winter. Air stagnation exerts a clear influence on air quality (AQ), with anomalies above 10% for summer ozone (O₃) and 30% for winter PM₁₀ (particulate matter ≤10 μm in diameter) on stagnant vs. non-stagnant days over most of the regions. These values exceed 20% and 50%, respectively, in the case of CEU, where air stagnation also drives significant changes in the frequency distributions of these pollutants and increases the likelihood of AQ exceedances. Moreover, persistent and widespread stagnation events favour the build-up of both O₃ and PM₁₀ over most of the continent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair quality 3aatmospheric precipitation 3adata collection 3afrequency distribution 3amodels 3aozone 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3aspatial variation 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3awind speed 3awinter 3aEurope 3aScandinavia 0aOzone 0aParticulate matter 0aAir pollution 0aRegional air quality 0aAir stagnation 0aMeteorology1 aOrdóñez, Carlos,1 aGarcía Herrera, Ricardo,1 aBarriopedro, David0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 645 p.1238-1252dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.2383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01071naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245006400157300001600221520021300237592002800450650001400478650002700492650002300519650001300542700002400555773013100579856007400710852000900784655001200793IND60659743120221119110601.0190823e20121218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065974312DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc37953h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoots, Leigh13aAn infinite catenane self-assembled by π⋯π interactions  ap. 671-673.  aPhenanthrenyl-based metallocycles are mechanically interlinked to form an infinite catenated chain.

Apolipoprotein H (ApoH) is an acute phase human plasma protein that has been previously shown to interact with viruses, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and bacterial proteins. The purpose of this study was to determine if ApoH was capable of binding and efficiently capturing two representative human norovirus strains (GI.1 and GII.4), a cultivable surrogate, and four bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, and Staphylococcus aureus). Experiments were carried out using an ApoH-conjugated magnetic bead-based capture followed by pathogen detection using nucleic acid amplification. For all three viruses studied, >10% capture efficiency (<1 Log10 loss in RT-qPCR amplifiable units) was observed. The same capture efficiencies were observed for the bacterial pathogens tested, with the exception of E. coli O157:H7 (approximately 1% capture efficiency, or 2 Log10 loss in CFU equivalents). The efficiency of the capture steps did not vary as a consequence of input target concentration or in the presence of an abundance of background microflora. A complementary plate-based capture assay showed that ApoH bound to a variety of human norovirus virus-like particles. ApoH has the potential to be a broadly reactive ligand for separating and concentrating representative foodborne pathogens, both bacteria and viruses.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Air Force Institute of Technology Civilian Institute Program Scholarshipdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009924  cU.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aNorovirus 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abacteria 3abacterial proteins 3ablood proteins 3afood pathogens 3agene amplification 3ahumans 3aligands 3alipopolysaccharides 3amagnetism 3amicrobial detection 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3avirus-like particles 3aviruses 0aApoH 0aDetection 0aNorovirus 0aBacteria 0aConcentration1 aGoulter, Rebecca M.1 aJaykus, Lee-Ann0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2016 Sept., v. 128 p.88-95dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2016.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle03391naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009900164300002000263500001900283520171400302592002802016596007902044596006302123596006302186650002302249650001102272650002602283650002702309650002002336650000902356650002502365650002502390650001302415650001802428650001302446650001302459650001902472650001402491650001302505650001902518650002502537700002702562700002102589700001502610773016802625856008302793852000902876655001202885IND60693854220221116202347.0200517e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069385422DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-07438-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yajun10aCarbon-to-nitrogen ratio influence on the performance of bioretention for wastewater treatment  ap. 17652-17660.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBioretention cell (BRC), bioretention cell with microbial fuel cell (BRC-MFC), and an enhanced combined BRC-MFC system with bimetallic zero-valent iron (BRC-MFC-BZVI) were implemented in current study to treat the domestic wastewater. Nitrogen removal characteristics of three systems were investigated by adjusting influent carbon/nitrogen ratio (C/N ratio of 2.54–19.36). Results revealed that the nitrification and denitrification performances were mainly influenced by organic matter and system combination, which further affected nitrogen removal. When the influent C/N ratio was between 2 to 3, compared with BRC system, in BRC-MFC and BRC-MFC-BZVI system, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), and ammonical nitrogen (NH₄⁺-N) removal efficiencies were still reached to 83.04%, 61.06%, and 42.26% and 86.53%, 43.61%, and 50.99% respectively, which simultaneously achieved high-efficiency of organic matter and nitrogen removal. The efficient supply of electrons in the BRC-MFC and BRC-MFC-BZVI processes was the main reason to achieve profound denitrification removal under the condition of low C/N. Removal rates of nitrate (NO₃⁻−N) and nitrite (NO₂⁻−N) were relatively higher due to microbial-driven redox reactions caused by driving electrons to flow in the closed circuit of metal wire connection. Moreover, phylogenetic diversity of bacterial communities mainly induced the catalytic iron, which further enhanced biological nitrogen reduction. The maximum efficient removal of organic matter (OM), TN, and NH4 + −N were obtained in the BRC-MFC-BZVI system, which were 98.42% (C/N = 10.42), 55.61% (C/N = 4.16), and 61.13% (C/N = 4.16), respectively.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016B-026cUniversity Scientific Research Project of Gansu Province, China  aJK2018-16cKey technology Program of Gansu province, China  a2015BAL02B05cNational Key Technologies R&D Program, China 3abioretention areas 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3achemical oxygen demand 3adenitrification 3airon 3amicrobial fuel cells 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aphylogeny 3aresearch 3atotal nitrogen 3awastewater treatment1 aSingh, Rajendra Prasad1 aGeng, Chongchong1 aFu, Dafang0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 May, v. 27, no. 15 p.17652-17660dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-07438-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04431naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245016000169300001600329520260000345592002802945650001902973650001402992650001903006650001903025650001303044650002003057650002203077650002003099650002503119650001503144650002203159650001903181650002903200650002103229650002203250650001203272650002303284650001803307650001403325650001803339650001103357650001703368650001903385650001903404653002803423653002503451653001903476653001603495653002503511653001603536700001903552700002103571700001703592773011303609856008603722852000903808655001203817IND60568111320221122180853.0180831e20170720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056811132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.04.1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamanzi, Luca14aThe impact of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU food chain: A quantitative and economic assessment using an environmentally extended input-output approach  ap. 168-176.  aIn order to provide a valuable knowledge basis for future global warming mitigation strategies and policy implementation, this study carries out an integrated assessment of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions throughout the EU-25 food supply chain, considering the highest available level of product disaggregation. Based on an environmentally extended input-output (EE-IO) approach, we estimate the environmental impacts resulting from the ‘food and non-alcoholic beverages’ supply chain from production to waste management, by 44 food products, grouped in 11 categories. Further, we perform a Structural Path Analysis to identify the hotspots along the supply chain with the highest emissions. Finally, we carry out an assessment of the economic impact of GHG emissions on each product category, considering both the related environmental pressure intensity and the cost of environmental damage (social cost). The results offer new insights on the amount, composition and origin of GHG emissions in the food supply chain. More precisely, detailed evidence is provided in support of the findings of previous studies that have shown that the contribution of farm-level activities on overall GHG emissions is mostly related to N2O and CH4 emissions. Moreover, we highlight the large environmental impact associated with CO2 emissions, even if they are scattered among a very high number of activities, with a limited contribution each. Hence, we infer that multiple hotspots for CO2 exist along the whole supply chain and that many of them occur in downstream stages, e.g. transportation, processing, packaging, waste disposal, as well as in the cold chain activities. As for the economic assessment of emissions, the highest costs are attributed to the highest emitting product categories, but the share of social costs of these emissions as compared to the overall production value, affect each product differently. Hence, the impact of a hypothetical price control measure, introduced to internalize the social cost of emissions, would vary significantly from one product category to another. Overall, our findings suggest that, in order to achieve effective and efficient GHG mitigation in the food system, an integrated approach is required, including both concrete technological and managerial measures at various stages of the food supply chain and for specific product categories, as well as appropriate economic incentive-based mechanisms accounting for the social cost of damage (e.g. a ‘carbon tax’), that can prompt polluters to reduce their emissions along the whole supply chain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abeverages 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon markets 3aconcrete 3acontrol methods 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic impact 3aenvironmental impact 3afood chain 3afood supply chain 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aissues and policy 3amethane 3amethane production 3anitrous oxide 3apackaging 3apath analysis 3aprices 3asupply chain 3atransportation 3awaste disposal 0aGreenhouse gas emission 0aEU food supply chain 0aEE-IO approach 0aE3IOT model 0aEnvironmental impact 0aSocial cost1 aAlikadic, Azra1 aCompagnoni, Luca1 aMerloni, Eva0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 July 20, v. 157 p.168-176dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.04.1183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245014100169300001600310520185200326592002802178650002402206650001202230650001902242650002202261650001402283650001302297650001802310650001102328650001102339650001602350650001002366700002502376700002502401700001902426773013002445856007902575852000902654655001202663IND60519269420221120233914.0160425e20160209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051926942DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2015-02682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDodrill, Michael J.10aPrey size and availability limits maximum size of rainbow trout in a large tailwater: insights from a drift-foraging bioenergetics model  ap. 759-772.  aThe cold and clear water conditions present below many large dams create ideal conditions for the development of economically important salmonid fisheries. Many of these tailwater fisheries have experienced declines in the abundance and condition of large trout species, yet the causes of these declines remain uncertain. Here, we develop, assess, and apply a drift-foraging bioenergetics model to identify the factors limiting rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) growth in a large tailwater. We explored the relative importance of temperature, prey quantity, and prey size by constructing scenarios where these variables, both singly and in combination, were altered. Predicted growth matched empirical mass-at-age estimates, particularly for younger ages, demonstrating that the model accurately describes how current temperature and prey conditions interact to determine rainbow trout growth. Modeling scenarios that artificially inflated prey size and abundance demonstrate that rainbow trout growth is limited by the scarcity of large prey items and overall prey availability. For example, shifting 10% of the prey biomass to the 13 mm (large) length class, without increasing overall prey biomass, increased lifetime maximum mass of rainbow trout by 88%. Additionally, warmer temperatures resulted in lower predicted growth at current and lower levels of prey availability; however, growth was similar across all temperatures at higher levels of prey availability. Climate change will likely alter flow and temperature regimes in large rivers with corresponding changes to invertebrate prey resources used by fish. Broader application of drift-foraging bioenergetics models to build a mechanistic understanding of how changes to habitat conditions and prey resources affect growth of salmonids will benefit management of tailwater fisheries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3aenergy metabolism 3afisheries 3ahabitats 3ainvertebrates 3amodels 3arivers 3atemperature 3atrout1 aYackulic, Charles B.1 aKennedy, Theodore A.1 aHayes, John W.0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2016 Feb. 9, v. 73, no. 5 p.759-772dNRC Research Pressx1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2015-02683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002800186245010700214300001800321506007600339520125100415592002801666506003701694650003201731650002601763650000801789650002601797650002401823650002001847650001201867650001101879650001301890653001801903653002601921653001601947653001401963653001401977700001701991700001602008700001502024700002102039700001902060773017202079856007902251852000902330655001202339IND60230321820221207072600.0150614e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023032182DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13153741112doi7 aPMC39482842pmcid7 a245504742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Christopher M.10aIdentification of a conserved branched RNA structure that functions as a factor-independent terminator  ap. 3573-3578.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAnti-Q is a small RNA encoded on pCF10, an antibiotic resistance plasmid of Enterococcus faecalis , which negatively regulates conjugation of the plasmid. In this study we sought to understand how Anti-Q is generated relative to larger transcripts of the same operon. We found that Anti-Q folds into a branched structure that functions as a factor-independent terminator. In vitro and in vivo, termination is dependent on the integrity of this structure as well as the presence of a 3′ polyuridine tract, but is not dependent on other downstream sequences. In vitro, terminated transcripts are released from RNA polymerase after synthesis. In vivo, a mutant with reduced termination efficiency demonstrated loss of tight control of conjugation function. A search of bacterial genomes revealed the presence of sequences that encode Anti-Q–like RNA structures. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that one of these functions as a terminator. This work reveals a previously unappreciated flexibility in the structure of factor-independent terminators and identifies a mechanism for generation of functional small RNAs; it should also inform annotation of bacterial sequence features, such as terminators, functional sRNAs, and operons.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aRNA 3aantibiotic resistance 3agenetic conjugation 3ain vivo studies 3amutants 3aoperon 3aplasmids 0atranscription 0acell–cell signaling 0aattenuation 0apheromone 0aantisense1 aChen, Yuqing1 aLee, Heejin1 aKe, Ailong1 aWeaver, Keith E.1 aDunny, Gary M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Mar. 4, v. 111, no. 9 p.3573-3578dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13153741113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011400171300001800285520168900303592002801992650002202020650002902042650001202071650001902083650002402102650001502126650002202141650001602163700001702179773009702196856004802293852000902341655001202350IND50090640820221122221509.0140627e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009064082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-013-0617-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPollnac, Fredric W.10aLife after establishment: factors structuring the success of a mountain invader away from disturbed roadsides  ap. 1689-1698.  aClimate change and increased anthropogenic activity may both alter the current ranges of non-native plant species in mountainous areas, and could result in increased success of such species at higher elevations in the future. However, the course that management should take is often unclear due to a lack of information about the dynamics of how successful mountain invaders spread away from roadsides. The goals of this study were to determine if patterns of growth of a successful mountain invader, Linaria dalmatica (L.) Mill., (as measured by species cover) were: (1) similar to those of establishment (as measured by probability of occurrence), and (2) structured by the extant plant community. Study sites were established throughout the current elevation range of L. dalmatica in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, and cover of the species was measured along with several vegetative community characteristics. Elevation influenced probability of occurrence (i.e., chance of establishment) for L. dalmatica, but not cover (which represents growth after establishment). L. dalmatica cover was negatively associated with several vegetative community characteristics which did not appear to be influenced by the presence of L. dalmatica. These results suggest that L. dalmatica establishment may be limited by climate, but that spread of established populations away from roadsides is most influenced by properties of the vegetative community. They further suggest that the resident vegetative communities structure the abundance of this invader, and that to limit spread of this species in mountainous areas, disturbance to the existing vegetative communities should be minimized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLinaria dalmatica 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aplant communities 3aprobability1 aRew, Lisa J.0 tBiological invasions.g2014 Aug., v. 16, no. 8 p.1689-1698dSpringer-Verlagx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-013-0617-6  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245011900171300001600290520182800306592002802134650002202162650002502184650001102209650002102220650001402241650001702255650002702272650002202299650001502321650002202336650001302358650001502371650002002386650001702406650001302423651001602436653001802452653002302470653001702493653001602510653001702526653002002543653002502563653001402588700001802602773009602620856008902716852000902805655001202814IND60597301620221119214405.0190719e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059730162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.05.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, HaeRan10aUrbanisation and land use transition in a second-tier city: The emergence of small factories in Gimpo, South Korea  ap. 534-541.  aThis research incorporates tenets of growth regime theory through the case of Gimpo, a Seoul-dependent second-tier city. To put second-tier cities in a context that includes the concept of Korean and East Asian nuances, we suggest conceptualising the development of a growth regime theory through a dialogue that considers the departure from an agreement with the Western paradigm and path dependence of developmental states. The development of Gimpo has been heavily constrained by the central government’s control of the overwhelming growth of the Seoul Capital Area. Since the 1990s, however, the deregulation of the area has driven the creation of thousands of small factories. Based on in-depth interviews, a focus group, archives, and site visits, the research demonstrates, first, that the central government and the city government have wavered between remaining interventionist and taking a neoliberal approach. The state allowed industrialisation of Seoul’s suburban cities, and the city government attempted to attract businesses into planned industrial parks but ended up allowing even more dispersed small factories. Second, the growth regime has emerged, including city government, real estate agencies, village leaders, landowners, entrepreneurs, and migrant-supporting organisations. They drove the development of the small factories by responding to policies and the influx of migrant workers. The village leaders, eejangs, who are both elected leaders and landowners, played a critical role by turning into developers and entrepreneurial mediators and persuading landowners to accommodate factories on their agricultural land. By examining the interaction between the urban growth regime and urban hierarchy, this research contributes to the debate on urban growth and development in various contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abusiness enterprises 3acities 3aentrepreneurship 3afactories 3afocus groups 3agrowth and development 3aindustrialization 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3alandowners 3amigrant workers 3aurbanization 3avillages 3aSouth Korea 0aGrowth regime 0aSecond-tier cities 0aDeregulation 0aSouth Korea 0aUrbanization 0aUrban hierarchy 0aDevelopmental states 0aEast Asia1 aChae, Sangwon0 tLand use policy.g2018 Sept., v. 77 p.534-541dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.05.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03163naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245007800205300001800283506007600301520155400377592002801931506003701959650002901996650001202025650001202037650001502049650001202064650001702076650001502093650001502108650001402123650001502137650002502152650000902177650001602186650001002202651001502212653001802227653002302245653001802268653002402286700002302310700002202333700001802355773017202373856007902545852000902624655001202633IND60230321920221207072543.0150614e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023032192DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13156671112doi7 aPMC39482642pmcid7 a245161442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHahm, W.

Although the distribution of ecosystems is largely explained by temperature and precipitation, vegetation can vary markedly with little variation in climate. Here we explore the role of bedrock in governing the distribution of forest cover across the Sierra Nevada Batholith, California. Our sites span a narrow range of elevations and thus a narrow range in climate. However, land cover varies from Giant Sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), the largest trees on Earth, to vegetation-free swaths that are visible from space. Meanwhile, underlying bedrock spans nearly the entire compositional range of granitic bedrock in the western North American cordillera. We explored connections between lithology and vegetation using measurements of bedrock geochemistry and forest productivity. Tree-canopy cover, a proxy for forest productivity, varies by more than an order of magnitude across our sites, changing abruptly at mapped contacts between plutons and correlating with bedrock concentrations of major and minor elements, including the plant-essential nutrient phosphorus. Nutrient-poor areas that lack vegetation and soil are eroding more than two times slower on average than surrounding, more nutrient-rich, soil-mantled bedrock. This suggests that bedrock geochemistry can influence landscape evolution through an intrinsic limitation on primary productivity. Our results are consistent with widespread bottom-up lithologic control on the distribution and diversity of vegetation in mountainous terrain.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSequoiadendron giganteum 3abedrock 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3aforests 3ageochemistry 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3amountains 3aphosphorus 3aprimary productivity 3asoil 3atemperature 3atrees 3aCalifornia 0aerosion rates 0abedrock weathering 0acritical zone 0aforest distribution1 aRiebe, Clifford S.1 aLukens, Claire E.1 aAraki, Sayaka0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Mar. 4, v. 111, no. 9 p.3338-3343dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13156671113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03585naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245007500171300001400246520191400260592002802174650001102202650001602213650001402229650001302243650001502256650001902271650001302290650000902303650001702312650001702329650001602346650002102362650001602383650001402399650002502413650001402438650001202452650001402464650001502478650001302493650001902506650001602525650001102541650001102552650001002563650001702573653002902590653001502619653002202634653002202656700002202678700002202700700001902722773013802741856008302879852000902962655001202971IND60689849320221120223252.0200621e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068984932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.baae.2020.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenvenuti, Stefano10aWildflower-pollinator interactions: Which phytochemicals are involved?  ap. 62-75.  aThe intensification of agricultural practices contributes to the decline of many taxa, such as insects and weeds. Wildflower species have an important environmental impact on rural biodiversity since plant-pollinator networks play a key role in both landscape aesthetics and environmental functionality. Due to their scarcity and/or disappearance in conventional agroecosystems, wildflowers are now being used in strips to restore the agro-environment.In this study, fifteen wildflower species were sown in order to verify their ecological performance in terms of a plant-pollinator interaction while in laboratory the several chemicals emitted by the flowers were identified. Flowering periods were concentrated in the spring, although flowering periods extended to the hot and dry summer months in some species. An extreme variability was found in terms of quantitative and qualitative pollinator-attractiveness (i.e., bees, bumblebees, hoverfly, bee flies and butterflies). Most wildflower species emit a volatiles belonging above all to one of the several chemical classes. A hierarchical cluster analysis of the different volatile emissions did not fully correlate with the botanical taxa of the respectives wildflowers. Often, single chemical compounds prevailed, such as β-ocimene and limonene among monoterpenes hydrocarbons, santolina alcohol in the case of oxygenated monoterpenes, or (Z)- or (E)-3-hexenol acetate for non-terpenes derivatives. It is believed that these chemical compounds can play an ecological role in plant-pollinator food webs. The hypothesis that the chemistry of the volatiles implies a specialized plant-pollinator co-evolution was confirmed by a significant regression (p < 0.05), which showed an inverse relationship between chemical diversity (H’) and pollinator dominance (D) indexes. The chemical specificity indicates the specificity of pollinators and vice versa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombus 3aBombyliidae 3aSyrphidae 3aacetates 3aaesthetics 3aagroecosystems 3aalcohols 3abees 3abeta-ocimene 3abiodiversity 3abutterflies 3acluster analysis 3acoevolution 3aemissions 3aenvironmental impact 3aflowering 3aflowers 3afood webs 3alandscapes 3alimonene 3aphytochemicals 3apollinators 3aspring 3asummer 3aweeds 3awild flowers 0aAgronomic sustainability 0aEntomogamy 0aWildflower strips 0aVolatile emission1 aMazzoncini, Marco1 aCioni, Pier Luigi1 aFlamini, Guido0 tBasic and applied ecology.g2020 June, v. 45 p.62-75dElsevier GmbHaGesellschaft für ÖkologiewJournal:jnl3925117x1439-17917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2020.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245009600171300001600267520127800283592002801561650002701589650001601616650001301632650002201645650001001667650002001677650001501697650001301712650002101725650001901746650001601765650001801781650001501799651001101814653003101825653002701856653002501883653002701908653002301935700001801958773011901976856008802095852000902183655001202192IND60609882220221117020531.0201118e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060988222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.2492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMentzafou, A.10aNitrogen loading and natural pressures on the water quality of a shallow Mediterranean lake  ap. 134-143.  aThe water quality of Koumoundourou Lake, a heavily modified, peri-urban, brackish and shallow lake near Athens, Greece, is under multiple stressors due to the industrial activities in the catchment area and natural pollution pressures. Although the broader area has undergone significant land use changes since the beginning of the 20th century converting it from rural to heavily industrialized, Koumoundourou Lake remained as one of the few habitats in Attica Region, for large numbers of aquatic birds. The water quality of the lake has been recently improved, which contributed to the increase of aquatic birds' population in the area and to the higher, in relation to the past, nitrogen inputs from natural sources. Therefore, a monitoring program has been implemented to assess the pollution pressure factors in the lake. A water quality model has been also used to simulate the lake's processes and estimate the nutrient mass budget focusing on the various nitrogen loading mechanisms (natural and anthropogenic). Based on the model output, the main polluting factor of the lake is the groundwater inflows. Aquatic birds affect slightly the lake's water quality, while the dry and wet atmospheric deposition contributes insignificantly to the total nitrogen loading.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric deposition 3agroundwater 3ahabitats 3ahydrologic models 3alakes 3aland use change 3amonitoring 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3apollution load 3awater birds 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aGreece 0aTotal nitrogen mass budget 0aAtmospheric deposition 0aAquatic bird loading 0aWater quality modeling 0aKoumoundourou Lake1 aDimitriou, E.0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 646 p.134-143dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.2493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02352naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245013200164500001900296520100900315592002801324650002001352650001501372650001601387650003401403650001901437650001701456650001501473650001301488650002501501653001801526653001301544653001301557653002701570653002001597700002101617700001701638700002301655700001701678773013001695856008401825852000901909655001201918IND60689849420221120223348.0200523e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068984942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2020.1023582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Rui10aPulsed electric energy and ultrasonication assisted green solvent extraction of bio-molecules from different microalgal species  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effects of physical treatments (pulsed electrical fields (PEF), high voltage electrical discharges (HVED) and ultrasonication (US)) on aqueous extraction of carbohydrates and proteins, and ethanolic extraction of chlorophyll a from three microalgal species (Nannochloropsis sp., P. tricornutum and P. kessleri) have been studied.

The variations tendency of GHG inventories were studied from 1949 to 2013 in China on the basis of first order decay (FOD) method, and the total estimated GHG was found to be increased from 0.36 to 72.4 Mt CO2-equiv in this work. Landfill was the main contributor for the GHG emissions, and the occupied percentage increased from 17% in 1979, to the peak value of 82% in 1999, and finally to 69.5% in 2013. The regional GHG division patterns were calculated every 5 years after 2003 due to the remarkable increase of MSW in past decades. East China was found to be the dominant region for GHG emissions, while the corresponding percentage decreased from 38.60% in 2003 to 30.75% in 2013. The percentage increased from 4.69% to 7.31%, as more MSW were landfilling in North West. The methane mitigation technologies, especially the soil cover and landfill gas collection-flaring, are the main contribution for CH4 reduction. The diversion alternatives for landfill are effective in the indirect GHG mitigation, and the reduction of MSW disposal is another critical part through the implementation of “pay-as-your-throw” and environmental protection tax.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aenvironmental protection 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ainventories 3alandfills 3amethane 3amunicipal solid waste 3asoil 3aChina 0aGHG emission inventory 0aWaste sector 0aChina 0a60 years 0aRegional division1 aCai, Bo-Feng1 aZhu, Nanwen1 aZhao, Youcai1 aGeng, Yong1 aYu, Bao1 aChen, Wei0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 July 20, v. 157 p.118-124dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.04.1353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245007400171500001900245520141800264592002801682650001101710650002001721650000801741650001701749650000901766650001101775650001701786650001101803650002301814650001101837650001001848650002101858653001601879653001001895653001501905700003001920700002301950700002101973700002101994700002802015773013002043856008402173852000902257655001202266IND60689849620221120223456.0200523e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068984962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2020.1023632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampelo, Pedro H.10aModulation of aroma and flavor using glow discharge plasma technology  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study evaluates the use of cold plasma technology to induce flavor and aroma modifications and improvement of sensory quality in juices and fruit pulps. The work investigated the changes induced by glow discharge plasma processing on the volatile compounds and flavor profile of fruit pulps, using camu-camu as a case study. Camu-camu pulp was subjected to glow discharge plasma operating at different processing times (10 to 30 min) and synthetic air plasma flowrates (10 to 30 mL/min). The headspace compounds were identified and quantified using GC–MS analysis, and consisted mainly of terpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, and alcohols. Cold plasma application induced a series of chemical modifications in the volatile compounds. The chemical pathway of the reactions induced by plasma application was proposed and discussed. The changes in the composition of the volatile compounds varied with the operating conditions, and induced changes in the aroma and flavor of the juice. Depending on the operating condition, modulation of aroma and flavor was possible increasing or decreasing, up to a certain level, the woody (34.2%), herbal (29.1%), terpenic (47.3%), spicy (18.2%), citrus (28.7%), and camphoraceous (81.9%) notes of the juice. The results presented in this work open the possibility of flavor and aroma modifications and improvement of sensory quality in food products, using plasma technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aMyrciaria dubia 3aair 3acase studies 3acold 3aflavor 3afood science 3afruits 3aheadspace analysis 3ajuices 3aodors 3asesquiterpenoids 0aCold plasma 0aCG-MS 0aTerponoids1 aAlves Filho, Elenilson G.1 aSilva, Lorena M.A.1 ade Brito, Edy S.1 aRodrigues, Sueli1 aFernandes, Fabiano A.N.0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2020 June, v. 62 p.102363-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2020.1023633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002500186245008600211300001800297506007600315520140300391592002801794506003701822650003101859650001201890650001401902650002001916650002101936650003501957650001801992650001702010650001402027650001602041650001902057650001602076650001802092700002602110700002102136700002602157700002502183700002702208773017202235856007902407852000902486655001202495IND60230322520221207071444.0150614e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023032252DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13164471112doi7 aPMC39483062pmcid7 a245505102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKourepini, Evangelia10aOsteopontin expression by CD103⁻ dendritic cells drives intestinal inflammation  ap. E856-E865.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIntestinal CD103 ⁻ dendritic cells (DCs) are pathogenic for colitis. Unveiling molecular mechanisms that render these cells proinflammatory is important for the design of specific immunotherapies. In this report, we demonstrated that mesenteric lymph node CD103 ⁻ DCs express, among other proinflammatory cytokines, high levels of osteopontin (Opn) during experimental colitis. Opn expression by CD103 ⁻ DCs was crucial for their immune profile and pathogenicity, including induction of T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cell responses. Adoptive transfer of Opn-deficient CD103 ⁻ DCs resulted in attenuated colitis in comparison to transfer of WT CD103 ⁻ DCs, whereas transgenic CD103 ⁻ DCs that overexpress Opn were highly pathogenic in vivo. Neutralization of secreted Opn expressed exclusively by CD103 ⁻ DCs restrained disease severity. Also, Opn deficiency resulted in milder disease, whereas systemic neutralization of secreted Opn was therapeutic. We determined a specific domain of the Opn protein responsible for its CD103 ⁻ DC-mediated proinflammatory effect. We demonstrated that disrupting the interaction of this Opn domain with integrin α9, overexpressed on colitic CD103 ⁻ DCs, suppressed the inflammatory potential of these cells in vitro and in vivo. These results add unique insight into the biology of CD103 ⁻ DCs and their function during inflammatory bowel disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3acolitis 3acytokines 3adendritic cells 3adisease severity 3agenetically modified organisms 3aimmunotherapy 3ainflammation 3aintegrins 3alymph nodes 3aneutralization 3aosteopontin 3apathogenicity1 aAggelakopoulou, Maria1 aAlissafi, Themis1 aPaschalidis, Nikolaos1 aSimoes, Davina C.

Agardh, with TBO staining. SPs were extracted using a blade and purified by Q sepharose fast flow anion-exchange chromatography, resulting in SP fractions F1, F2 and F3, with molecular weights of 30, 35 and 20kDa, respectively. An SP yield of 43.1% was obtained in F3, while F2 yielded a sulfate content of 21.9%. Furthermore, the in vitro anticancer and antioxidant activities of the polysaccharide fractions were evaluated. The F2 fraction showed higher anticancer activity against HepG2 and A549 cells than the other two fractions, with IC50 values of 600μg/mL and 700μg/mL, respectively. The normal breast epithelial cell line (HBL-100) exhibited IC50 concentrations of 1200 and 1400μg/mL for crude sulfated polysaccharides (CSPs) and all SP fractions (F1–F3). These results indicated that the anticancer activity of F2 could be related to its sulfate content. However, the antioxidant activities of F1–F3 were low at their tested concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSargassum 3aagarose 3aanion exchange chromatography 3aantineoplastic agents 3aantioxidant activity 3aepithelial cells 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amolecular weight 3asulfates 3athallus 0aSeaweeds 0aSulfated polysaccharides 0aAntioxidant 0aIn vitro anticancer 0aApoptosis 0aCell cycle arrest1 aSenthilkumar, Namasivayam1 aThangam, Ramar1 aRajkumar, Mayan1 aAnbazhagan, Chinnathambi1 aRengasamy, Ramasamy1 aGunasekaran, Palani1 aKannan, Soundarapandian1 aPalani, Perumal0 tProcess Biochemistry.g2013 Feb., v. 48 p.364-373dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2012.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011000166300002000276500001900296520117000315592002801485596007001513596014501583596006301728650002201791650003701813650002201850650001101872650001901883650001701902650001601919650001301935650001801948650001901966650001501985650001402000650001602014650001302030650002302043650002102066650002602087650000902113700006702122700001602189700002302205700001602228700002702244773016802271856008302439852000902522655001202531IND60693855120221116202229.0200517e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069385512DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-05787-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Zhenhua10aCu/N-codoped TiO2 prepared by the sol-gel method for phenanthrene removal under visible light irradiation  ap. 17530-17540.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCu/N-codoped TiO₂ nanoparticles were prepared by the modified sol-gel method, to study its efficiency for the removing of polyaromatic hydrocarbon (phenanthrene) from an aqueous solution. Urea and copper sulfate pentahydrate were used as sources of doping element for Cu/N-codoped TiO₂, respectively. The characterizations of the nanoparticles were done by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra. XRD revealed that all the nanoparticles were indexed to the anatase phase structure, with crystallite size range from 11 to 30 nm, which decreased with the doping of copper and nitrogen. The photocatalytic activities of Cu/N-codoped TiO₂ showed the highest activities than other TiO₂ nanoparticles (TiO₂ and N-doped TiO₂). The photodegradation efficiency of Cu/N-codoped TiO₂ on phenanthrene under visible light irradiation was slightly higher (96%) comparing to UV light irradiation (94%). Cu/N-codoped TiO₂ was found to be very efficient and economical for phenanthrene removal, because the smallest amount of Cu/N-codoped TiO₂ exhibited the best removal efficiency on phenanthrene.  aPublisher supplied data  a41371307 & 51509129cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a0812201228cthe State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture (Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences) foundation  aBK20171435cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaqueous solutions 3acopper 3acopper sulfate 3acrystallites 3airradiation 3anitrogen 3aphenanthrenes 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotolysis 3apollution 3areflectance 3aresearch 3asol-gel processing 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation 3aurea1 aOmer, Abduelrahman Adam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0131-89721 aQin, Zhirui1 aOsman, Salaheldein1 aXia, Liling1 aSingh, Rajendra Prasad0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 May, v. 27, no. 15 p.17530-17540dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05787-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011600164300001800280520118400298592002801482650001701510650001801527650001801545650001101563650002401574650001601598650001101614650001701625653004101642653001401683653001801697653003301715700001801748700005601766700001301822773009201835856008501927852000902012655001202021IND60589698320221121082619.0190207e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058969832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.02.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLong, Rui10aDirect contact membrane distillation system for waste heat recovery: Modelling and multi-objective optimization  ap. 1060-1068.  aDirect contact membrane distillation (DCMD) is an alternative technology to utilize the low temperature waste heat source for water supply. In this paper, we proposed a modified model characterizing the heat and mass transfer in the DCMD, which was validated by a great accordance with the experiment data. For evaluating the performance of a DCMD system with heat recovery, gain output ration (GOR) and mass recovery rate are two main criteria, however, they could not achieve their maximum values simultaneously. To achieve such a compromise, a multi-objective optimization considering both the water recovery rate and GOR was conducted. Besides, the GOR, mass recovery rate and thermal efficiency under single-objective optimization methods were calculated and compared. Compared to the results under the maximum GOR, the increase magnitude of water mass recovery rate under the multi-objective optimization override the decrease magnitude of GOR. Compared with the performance under the single-objective optimization for transmembrane water flux, the transmembrane water flux under the multi-objective optimization was reduced by only 6.7%, but the GOR is increased by 83.2%.  aPublisher supplied data 3adistillation 3aheat recovery 3amass transfer 3amodels 3asystem optimization 3atemperature 3awastes 3awater supply 0aDirect contact membrane distillation 0aModelling 0aHeat recovery 0aMulti-objective optimization1 aLai, Xiaotian1 aLiu, Zhichun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4911-17161 aLiu, Wei0 tEnergy.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 148 p.1060-1068dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.02.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012200156300001600278500002000294520157600314592002801890650001001918650001101928650001301939650002401952650001901976650001501995650000902010650002302019650001902042650001602061650002002077650000902097650000902106650001602115650001002131650001802141650001102159650002902170700001802199700001402217773011402231856007302345852000902418655001202427IND60572100720221118012120.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057210072DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.129022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohammadi, H10aReproductive performance of breeder quails fed diets supplemented with L‐cysteine‐coated iron oxide nanoparticles  ap. 298-304.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe objective of this study was to investigate the effects of L‐cysteine‐coated iron oxide nanoparticles on reproductive performance in breeder quails. The five treatment diets consisted of (i) negative control diet not supplemented with iron, (ii) positive control diet supplemented with 60 mg/kg of Fe₃O₄ and (iii) experimental diets supplemented with 0.6, 6 and 60 mg/kg of L‐cysteine‐coated iron oxide nanoparticles. A total of 100 seven‐day‐old quail chicks were weighed and randomly placed to five groups of five replicate cages. Four quails (one male and three females) were raised in each cage (50 × 15 × 17 cm). Egg production, feed consumption and egg weight were recorded daily and calculated on a hen per day basis. Egg components, fertility, hatchability and day‐old chicks hatched from their eggs were measured at the end of the experiment. The percentage of egg production and egg mass of the 6 mg/kg Fe₃O₄‐Cys NPs group were significantly higher than those of the control groups. Throughout the experimental period, the highest weekly egg weight was recorded for the 60 mg/kg Fe₃O₄‐Cys NPs group. Fertility was improved by diet supplemented with iron, both FeSO₄ and Fe₃O₄‐Cys NPs. The breeder fed Fe₃O₄‐Cys NPs had the highest day‐old chicks weight. The results of this study showed that Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles that were coated by L‐cysteine could improve availability and utilization of iron in diet. Finally, it was proposed that Fe₃O₄‐Cys NPs could be used as feed additives in quails.  aPublisher supplied data 3acages 3achicks 3acysteine 3adietary supplements 3aegg production 3aegg weight 3aeggs 3aexperimental diets 3afeed additives 3afeed intake 3aferrous sulfate 3ahens 3airon 3airon oxides 3amales 3ananoparticles 3aquails 3areproductive performance1 aFarzinpour, A1 aVaziry, A0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2017 Apr., v. 52, no. 2 p.298-304dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.129023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02235naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245005500177500001900232520102500251592002801276650001501304650003601319650001701355650001701372650001101389650001901400650002601419653001701445653002501462653002401487653002201511653004001533700002201573700003101595773013001626856008401756852000901840655001201849IND60689849820221120232508.0200523e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068984982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2020.1023662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPellicer, José Antonio10aPectin methylesterase inactivation by pulsed light  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPectinmethylesterase (PME) is a degradative enzyme of the cloudiness of fruit juices. Pulsed light (PL) is a non-thermal technology able to inactivate enzymes. This work aimed to assess the potential inactivation of PME by PL and to explain how it occurs. To this, a suspension of the enzyme was treated with PL up to 128 J/cm². The inactivation curve was built and structural changes were determined by far-UV circular dichroism, intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence and spectrophotometry. Furthermore, the presence/absence of unfolding intermediaries was assessed by phase-diagram analysis. PL was able to inactivate PME with a first-order kinetic rate of 0.034 cm²/J. The inactive protein seemed to have a molten-globule structure, due to the conserved secondary structure and modified tertiary structure. Phase diagram data fitted a single line, which is consistent with absence of unfolding intermediaries. A significant increase in absorbance at 420 nm (p < 0.05) showed that PL promoted enzyme aggregation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3afluorescence 3afood science 3afruits 3apectinesterase 3aultraviolet radiation 0aPulsed light 0aPectinmethylesterase 0aEnzyme inactivation 0aProtein structure 0aInactivation kinetics, fruit juices1 aNavarro, Patricia1 aGómez-López, Vicente M.,0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2020 June, v. 62 p.102366-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2020.1023663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013900173300001600312520121700328592002801545650002201573650001701595650002001612650001101632650002101643650002001664650001001684650001201694650001001706651002101716653002201737653002101759653002201780653001001802653001401812653001101826700001901837773009001856856008501946852000902031655001202040IND60589698420221121082520.0210904e20180415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058969842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.02.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUnakıtan, Gökhan12aA comparison of energy use efficiency and economic analysis of wheat and sunflower production in Turkey: A case study in Thrace Region  ap. 279-285.  aMain objectives of this study were to define total amount of input usage and do the economic comparison of wheat and sunflower production in Thrace Region in Turkey and to determine the energy equivalent of these inputs. The data of this study was collected by survey method which was carried out face to face with 169 wheat and sunflower producers in Thrace Region. The total energy inputs in wheat and sunflower production were determined to be 23,231 MJ ha⁻¹ and 10,139 MJ ha⁻¹ and based on the energy output, it was noticed that energy outputs in wheat (including straw) and sunflower production were determined to be 81,720 MJ and 38,250 MJ, respectively. Energy use efficiency, energy productivity, specific energy and net energy in wheat production were calculated as 3.52, 0.19 kg MJ⁻¹, 5.16 MJ kg⁻¹ and 58,489 MJ ha⁻¹ respectively in wheat production and 3.77, 0.15 kg MJ⁻¹, 6.63 MJ kg⁻¹ and 28,111 MJ ha⁻¹ respectively in sunflower production.

Still, there remains very little empirical work focused on how fields are divided. Under local interpretations of Islamic law, parcels resulting from division should be of equal size. Complicating this is the potential for within-field variation in soil fertility which may result in parcels of unequal fertility. Research was conducted in western Niger to understand how these considerations affect the placing of boundaries when fields are divided. In two adjoining village territories, a random sample of farmers were interviewed about soil quality variation in their fields and how their management may vary within these fields. Interviews were conducted with those who oversee the division of fields: village chiefs and Islamic clergy. The divisions of 92 fields resulting from 43 household splits over a twenty-one-year period were analyzed. Group interviews of the parties to these splits were conducted and for 54 of the divided fields, soil quality variation was mapped. This information was used to assess the equality of the parcels resulting from division in terms of area and fertility. Unequal divisions were also accessed for bias toward the eldest party to the division. We find that soil fertility variation is an important consideration in the placement of boundaries and requirements for equal parcel size is not significant impediment to creating parcels of comparable fertility.

We analyzed these two phenomena by turning emissions into a per capita term, and extending the impact from the traditional urbanization rate effect to include population density effect. Our results show that population density has actually been the dominant demographic player in changing per capita emissions for the past two decades in China, and its elasticity changed from positive in economically less-developed provinces to negative for the developed provinces. This study therefore provides a new perspective in the study of the relationship between urbanization and greenhouse gas emissions, and our results indicate that population density change should be taken into account to accurately assess the impact of urbanization.  aPublisher supplied data 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3apopulation density 3aurban areas 3aurban population 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aPopulation migration 0aUrbanization 0aGHG emissions 0aChina1 aGao, Chaochao1 aLu, YingYing,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 July 20, v. 157 p.299-309dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.04.1383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245015500160300001600315500002000331520128800351592002801639650002001667650001601687650001101703650002001714650001401734650001701748650001801765650001901783650002801802650002401830650001801854650004401872650001401916700001601930700002001946700002101966700001501987773011402002856007302116852000902189655001202198IND60572100920221118012028.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057210092DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.129002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatitmanwiwat, S10aLipid and protein oxidation levels in spermatozoa and seminal plasma of Asian Elephants (Elephas maximus) and their relationship with semen parameters  ap. 283-288.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPeroxidation damage to spermatozoa and seminal plasma has an important role in sperm quality. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the levels of lipid and protein oxidation in spermatozoa and seminal plasma of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) with varying percentage of progressive motility. Lipid and protein oxidation was measured by the thiobarbituric acid‐reactive species (TBARS) assay and the 2, 4‐dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) carbonyl groups assay, respectively. Fresh semen samples were collected from Asian elephants and classified according to the percentage of motile spermatozoa into good (>60%) and poor (≤20%) motility. Results revealed that seminal plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) and seminal plasma protein carbonyls (PCs) were significantly higher in poor motility than in good motility (p < .05). The MDA and PC levels in seminal plasma were negatively correlated with the percentages of progressive motility (p < .05). In addition, the negative correlation between sperm concentration and seminal plasma MDA level was investigated (p < .05). The sperm viability was also negatively correlated with sperm PC level (p < .05). This study indicated that lipid and protein oxidation has deleterious effect on semen quality of Asian elephants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElephas maximus 3acorrelation 3alipids 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidation 3aperoxidation 3asemen quality 3aseminal plasma 3aseminal plasma proteins 3asperm concentration 3asperm quality 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3aviability1 aPromthep, K1 aBuranaamnuay, K1 aMahasawangkul, S1 aSaikhun, K0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2017 Apr., v. 52, no. 2 p.283-288dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.129003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245017900164300001600343520116600359592002801525650002001553650002201573650000901595650001001604650003301614650001101647650001201658650001401670650001801684650001801702650002201720651001001742651001001752653000901762653003401771653002601805653001501831653001601846653000901862653001001871700001501881773010101896856008201997852000902079655001202088IND50090636520221121162455.0210302e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009063652DNAL7 a10.2478/s11687-014-0221-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAthokpam, V.10aMorphological and molecular characterization of Posthodiplostomum sp.

The fish host C. punctata from Lamphel area revealed a diplostomid metacercarial infection. Morphologically, the recovered metacercaria was identified as a species of Posthodiplostomum Dubois, 1936. Molecular characterization using the ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA 18S, ITS2 and 28S regions) and the mitochondrial CO1 region supplements the identification. Molecular analysis revealed the metacercaria to be closely related to Posthodiplostomum sp. Japan isolate, with sequence similarity variation from 97.5–99.7 % while considering for the three rDNA markers. The secondary structure of the ITS2 region further corroborated these results; the typical four-helix model, when compared to the taxon from Japan, showed differences only in twelve bases (with seven transitions and five transversions). In phylogenetic analysis also, the metacercaria claded with the genus Posthodiplostomum, coming closer to the Japanese isolate, thus supplementing the morphological identification of the metacercaria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChanna punctata 3aPosthodiplostomum 3afish 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amodels 3amuscles 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence homology 3aIndia 3aJapan 0afish 0aChanna punctata; metacercaria 0aPosthodiplostomum sp. 0amorphology 0amorphometry 0arDNA 0amtCO11 aTandon, V.0 tHelminthologia.g2014 June 1, v. 51, no. 2 p.141-152dVersitawJournal:jnl24740x1336-90837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11687-014-0221-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245007800209300001800287506007600305520131800381592002801699506003701727650002001764650002901784650001201813650001901825650001101844650002101855650002201876650002101898650001901919650001701938651001401955651002601969653001201995653001302007700001702020700002002037700002202057700002102079700002002100700002102120700001802141700002302159700001802182700001902200700002402219700002002243700002002263773017202283856007902455852000902534655001202543IND60230318620221207135013.0150614e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023031862DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12224751102doi7 aPMC39482592pmcid7 a243442752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaddeland, Ingjerd10aGlobal water resources affected by human interventions and climate change  ap. 3251-3256.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHumans directly change the dynamics of the water cycle through dams constructed for water storage, and through water withdrawals for industrial, agricultural, or domestic purposes. Climate change is expected to additionally affect water supply and demand. Here, analyses of climate change and direct human impacts on the terrestrial water cycle are presented and compared using a multimodel approach. Seven global hydrological models have been forced with multiple climate projections, and with and without taking into account impacts of human interventions such as dams and water withdrawals on the hydrological cycle. Model results are analyzed for different levels of global warming, allowing for analyses in line with temperature targets for climate change mitigation. The results indicate that direct human impacts on the water cycle in some regions, e.g., parts of Asia and in the western United States, are of the same order of magnitude, or even exceed impacts to be expected for moderate levels of global warming (+2 K). Despite some spread in model projections, irrigation water consumption is generally projected to increase with higher global mean temperatures. Irrigation water scarcity is particularly large in parts of southern and eastern Asia, and is expected to become even larger in the future.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair temperature 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate 3aglobal warming 3ahumans 3ahydrologic cycle 3ahydrologic models 3airrigation water 3asupply balance 3awater supply 3aEast Asia 3aWestern United States 0aISI-MIP 0aWaterMIP1 aHeinke, Jens1 aBiemans, Hester1 aEisner, Stephanie1 aFlörke, Martina1 aHanasaki, Naota1 aKonzmann, Markus1 aLudwig, Fulco1 aMasaki, Yoshimitsu1 aSchewe, Jacob1 aStacke, Tobias1 aTessler, Zachary D.1 aWada, Yoshihide1 aWisser, Dominik0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Mar. 4, v. 111, no. 9 p.3251-3256dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12224751103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012700173300001400300520103700314592002801351650001601379650002101395650002601416650001401442650001401456650001801470650001701488650001001505650001101515650002101526650001301547650003101560653001401591653001701605653001901622653002601641700001701667700001901684700001801703700001801721700001701739773008301756856008501839852000901924655001201933IND60114007520221120042025.0161024e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011400752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2012.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWijesekara, Isuru10aInduction of apoptosis in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells by neoechinulin A from marine-derived fungus Microsporum sp.  ap. 68-72.  aRecently, the relationship between apoptosis and cancer has been emphasized and the induction of apoptosis is recognized as one of the key mechanisms of anti-cancer agents. Marine-derived fungi are valuable sources of structurally diverse bioactive compounds with anticancer activity. In the present study, a marine-derived fungus, Microsporum sp. was cultured and a prenylated indole alkaloid, neoechinulin A was isolated from the culture broth extract. Neoechinulin A has shown cytotoxic effect on human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells and its apoptosis induction in HeLa cells was investigated by the expressions of p53, p21, Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase 9, and Caspase 3 proteins. Western blot analysis has revealed that neoechinulin A could induce cell apoptosis through down-regulating of Bcl-2 expression, up-regulating of Bax expression, and activating the caspase-3 pathway. Collectively, these results suggest that neoechinulin A could be a potential candidate in the field of anticancer drug discovery against human cervical cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrosporum 3aWestern blotting 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3aculture media 3acytotoxicity 3afungi 3ahumans 3aindole alkaloids 3aproteins 3auterine cervical neoplasms 0aApoptosis 0aMarine fungi 0aNeoechinulin A 0aSecondary metabolites1 aLi, Yong-Xin1 aVo, Thanh-Sang1 aVan Ta, Quang1 aNgo, Dai-Hung1 aKim, Se-Kwon0 tProcess Biochemistry.g2013 Jan., v. 48 p.68-72dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2012.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04294naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245012400208300001800332506007600350520183300426592002802259506003702287650003102324650002302355650001902378650001102397650001902408650001202427650001902439650002102458650001902479650002502498650001602523650002502539651001302564651001402577651001902591651001002610651002502620651001802645651001802663651002002681653000902701653000802710653001302718653000802731653001202739700002002751700002302771700002002794700002102814700002102835700002002856700002202876700002002898700002102918700001702939700001602956700002502972700001902997700002003016700002303036700001803059700002103077700002203098700002203120700002103142700002003163700002103183773017203204856007903376852000903455655001203464IND60230318820221207135000.0150614e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023031882DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12224771102doi7 aPMC39482362pmcid7 a243442652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFriend, Andrew D.10aCarbon residence time dominates uncertainty in terrestrial vegetation responses to future climate and atmospheric CO₂  ap. 3280-3285.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFuture climate change and increasing atmospheric CO ₂ are expected to cause major changes in vegetation structure and function over large fractions of the global land surface. Seven global vegetation models are used to analyze possible responses to future climate simulated by a range of general circulation models run under all four representative concentration pathway scenarios of changing concentrations of greenhouse gases. All 110 simulations predict an increase in global vegetation carbon to 2100, but with substantial variation between vegetation models. For example, at 4 °C of global land surface warming (510–758 ppm of CO ₂), vegetation carbon increases by 52–477 Pg C (224 Pg C mean), mainly due to CO ₂ fertilization of photosynthesis. Simulations agree on large regional increases across much of the boreal forest, western Amazonia, central Africa, western China, and southeast Asia, with reductions across southwestern North America, central South America, southern Mediterranean areas, southwestern Africa, and southwestern Australia. Four vegetation models display discontinuities across 4 °C of warming, indicating global thresholds in the balance of positive and negative influences on productivity and biomass. In contrast to previous global vegetation model studies, we emphasize the importance of uncertainties in projected changes in carbon residence times. We find, when all seven models are considered for one representative concentration pathway × general circulation model combination, such uncertainties explain 30% more variation in modeled vegetation carbon change than responses of net primary productivity alone, increasing to 151% for non-HYBRID4 models. A change in research priorities away from production and toward structural dynamics and demographic processes is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3abiomass production 3aboreal forests 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3agreenhouse gases 3aphotosynthesis 3aprimary productivity 3auncertainty 3avegetation structure 3aAmazonia 3aAustralia 3aCentral Africa 3aChina 3aMediterranean region 3aNorth America 3aSouth America 3aSouth East Asia 0aDGVM 0aGVM 0aturnover 0aNPP 0aISI-MIP1 aLucht, Wolfgang1 aRademacher, Tim T.1 aKeribin, Rozenn1 aBėtts, Richard,1 aCadule, Patricia1 aCiais, Philippe1 aClark, Douglas B.1 aDankers, Rutger1 aFalloon, Pete D.1 aIto, Akihiko1 aKahana, Ron1 aKleidon, A.q(Axel),1 aLomas, Mark R.1 aNishina, Kazuya1 aOstberg, Sebastian1 aPavlick, Ryan1 aPeylin, Philippe1 aSchaphoff, Sibyll1 aVuichard, Nicolas1 aWarszawski, Lila1 aWiltshire, Andy1 aWoodward, F.

Considering that the moisture content of dry land is usually changeable, it is essential to investigate the effect of biochar on soil N₂O emission under different moisture contents. Therefore, column experiments were conducted with two biochars (B300 and B500, biochars pyrolyzed at 300 and 500 °C, respectively) under five moisture contents (18%, 21%, 24%, 27% and 30%, w/w). The results showed that B300 promoted N₂O emission under the moisture contents of 18%, 21% and 24% by increasing the content of dissolved organic carbon and thus enhancing the microbial processes related to N₂O production. However, when the moisture contents were 27% and 30%, the promotion of N₂O production was overwhelmed by the improvement in N₂O reduction due to the B300 induced increase in the abundance ratio of nosZ to nirS, leading to the decrease in N₂O emission. Moreover, B500 did not alter the content of dissolved organic matter significantly and thus caused no significant change in N₂O emission when the moisture contents were 18%, 21% and 24%. But it was able to increase the abundance ratio of nosZ to nirS and thus decrease N₂O emission when the moisture contents were 27% and 30%. The results further clarified the effect of biochar on soil N₂O emission and helped to evaluate the N₂O-suppressing-potential of biochar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3abiochar 3adissolved organic carbon 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3anitrous oxide 3asoil 3asoil amendments 3awater content 0aBiochar 0aNitrous oxide 0aMoisture content1 aSheng, Yaqi1 aCai, Fei1 aWang, Wei1 aZhu, Lizhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5044-277X0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 645 p.887-894dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.2243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03327naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006000144245007800204300002000282520180600302592002802108596009102136596009102227650001502318650002802333650001602361650001502377653003002392653002402422653001902446653002002465653003902485653002902524700002002553700006102573700006502634773014202699856007902841852000902920655001202929IND60776320120221120132901.0220505e20220422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077632012DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c028852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Tanweepriya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9472-333510aAnisotropic Particle Fabrication Using Thermal Scanning Probe Lithography  ap. 19878-19888.  aSize, shape, and chemical properties of nanoparticles are powerful tools to modulate the optical and physicochemical properties of a particle suspension. Despite having many methods to synthesize anisotropic nanoparticles, often there are challenges in terms of controlling the polydispersity, shape, size, or composition of anisotropic nanoparticles. This work has been inspired by the potential for developing a unique pathway to make different shaped monodispersed anisotropic nano- and microparticles with large flexibility in material choice. Compared to existing methods, this state-of-the-art nanolithographic method is fast, easy to prototype, and much simple in terms of its mechanical requirement. We show that this technique has been efficiently used to make a variety of anisotropic nano- and microparticles of different shapes, such as triangular prisms, ovals, disks, flowers, and stairs following the same pathway, at the same time showing the potential of being flexible with respect to the composition of the particles. The thermal scanning probe lithographic method in combination with dry reactive ion etching was used to make two-dimensional and three-dimensional templates for the fabrication of anisotropic nano- and microparticles. Deposition of different metal/metal oxides by the electron-beam evaporation method onto these templates allowed us to fabricate a range of nanomaterials according to the required functionality in potential applications. The particles were characterized by atomic force microscopy, He-ion microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering to ensure that the developed method is reproducible, flexible, and robust in choosing the shapes for making monodispersed anisotropic nanoparticles with great control over shape and size.  aPublisher supplied data  aDP150101156cARC Centre for Nanoscale BioPhotonicsdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100015360  aLE160100124cARC Centre for Nanoscale BioPhotonicsdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100015360 3aanisotropy 3aatomic force microscopy 3aevaporation 3aprototypes 0aanisotropic nanoparticles 0aJanus nanoparticles 0amicroparticles 0ananolithography 0athermal scanning probe lithography 0atemplate-directed method1 aSmith, James D.1 aUddin, Md Hemayet1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3618-96531 aDagastine, Raymond R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2154-48460 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Apr. 22, v. 14, no. 17 p.19878-19888dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c028853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01534naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010500164300001600269520036700285592002800652650002500680650003300705650001600738650002700754651001100781653003100792653002400823653002500847700001700872700001600889700001700905700002100922700002500943773010100968856008201069852000901151655001201160IND50090636820221121133058.0210302e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009063682DNAL7 a10.2478/s11687-014-0224-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTumialis, D.10aSteinernema kraussei (Steiner, 1923) (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae) — the first record from Poland  ap. 162-166.  aThis study reports the first record of Steinernema kraussei from Poland.

To meet the pressing need of safe and cost-efficient PED maternal vaccines against PEDV variant, we vaccinated growing piglets with a flagellin-adjuvanted PED vaccine rSF-COE-3D by injection at Houhai acupoint. The vaccination not only enhanced the antibody responses of serum IgG/IgA, mucosal IgA and serum neutralizing antibody, but also improved the production of IFN-γ and IL-4. Moreover, rSF-COE-3D could provide a better protection against the challenge of a high pathogenic PEDV variant, with less diarrhea pigs, less pigs with detectable PEDV shed, lower rank values of feces and less apparent lesions and inflammation in duodenum of the PEDV infected pigs. The improved protective efficiency of rSF-COE-3D compared with COE was mostly benefited from the enhanced production of serum IgA, mucosal IgA in feces and serum neutralizing antibody titers. Taken together, our data suggest that rSF-COE-3D would be a novel efficient PED vaccine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal use reduction 3ablood serum 3acost effectiveness 3adiarrhea 3aduodenum 3afeces 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-4 3amortality 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3apiglets 3asubunit vaccines 3asuckling 3avaccination 0aPorcine epidemic diarrhea 0aFlagellin 0aSubunit vaccine 0aProtective efficiency1 aXu, Zhichao1 aWu, Tingting1 aPeng, Ouyang1 aHuang, Licheng1 aZhang, Yun1 aXue, Chunyi1 aWen, Zhifen1 aZhou, Qingfeng1 aCao, Yongchang0 tVaccine.g2018 July 05, v. 36, no. 29 p.4228-4235dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.05.1243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03502naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245012200159300002000281520118200301592002801483596009801511596009801609596009801707596009801805596011301903596009402016650001502110650001602125650001802141650001202159650001702171650001302188650001402201650001102215650001102226653003202237653002302269653002502292653003102317653003202348700005302380700001602433700001702449700001402466700001902480700001402499700001702513700001602530700001502546700001702561700001102578700001202589700005702601773014202658856007902800852000902879655001202888IND60776320320221120122240.0220505e20220419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077632032DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c029792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Jun10aFlexible Full-Surface Conformal Encapsulation for Each Fiber in Graphene Glass Fiber Fabric against Thermal Oxidation  ap. 19889-19896.  aEncapsulation for carbon-based electronic devices against oxidation can enhance their long-term working stability. Graphene glass fiber fabric (GGFF), as an advanced flexible electrothermal material, also struggles with graphene oxidation. The flexible, full-surface, conformal encapsulation for each fiber in the large-area fabric puts forward high requirements for encapsulating materials and techniques. Herein, the nanometer-thick h-BN layer was in situ grown on cambered surfaces of each fiber in GGFF with the chemical vapor deposition method. Stable heating duration (500 °C) of h-BN-encapsulated GGFF (h-BN/GGFF) was increased by 1 order of magnitude without compromising the electrothermal performances and flexibility. Theoretical simulations revealed that the enhanced oxidation resistance of h-BN/GGFF was attributed to the decreased interaction and adsorption life of oxygen. The proposed flexible, full-surface, conformal encapsulation technique targeting the fiber-shaped graphene electrothermal device is scalable and can be extended to the other carbon materials, even devices with intricate shapes, which will promote the development of flexible electronics.  aPublisher supplied data  a51432002cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a52021006cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aT2188101cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aU1904193cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aZ201100008720006cBeijing Municipal Science and Technology Commissiondhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100009592  aBNLMS-CXTD-202001cBeijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aadsorption 3aelectronics 3aencapsulation 3afabrics 3aglass fibers 3agraphene 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3avapors 0agraphene glass fiber fabric 0ah-BN encapsulation 0aoxidation resistance 0ahigh-temperature stability 0aelectrothermal performances1 aCheng, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5865-06851 aSun, Xiucai1 aHuang, Kewen1 aWang, Kun1 aCheng, Shuting1 aYuan, Hao1 aLiu, Ruojuan1 aLi, Wenjuan1 aZhang, Hui1 aLi, Junliang1 aTu, Ce1 aQi, Yue1 aLiu, Zhongfan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0065-79880 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Apr. 19, v. 14, no. 17 p.19889-19896dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c029793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245016200154300001400316500002000330520159100350592002801941650001501969650002101984650001502005650002002020650001402040650001002054650001702064650001202081650001002093650001802103650001802121650001602139650001402155650001102169650001202180650002002192650001402212700001502226700001402241700001602255700001902271700001802290700001402308700001402322700001402336700001502350700001602365700002202381700001502403700001402418700001402432700001402446773011202460856007302572852000902645655001202654IND60572098320221118062756.0170712e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057209832DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.128032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSousa, FCA10aOrganogenesis and foetal haemodynamics during the normal gestation of healthy black‐rumped agoutis (Dasyprocta prymnolopha, Wagler, 1831) bred in captivity  ap. 60-66.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe objective of this study was to define the patterns of organogenesis and foetal haemodynamics during the normal gestation of healthy agoutis (Dasyprocta prymnolopha) kept in captivity. Thirty pregnant agoutis that ranged in size from small to medium and weighed between 2.5 and 3 kg underwent B‐mode and Doppler ultrasonography for the biometric evaluation of the foetal organs. The foetal aortic blood flow proved to be predominantly systolic, and the measured flow velocity was 78.89 ± 2.95 cm/s, with a maximum pressure gradient of 2.12 ± 0.27 mmHg. The liver was characterized by its large volume, occupying the entire cranial aspect of the abdominal cavity, and it was associated cranially with the diaphragm and caudally with the stomach. The flow velocity in the portal vein was estimated to equal 12.17 ± 2.37 cm/s, with a resistivity index of 0.82 ± 0.05. The gallbladder was centrally located and protruded cranially towards the diaphragm. The spleen was visualized as an elongated structure with tapered cranial and caudal extremities, and the foetal kidneys were visualized bilaterally in the retroperitoneal region, with the right kidney positioned slightly more cranially than the left. The morphological characterization and hemodynamic analysis of the foetal organs of black‐rumped agoutis via B‐mode and Doppler ultrasonography allow determination of the vascular network and of reference values for the blood flow required for perfusing the anatomical elements essential for maintaining the viability of foetuses at different gestational ages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDasyprocta 3aabdominal cavity 3ablood flow 3acaptive animals 3adiaphragm 3afetus 3agall bladder 3akidneys 3aliver 3anormal values 3aorganogenesis 3aportal vein 3apregnancy 3aspleen 3astomach 3aultrasonography 3aviability1 aPessoa, GT1 aMoura, LS1 aAraújo, JR1 aRodrigues, RPS1 aBarbosa, MAPS1 aDiniz, AN1 aSouza, AB1 aSilva, EG1 aLucena, LU1 aSanches, MP1 aSilva‐Filho, OF1 aGuerra, PC1 aSousa, JM1 aNeves, WC1 aAlves, FR0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2017 Feb., v. 52, no. 1 p.60-66dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.128033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024003700128040001800165100002200183245011200205300001800317520098900335596008301324650001101407650001801418650001601436650001801452650001701470650001001487650002001497650001901517650001301536650002101549650001401570700001701584700001501601700001601616700002001632773017901652856008101831852000901912655001201921IND60519267420221121024900.0160425e20151104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051926742DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b036322doi7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b036322chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrewer, Lauren R.10aGlycemic Response and Fermentation of Crystalline Short Linear α-Glucans from Debranched Waxy Maize Starch  ap. 9528-9535.  aThe glycemic index (GI) is used to rank foods based on postprandial blood glucose response. GI test requires that 50 g of available carbohydrate be used. Available carbohydrate is often calculated as total carbohydrate minus dietary fiber; yet, AOAC fiber methods do not always include resistant starch (RS). The objective of this study was to examine GI response and fermentation properties of crystalline short-chain α-glucan (CSCA), which has high RS content, but no total dietary fiber (TDF) content as measured by AOAC method 991.43. Using the standard GI method, 10 adults were fed 50 g of waxy maize starch and CSCA, consumed alone and in mixed formulation. Breath hydrogen was also determined over 6 h. Fifty grams of CSCA was not entirely available in vivo, and breath hydrogen testing indicated that CSCA was as likely to ferment. Products high in RS, but with no TDF, would yield reduced GI values, and this calls for the need of a method to define available carbohydrate.  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825 3aadults 3ablood glucose 3acorn starch 3adietary fiber 3afermentation 3afoods 3aglycemic effect 3aglycemic index 3ahydrogen 3aresistant starch 3awaxy corn1 aWeber, Casey1 aHaub, Mark1 aCai, Liming1 aShi, Yong-Cheng0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 Nov. 4, v. 63, no. 43 p.9528-9535dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals DivisionwJournal:jnl54923x0021-85617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b036323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03947naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003400135040001800169100002000187245018700207300001200394506007600406520228000482592002802762506003702790650001202827650001302839650001702852650001002869650001202879650001002891650001202901650001702913650002002930650001002950650002102960650000902981650000902990650004802999650001103047700002003058700001903078700002103097700001903118700003203137700002003169700002103189773011703210856008103327852000903408655001203417IND50090637020221207124552.0210908e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009063702DNAL7 aPMC40655782pmcid7 a249300082pmid7 a10.1186/1746-6148-10-1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKünzler, Rahel10aObserved management practices in relation to the risk of infection with paratuberculosis and to the spread of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosisin Swiss dairy and beef herds  ap. 132.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Many studies have been conducted to define risk factors for the transmission of bovine paratuberculosis, mostly in countries with large herds. Little is known about the epidemiology in infected Swiss herds and risk factors important for transmission in smaller herds. Therefore, the presence of known factors which might favor the spread of paratuberculosis and could be related to the prevalence at animal level of fecal shedding of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis were assessed in 17 infected herds (10 dairy, 7 beef). Additionally, the level of knowledge of herd managers about the disease was assessed. In a case–control study with 4 matched negative control herds per infected herd, the association of potential risk factors with the infection status of the herd was investigated. RESULTS: Exposure of the young stock to feces of older animals was frequently observed in infected and in control herds. The farmers’ knowledge about paratuberculosis was very limited, even in infected herds. An overall prevalence at animal level of fecal shedding of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis of 6.1% was found in infected herds, whereby shedders younger than 2 years of age were found in 46.2% of the herds where the young stock was available for testing. Several factors related to contamination of the heifer area with cows’ feces and the management of the calving area were found to be significantly associated with the within-herd prevalence. Animal purchase was associated with a positive herd infection status (OR = 7.25, p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Numerous risk factors favoring the spread of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis from adult animals to the young stock were observed in infected Swiss dairy and beef herds, which may be amenable to improvement in order to control the disease. Important factors were contamination of the heifer and the calving area, which were associated with higher within-herd prevalence of fecal shedding. The awareness of farmers of paratuberculosis was very low, even in infected herds. Animal purchase in a herd was significantly associated with the probability of a herd to be infected and is thus the most important factor for the control of the spread of disease between farms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aheifers 3amanagers 3aepidemiology 3aherds 3afarmers 3afarms 3acalving 3arisk factors 3adisease control 3afeces 3aparatuberculosis 3abeef 3acows 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3aadults1 aTorgerson, Paul1 aKeller, Selina1 aWittenbrink, Max1 aStephan, Roger1 aKnubben-Schweizer, Gabriela1 aBerchtold, Beat1 aMeylan, Mireille0 tBMC veterinary research.g2014 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.132-132dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-10-1323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04202naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100002200197245011100219300001400330506007600344520232200420592002802742506003702770650002102807650001402828650001902842650001702861650002002878650002502898650002002923650001102943650001402954650001502968650001302983650001302996650001503009650002303024653001303047653002603060653001903086653002403105653002303129653003303152700002403185700002003209700002903229700002403258700001803282700002703300700002303327700006103350773009003411856009003501852000903591655001203600IND60606791620221207115714.0180730e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060679162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.05.0112doi7 aPMC49108732pmcid7 a272146502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParmar, Paresh A.10aTemporally degradable collagen–mimetic hydrogels tuned to chondrogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells  ap. 56-71.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTissue engineering strategies for repairing and regenerating articular cartilage face critical challenges to recapitulate the dynamic and complex biochemical microenvironment of native tissues. One approach to mimic the biochemical complexity of articular cartilage is through the use of recombinant bacterial collagens as they provide a well–defined biological ‘blank template’ that can be modified to incorporate bioactive and biodegradable peptide sequences within a precisely defined three–dimensional system. We customized the backbone of a Streptococcal collagen–like 2 (Scl2) protein with heparin–binding, integrin–binding, and hyaluronic acid–binding peptide sequences previously shown to modulate chondrogenesis and then cross–linked the recombinant Scl2 protein with a combination of matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7)– and aggrecanase (ADAMTS4)–cleavable peptides at varying ratios to form biodegradable hydrogels with degradation characteristics matching the temporal expression pattern of these enzymes in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) during chondrogenesis. hMSCs encapsulated within the hydrogels cross–linked with both degradable peptides exhibited enhanced chondrogenic characteristics as demonstrated by gene expression and extracellular matrix deposition compared to the hydrogels cross–linked with a single peptide. Additionally, these combined peptide hydrogels displayed increased MMP7 and ADAMTS4 activities and yet increased compression moduli after 6 weeks, suggesting a positive correlation between the degradation of the hydrogels and the accumulation of matrix by hMSCs undergoing chondrogenesis. Our results suggest that including dual degradation motifs designed to respond to enzymatic activity of hMSCs going through chondrogenic differentiation led to improvements in chondrogenesis. Our hydrogel system demonstrates a bimodal enzymatically degradable biological platform that can mimic native cellular processes in a temporal manner. As such, this novel collagen–mimetic protein, cross–linked via multiple enzymatically degradable peptides, provides a highly adaptable and well defined platform to recapitulate a high degree of biological complexity, which could be applicable to numerous tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiodegradability 3acartilage 3achondrogenesis 3acrosslinking 3aenzyme activity 3aextracellular matrix 3agene expression 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3amatrilysin 3amedicine 3apeptides 3astem cells 3atissue engineering 0aHydrogel 0aMesenchymal stem cell 0aBiodegradation 0aBiomimetic material 0aBacterial collagen 0aCartilage tissue engineering1 aSkaalure, Stacey C.1 aChow, Lesley W.1 aSt-Pierre, Jean-Philippe1 aStoichevska, Violet1 aPeng, Yong Y.1 aWerkmeister, Jerome A.1 aRamshaw, John A.M.1 aStevens, Molly M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7335-266X0 tBiomaterials.g2016 Aug., v. 99 p.56-71dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03314naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100003400171245014000205300001600345520117600361592002801537650002701565650002101592650001801613650001201631650002001643650001501663650001401678650001801692650003201710650001201742650001501754650002101769650000701790650002001797650001301817650001601830650001201846650002301858650001201881650002601893650003301919650004001952650002101992650005602013650003102069650001302100650005002113650003602163653001202199653002402211653003402235653001202269700003402281700003402315700003402349700002602383700002802409773010702437856008702544852000902631655001202640IND50067377020221122145214.0190402e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006737702DNAL7 a237908712pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.03.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillalba-Villalba, Ana Gloria10aTrypsin from viscera of vermiculated sailfin catfish, Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus, Weber, 1991: Its purification and characterization  ap. 940-945.  aPterygoplichthys disjunctivus viscera trypsin was purified by fractionation with ammonium sulphate, gel filtration, affinity and ion exchange chromatography (DEAE-Sepharose). Trypsin molecular weight was approximately 27.5kDa according to SDS–PAGE, shown a single band in zymography. It exhibited maximal activity at pH 9.5 and 40°C, using N-benzoyl-dl-arginine-p-nitroanilide (BAPNA) as substrate. Enzyme was effectively inhibited by phenyl methyl sulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) (100%), N-α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) (85.4%), benzamidine (80.2%), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (75.6%) and partially inhibited by N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) (10.3%), ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (8.7%) and pepstatin A (1.2%). Enzyme activity was slightly affected by metal ions (Fe2+>Hg2+>Mn2+>K+>Mg2+>Li+>Cu2+). Trypsin activity decreased continuously as NaCl concentration increased (0–30%). Km and kcat values were 0.13mM and 1.46s−1, respectively. Results suggest the enzyme have a potential application where room processing temperatures (25–35°C) or high salt (30%) concentration are needed, such as in fish sauce production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aammonium sulfate 3aanimal organs 3acatfish 3aenzyme activity 3afiltration 3afluorides 3afractionation 3aion exchange chromatography 3aketones 3ametal ions 3amolecular weight 3apH 3asodium chloride 3asoybeans 3atemperature 3atrypsin 3atrypsin inhibitors 2aAnimals 2aCatfishesxmetabolism 2aChromatography, Ion Exchange 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEnzyme Stability 2aFish Proteinsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aTrypsinxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aVisceraxchemistryxenzymology. 0aTrypsin 0aEnzyme purification 0aPterygoplichthys disjunctivus 0aViscera1 aRamírez-Suárez, Juan Carlos1 aValenzuela-Soto, Elisa Miriam1 aSánchez, Guillermina García1 aRuiz, Gisela Carvallo1 aPacheco Aguilar, Ramon,0 tFood chemistry.g2013 Nov. 15, v. 141, no. 2 p.940-945dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.03.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245011900177300001800296520157700314592002801891650001201919650001401931650001401945650001401959650002001973650001801993650001102011650001902022650000702041650000902048700002202057700002502079700001902104700002202123773011102145856008102256852000902337655001202346IND60602882520221119063959.0180711e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060288252DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-018-1882-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNikkhah Dafchahi, Mostafa10aExploring the influence of initial liquor pH in the pre-hydrolysis stage on alpha-cellulose production from poplar  ap. 4783-4790.  aThe effect of using auto pre-hydrolysis liquor, acidic pre-hydrolysis liquor, and alkaline pre-hydrolysis liquor on the production of alpha cellulose from poplar was investigated across this research work. Poplar chips were pulped with soda-AQ pulping process at a kappa number of 15 after being pre-hydrolyzed with different pre-hydrolysis liquors at 170 °C. The residual lignin of chips were more delignified by about 40% using a single stage oxygen delignification and totally bleached with a D₀ED₁ bleaching sequence. The results indicated that the yield and kappa number of the pulps can be affected by the kind of pre-hydrolysis liquor. In general, using acidic and alkaline catalysts in pre-hydrolysis liquor led to an acceleration in the rate of hemicellulose separation and kappa number reduction. The alkaline pre-hydrolysis and auto pre-hydrolysis had the highest and the least efficiency to remove hemicelluloses from the wood and purify the produced alpha cellulose, respectively. The alkaline pre-hydrolyzed dissolving pulp of poplar due to existing alkali catalyst in the pre-hydrolysis liquor and occurring alkaline darkening had the least brightness, while the acidic pre-hydrolyzed dissolving pulp, because of the effect of acidic catalyst on the reduction of chromophore compounds, had the highest brightness among the pulps. The results illustrated that a dissolving pulp with more purity and alpha-cellulose content is achievable from Poplar through employing an alkaline pre-hydrolysis stage, soda-AQ pulping, and OD₀ED₁ bleaching sequence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus 3ableaching 3acatalysts 3acellulose 3adissolving pulp 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3aoxygen pulping 3apH 3awood1 aResalati, Hossein1 aSaraeyan, Ahmad Reza1 aGhasemian, Ali1 aShakeri, Ali Reza0 tCellulose.g2018 Aug., v. 25, no. 8 p.4783-4790dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-018-1882-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02286naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003900148245013300187300002000320500001900340520093600359592002801295650000801323650001801331650001201349650001801361650001301379650001101392650002401403650001301427650001601440650002501456651001101481700002301492700003501515700003301550700003301583773016801616856008301784852000901867655001201876IND60693852120221116202317.0200517e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069385212DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-08216-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Aguiar Pontes Pamplona, Ysabely10aRelationship between air pollution and hospitalizations for congestive heart failure in elderly people in the city of São Paulo  ap. 18208-18220.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo evaluate the effects of air pollutants on hospitalizations of elderly people for congestive heart failure (CHF) in the city of São Paulo, stratified by sex, exploring lag structures, from 2000 to 2013. Ecological time series study using information on hospitalization of elderly patients for CHF (ICD-10th: I50) obtained from DATASUS for the city of São Paulo. Information on O₃, PM₁₀, NO₂, SO₂, CO, temperature and humidity was obtained from CETESB. Descriptive analyses, Pearson correlation, and generalized linear Poisson regression model were applied to estimate the effects of pollutants. The interquartile variations of O₃ (52.45 μg/m³), PM₁₀ (24.28 μg/m³), NO₂ (7.63 μg/m³), SO₂ (50.22 μg/m³), and CO (1.28 ppm) were associated with increased hospitalizations for CHF. Air pollutants continue to be a factor that contributes to the increase in the number of hospitalizations due to CHF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3aelderly 3aheart failure 3ahumidity 3apeople 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3aBrazil1 aArbex, Marcos Abdo1 aBraga, Alfésio Luís Ferreira1 aPereira, Luiz Alberto Amador1 aMartins, Lourdes Conceição0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 May, v. 27, no. 15 p.18208-18220dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08216-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245005000170300001600220520141700236592002801653650000801681650002101689650001801710650002301728650001801751650001501769650002201784700001801806700002101824773011201845856008501957852000902042655001202051IND60568109720221122225342.0180831e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056810972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.copbio.2017.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValero, Julián10aInterlocked DNA topologies for nanotechnology  ap. 159-167.  aInterlocked molecular architectures are well known in supramolecular chemistry and are widely used for various applications like sensors, molecular machines and logic gates. The use of DNA for constructing these interlocked structures has increased significantly within the current decade. Because of Watson–Crick base pairing rules, DNA is an excellent material for the self-assembly of well-defined interlocked nanoarchitectures. These DNA nanostructures exhibit sufficient stability, good solubility in aqueous media, biocompatibility, and can be easily combined with other biomolecules in bio-hybrid nano-assemblies. Therefore, the study of novel DNA-based interlocked systems is of interest for nanotechnology, synthetic biology, supramolecular chemistry, biotechnology, and for sensing purposes. Here we summarize recent developments and applications of interlocked supramolecular architectures made of DNA. Examples illustrating that these systems can be precisely controlled by switching on and off the molecular motion of its mechanically trapped components are discussed. Introducing different triggers into such systems creates molecular assemblies capable of performing logic gate operations and/or catalytic activity control. Interlocked DNA-based nanostructures thus represent promising frameworks for building increasingly complex and dynamic nanomachines with highly controllable functionality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiocompatibility 3abiotechnology 3acatalytic activity 3ananomaterials 3asolubility 3asynthetic biology1 aLohmann, Finn1 aFamulok, Michael0 tCurrent opinion in biotechnology.g2017 Dec., v. 48 p.159-167dElsevier LtdwJournal:11964x0958-16697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2017.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245016400170300001600334520131500350592002801665650001201693650001901705650000901724650001101733650001601744650001101760650001701771650002901788650000901817650002001826650001301846650001401859650001501873650001701888650001101905650001801916650002801934650002501962650001801987650001302005650002902018650002502047700002202072700002502094700002002119700002102139773007802160856008402238852000902322655001202331IND60096411220221119074741.0141104e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009641122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2012.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsaksson, Johan10aIntegration of biomass gasification with a Scandinavian mechanical pulp and paper mill – Consequences for mass and energy balances and global CO₂ emissions  ap. 420-428.  aThe Scandinavian mechanical pulp and paper industry has been facing great challenges during the past decades, mainly because of declining demand for newsprint, and higher prices on raw material and energy. One way of increasing profitability is to produce more value-added products besides the production of pulp and paper. In this study, integration potentials of three possible future biomass gasification-based energy mills with an existing thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP) mill, co-located with a sawmill, have been evaluated. The product gas was utilized for electricity production in a gas turbine, for production of methanol or for production of Fischer–Tropsch (FT) liquids. Integration of the energy mills showed good potential as the TMP mill constitutes a heat sink for which the excess heat from the energy mills can be utilized all year round. However, since there is little excess heat from the TMP mill at the required level to be utilized for biomass drying, for example, heat integration is typically one way. It has also been shown that integration of biomass gasification with a TMP mill results in larger CO₂ emissions reduction than stand-alone operation. Still, compared to co-firing biomass in a coal power plant, the energy mills all have lower potentials for CO₂ emissions reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3adrying 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3agasification 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat 3amechanical pulp 3amethanol 3anewsprint 3apaper pulp 3apower plants 3aprices 3aprofitability 3apulp and paper industry 3apulp and paper mills 3araw materials 3asawmills 3athermomechanical pulping 3avalue-added products1 aPettersson, Karin1 aMahmoudkhani, Maryam1 aÅsblad, Anders1 aBerntsson, Thore0 tEnergy.g2012 Aug., v. 44, no. 1 p.420-428dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2012.06.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245013900206300002000345500001900365520152400384592002801908596005601936596005001992596005002042596007102092596006602163596006602229650000902295650001502304650001402319650001302333650001102346650001302357650001102370650001102381650001502392650001102407650001602418650001302434650001602447650001102463650000902474651001702483651001102500700001702511700001902528700001902547700001902566773016802585856008302753852000902836655001202845IND60693852320221116202534.0200517e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069385232DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-08070-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCodling, Garry1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5299-602810aMetals and PFAS in stormwater and surface runoff in a semi-arid Canadian city subject to large variations in temperature among seasons  ap. 18232-18241.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBecause compounds accumulate through dry periods and enter aquatic systems in just a few seasonal events such as snowmelt and summer storms, surface waters in semi-arid, cold regions, such as the Canadian Prairies, are particularly vulnerable to loading of contaminant from runoff events from surfaces. This study assessed concentrations of metals and selected trace organics entering a river via surface runoff from an urban region and how these semi-arid regions with large seasonal variations in temperature might differ from more temperate regions. Selected potentially harmful elements (PHEs) including, Mn with Cr, Cu, Zn, Ba and U all exceeded guideline discharge values set by the Canadian Council of the Ministers of the Environment (CCME) by as much as 16-fold. Variation among discharges during spring, summer and winter was observed. For example, across the whole city, an estimated 6 kg of zinc was discharged in a spring storm, 36 kg in a summer storm and 17 tonnes in snowmelt. The mass of Zn discharged is similar to the annual loading estimated for Stockholm, Sweden, but in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, the bulk of runoff was during snowmelt. The mean sum of poly- and per-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in stormwater was 9.0 ng L⁻¹, which is consistent with concentrations observed in other Canadian cities (6.5–16 ng L⁻¹). These concentrations of PFAS are likely due to dispersed sources and orders of magnitude less than thresholds for toxicity to fish and aquatic invertebrates.  aPublisher supplied data  a326415-07cScience and Engineering Research Council  a6578cWestern Economic Diversification Canada  a6807cWestern Economic Diversification Canada  aCZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/15_003/ 0000469cH2020 Research Infrastructures  aLM2018121cMinisterstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy  aLM2015051cMinisterstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy 3acold 3aguidelines 3apollution 3aresearch 3arivers 3asnowmelt 3aspring 3astorms 3astormwater 3asummer 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3aurban areas 3awinter 3azinc 3aSaskatchewan 3aSweden1 aYuan, Hongda1 aJones, Paul D.1 aGiesy, John P.1 aHecker, Markus0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 May, v. 27, no. 15 p.18232-18241dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08070-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03281naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245008900174300001300263520171400276592002801990650001902018650001102037650001702048650001602065650003802081650001902119650002102138650001102159650001902170650001102189650000902200650001102209650001802220650001902238650001302257650001302270650002402283650001702307650001702324653002002341653001802361653002602379653003702405653002202442700002002464700001802484700001902502700001802521773008902539856009002628852000902718655001202727IND60606791920221118001315.0180730e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060679192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeh, Chen-Yun10aPeptide-conjugated nanoparticles for targeted imaging and therapy of prostate cancer  ap. 1-15.  aWhile there has been extensive development of anti-cancer drugs for treatment of prostate cancer, the therapeutic efficacy of such drugs remains inadequate in many cases. Here, we performed in vitro biopanning of the PC3 human prostate carcinoma cell line to select prostate cancer-specific peptides by phage display. We successfully identified specific peptides targeting prostate cancer cells, and their specificity was confirmed by cellular ELISA and flow cytometry. Moreover, we found that the phage clones also recognize other prostate cancer cell lines and surgical specimens from prostate cancer patients. The tumor targeting ability of these phages was validated in a xenograft model, in which high accumulation of targeting phage was observed. To investigate whether selected peptides are able to target tumors and enhance drug delivery into cancer cells, we synthesized peptide-PEGylated lipids and post-inserted them into preformed liposomal doxorubicin and vinorelbine. The results of our cellular uptake and MTT assays indicate that peptide-conjugated liposomes exhibit enhanced drug intracellular delivery and cytotoxicity. The conjugation of targeting peptide to imaging agents, such as quantum dots (QDs) and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), results in more precise delivery of these agents to tumor sites. Furthermore, administration of liposomal doxorubicin and vinorelbine conjugated with targeting peptides was found to markedly increase the inhibition of human prostate tumor growth in mouse xenograft and orthotopic models. These results indicate that targeting peptide, SP204, has significant potential for targeted therapy and molecular imaging in prostate cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteriophages 3aclones 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aflow cytometry 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3alipids 3amice 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3apeptides 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aquantum dots 3atherapeutics 0aProstate cancer 0aPhage display 0aDrug delivery systems 0aPeptide-conjugated nanoparticles 0aMolecular imaging1 aHsiao, Jong-Kai1 aWang, Yi-Ping1 aLan, Chun-Hsin1 aWu, Han-Chung0 tBiomaterials.g2016 Aug., v. 99 p.1-15dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001800160245006300178300001600241500000900257520164300266592002801909650002201937650002101959650002501980650003002005650003102035650003702066650001202103700002002115773012202135852000902257856009702266655001202363IND2059984320221117235024.0191122e199703  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205998432DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1997.00021962008900020005x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yudong10aDIALLEL-SAS: A SAS Program for Griffing's Diallel Analyses  ap. 176-182.  aepub  aDiallel mating designs are generally used to obtain estimates of genetic effects for a fixed set of parental lines (fixed effects) or to estimate general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) variance components from a set of randomly chosen parental lines (random effects) from multiple-environment experiments. Published computer programs for diallel analyses do not provide a partition of F₁ hybrids ✕ environments interaction into GCA ✕ environments, SCA ✕ environments, and reciprocal ✕ environments components for Griffing's Methods 1 and 3, and into GCA ✕ environments and SCA ✕ environments components for Griffing's Methods 2 and 4. Existing programs for Methods 1 and 3 also do not partition reciprocal effects into maternal and nonmaternal effects. This paper reports the development of a comprehensive SAS program (DIALLEL-SAS) for partitioning interactions between environments (years and/or locations) and F₁ hybrids. DIALLEL-SAS can be run on any microcomputer with SAS, as well as on mainframe computers installed with SAS via UNIX or TSO.

It is used to treat the common cold in China. In the ongoing search for antibacterial activity in fungi derived from natural, pungently scented vegetables, the secondary metabolites of Talaromyces pinophilus AF-02, which was isolated from the stem of the green Chinese onion, were investigated. The genus Talaromyces (Trichocomaceae) is an important fungal genus because of its ubiquity and the role of many of its species in food and agriculture production. Three new phthalide derivatives, talaromycolides A–C, 1–3; a new long-chain dicarboxylic acid, 11; and 12 known compounds were isolated from methanolic extracts of this fungus. Their structures were determined via extensive NMR, HR-ESI-MS, and CD spectroscopic analyses. Compounds 1–3 are rare phthalide derivatives with a novel linkage position between the phenyl and phthalide moieties. The biological properties of 1–16 were evaluated using six different bacteria, and 1–3, 5, and 11 exhibited significant antibacterial activity in response to some of the tested strains. 3aAllium fistulosum 3aTalaromyces pinophilus 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3acommon cold 3afungi 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aonions 3aphthalides 3asecondary metabolites 3aspices 3aChina 3aSouth East Asia1 aNiu, Hai-Tao1 aLi, Jie1 aXiao, Hui1 aShi, Yan-Ping1 aDi, Duo-Long1 aCrews, Phillip1 aWu, Quan-Xiang0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 Nov. 4, v. 63, no. 43 p.9558-9564dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b04296  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245015200205300001800357520150700375592002801882650001501910650002201925650001501947650001401962650002601976650001902002650001502021650000902036650001902045650000702064650001202071650002702083650001802110700002602128773011102154856008102265852000902346655001202355IND60602882920221119064039.0180711e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060288292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-018-1887-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWallecan, Joel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6908-412110aStrong cationic polyelectrolyte adsorption on a water swollen cellulosic biomaterial and its relevance on microstructure and rheological properties  ap. 4437-4451.  aA multiscale approach was taken to study the swelling and viscosifying properties of a cellulose-rich biomaterial as a function of environmental conditions. First, the impact of pH and ionic strength on the surface properties of the fiber was investigated by means of potentiometry and cationic polyelectrolyte adsorption. Three adsorption regimes were identified: the first one occurred in acidic conditions and was related to the ionization of the carboxylic groups of pectin. A very sharp adsorption was then observed in the mild-acidic to neutral region which was most likely related to a conformation change in the plant cell wall architecture. The third adsorption regime happened in the alkaline region and was related to ionization effects. Based on this information, the impact of environmental conditions on the hydrated microstructure was studied in DSC by means of thermoporosimetry. It clearly demonstrated a structural collapse of the hydrated fiber when pH decreased or the amounts of ions increased. This phenomenon was in line with the surface charge measurements. Finally, the link between the wet microstructure and the macroscale behavior of the fiber was demonstrated by studying the flow properties of the reconstituted fiber, below and above its percolation threshold. In line with the surface properties and microstructure data, yield stresses increased when the pH was adjusted from acidic to alkaline conditions. Salt addition resulted in a loss of the texturizing properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiobased products 3acell walls 3acellulose 3aenvironmental factors 3aionic strength 3aionization 3aions 3amicrostructure 3apH 3apectins 3arheological properties 3atexturization1 aDebon, Stephane J.

In this study, using porous carbon as a vaporizer and a tungsten coil as a Zn and Cd trap, a novel method of solid sampling electrothermal vaporization (SS-ETV) coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was developed for the direct detection of Zn and Cd in grain samples. The optimal ashing, vaporization, and releasing conditions as well as the flow rate of the 4% H₂ (v/v) and Ar mixture as the extra and carrier gases were investigated. Under the optimized conditions, the detection limits (LOD) were 1 pg for Zn and 0.1 pg for Cd; the relative standard deviations (RSD) of 11 repeated measurements were 4.7% for Zn and 7.9% for Cd using 2 mg of rice powder samples; the spiked recoveries ranged from 88% to 113%. The concentrations of Zn and Cd in wheat, corn and rice samples measured by the established method were all found to be in the range of the certified values of reference materials. Furthermore, it was proven that the vaporized and trapped species of Zn and Cd were almost atoms by atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS) and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS).  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3acarbon 3acorn 3adetection limit 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3agases 3ahydrogen 3arice 3astandard deviation 3atrapping 3atungsten 3avolatilization 3awheat 3azinc1 aZhang, Ying1 aLiu, Jixin1 aWang, Min1 aQian, Yong-Zhong,1 aZhang, Zhiwei1 aQi, Yuehan1 aGao, Chengling0 tRSC advances.g2016 May 17, v. 6, no. 54 p.48699-48707dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra03524h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245011100207300001600318520129700334592002801631650001601659650002201675650002201697650001001719650000901729650001501738650001301753650001901766650001101785650001301796650001101809651001201820651001201832651001101844651001601855651001101871653002101882653001801903653002501921653001101946700006501957700002002022773009002042856008502132852000902217655001202226IND60589696220221122002212.0210904e20180415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058969622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.01.1482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSandberg, Eli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2371-516X10aFramework conditions for Nordic district heating - Similarities and differences, and why Norway sticks out  ap. 105-119.  aThe district heating (DH) sectors differ considerably among the Nordic countries: DH is an important contributor to heat supply in Denmark, Finland and Sweden, but in Norway it plays only a minor role. In this study, we compare historical, economic, jurisdictional, political and geographical framework conditions for DH and assess their impacts on the development of DH in the Nordic region. DH is subject to national and municipal regulations, with tax and subsidy schemes that are complex and vary between the countries. The total fuel prices induce differences in fuel distribution. Electricity is competitive, both in DH and individual heating in Norway. This study further suggests, by comparing the impacts and implications of differences in cost components in a model plant, that differences in proﬁtability is currently small between the Nordic countries. However, historical and geographical factors, such as local commitment and differences in infrastructure, constitute the major difference in the penetration of DH. Adaptability, in terms of fuel flexibility, is important for the industry's survivability and electricity prices are crucial for the development of DH. Energy efficiency measures and competition from residential heat pumps are the industry's largest challenges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aelectricity costs 3aenergy efficiency 3afuels 3aheat 3aheat pumps 3aindustry 3ainfrastructure 3amodels 3apolitics 3aprices 3aDenmark 3aFinland 3aNorway 3aScandinavia 3aSweden 0aDistrict heating 0aEnergy policy 0aFramework conditions 0aNordic1 aSneum, Daniel Møller1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2789-29101 aTrømborg, Erik0 tEnergy.g2018 Apr. 15, v. 149 p.105-119dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.01.1483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013400166300001800300520119800318592002801516596011201544596008401656596011001740650001101850650001201861650001301873650001901886650001901905650002001924650001601944650001301960650001501973650002501988650001402013650001102027650001302038653002502051653001002076653004702086653002102133653003202154700001602186700001502202700001902217700005402236773014502290856008602435852000902521655001202530IND60782574320221117162156.0220711e20220629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078257432DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c017982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Xia10aFacile Synthesis of a Honeycomb-Like Nano-Bi/N-Doped C Composite as an Anode for Sodium-Ion Batteries with Superb Cycle Stability  ap. 8856-8862.  aA new honeycomb-like nano-Bi/N-doped C composite is synthesized through simple physical blending followed by pyrolysis, using polyvinylpyrrolidone and bismuth nitrate pentahydrate as starting materials. In the synthesized composite, the particle sizes of Bi nanospheres are concentrated in 4–16 nm, and most of them are embedded in N-doped C. When used as an anode for sodium-ion batteries, it displays a stable reversible capacity of around 285 mAh g–¹ at 5 A g–¹. After the electrode was cycled for 20 000 times, the capacity remained at 283 mAh g–¹, with 88.4% capacity retention relative to the second discharge capacity (320 mAh g–¹). The honeycomb-like nano-Bi/N-doped C anode presents an interface and charge transfer resistance of less than 2 Ω and fast Na⁺ diffusion coefficients of around 10–⁶ cm² s–¹. Full cells composed of the honeycomb-like nano-Bi/N-doped C anode and the sodium vanadium phosphate/reduced graphene oxide cathode exhibit high energy density and excellent cycle performance. This work demonstrates the feasibility of synthesizing high-performance Bi/C composites through facile and scalable methods using inexpensive starting materials.  aPublisher supplied data  a2021YJ0051cDepartment of Science and Technology of Sichuan Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004829  aCXTD2020-1cChina West Normal Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007433  aCSPC202106cChemical Synthesis and Pollution Control Key Laboratory, Sichuan Provincedhttps://doi.org/NA 3aanodes 3abismuth 3acathodes 3aenergy density 3agraphene oxide 3agreen chemistry 3ananospheres 3anitrates 3aphosphates 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3apyrolysis 3asodium 3avanadium 0aSodium-ion batteries 0aAnode 0aHoneycomb-like nano-Bi/N-doped C composite 0aFacile synthesis 0aElectrochemical performance1 aChen, Yiwen1 aZhang, Wei1 aZhang, Zhanwei1 aLi, Mingqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8349-27030 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2022 June 29, v. 10, no. 27 p.8856-8862dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c017983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002300180245009500203300001800298506007600316520130100392592002801693506003701721650003401758650002101792650001401813650002001827650001901847650001201866700002301878700002201901700002801923700002801951700002001979700002301999773012602022856007502148852000902223655001202232IND60534756320221207121315.0160803e20130903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053475632DNAL7 a10.1021/es401663t2doi7 aPMC38309402pmcid7 a239062262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerrato, José M.,10aRelative Reactivity of Biogenic and Chemogenic Uraninite and Biogenic Noncrystalline U(IV)  ap. 9756-9763.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAqueous chemical extractions and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analyses were conducted to investigate the reactivity of chemogenic uraninite, nanoparticulate biogenic uraninite, and biogenic monomeric U(IV) species.

Greater than 90% of the total U was extracted from biogenic uraninite and monomeric U(IV) after 6 h of reaction in an oxidizing solution of 50 mM K₂S₂O₈. Additional oxidation experiments with lower concentrations (2 mM and 10 mM) of K₂S₂O₈ and 8.2 mg L–¹ dissolved oxygen suggested that monomeric U(IV) species are more labile than biogenic uraninite; chemogenic uraninite was much less susceptible to oxidation than either form of biogenic U(IV). These results suggest that noncrystalline forms of U(IV) may be more labile than uraninite in subsurface environments. This work helps fill critical gaps in our understanding of the behavior of solid-associated U(IV) species in bioremediated sites and natural uranium ore deposits.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3adissolved oxygen 3aoxidation 3asodium fluoride 3asolubilization 3auranium1 aAshner, Matthew

We hypothesize that plant community composition, nutrient availability, and spatial distance are driving factors for the functional gene diversity of soil microorganisms at a regional scale. We also hypothesize that different functional genes have different responses to environment. Using functional gene arrays (GeoChip 3.0), we examined microbial diversity, and influencing factors in Ultisols in 11 natural secondary forest plots in southern China which contained 4073 functional genes averagely. Carbon and nitrogen cycle genes were more variable than genes involved in phosphorus utilization, organic remediation, and metal resistance, in similar trends with soil substrate availability. Genes involved in nitrification being more variable than other nitrogen cycling genes; phytase genes being more variable than polyphosphate kinase genes (ppk) and exopolyphosphatase genes (ppx); exoglucanase and endoglucanase genes being more variable than cellobiase genes; lignin peroxidase genes (lip) being more variable than manganese peroxidase genes (mnp). Approximately 41% of the variation in gene composition could be explained by fine root surface area, available nitrogen, and the largest spatial scale factor, with the former two environmental factors over influenced spatial distance. Both environmental factors (represented by nutrient availability) and spatial distance influenced microbial functional gene composition, while the influence of spatial distance worked through environmental factors in natural secondary forest in Ultisols within approximately 500 km, providing insights into microbial biogeography from a functional gene perspective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUltisols 3abeta-glucosidase 3abiogeography 3abotanical composition 3acarbon cycle 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenvironmental factors 3aexopolyphosphatase 3afine roots 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3alignin peroxidase 3amanganese peroxidase 3ameta-analysis 3ametal tolerance 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3anutrient availability 3aphosphorus 3aphytases 3apolyphosphate kinase 3aremediation 3asecondary forests 3asoil microorganisms 3asurface area 3aChina 0aDiversity 0aFunctional gene 0aInfluencing factors 0aMicrobial biogeography 0aNatural secondary forest1 aZheng, Hua1 aYang, Yunfeng1 aLiang, Yuting1 aZhou, Jizhong1 aHe, Zhili1 aChen, Falin1 aOuyang, Z.q(Zhiyun),0 tActa oecologica.g2020 May, v. 105 p.103575-dElsevier Masson SASaElsevier Masson SASwJournal:2127x1146-609X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2020.1035753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100002700160245005900187300001600246500000900262500001500271520172300286592002802009650001202037650002302049650001602072650002202088650001102110650002302121650001802144650001902162650002802181650001602209650001502225650001802240650001502258653002402273700002402297700002002321700002502341773012202366852000902488856009602497655001202593IND2059984820221117234930.0191122e199703  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205998482DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1997.00021962008900020010x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWagner-Riddle, Claudia10aModeling a Rye Cover Crop and Subsequent Soybean Yield  ap. 208-218.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aSoybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] can be no-till seeded in the spring following a killed rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop. A shortage of rain can affect soybean yields, depending on the timing of killing and the amount of mulch produced. Our main objective was to incorporate the effect of a rye mulch on soil water content into a soybean growth model (SOYGRO). The use of a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) growth model (CERES-Wheat) for rye mulch production calculations and SOYGRO for predicting yields under no-mulch and mulch conditions were evaluated. The water balance subroutine of SOYGRO as modified to account for the effect of a rye mulch on soil water content due to mulch albedo, rain interception, and transmissivity of solar radiation. Data from previous experiments at Delhi (Psammentic Hapludalf soil), and Woodstock (Typic Hapludalf) in Ontario, Canada, were used to evaluate these modifications and yield predictions. Mulch production was described well by CERES-Wheat (r² = 0.96). The modified SOYGRO model improved soil water content calculations relative to the original model (r² = 0.67 vs. 0.58, root mean square error = 0.028 vs. 0.064 m³ m⁻³). Simulated soybean yields were within 1 SD of measured values. In agreement with field measurements, the simulated effect of mulch did not increase soybean yields, and modification of SOYGRO to include mulch effects did not change yield predictions (r² = 0.83 vs. 0.81) when no prolonged drought occurred. The simple mulch model incorporated into SOYGRO was adequate to model the effect of rye mulch on soybean growth. The use of CERES-Wheat and the modified SOYGRO model in sequence under hypothetical drier weather conditions was demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3amulches 3asoil water balance 3aGlycine max 3asimulation models 3awinter 3asoil water content 3acrop residues 3aSecale cereale 3adry matter accumulation 3acover crops 3acrop yield 3agrowth models 3aprediction 0amathematical models1 aGillespie, Terry J.1 aHunt, Leslie A.1 aSwanton, Clarence J.0 tAgronomy journal.g1997 Mar., v. 89, no. 2 p.208-218dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1997.00021962008900020010x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02830naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006800148245018500216300002000401500001900421520162600440592002802066650001902094650001702113650002902130650002502159650001402184650001302198650002202211651001102233773016802244856008302412852000902495655001202504IND60693852720221116202509.0200517e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069385272DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-08346-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarkiewicz, Maria Teresa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6180-094710aAnalysis of spatial planning documents and strategic environmental assessment reports with regard to hazards of major industrial accidents: a case study involving six Polish cities  ap. 18269-18286.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the event of an accident in an industrial plant, the damage caused by it can be enormous. There may be environmental contamination in a large area. Injured persons may be both employees of the plant staying on its premises and local residents. The control of major accidents is realised by implementing the procedures regarding: safety analysis, emergency and operational planning, effective land-use planning (LUP), strategic environmental assessment (SEA), environmental impact assessment (EIA) and public consultation. The paper presents findings of a case study aiming to analyse selected spatial planning documents prepared at the municipality and SEA reports accompanying them, with regard to hazards of major industrial accidents in six Polish cities. In addition, changes of relevant Polish legislation taking place from 1995 till now are explained referring to European Union (EU) law. This article is the very first to present the situation concerning LUP around hazardous plants in Poland based on such extensive data. The assessment shows that the way of recording the major accident hazards is varied, but legal norms, binding at the time when the documents were drawn up, were met in each of the analysed documents. Changes of relevant Poland legislation were not the only reason for differences in the ways of recording the hazards of major industrial accidents in these documents. The case study has revealed that relevant Polish regulations can be still improved. The results of the study have useful implications for the control of major accidents, spatial policy-making and environmental management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acase studies 3aenvironmental assessment 3alaws and regulations 3apollution 3aresearch 3asafety assessment 3aPoland0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 May, v. 27, no. 15 p.18269-18286dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08346-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02182naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008000170300001600250520114400266592002801410650000901438650002201447650002201469650000901491650002001500650001501520650001101535650002201546700001301568700001401581700001401595700001501609700001301624773007801637856008401715852000901799655001201808IND60096411720221119074752.0141104e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009641172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2012.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Guozhong10aOperation strategy analysis of a geothermal step utilization heating system  ap. 458-468.  aGeothermal energy has been successfully applied in many district heating systems. In order to promote better use of geothermal energy, it is important to analyze the operation strategy of geothermal heating system. This study proposes a comprehensive and systematic operation strategy for a geothermal step utilization heating system (GSUHS). Calculation models of radiator heating system (RHS), radiant floor heating system (RFHS), heat pump (HP), gas boiler (GB), plate heat exchanger (PHE) and pump are first established. Then the operation strategy of the GSUHS is analyzed with the aim to substantially reduce the conventional energy consumption of the whole system. Finally, the energy efficiency and geothermal tail water temperature are analyzed. With the operation strategy in this study, the geothermal energy provides the main heating amount for the system. The heating seasonal performance factor is 15.93. Compared with coal-fired heating, 75.1% of the standard coal equivalent can be saved. The results provide scientific guidance for the application of an operation strategy for a geothermal step utilization heating system.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3aenergy efficiency 3ageothermal energy 3aheat 3aheat exchangers 3aheat pumps 3amodels 3awater temperature1 aLi, Feng1 aTian, Zhe1 aZhu, Neng1 aLi, Qianru1 aZhu, Han0 tEnergy.g2012 Aug., v. 44, no. 1 p.458-468dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2012.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03281naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245008800172300001800260520227800278592002802556650002202584650001802606650002202624650001302646650001302659650001102672650002302683650001302706700002302719700001602742700001802758773009802776856004802874852000902922655001202931IND50069735720221118162636.0131017e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006973572DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-013-0494-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThrimawithana, A. H.10aReduced total genetic diversity following translocations? A metapopulation approach  ap. 1043-1055.  aTranslocation is the movement of a group of individuals from one site to another. Conservationists and wildlife managers around the world use translocation to new and/or newly safe habitats as a tool for preserving and propagating threatened species whose populations are surviving at only few and vulnerable localities. The success of translocations is typically defined as the establishment of a self-sustaining population. However, this definition overlooks the genetic consequences of translocations at the metapopulation scale, especially when maintaining genetic diversity is one of the specific aims of immediate and/or long-term management goals for the translocated population. We evaluated the potential effects of translocation on the total genetic diversity of a metapopulation in an increasingly common scenario: a small island as the source site, and a nearby predator-proofed, large island as the target site. Specifically, we tested the counterintuitive hypothesis that translocation and subsequent migration between an expanding, recently established population and the original population might actually result in the suppression of genetic diversity in the metapopulation relative to the temporal course of genetic drift in the small island population without translocation (control). Our simulations confirm that the directional genetic consequences of translocations are complex and depend on the combination of parameter estimates used for the modelling. Critically, however, under a lower rate of migration, lower rate of growth and higher carrying capacity on the translocation site, and smaller initial size of the translocated population, the total genetic diversity of the metapopulation may become suppressed following a translocation, relative to the control. At the same time, when translocations are carried out under a broader set of conditions, the metapopulation genetic diversity will typically exceed that of the control. Our approach is also informative about the genetic consequences of natural re-/colonisation events between small source and nearby large target sites and the resulting metapopulation. Overall, these results confirm the importance of translocation as a potentially effective and successful conservation genetic tool.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarrying capacity 3agenetic drift 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3amanagers 3amodels 3athreatened species 3awildlife1 aOrtiz-Catedral, L.1 aRodrigo, A.1 aHauber, M.

Br.] is a high-quality grain crop that can that can be grown without irrigation during hot, dry summers in the southeastern United States. The N rate required for optimum pearl millet grain yield varies widely in published studies, possibly because of variability in residual soil N from the subsoil. Field studies were conducted in the southern Coastal Plain at Tifton, GA, on a Tifton loamy sand (fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic Plinthic Kandiudult) with nitrate accumulations near subsoil plinthite. The objective was to determine if pearl millet can extract N from acidic, relatively impermeable subsoils. Nitrate N (1 M KCl-extractable) was 4 mg kg⁻¹ in the surface 0.6 in, 1 mg kg⁻¹ in the next 0.6 m, and 6 mg kg⁻¹ from 1.2 to 1.5 m. We fertilized pearl millet field plots with two levels of N (0 and 168 kg ha⁻¹) and studied root development during the growing seasons in 1993 and 1994. Soil cores were taken 40 d after planting to a depth of 1.2 m, separated into 0.3-m depth segments, and root length density was measured. Roots were found in the deepest segments. Nitrogen fertilization increased the proportion of the root length density found in the surface soil in one year. We also injected ¹⁵N as 60% atom ˡ⁵N-enriched KNO₃ at a depth of 1 m at 30 and 40 d after planting. At physiological maturity, atom % ¹⁵N abundance in the plants ranged from 10.1 to 12.0 where ¹⁵N was injected and was near natural abundance where no ¹⁵N was injected. These results indicate that pearl millet can extract N from 1 to 1.2 m in an acidic and impermeable subsoil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPennisetum glaucum 3anitrogen fertilizers 3asandy soils 3asubsoil 3apermeability 3aacid soils 3anutrient uptake 3anitrate nitrogen 3aroot systems 3aplant development 3aapplication rate 3aloamy sand soils 3aGeorgia1 aGascho, Gary J.1 aHanna, Wayne W.1 aCabrera, Miguel L.1 aHook, James E.0 tAgronomy journal.g1997 Mar., v. 89, no. 2 p.189-194dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1997.00021962008900020007x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03010naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245012300178300002000301500001900321520175800340592002802098650002302126650000802149650001302157650001102170650001302181650001302194650001202207650001402219650001302233650001002246650001502256700003002271700002402301700002702325773016802352856008302520852000902603655001202612IND60693852920221116202414.0200517e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069385292DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-05690-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwaminathan, Siluvaimuthu10aEmission profiling of CI engine fueled with neem and wintergreen oil blend with hexanol and octanol manifold injection  ap. 17505-17515.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present work details the effects of injection of higher order alcohols, namely hexanol (Hex) and octanol (Oct) as secondary fuels in a CI engine. The last decade has seen an exponential increase in the carbon emission chief of which have been contributed by fossil fuels. Vegetable oils provide a viable alternative to the current scenario as they can be synthesized easily from nature and can be readily adapted for use in CI engines. Neem oil (NO) is non-edible and widely available and hence taken as a base fuel for this research. The poor properties of neem oil were improved by the addition of novel low viscous biofuel, namely wintergreen oil (WGO). During the course of this research work, a blend containing a mixture of 50% of neat neem oil and 50% of wintergreen oil (NO50-WGO50) was optimized based on trial tests and taken as pilot fuel while Hex and Oct were injected along with intake air as secondary fuels. The alcohols were injected into the engine successively in the 10%, 20%, and 30% (by mass) ratios. Experiments were conducted in a single-cylinder CI engine fabricating 5.2-kW power at a constant speed of 1500 rpm at varying load conditions. It is observed that inferior performance of NO led to more smoke, HC, and CO in comparison to diesel at all the loads and these are improved with NO50-WGO50 blend. Nevertheless, a minor increase in NOx emission was perceived with the blend. Addition of higher order alcohol promoted reduction of both NOx and smoke emission without affecting performance. Among the various combinations, NO50-WGO50 + Hex30 and Oct30 reduced NOx emission by 12% and 9.5% and smoke emission by 13% and 19% respectively. These results are on par with the diesel performance and emission characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzadirachta indica 3aair 3abiofuels 3acarbon 3ahexanols 3aneem oil 3aoctanol 3apollution 3aresearch 3asmoke 3avegetables1 aSubramanian, Thiyagarajan1 aMartin, Leenus Jesu1 aBeddhannan, Nagalingam0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 May, v. 27, no. 15 p.17505-17515dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05690-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005800144245014500202300002000347520174700367592002802114596006602142596011502208596006502323650001402388650001902402650001302421650001002434650001802444650001002462650001902472650001902491650001202510650000902522650001102531650002202542650001602564653002102580653002502601653003002626653002702656653004202683700002602725773014202751856007902893852000902972655001202981IND60776321120221120081401.0220505e20220421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077632112DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c031562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBazazi, Parisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1111-882410aWetting Dynamics of Nanoparticle Dispersions: From Fully Spreading to Non-sticking and the Deposition of Nanoparticle-Laden Surface Droplets  ap. 20280-20290.  aControlled transport of liquid droplets on solid surfaces is critical in many practical applications, such as self-cleaning surfaces, coating, drug delivery, and agriculture. Non-adhesive liquid drops levitate on solid surfaces; therefore, they are highly mobile and directed toward desired locations by external stimuli. Although research on liquid-repellent surfaces has proliferated, the existing methods are still limited to creating surface roughness or coating the liquid droplets. Here, we create non-contact aqueous drops on hydrophilic surfaces in an oleic environment and use them to deposit submicrometer droplets encapsulating nanoparticles on solid surfaces. A glass surface is buried under an oil phase that contains a high concentration of Span 80 surfactants, and a drop of silica nanoparticle dispersion is released on the solid surface. We study the effect of surfactant concentration in oil and nanoparticle concentration in water on wetting dynamics and report a plethora of droplet spreading regimes from fully wetting to non-wetting. We find a threshold Span 80 concentration above which surfactant assemblies are formed on the solid and prevent the direct contact of the drop with the surface. At the same time, water-in-oil emulsions are generated at the drop–oil interface. The drop moves and leaves a trace of emulsions with encapsulated nanoparticles on the solid. We demonstrate the possibility of local surface coating with hydrophilic nanoparticles in a hydrophobic medium. The developed methodology in this study is a generic approach facilitating the droplet patterning in numerous applications, from pharmaceutical polymetric carriers to the formulation of cosmetics, insecticides, and biomedical diagnoses.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcUniversity of Calgarydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008459  a07186-2019cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canadadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000038  aNAcAlberta Innovatesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100009192 3acosmetics 3adirect contact 3adroplets 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3aglass 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquids 3aoils 3asilica 3asurface roughness 3asurfactants 0awetting dynamics 0aunder liquid coating 0anon-adhesive liquid drops 0ain situ emulsification 0aspreading of nanoparticle-laden drops1 aHejazi, Seyed Hossein0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Apr. 21, v. 14, no. 17 p.20280-20290dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c031563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012800162300001800290520123700308592002801545596009901573650001501672650001401687650001301701650001601714650001101730650001201741650001901753650002601772650001301798650001001811700001601821700001801837700001401855700001801869700001901887700005201906773011101958856008102069852000902150655001202159IND60602883320221119064154.0180711e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060288332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-018-1891-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ya Dan10aChitosan functionalization to prolong stable hydrophilicity of cotton thread for thread-based analytical device application  ap. 4831-4840.  aCotton thread has been proposed as a new, economically affordable material for the fabrication of microfluidic circuits for use in fast, low-cost, point-of-care diagnostic testing devices. In this work, chitosan, a biocompatible polymer, was used to modify cotton thread to improve its fluidic properties for microfluidic applications. Electrostatic-interaction-mediated adsorption of chitosan on alkaline-scoured thread can effectively increase thread’s solution hydrophilicity and wicking rate. Moreover, the proposed process conserves the thread’s hydrophilicity and fluidic properties even when stored for several months. As a microfluidic platform for enzymatic-reaction-associated colorimetric measurement, the suggested chitosan modification results in the accumulation of more analyte in the detection zone because of the improved flow rate, which enhances the colorimetric signal intensity. In this study, a glucose oxidase-mediated colorimetric glucose assay was demonstrated on a chitosan-modified microfluidic thread-based analytical device (μTAD). A linear range of 1–7.5 mM, a low detection limit of 0.2 mM, and a recovery rate between 93 and 98% was achieved in detecting glucose in artificial urine samples.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013YQ03062909cNational Key Scientific Instrument and Equipment Development Projects of China 3aadsorption 3acellulose 3achitosan 3acolorimetry 3acotton 3aglucose 3ahydrophilicity 3apoint-of-care testing 3apolymers 3aurine1 aLi, Wanyun,1 aChai, Hui Hui1 aFang, Can1 aKang, Yue Jun1 aLi, Chang Ming1 aYu, Ling1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6726-281X0 tCellulose.g2018 Aug., v. 25, no. 8 p.4831-4840dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-018-1891-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01793naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245009000179300001600269520086900285592002801154650002401182650001101206650000901217650001701226650001601243650001201259650001601271700002101287773007801308856008401386852000901470655001201479IND60096411920221119074742.0141104e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009641192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2012.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarmolejo-Correa, Danahe12aA comparison of exergy efficiency definitions with focus on low temperature processes  ap. 477-489.  aThis work compares two classes of exergy efficiency definitions and applies them on a simple process (i.e. PRICO) for the liquefaction of natural gas. This comparison demonstrates the possible inconsistency and uncertainty of several exergy efficiency definitions already proposed in the literature. In addition, the paper highlights the importance of decomposing the total exergy into its relevant components, and to analyze the behavior of these exergy components individually. The exergy of heat as well as the exergy of a material stream exhibit a special and different behavior below ambient temperature compared to above ambient conditions. This is illustrated by calculating exergy efficiencies for the PRICO process for liquefaction of natural gas, and the results also show different figures for the various exergy efficiencies proposed in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aexergy 3aheat 3aliquefaction 3anatural gas 3astreams 3auncertainty1 aGundersen, Truls0 tEnergy.g2012 Aug., v. 44, no. 1 p.477-489dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2012.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245012500179300001800304520091600322592002801238596011101266596011101377596009301488650002301581650001201604650002001616650001701636650001601653650001901669650000801688650001301696653000801709653001101717653001201728653002901740653001801769700002401787700002201811700002001833700002101853700002901874700002001903700006001923773014501983856008602128852000902214655001202223IND60782574620220711000000.0220711e20220628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078257462DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c019872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJimenez-Martin, Jose M.10aEfficient Conversion of Glucose to Methyl Lactate with Sn-USY: Retro-aldol Activity Promotion by Controlled Ion Exchange  ap. 8885-8896.  aSn-USY materials have been prepared through an optimized post-synthetic catalytic metalation procedure.

This outstanding catalytic performance is ascribed to the neutralization of Brønsted acid sites, the consequent depression of side reactions, and a higher population of tin open sites in the ion-exchanged Sn-USY zeolites. Reusability tests evidenced some loss of catalytic activity, partially caused by the closing of tin sites, although the use of small amounts of water in the reaction media demonstrated that this deactivation mechanism can be, at least, partially alleviated.  aPublisher supplied data  aRTI2018-094918-B-C41cMinistry of Science, Innovation and Universitiesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100014440  aRTI2018-094918-B-C42cMinistry of Science, Innovation and Universitiesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100014440  a101023202cBio-Based Industries Joint Undertakingdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100019285 3acatalytic activity 3aglucose 3agreen chemistry 3aion exchange 3alactic acid 3aneutralization 3atin 3azeolites 0aUSY 0aSn-USY 0azeolite 0aretro-aldol condensation 0aalkyl lactate1 aOrozco-Saumell, Ana1 aHernando, Héctor1 aLinares, María1 aMariscal, Rafael1 aLópez Granados, Manuel,1 aGarcía, Alicia1 aIglesias, José,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5929-26080 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2022 June 28, v. 10, no. 27 p.8885-8896dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c019873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011500172520152700287592002801814650002201842650001101864650001701875650001301892650002701905650002001932650001201952650001501964650002301979650001402002650002402016650001002040650002102050650000902071650001602080650001002096650000902106650001702115650001702132651000902149653001302158653003002171653002602201653001502227653002302242653002102265700002302286773012902309856008502438852000902523655001202532IND60689848220221120192226.0200523e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068984822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejsobi.2020.1031892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKheirfam, Hossein10aStabilizing sand from dried-up lakebeds against wind erosion by accelerating biological soil crust development  aLand degradation and the resulting desertification often lead to sand flowing from deserts and/or dried-up lakebeds and into habitable zones; a problem that has intensified in recent decades. We cultivated locally collected biological soil crust (BSC) bacteria (Bacillus subtilis strain) and cyanobacteria (Nostoc sp. and Oscillatoria sp.) from the dried-up bed of Lake Urmia, northwest Iran. To evaluate the ability of BSC to stabilize the sandy lakebed soil, bacteria and cyanobacteria were used to inoculate experimental trays of sandy soil from the same area, under laboratory conditions. After 120 days, we simulated winds at a speed of 72 km h⁻¹ for three 10-min intervals (30 min in overall) to measure the sand transport rate as well as the durability and fragility of the BSCs during the wind erosion process, using an open circuit wind tunnel. We found that the bacteria, cyanobacteria, and cyanobacteria + bacteria inoculation reduced the sand flowing by 42.3, 96.6, and 95.9%, respectively, as compared to the control. We found that in addition to creating a protective cover on the soil surface, cyanobacteria created a strong bond between the soil particles through their exudation of exopolysaccharides and network of filaments, increasing the ability of the sand to withstand wind forces. Our inoculation technique was an effective and natural way to stabilize moving sand. Future research should replicate our methods under natural conditions to evaluate the potential for large-scale restoration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aNostoc 3aOscillatoria 3abacteria 3abiological soil crusts 3adesertification 3adeserts 3adurability 3aexopolysaccharides 3aexudation 3ainoculation methods 3alakes 3aland degradation 3asand 3asandy soils 3atrays 3awind 3awind erosion 3awind tunnels 3aIran 0aBiocrust 0aCombating desertification 0aEcosystem restoration 0aLake Urmia 0aSoil cyanobacteria 0aSoil inoculation1 aAsadzadeh, Farrokh0 tEuropean journal of soil biology.g2020 May,  June, v. 98 p.103189-dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl597945x1164-55637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2020.1031893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03913naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245025500164300001600419506002800435520249400463592002802957506003702985650002903022650002303051650001803074650001503092650001803107650001203125650002303137650001703160650001203177650001703189650001503206650001803221650001803239700002203257700001703279773010703296856007903403852000903482655001203491IND60785532120221207092030.0161227e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078553212DNAL7 a10.22146/agritech.93232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArnata, I Wayan10aPRODUKSI BIOETANOL DARI HIDROLISAT ASAM TEPUNG UBI KAYU DENGAN KULTUR CAMPURAN Trichoderma viride dan Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Ethanol Production From Acid Hydrolysate Cassava Flour with Mixed Culture Trichoderma viride and Saccharomyces cerevisiae)  ap. 396-405.  aResource is Open Access  aThe objective of this research was to produce bioethanol from acid hydrolysate cassava flour with mix cultured Trichoderma viride and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

In order to address this issue, the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) in collaboration with the Institute for Transuranium Elements (ITU) has initiated a study to investigate the feasibility of preparing and characterizing a uranium particle reference material for nuclear safeguards, which is finally certified for isotopic abundances and for the uranium mass per particle. Such control particles are specifically required to evaluate responses of instruments based on mass spectrometric detection (e.g. SIMS, TIMS, LA-ICPMS) and to help ensuring the reliability and comparability of measurement results worldwide. In this paper, a methodology is described which allows quantifying the uranium mass in single micron particles by isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS). This methodology is characterized by substantial improvements recently achieved at IRMM in terms of sensitivity and measurement accuracy in the field of uranium particle analysis by TIMS. The use of monodisperse uranium oxide particles prepared using an aerosol generation technique developed at ITU, which is capable of producing particles of well-characterized size and isotopic composition was exploited. The evidence of a straightforward correlation between the particle volume and the mass of uranium was demonstrated in this study. Experimental results have shown that the uranium mass per particle can be measured via the ID-TIMS method to a relative expanded uncertainty of about 10% (coverage factor k=2). The availability of reliable and validated methods for the characterization of uranium particles is considered to be essential for the establishment of SI-traceable measurement results. It is therefore expected that the method developed in this study is valuable for the certification of particulate materials in which the isotopic composition and the content of uranium must be accurately known.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3acertification 3aequipment 3aionization 3aisotope dilution technique 3amass spectrometry 3aplutonium 3auncertainty 3auranium1 aRichter, S.1 aErdmann, N.1 aKühn, H.1 aHedberg, M.1 aAregbe, Y.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2012 Oct. 20, v. 748 p.37-44dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2012.08.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03383naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007600166300001800242520209600260592002802356650001702384650001702401650002302418650002602441650001102467650001302478650002402491650002502515650001202540650001302552650001802565650001302583650001902596650004502615650001802660700001602678700001602694700001702710700001602727773010402743856008102847852000902928655001202937IND50074903520221116175955.0150214e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007490352DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-013-2773-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xiaorong10aRegulation of nitrification in latosolic red soils by organic amendment  ap. 3865-3878.  aThe effect of glucose, chicken manure, and filter mud on the ammonium and nitrate concentrations, ammonia-oxidizing bacterial community and bacterial community in latosolic red soils during the incubation of microcosms was investigated. The soil nitrate concentration was significantly lower in the glucose-treated soil than in the filter mud or chicken manure-treated soil from days 2 and 5 to 21 of incubation. The ammonia-oxidizing bacteria community composition, measured by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, was different among the treatments 9 days after incubation, suggesting that the control soil without external fertilization had a low 283-bp (Nitrosospira) fragment relative abundance (27 %) compared with the glucose-treated (62 %), filter mud (73 %) and chicken manure (78 %) samples. Additionally, 491-bp fragments (Nitrosomonas) were detected in all the soil treatments except for the control soil, and 48-bp fragments (from different Nitrosomonas) were detected in the chicken manure-treated soil. The bacterial community structure was markedly changed in the glucose-treated soil on day 9 and in the filter mud-treated soil on day 31, indicating that the effect of filter mud on the bacterial community is delayed compared to the effect of glucose. The chicken manure-treated soil showed less change, similar to that of the control soil. Glucose fertilization greatly increased the soil bacterial abundance and functional diversity; however, the chicken manure and filter mud did not stimulate soil bacterial activity on day 9. These results indicated that nitrification may have been somewhat suppressed in the glucose-treated soils, which was possibly related to the improving ammonia-oxidizing bacterial community, bacterial community and activity via the available carbon application. The filter manure and chicken manure treatments demonstrated fewer effects. These results suggest that organic carbon quality, e.g., increasing the available carbon, regulates the nitrification process and is beneficial to reducing soil nitrogen losses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNitrosomonas 3aNitrosospira 3aammonium compounds 3abacterial communities 3acarbon 3achickens 3acommunity structure 3afunctional diversity 3aglucose 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3apoultry manure 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asoil bacteria1 aCai, Yanfei1 aPeng, Chong1 aZhao, Suqing1 aLi, Yongtao0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2014 May, v. 71, no. 9 p.3865-3878dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-013-2773-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245013700168520148300305592002801788650001601816650002401832650001001856650001901866650002301885650001101908650001501919650001801934650002601952650001301978650003001991650001702021650001502038650001402053651001002067700002202077700001902099700002002118700001702138700002102155700002502176700002102201773011902222856008002341852000902421655001202430IND60703169320221118012300.0200720e20200513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070316932DNAL7 a10.3390/insects110503012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRipamonti, Matteo 10aPrevalence of Flavescence Dorée Phytoplasma-Infected Scaphoideus titanus in Different Vineyard Agroecosystems of Northwestern Italy  aQuantitative estimates of vector populations and their infectivity in the wild and in cultivated compartments of agroecosystems have been carried out to elucidate the role of the wild compartment in the epidemiology of Flavescence dorée (FD). Seven sites were selected for the investigations in the Piedmont Region of Italy. They were characterized by a high variety of agricultural and ecological landscape features, and included a vineyard surrounded by wild vegetation. In order to describe abundance and prevalence of FD-infected vectors in the cultivated and wild compartments of the vineyard agroecosystem, adults of Scaphoideus titanus were collected by yellow sticky traps inside and outside the vineyard over the period July 10th–September 9th, 2015. They were counted and singly analyzed for the presence of FD phytoplasmas by PCR. Multifactorial correlations among vector population level, prevalence of infected insects inside and outside the vineyards, disease prevalence in cultivated and wild Vitis plants, and location of wild Vitis plants with respect to the vineyard were analyzed. Abundance of S. titanus adults significantly decreased from the end of July onwards, particularly inside the vineyard (average range 22.7 ± 2.5 insects/trap). Percentage of FD-positive S. titanus was significantly higher outside the vineyard (up to 48% on average) compared to inside the vineyard (up to 34% on average), and increased during the season in both compartments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytoplasma 3aScaphoideus titanus 3aVitis 3aagroecosystems 3adisease prevalence 3aimagos 3alandscapes 3apathogenicity 3aphytoplasmal diseases 3apiedmont 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asticky traps 3avegetation 3avineyards 3aItaly1 aPegoraro, Mattia 1 aRossi, Marika 1 aBodino, Nicola 1 aBeal, Dylan 1 aPanero, Loretta 1 aMarzachì, Cristina 1 aBosco, Domenico 0 tInsects.g2020 May 13, v. 11, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects110503013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01467naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245008300157300001800240520063200258592002800890650000800918650002000926650001700946700001500963700001600978773011100994856007501105852000901180655001201189IND60529075820221117160200.0160717e20120717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052907582DNAL7 a10.1021/ac30047272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jiahao10aEnzyme-Free and Amplified Fluorescence DNA Detection Using Bimolecular Beacons  ap. 5939-5943.  aIn this work, we propose a simple and enzyme-free strategy for sensitive and selective DNA detection by using two different types of molecular beacons (MBs), MB1 and MB2. In this method, the target DNA binds with and restores the fluorescence of MB1 first. Then, MB2 hybridizes with MB1 and free the target, which is used to trigger another reaction cycle. The cycling use of the target and the employment of bi-MBs amplify the fluorescence intensity for sensitive DNA detection.

The Rayleigh waves at frequencies ranging from 800 to 2400Hz propagate on the flesh and are detected by a piezo-bimorph sensor in contact with the flesh. We determined the shear elasticity from the velocity for two types of Japanese watermelons, Matsuribayashi777 and Wasenissho, to be 1.18 and 0.74MPa, respectively. These correlated well with a sensory firmness evaluation. The values of Young modulus obtained by the surface-wave measurements were nine times larger than those by the compression tests performed, which can be explained by the differences in measurement displacement and frequency. We also investigated the effect of storage on the surface-wave velocity for Matsuribayashi777. The velocity decreased by about 10% after ten days of storage. The present results suggest that this technique can be applied to estimating the elastic properties of various fruits.  aPublisher supplied data 3afirmness 3afruits 3astorage time 3awatermelons 0aFirmness 0aPoisson ratio 0aRayleigh waves 0aShear elasticity 0aWatermelon 0aYoung’s modulus1 aChoi, Pak-Kon1 aIshii, Toshio1 aArai, Ikko1 aOsawa, Masako0 tJournal of food engineering.g2015 Sept., v. 160 p.28-33dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2015.03.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04164naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010800169300001400277520250300291592002802794650001302822650001102835650001302846650001902859650001602878650001302894650002002907650002402927650003302951650001702984650002003001650001703021653004303038653004703081653003303128653001703161653003203178700003003210700001903240700005803259700001903317700002003336700002403356700002303380700006403403773008503467856008503552852000903637655001203646IND60635222620221119210417.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063522262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micron.2019.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIrde, Gabriele10aImaging photoinduced surface potentials on hybrid perovskites by real-time Scanning Electron Microscopy  ap. 53-65.  aWe introduce laser-assisted Time-Resolved SEM (TR-SEM), joining Scanning Electron Microscopy and laser light excitation, to probe the long-term temporal evolution of optically excited charge distributions at the surface of Metal Ammonium Lead Triiodide (MAPbI3) hybrid perovskite thin films. Laser-assisted TR-SEM relies on the optically induced local modification of Secondary Electron (SE) detection yield to provide mapping of photoexcited potentials and charge dynamics at surfaces, and qualifies as a complementary approach to near-field probe microscopies and nonlinear photoemission spectroscopies for photovoltage measurements. Real-time imaging of evolving field patterns are provided on timescales compatible with SEM scanning rates, so that temporal resolution in the millisecond range can be ultimately envisaged. MAPbI3 is an outstanding light-sensitive material candidate for applications in solar light harvesting and photovoltaics, also appealing as an active system for light generation. In this work, the real time temporal evolution of optically induced SE contrast patterns in MAPbI3 is experimentally recorded, both under illumination by a 405 nm blue laser and after light removal, showing the occurrence of modifications related to photoinduced positive charge fields at surface. The long term evolution of these surface fields are tentatively attributed to ion migration within the film, under the action of the illumination gradient and the hole collecting substrate. This optical excitation is fully reversible in MAPbI3 over timescales of hours and a complete recovery of the system occurs within days.Permanent irradiation damage of the material is avoided by operating the SEM at 5 keV of energy and 1–10 pA of primary current. Optical excitation is provided by intense above-bandgap illumination (up to 50 W/cm2). TR-SEM patterns show a strong dependence on the geometry of SE collection. Measurements are taken at different axial orientations of the sample with respect to the entrance of the in-column detection system of the SEM and compared with numerical modeling of the SE detection process. This enables to single out the information regarding the local potential distribution. Results are interpreted by combining data about the spectral distribution of emitted SEs with the configuration of the electric and magnetic fields in the specimen chamber. The present modeling sets a robust basis for the understanding of photoinduced SE electron contrast.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aenergy 3ageometry 3aimage analysis 3airradiation 3alighting 3amagnetic fields 3amathematical models 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3aspectroscopy 0aReal-time scanning electron microscopy 0aTime-Resolved Scanning Electron Microscopy 0aOrganic-inorganic perovskite 0aPhotovoltage 0aSecondary electron emission1 aPietralunga, Silvia Maria1 aSala, Vittorio1 aZani, Maurizio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7960-33621 aBall, James M.1 aBarker, Alex J.1 aPetrozza, Annamaria1 aLanzani, Guglielmo1 aTagliaferri, Alberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8001-17860 tMicron.g2019 June, v. 121 p.53-65dElsevier LtdwJournal:12416x0968-43287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micron.2019.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245016700163520147900330592002801809650001801837650002901855650002001884650002401904650002201928650002301950650001901973650001101992650001802003650003002021650001402051650001402065650001202079650001002091650001302101650001902114651001202133700002002145700002202165773011902187856007902306852000902385655001202394IND60703169920221118012331.0200720e20200514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070316992DNAL7 a10.3390/insects110503072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuno, Nobuko 10aClimate Change May Restrict the Predation Efficiency of <i>Mesocyclops aspericornis</i> (Copepoda: Cyclopidae) on <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) Larvae  a(1) Dengue is the most spread mosquito-borne viral disease in the world, and vector control is the only available means to suppress its prevalence, since no effective treatment or vaccine has been developed. A biological control program using copepods that feed on mosquito larvae has been practiced in Vietnam and some other countries, but the application of copepods was not always successful. (2) To understand why the utility of copepods varies, we evaluated the predation efficiency of a copepod species (<i>Mesocyclops aspericornis</i>) on a vector species (<i>Aedes aegypti</i>) by laboratory experiments under different temperatures, nutrition and prey-density conditions. (3) We found that copepod predation reduced intraspecific competition among <i>Aedes</i> larvae and then shortened the survivor&rsquo;s aquatic life and increased their pupal weight. In addition, the predatory efficiency of copepods was reduced at high temperatures. Furthermore, performance of copepod offspring fell when the density of mosquito larvae was high, probably because mosquito larvae had adverse effects on copepod growth through competition for food resources. (4) These results suggest that the increase in mosquitoes will not be suppressed solely by the application of copepods if the density of mosquito larvae is high or ambient temperature is high. We need to consider additional control methods in order to maintain the efficiency of copepods to suppress mosquito increase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aMesocyclops aspericornis 3aadverse effects 3aambient temperature 3aaquatic organisms 3abiological control 3aclimate change 3adengue 3ainsect larvae 3aintraspecific competition 3anutrition 3apredation 3aprogeny 3apupae 3avaccines 3avector control 3aVietnam1 aPhong, Tran  Vu1 aTakagi, Masahiro 0 tInsects.g2020 May 14, v. 11, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects110503073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245010900161300001800270520092100288592002801209596007901237596006301316596007301379650001501452650001301467650001801480650001301498650001401511650001901525650001201544650002101556650001601577700001401593700001501607700001801622700001601640700001301656773012101669856008201790852000901872655001201881IND60573570020221118071056.0180912e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057357002DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-016-0486-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Gang10aEnhanced photoactivities of ternary composite coating by antireflection and double P–N heterojunctions  ap. 1981-1987.  aIn this paper, we present a convenient and universal strategy to sequentially assemble titania (TiO₂) nanorods and polyaniline (PANI) nanoparticles on the Si wafers through hydrothermal synthesis and chemical oxidation. On the one hand, the composite coatings (PANI/TiO₂/Si) with hierarchical structures reduced the reflectivity to less than 5 % at the wavelengths from 200 to 2500 nm, namely increasing the absorption efficiency of incident light. On the other hand, the double P–N heterojunctions that the composite coatings developed could suppress the recombination of photogenerated carriers, namely enhancing utilization efficiency of absorbed light. The photocurrent density of PANI/TiO₂/Si was above two times higher than that of TiO₂/Si at 1.5 V of positive potentials. The application of such coatings in the photocatalysis area, which are fabricated with this method, is thus straightforward.  aPublisher supplied data  a21401079, 21501069, 21671081cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aBK20140158cJiangsu Province Science Foundation for Youths  aJUSRP51626BcFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aabsorption 3acoatings 3ananoparticles 3ananorods 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3asilicon 3atitanium dioxide 3awavelengths1 aChen, Jie1 aNi, Caihua1 aZhang, Liping1 aWang, Dawei1 aLi, Ying0 tJournal of materials science.g2017 Feb., v. 52, no. 4 p.1981-1987dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-016-0486-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245015900177300001400336520124000350592002801590650002301618650002701641650001901668650001601687650001801703650002601721650001201747650001701759650001701776650002101793650001001814650001501824650001501839650001301854650002201867650001601889653001201905653001201917653000701929653000801936653001201944653000801956653001901964653002801983653001302011653002602024653000902050653002002059773008502079856008502164852000902249655001202258IND60635222820221119210747.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063522282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micron.2019.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaźmierczak, Andrzej,10aFluctuations in cell cycle, morphology and metabolism of Anemia phyllitidis gametophytes are the most important hallmarks of GA3-induced antheridiogenesis  ap. 66-76.  aThe research object concerns partially explained mechanisms of plant hormone participation in male sex determination in plants, among them in A. phyllitidis gametophytes during GA3-induced antheridiogenesis.To provide an explanation of the mechanisms of fluorescence and white-light microscopy, cytophotometric, autoradiographic and spectrophotometic methods were used to study cell cycle, the number of nucleoli, the amount of DiOC6-stained IMN/ER, in which endoplasmic reticulum (ER) constitutes the main part, and its distribution as well as the amounts of proteins and chlorophylls and activities of acidic (Ac) and basic (Ba) phosphatases (Phases).It was revealed that antheridiogenesis was accompanied by cell cycle arrest at S-phase, changes of the number of nucleoli with simultaneous changes of the amount of IMN/ER and its distribution as well as fluctuations of protein amounts and of activities of acidic (Ac) and basic (Ba) phosphatases (Phases).The results indicated that initiation of antheridiogenesis in A. phyllitidis gametophytes by GA3 was related to the elevation of GAs/ANs in the culture media, during its induction phase, and the elevation of IMN/ER and GAs/ANs amounts, during expression phase of this process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnemia phyllitidis 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell nucleolus 3achlorophyll 3aculture media 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aenzymes 3afluorescence 3agametophytes 3agibberellic acid 3amales 3ametabolism 3amicroscopy 3aproteins 3asex determination 3awhite light 0aAcPhase 0aBaPhase 0aER 0aGA3 0aGAs/ANs 0aIMN 0aAntheridiogens 0aFluorescence microscopy 0aEthylene 0aEndoplasmic reticulum 0aFern 0aGibberllic acid0 tMicron.g2019 June, v. 121 p.66-76dElsevier LtdwJournal:12416x0968-43287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micron.2019.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02231naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245014700173300001200320506002800332520100000360592002801360506003701388650004001425650001301465650002401478650001701502650001901519650001701538700001101555700001801566700001701584700001601601773015301617856009001770852000901860655001201869IND60785533520221207093702.0200314e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078553352DNAL7 a10.24843/Pastura.2018.v08.i01.p012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSowmen, Simel10aAPPLICATION OF DIFFERENT P FERTILIZATION ON THE GROWTH AND NODULES OF Pueraria javanica INOCULATED WITH ARBUSCULAR MYCHORRIZA FUNGY IN ULTISOL  ap. 1-4.  aResource is Open Access  aThis research was aims to assess effect of the different phospor fertilizer on the growth and nodules in Pueraria javanica inoculated with Arbuscular Fungi Micorrhyza. This experimental design was Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with three phospor fertilizer treatments: P0 = 0 kg/ha phosphor (0, g/pot), P1 = SP36 200 kg/ha (1 g/pot), and P2 = rock phosphate 200 kg/ha (1 g/pot), with four replicates. The whole pot treatments received mycorrhizal inoculation. The variables measured were plant height, number of leaves, number of branches, root length, number of root nodule, number of active nodules , and the percentage of active nodules.

We tested the host-quality-effect hypothesis by analyzing the chemical composition of scent bouquets emitted by calling males of two polyphagous tephritid species (<i>Anastrepha</i> <i>ludens</i> and <i>A</i>. <i>obliqua</i>) that originated from 13 fruit species representing diverse plant families. In <i>A</i>. <i>ludens</i>, we worked with an ancestral host (Rutaceae), nine exotic ones (Rutaceae, Anacardiaceae, Rosaceae, Solanaceae, Lythraceae), and two species never attacked in nature but that represent candidates for host-range expansion (Solanaceae, Myrtaceae). In <i>A</i>. <i>obliqua</i>, we tested an ancestral, a native, and an exotic host (Anacardiaceae), one occasional (Myrtaceae), and one fruit never attacked in nature (Solanaceae). We identified a core scent bouquet and significant variation in the bouquet&rsquo;s composition depending on the fruit the larvae developed in. We also tested the possible microbial role on the scent bouquet by treating adults with antibiotics, finding a significant effect on quantity but not composition. We dwell on plasticity to partially explain our results and discuss the influence hosts could have on male competitiveness driven by variations in scent bouquet composition and how this could impact insect sterile technique programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnacardiaceae 3aAnastrepha ludens 3aAnastrepha obliqua 3aLythraceae 3aMyrtaceae 3aRosaceae 3aRutaceae 3aSolanaceae 3aadults 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3aaseptic conditions 3achemical composition 3afruits 3ahost plants 3ahost range 3ainsect pests 3alarvae 3amales 3aodors 3areproductive success 3asex pheromones1 aCabagne, Gabriela 1 aAltúzar-Molina, Alma 1 aPascacio-Villafán, Carlos 1 aEnciso, Erick 1 aGuillén, Larissa 0 tInsects.g2020 May 14, v. 11, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects110503093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02089naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245010100178506002800279520089500307592002801202506003701230650003801267650002501305650001101330650001601341650001101357650001401368650001001382650001001392650001101402653001901413653000901432653001501441700002501456700001401481773009701495856009001592852000901682655001201691IND60785533620221207093629.0180207s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078553362DNAL7 a10.24246/agric.2014.v26.i1.p75-842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdillah, Jalalina10aPengaruh dosis ragi dan penambahan gula terhadap kualitas gizi dan organoleptik tape biji gandum  aResource is Open Access  aTape yeast in certain dose is required in making tape.

We studied the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on plant growth, mineral nutrition and biological nitrogen fixation of Melilotus alba Med., a forage legume with potential use in subtropical grasslands. Responses to AMF inoculation (a mix of Funneliformis mosseae, Rhizophagus irregularis and Simiglomus hoi) and phosphate fertilization were evaluated in plants growing for 12 weeks in a subtropical soil. All plants were previously inoculated with a suspension of Rhizobium meliloti. Plant responses were assessed in terms of mycorrhizal colonization, biomass production, mineral nutrition (P and N) and proportion of biological nitrogen fixation by 15N natural abundance method. The results showed that when soil phosphorus availability was very low, regardless of the degree of AMF colonization, the generation of mycorrhizae did not reach a significant impact on plant nutrition and biomass production. But under a relatively higher phosphorus provision, AMF symbiosis showed positive effects on phosphorus accumulation, nitrogen nutrition and biomass production, linked to an enhancement of biological nitrogen fixation. The results strengthen our understanding of how synergistic effects between belowground symbionts (in this case AMF + Rhizobium) could promote the recruitment of forage legumes in subtropical grassland soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnsifer meliloti 3aGlomus mosseae 3aMelilotus albus 3aRhizobium 3aRhizophagus irregularis 3abiomass production 3aecosystems 3aforage legumes 3agrassland soils 3agrasslands 3amicrosymbionts 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3anutrients 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3aplant nutrition 3aplant response 3astable isotopes 3asubtropical soils 3asynergism 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 0aForage legumes 0aMycorrhiza 0aNitrogen fixation 0aPhosphorus 0aSubtropical grasslands 0aSymbiosis1 aPorta, Miriam1 aSchäufele, Rudi1 aGrimoldi, Agustín A.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2019 Feb., v. 134 p.38-44dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2018.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006800147245012500215300001400340520125000354592002801604650001701632650001901649650001801668650001201686650001201698650001201710650001901722650002001741650001201761650001201773650001901785650001401804650002101818650002401839650001001863650001001873650002001883650001601903650001201919650002001931650001901951650001701970650002201987650001602009650001902025650001602044650000902060651001102069653002302080653002002103653001902123653001202142653001802154653002102172653002202193653002302215653001102238700002802249700006902277700001802346700001902364700002802383700001702411700002202428700001902450773014602469856008202615852000902697655001202706IND60635223020221119210448.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063522302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.esd.2019.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadilla-Barrera, Zuhelen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2721-046810aDetermination of emission factors for climate forcers and air pollutants from improved wood-burning cookstoves in Mexico  ap. 61-68.  aThe estimation of emissions inventories of climate forcing species and air pollutants from activities such as the burning of biomass from cooking food in rural environments in Mexico presents some degree of uncertainty due to the lack of locally obtained emission factors; emissions estimates were generally obtained with other types of biomass and cookstoves. This study presents a controlled dilution system to obtain emission factors for gases (CO2, CH4, CO, NMHC, NOx, and SO2) and PM2.5 (and its components, elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC)) from improved wood-burning stoves. The sampling experiment combines measurements of PM2.5 and gases from a diluted stream of emissions, with carbon mass balance methods and concentration ratios of CO2 and CO to obtain average emission factors under the Water Boiling Test (WBT) protocol. The feasibility of the experimental design is demonstrated by an application of using white oak wood as fuel in an improved Patsari stove. The ranges of average emission factors obtained for the Patsari stove in g/kg of wood consumed for four representative species were: CO2, 1305–1423; OC, 1.47–2.07; EC, 0.13–0.17; PM2.5, 1.97–4.19, and are within the ranges reported in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus alba 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3abiomass 3aboiling 3aburning 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3aclimate 3acooking 3acooking stoves 3aemissions 3aemissions factor 3aexperimental design 3afuels 3agases 3aheating systems 3ainventories 3amethane 3anitrogen oxides 3aorganic carbon 3aparticulates 3aradiative forcing 3arural areas 3asulfur dioxide 3auncertainty 3awood 3aMexico 0aParticulate matter 0aCarbon monoxide 0aCarbon dioxide 0aMethane 0aPatsari stove 0aElemental carbon 0aThree-stone fires 0aWater Boiling Test 0aCarbon1 aTorres-Jardón, Ricardo1 aGerardo Ruiz-Suarez, Luis1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4159-12171 aCastro, Telma1 aPeralta, Oscar1 aSaavedra, Maria Isabel,1 aMasera, Omar1 aTan Molina, Luisa1 aZavala, Miguel0 tEnergy for sustainable development.g2019 June, v. 50 p.61-68dElsevier Inc.aInternational Energy InitiativewJournal:12424x0973-08267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2019.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245017900162300001800341520179600359592002802155650001102183650001102194650001702205650002002222651001002242700001602252773010402268856004802372852000902420655001202429IND50074904820221116175826.0140410e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007490482DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-013-2786-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Xiang14aThe temporal-spatial variation of water resources constraint on urbanization in the northwestern China: examples from the Gansu section of west Longhai–Lanxin economic zone  ap. 4029-4037.  aBased on more than 2,000 data points reflecting various meaningful aspects of urban systems and water-resource systems, and using a quantitative measurement model and ArcGIS, this study discusses the temporal-spatial variations of water resources constraint on urbanization in the Gansu section of China. The conclusions were: (1) from 1989 to 2007 the water resources constraint intensities (WRCIs) of Gansu section and its 9 cities have been generally decreasing, albeit with much fluctuation, and the decrease has been more rapid since 2000, with Lanzhou and Jinchang as the most representative cities. There is, however, a great deal of variation of WRCI among the 9 cities: Lanzhou changed from intensive constraint to relatively strong constraint, with a significant decline in its WRCI; 5 cities changed from extreme constraint to intensive constraint, including Wuwei and Jiuquan with significant declines in their WRCI, Jiayuguan and Jinchang with no dramatic declines and Dingxi with a fluctuating decline; and 3 cities remained at the same level of water resources constraint, including Zhangye and Baiyin with extreme constraint, and Tianshui with intensive constraint. (2) Looking at the 20-year average of WRCI, there are three types of spatial variations among the 9 cities in the Gansu section: Lanzhou, the capital city of Gansu Province, belongs to the relatively strong constraint-high type; 4 cities—Jiuquan, Jiayuguan, Jinchang and Tianshui—belong to the intensive constraint-high type; and the remaining 4 cities—Zhangye, Wuwei, Baiyin and Dxingxi—belong to the extreme constraint-low type. These results show that the Gansu section will continue to be affected by water resources constraint on urbanization and local economic development for some time to come.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3amodels 3aurbanization 3awater resources 3aChina1 aYu, Tengfei0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2014 May, v. 71, no. 9 p.4029-4037dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-013-2786-0  aDNAL 7aarticle01767naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245010800179300001400287520083600301592002801137650001401165650001101179650000701190650002801197650001901225700002301244700001801267773009001285856008101375852000901456655001201465IND60085800120221119005153.0141101e20121024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008580012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2012.08.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, V.K.q(Vinod Kumar),12aA new beryllium ion-selective membrane electrode based on dibenzo(perhydrotriazino)aza-14-crown-4 ether  ap. 44-50.  aBeryllium(II) selective electrodes have been fabricated based on poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) matrix membranes containing newly synthesized neutral carrier dibenzo(perhydrotriazino)aza-14-crown-4 ethers as ionophore. Best performance was exhibited by the membrane having a composition ionophore (IIa):PVC:sodium tetraphenylborate (NaTPB):tributyl phosphate (TBP) in the ratio (w/w; mg) of 5:30:3:65. This membrane worked well over a wide concentration range 7.6×10⁻⁶ to 1.0×10⁻¹M of Be²⁺ with a Nernstian slope of 30.7mV per decade of beryllium activity. The response time of the sensor is 15s and the membrane can be used over a period of 4months with good reproducibility. The proposed electrode works well in a wide pH range 3.0–9.0. It was successfully applied to the determination of beryllium in a mineral sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3aberyllium 3aethers 3apH 3aspecific ion electrodes 3avinyl chloride1 aSingh, Ashok Kumar1 aMergu, Naveen0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2012 Oct. 24, v. 749 p.44-50dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2012.08.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04462naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016700168300001400335520212100349592002802470650001902498650001602517650001902533650001602552650001902568650002602587650002602613650001102639650002402650650000902674650001802683650002102701650002002722650002702742650002602769650002302795650002202818650001902840650001302859650002502872650001402897650002402911650001102935650001302946650001802959650001502977650002402992650001803016650002003034650001203054651001003066653001403076653002003090653002303110653003403133653002503167653003203192700006003224700001903284700005903303700001803362700002403380700005803404700005703462773010303519856008503622852000903707655001203716IND60622980720221120074146.0190408e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062298072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2018.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSandén, Taru10aOut of sight: Profiling soil characteristics, nutrients and bacterial communities affected by organic amendments down to one meter in a long-term maize experiment  ap. 54-63.  aCommon soil characteristics, nutrients and microbial activity at deeper soil depths are topics seldom covered in agricultural studies. Biogeochemical cycles in deep soils are not yet fully understood. This study investigates the effect of different mineral and organic fertilisation on soil organic matter dynamics, nutrients and bacterial community composition in the first meter of the soil profiles in the long-term maize cropping system experiment Tetto Frati, near the Po River in northern Italy. The following treatments have been applied since 1992: 1) crop residue removal (CRR), 2) crop residue incorporation (CRI), 3) crop residue removal with bovine slurry fertilisation (SLU), 4) crop residue removal with farmyard manure fertilisation (FYM). A total of 250 kg N ha−1 were applied annually as mineral fertiliser in the first two and as organic fertilizer in the latter two treatments. Soil organic carbon (SOC) was significantly higher in the treatments with organic amendments (CRI, SLU and FYM) compared to CRR in 0–25 cm (11.1, 11.6, 14.7 vs. 9.8 g kg−1, respectively), but not in the deeper soil. At 75–100 cm soil depth, SLU and FYM had the highest potential N mineralisation. Bacterial diversity decreased down the soil profile much less than microbial biomass. Incorporation of crop residues alone showed no positive effects on either biomass or diversity, whereas fertilisation by FYM instead of mineral fertilizer did. Bacterial community composition showed depth-related shifts: Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria dominated the topsoil, whereas Chloroflexi, Nitrospira and Thermotogae were relatively more abundant deeper in the soil profile. Although the main factor determining soil bacterial community composition in the entire dataset was soil depth, both the size and diversity of bacterial community, as well as several discriminating taxa, were affected by organic N fertilisation down to 1 m depth. This calls for continued efforts to study the deeper soil depths in the numerous long-term field experiments, where mostly topsoils are currently studied in detail.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aChloroflexi 3aProteobacteria 3aThermotogae 3aanimal manures 3abacterial communities 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acattle 3acommunity structure 3acorn 3acrop residues 3acropping systems 3adata collection 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrients 3aorganic fertilizers 3arivers 3aslurries 3asoil bacteria 3asoil depth 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil profiles 3asoil properties 3atopsoil 3aItaly 0aDeep soil 0aSoil microbiome 0aOrganic amendments 0aFarmyard manure fertilisation 0aLong-term experiment 0aBovine slurry fertilisation1 aZavattaro, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2496-63071 aSpiegel, Heide1 aGrignani, Carlo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3702-52631 aSandén, Hans1 aBaumgarten, Andreas1 aTiirola, Marja1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5589-37481 aMikkonen, Anu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8199-73990 tApplied soil ecology.g2019 Feb., v. 134 p.54-63dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2018.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245007600175300001400251520113200265592002801397650001801425650001201443650002101455650001301476650002001489650002001509650002201529650002401551650002001575650001101595650001601606650001601622650001201638653001101650653001201661653001501673653002301688653002301711653002501734700002501759700003201784700002201816773011001838856008701948852000902035655001202044IND60541534920221118162919.0190318e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054153492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2015.03.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJurado-Alameda, E.10aStarch-soiled stainless steel cleaning using surfactants and α-amylase  ap. 56-64.  aThe cleaning of dry starch adhered to stainless steel has been studied in a device which simulates a CIP system. The influence of an α-amylase, two polyoxyethylene lauryl ether carboxylic acids, a linear alkyl benzene sulfonate, a fatty ethoxylated alcohol, an alkylpolyglycoside, and two polyoxyethylene mono- and diglycerides has been analysed. The variables analysed were temperature, enzyme concentration, and different surfactants. The enzyme allowed for milder washing conditions improving starch removal. Surfactants, including the anionic ones, did not meaningfully alter the enzyme activity. Furthermore, they did not significantly modify the detergency in the presence or absence of enzyme, except for ethoxylated alcohol and polyoxyethylene(3) lauryl ether carboxylic acid solutions which decreased the detergency of the enzyme solutions. Temperature increase improved detergency either in the presence or absence of enzyme or surfactants. The experimental results advised interactions between those surfactants, the enzyme and the substrate, which could affect washing performance, basically at high washing times.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-amylase 3abenzene 3acarboxylic acids 3acleaning 3adiacylglycerols 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme substrates 3apolyethylene glycol 3astainless steel 3astarch 3asurfactants 3atemperature 3awashing 0aStarch 0aAmylase 0aDetergency 0aEnzymatic activity 0aAnionic surfactant 0aNon-ionic surfactant1 aHerrera-Márquez, O.1 aMartínez-Gallegos, Juan F.1 aVicaria, José M.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2015 Sept., v. 160 p.56-64dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2015.03.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007800167300001600245520114800261592002801409650002401437650001401461650001101475650002101486650002301507650001701530650002601547650001601573650002101589650003101610650001101641650002301652650001501675650001401690650001401704650001701718650001401735653002101749653001701770653001401787653002301801653002001824700001701844700001401861700001801875700001801893773011101911856008402022852000902106655001202115IND60122938320221119071135.0150325e20140704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012293832DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2014.8890492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLa Torre, A.10aEvaluation of essential plant oils for the control of Plasmopara viticola  ap. 282-291.  aThe aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of various concentrations of tea tree oil and clove oil against Plasmopara viticola. In vitro tests entailed assessing the development of P . viticola on leaf disks and calculating sporangial germination. In a field trial, formulated products containing 23.8% tea tree oil (BM-608) and 15% clove oil (Sporatec) were tested in an organic vineyard to control downy mildew. The efficacy of pure and formulated essential oils was compared with a water control and a reference product (Airone, containing copper oxychloride 50% and copper hydroxide 50%). Laboratory experiments revealed the inhibitory activity of essential oils, although the effectiveness was lower than that of the reference product. The field data demonstrated that BM-608 and Sporatec were able to control the development of downy mildew although they were not as effective as the reference product. This study suggests the application of essential oils in order to reduce the use of synthetic pesticides in agriculture, in accordance with European laws, and to avoid the environmental pollution of copper in organic farming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmopara viticola 3aclove oil 3acopper 3acopper hydroxide 3acopper oxychloride 3adowny mildew 3afield experimentation 3agermination 3ain vitro studies 3alaboratory experimentation 3aleaves 3aorganic production 3apesticides 3apollution 3asporangia 3atea tree oil 3avineyards 0anatural products 0atea tree oil 0aclove oil 0agrape downy mildew 0aorganic farming1 aMandalà, C.1 aPezza, L.1 aCaradonia, F.1 aBattaglia, V.0 tJournal of essential oil research.g2014 July 4, v. 26, no. 4 p.282-291dTaylor & Francisx2163-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10412905.2014.8890493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245009700207300001800304506007600322520122900398592002801627506003701655650001701692650002101709650001401730650001101744650002601755650002201781650002601803650001301829650002001842650001501862650001401877650002501891650002001916650001201936653001501948653001601963653001301979653002701992653001002019653000902029653000902038653000702047653000902054653000902063653000702072653000902079653001002088653000902098653000802107653001102115653001002126653000802136653000702144653000802151653001102159653000902170653001002179700002002189700002002209700001702229773012202246856008102368852000902449655001202458IND60648295520221207094208.0190628e20180622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064829552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2018.04.0392doi7 aPMC70943772pmcid7 a297468512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLasswitz, Lisa10aGlycomics and Proteomics Approaches to Investigate Early Adenovirus–Host Cell Interactions  ap. 1863-1882.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAdenoviruses as most viruses rely on glycan and protein interactions to attach to and enter susceptible host cells. The Adenoviridae family comprises more than 80 human types and they differ in their attachment factor and receptor usage, which likely contributes to the diverse tropism of the different types. In the past years, methods to systematically identify glycan and protein interactions have advanced. In particular sensitivity, speed and coverage of mass spectrometric analyses allow for high-throughput identification of glycans and peptides separated by liquid chromatography. Also, developments in glycan microarray technologies have led to targeted, high-throughput screening and identification of glycan-based receptors. The mapping of cell surface interactions of the diverse adenovirus types has implications for cell, tissue, and species tropism as well as drug development. Here we review known adenovirus interactions with glycan- and protein-based receptors, as well as glycomics and proteomics strategies to identify yet elusive virus receptors and attachment factors. We finally discuss challenges, bottlenecks, and future research directions in the field of non-enveloped virus entry into host cells.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAdenoviridae 3adrug development 3aglycomics 3ahumans 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amicroarray technology 3apeptides 3apolysaccharides 3aproteomics 3ascreening 3asurface interactions 3avirus receptors 3aviruses 0aadenovirus 0avirus entry 0aglycomis 0ahost cell interactions 0aHAdVs 0aLSFs 0aSSFs 0aSA 0aIAVs 0aGAGs 0aHS 0aHSPG 0aHBGAs 0aGSLs 0aCAR 0aVCAM-1 0aMHC-I 0aCFG 0aSG 0aICL 0aVOPBAs 0aVAPs 0aAE-MS1 aChandra, Naresh1 aArnberg, Niklas1 aGerold, Gisa0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2018 June 22, v. 430, no. 13 p.1863-1882dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2018.04.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245020200173300001600375520145200391592002801843650002301871650001701894650001201911650001601923650001901939650001801958650001601976650001801992650001702010650001502027650001502042650002002057650002502077650001402102650001102116650004402127650001702171653002402188653003502212653003802247653004902285653003102334700002102365700002002386700001902406773009502425856008402520852000902604655001202613IND60528033520221120103733.0190416e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052803352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2016.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtiz-Tena, Jose G.10aRevealing the diversity of algal monosaccharides: Fast carbohydrate fingerprinting of microalgae using crude biomass and showcasing sugar distribution in Chlorella vulgaris by biomass fractionation  ap. 227-235.  aThe quantitative and qualitative analysis of carbohydrates from algae is essential for the optimal utilization of algal biomass. A previously established high throughput method for the identification of complex carbohydrates was applied to microalgae. It is based on the selective derivatization of monosaccharides by 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP), UHPLC separation and MS analysis of the derivatives. The crude biomass of six different representative microalgae was analyzed and the monosaccharide composition after trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) hydrolysis is reported here. In addition to the usually found neutral sugars, uronic acids, and amino sugars, with this method methylated and phosphorylated or sulfated monosaccharides were also identified. The PMP derivatization enabled a monosaccharide recovery in the hydrolysates between 90% and 105% in five strains. Furthermore, a fractionation process with an overall recovery of 82% was applied to the microalga Chlorella vulgaris to investigate the carbohydrate distribution in the cell. The relative amounts of starch, soluble sugars, carbohydrates associated with glycoproteins and glycolipids, as well as the structural polysaccharides were determined. Due to its advantages, this method can help in strain screening and designing of proper strategies for maximal biomass development, formation of rare sugars as well as general utilization in the emerging field of algal biorefinery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aamino sugars 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3aderivatization 3afractionation 3aglycolipids 3aglycoproteins 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3amicroalgae 3amonosaccharides 3aqualitative analysis 3ascreening 3astarch 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3auronic acids 0aAlgal carbohydrates 0a1-Phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone 0aAutomatable carbohydrate analysis 0aUltra high performance liquid chromatography 0aMass spectroscopy analysis1 aRühmann, Broder1 aSchieder, Doris1 aSieber, Volker0 tAlgal research.g2016 July, v. 17 p.227-235dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2016.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03829naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010000168300001600268520168400284592002801968650002401996650002302020650002302043650002702066650001802093650001902111650001502130650001602145650001902161650001802180650001202198650001402210650001302224650001002237650002802247650001102275650001302286650000902299650002402308650001402332650001302346650002202359650001502381650001402396650002602410650002502436650001702461650001902478650001202497650001902509650001702528650002802545653001902573653001502592653002102607653003202628700002102660700001602681700002002697700002102717700001502738700002402753700002502777700001602802700001902818700002302837773010502860856008502965852000903050655001203059IND60622980820221120074139.0190408e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062298082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2018.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSattar, Annum10aPerspectives of potassium solubilizing microbes in sustainable food production system: A review  ap. 146-159.  aPotassium is a major essential plant nutrient that plays a pivotal role in plant physiological and metabolic processes, and provides resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses. In order to feed an ever increasing world population, cultivation of high yielding varieties in an intensive production system during the last few decades caused depletion soil fertility status, especially potassium (K). As 90–98% K reserves in soil system are non-exchangeable mineral sources, efficient rhizospheric microbes (ERMs) are needed to effectively dissolve this mineral and make it available to plants. A diverse group of ERMs such as rhizobacteria (Bacillus edaphicus, B. mucilaginosus, Acidothiobacillus ferrooxidans, B. circulans, Paenibacillus sp.), fungal strains (Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus sp.) and nitrogen fixing rhizobacteria (NFR) is involved in K mineral (orthoclase, muscovite, feldspar, biotite, mica, illite) solubilization. Mechanisms utilized by microbes for K dissolution are organic acid production, lowering soil pH, acidolysis, chelation, exchange reactions and complexation. These ERMs also contribute to other beneficial effects such as production of growth hormones, nitrogen (N) fixation, phosphorus (P) dissolution, enlargement of root system and antibiotic production. More specifically, potassium solubilizing microbes (KSMs) are being commercialized in the form of biofertilizer and inoculum to alleviate constraints of chemical fertilizers. This is an ecofriendly approach towards sustainable food production systems in many countries of the world. This report updates our current knowledge and potential for developing microbial based products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus terreus 3aBacillus circulans 3aBacillus edaphicus 3aBacillus mucilaginosus 3aPaenibacillus 3aabiotic stress 3aacidolysis 3aantibiotics 3abiofertilizers 3abiotic stress 3abiotite 3achelation 3afeldspar 3afungi 3ahigh-yielding varieties 3aillite 3ainoculum 3amica 3amineral fertilizers 3amuscovite 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aproduction technology 3arhizosphere bacteria 3aroot systems 3asoil fertility 3asoil pH 3asolubilization 3asomatotropin 3asustainable agriculture 0aSoil fertility 0aK dynamics 0aK solubilization 0aSustainable food production1 aNaveed, Muhammad1 aAli, Mohsin1 aZahir, Zahir A.1 aNadeem, Sajid M.1 aYaseen, M.1 aSingh Meena, Vijay,1 aFārūq, Muḥammad,1 aSingh, Renu1 aRahman, Mahfuz1 aMeena, Har Narayan0 tApplied soil ecology.g2019 Jan., v. 133 p.146-159dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2018.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03529naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001900139245012200158300001600280500001500296520238300311650001502694650001302709650001602722650002202738650002302760650001202783650002502795650001902820651001502839653001602854653001602870700001602886773008202902852000902984856007902993930003303072945001303105946001303118655001203131IND2061074320221121152938.0980105e199704  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206107432DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/26.2.1422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCostello, M.J.10aComparison of sampling methods used to estimate spider (Araneae) species abundance and composition in grape vineyards  ap. 142-149.  a2019-12-04  aThe effectiveness of 3 methods for sampling spiders in grape vineyards was tested. The sampling methods were as follows: (1) a drop-cloth method in which spiders were dislodged from a 5.1-m2 area of grapevine onto a drop cloth, (2) a funnel method in which spiders were dislodged into a 0.74-m2 funnel, and (3) a D-vac method in which 50 sections of grapevine (30-cm sections, total area of 5.4 m2) were suctioned with a gasoline-powered vacuum. Data from all sampling methods were adjusted for area sampled and compared with an absolute control, in which foliage from an entire vine was removed and searched for spiders. Analyses were made on the following 8 most abundant spider species: Anyphaena pacifica Banks, Metaphidippus vitis (Cockerell), Theridion dilutum Levi and Theridion melanurum Hahn (grouped as Theridion spp.), Cheiracanthium inclusum (Hentz), Hololena nedra Chamberlin & Ivie, Trachelas pacificus (Chamberlin & Ivie), and Erigone dentosa (O.P.-Cambridge). Mean spider abundance from each sampling method differed significantly from the absolute control in (greater than or equal to 1) species. The funnel method often overestimated spider abundance while the drop-cloth and D-vac methods often underestimated spider abundance. Estimates of spider species composition were most accurately measured by the drop-cloth method and were significantly altered by the D-vac method. We tested 3 data transformations (ln[x + 1], square root [x + 0.5]. and x(1-b/2)) to stabilize the variance and satisfy the requirements of analysis of variance (ANOVA). No single transformation uncoupled the mean and variance for all spider species over the 3 sampling methods. Using mean and variance of mean spider abundance, sample size and dispersion parameters were created by way of the Taylor power law. Sample sizes were determined for each sampling method, estimates of sample size and sampling costs varied considerably among spider species and sampling methods. All but 1 spider species collected with the drop-cloth method had a clumped distribution, the funnel method produced variable dispersion indexes, and all spider species collected with the D-vac method had a random distribution pattern. Whereas no single sampling method was best for all spider species, the funnel method is favored because of its efficiency in estimating spider densities and its reduced cost. 3aestimation 3asampling 3aviticulture 3aspecies diversity 3apopulation density 3aAraneae 3astatistical analysis 3aVitis vinifera 3aCalifornia 0acomparisons 0amethodology1 aDaane, K.M.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1997 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.142-149x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/26.2.1423Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle01349naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006500128300001400193500002300207520053200230650001200762650000800774650002300782653002300805653001400828653001900842653001700861700001800878700001700896773008000913939003300993852000901026655001201035IND9200256620221121120337.0920116e199110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920025662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCubbage, F.W.10aCross-sectional estimates of logging equipment resale values  ap. 16-22.  aLiterature review.  aPrices for used logging equipment were collected from various sources and compared with the original sales price based on equipment age, condition, and geographic region.

Associational resistance is a grazing avoidance mechanism resulting from herbivores being less inclined to eat palatable plant species when these species grow in association with unpalatable species. Such facilitative interactions between plant species may have important consequences for patterns of relative abundance and reproduction in plant communities. 2. We studied the relationship between abundance and flowering success of palatable species and the cover of three unpalatable species (Senecio jacobaea, Iris pseudacorus and Lysimachia vulgaris) in a grassland where moderately intense grazing (0.17-0.42 grazers ha(-1)) had been ongoing for 3 years. Plots were selected so that there were no systematic differences in microenvironmental conditions associated with the level of cover of unpalatable species. 3. Several palatable species had a higher frequency, cover and/or flowering success when they grew in the neighbourhood of an unpalatable species. 4. Several species (both palatable and unpalatable) were significantly taller in the vicinity of a large unpalatable species, probably due to the combined effects of grazing avoidance and increased light competition. 5. These facilitative effects, however, have not yet resulted in a higher local species richness or plant community evenness. It is nevertheless likely that more pronounced effects will be seen if grazing is continued, because facilitative interactions between plant species induced by grazing have already led to a shift in patterns of abundance and flowering success. 3aflowering 3aplant communities 3aIris pseudacorus 3aspatial distribution 3agrazing 3abotanical composition 3aLysimachia 3amicrohabitats 3aherbivores 3avegetation cover 3aheight 3aJacobaea vulgaris 3aplant competition 3aplant reproduction 3apalatability 3afeeding preferences 3agrasslands 3alight 3aBelgium 0aLysimachia vulgaris 0aSenecio jacobaea 0aspecies diversity1 aFre, B. de1 aHoffmann, M.0 tjournal of ecology.g2005 Dec., v. 93, no. 6 p.1104-1114dCambridge University Pressx0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01059.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110423b20110507c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/01/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02411naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245007500203300002000278506007600298520101700374506003701391650002401428650001301452650001601465650002501481650002201506650001601528700002001544700002401564700002201588700002101610700002001631700002401651773017601675852000901851856008301860930003301943946001301976655001201989IND4424565820221207111723.0090814e20090811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442456582DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09026511062doi7 aPMC27264222pmcid7 a196516042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeschek, Jirka14aThe eye lens chaperone α-crystallin forms defined globular assemblies  ap. 13272-13277.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aα-Crystallins are molecular chaperones that protect vertebrate eye lens proteins from detrimental protein aggregation. αB-Crystallin, 1 of the 2 α-crystallin isoforms, is also associated with myopathies and neuropathological diseases. Despite the importance of α-crystallins in protein homeostasis, only little is known about their quaternary structures because of their seemingly polydisperse nature. Here, we analyzed the structures of recombinant α-crystallins using biophysical methods. In contrast to previous reports, we show that αB-crystallin assembles into defined oligomers consisting of 24 subunits. The 3-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of αB-crystallin by electron microscopy reveals a sphere-like structure with large openings to the interior of the protein. αA-Crystallin forms, in addition to complexes of 24 subunits, also smaller oligomers and large clusters consisting of individual oligomers. This propensity might explain the previously reported polydisperse nature of α-crystallin.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aelectron microscopy 3aeye lens 3ahomeostasis 3amolecular chaperones 3amuscular diseases 3avertebrates1 aBraun, Nathalie1 aFranzmann, Titus M.1 aGeorgalis, Yannis1 aHaslbeck, Martin1 aWeinkauf, Sevil1 aBüchner, Johannes.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Aug. 11, v. 106, no. 32 p.13272-13277dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09026511063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090814b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01249naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245005400127300001600181500010600197520019100303650002300494650001600517650001600533650001000549650002100559650001500580650002200595650002300617650002100640650001500661653002300676700001600699773009400715852000900809930003300818945001300851946001100864655001200875IND2054026620221121120406.0961114e199607  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205402662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibney, E.R.10aReport of macronutrient metabolism group workshop  ap. 725-736.  aPaper presented at the workshop on Measurement of energy expenditure, November 7, 1995, Cambridge, UK  aFour methods for measuring energy expenditure are described in this article: indirect calorimetry; doubly-labeled water; heart rate; observational, and diary and pedometer-based methods. 3aenergy expenditure 3ameasurement 3acalorimetry 3awater 3aisotope labeling 3aheart rate 3aphysical activity 3aclinical nutrition 3abasal metabolism 3aprediction 0aliterature reviews1 aLeahy, F.E.0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g1996 July, v. 55, no. 2 p.725-736x0029-66517nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01609naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245009200131300001600223500021200239500001500451520016600466650002000632650003100652650002200683650001300705650002300718650002200741650001800763650001500781650002000796650002100816651001100837653002800848653001600876653003300892653001600925700001700941700001500958700001800973773009400991852000901085930003301094945001301127946001101140655001201151IND2054026120221121120341.0961114e199607  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205402612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrichopoulou, A.10aIntegration of nutritional data based on household budget surveys in European countries  ap. 699-704.  aPaper presented at the symposium on Nutritional assessment and surveillance: implications for food policy. 3.

In contrast, virtually nothing is known about the interspecific allometry of pachycaulis species. Here, the interspecific allometries for palms, cacti and cycads are reported and compared with those of leptocaulis dicot and conifer tree species to determine whether pachycauly limits H[subscript max] with respect to D[subscript max]. METHODS: Data for each of a total of 1461 pachycaulis and leptocaulis species were gathered from the primary literature. The scaling exponent and the allometric constant of logH[subscript max] vs. logD[subscript max] reduced major axis regression curves (and their respective 95 % confidence intervals) were used to compare the four species groups. The stem slenderness ratio (H[subscript max]/D[subscript max] = R[subscript max]) for each species was also computed to compare interspecific trends in trunk shape. KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Each of the four species groups is allometrically unique, i.e. no single 'canonical' maximum plant height to stem diameter allometry exists across all four species groups. Although pachycaulis does not intrinsically limit height, height is nevertheless limited by the size range of basal stem diameter occupied by each species group. Pachycaulis species achieve heights comparable to some leptocaulis species by virtue of very high slenderness ratios attended by an absence or paucity of stem branching. The diversity observed for pachycaulis stem allometries is likely the result of the independent evolutionary origins of this growth habit and the different anatomical strategies used to stiffen stems.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aplant growth 3adiameter 3astems 3aplant architecture 3aallometry 3aheight 3aSpermolepis 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aPlant Stemsxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aTreesxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 0aPachycaulis 0aApiaceae 0aplant morphology1 aCobb, Ed.1 aMarler, T.0 tAnnals of botany.g2006 Jan., v. 97, no. 1 p.79-83dAcademic Press [etc.]x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcj0023Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aob.oupjournals.org/3electronic resource  a20060301b20060402c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/03/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03269naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161072000900179072000900188072000900197072000900206100001500215245011400230300001400344500002400358506007600382520136900458506003701827650001501864650002601879650002101905650002301926650002501949650001001974650000901984650002101993650001402014650002202028650002102050650003102071650004002102650005402142650004102196650006402237700001702301700001602318700001202334700001702346773009502363852000902458856007802467856005302545930003302598945002502631946001102656655001202667IND4376663820221207112611.0051211e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437666382DNAL7 a163037722pmid7 aPMC28033742pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcj0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF840 0aF600 0aF400 0aF2001 aFukuta, N.10aPhysical restriction of pods causes seed size reduction of a brassinosteroid-deficient faba bean (Vicia faba)  ap. 65-69.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: A brassinosteroid-deficient mutant faba bean (Vicia faba 'Rinrei') shows dwarfism in many organs including pods and seeds. 'Rinrei' has normal-sized seeds together with dwarf seeds, suggesting that dwarfism in the seed may be indirectly caused by brassinosteroid deficiency. The mechanism of seed size reduction in this mutant was investigated. METHODS: The associations between seed orientation in the pod, seed numbers per pod and pod lengths with seed sizes were analysed in 'Rinrei' and the wild-type plant. KEY RESULTS: 'Rinrei' seeds are tightly arranged in pods containing two or three seeds. Seed size decreased as the number of seeds per pod increased or as the length of the pod decreased. Where no physical restriction occurred between seeds in a pod, the wild-type faba bean seeds had a nearly constant size regardless of seed number per pod or pod length. 'Rinrei' seeds in pods containing single seeds were the same size as wild-type seeds. Brassinolide treatment increased the seed size and the length of pods containing three seeds in 'Rinrei'. CONCLUSION: Seed size of 'Rinrei' is mainly regulated through a reduction of pod length due to brassinosteroid deficiency; physical restriction within pods causes a reduction in seed size. These results suggest a possible mechanism for increasing faba bean yields to optimal levels.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVicia faba 3anutrient deficiencies 3abrassinosteroids 3agrowth retardation 3aabnormal development 3aseeds 3apods 3aplant morphology 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 2aBrassinosteroids 2aCholestanolsxpharmacology 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxphysiology 2aSeedsxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & development. 2aSteroids, Heterocyclicxpharmacology 2aVicia fabaxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aFukuzono, K.1 aKawaide, H.1 aAbe, H.1 aNakayama, M.0 tAnnals of botany.g2006 Jan., v. 97, no. 1 p.65-69dAcademic Press [etc.]x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcj0143Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aob.oupjournals.org/3electronic resource  a20060301b20060402c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/03/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02875naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245013100202300002000333506007600353520093300429506003701362650002101399650000901420650001601429650002501445650002101470650000901491650002801500650002401528650001401552650001701566650001301583700001901596700001601615700002101631700002901652700003001681700001601711700001901727700001701746700002001763700002401783700002601807700001901833700001701852700002201869700001801891700002001909700001901929773017501948852000902123856008302132930003302215946001302248655001202261IND4424306420221207110143.0090807e20090804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442430642DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09051951062doi7 aPMC27222742pmcid7 a196207172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurke, Andrew10aLong-term survival following a single treatment of kidney tumors with multiwalled carbon nanotubes and near-infrared radiation  ap. 12897-12902.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMultiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) exhibit physical properties that render them ideal candidates for application as noninvasive mediators of photothermal cancer ablation. Here, we demonstrate that use of MWCNTs to generate heat in response to near-infrared radiation (NIR) results in thermal destruction of kidney cancer in vitro and in vivo. We document the thermal effects of the therapy through magnetic resonance temperature-mapping and heat shock protein-reactive immunohistochemistry. Our results demonstrate that use of MWCNTs enables ablation of tumors with low laser powers (3 W/cm²) and very short treatment times (a single 30-sec treatment) with minimal local toxicity and no evident systemic toxicity. These treatment parameters resulted in complete ablation of tumors and a >3.5-month durable remission in 80% of mice treated with 100 μg of MWCNT. Use of MWCNTs with NIR may be effective in anticancer therapy.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon nanotubes 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aimmunohistochemistry 3akidney neoplasms 3amice 3anear infrared radiation 3aphysical properties 3aremission 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity1 aDing, Xuanfeng1 aSingh, Ravi1 aKraft, Robert A.1 aLevi-Polyachenko, Nicole1 aRylander, Marissa Nichole1 aSzot, Chris1 aBuchanan, Cara1 aWhitney, Jon1 aFisher, Jessica1 aHatcher, Heather C.1 aD'Agostino, Ralph Jr.1 aKock, Nancy D.1 aAjayan, P.M.1 aCarroll, David L.1 aAkman, Steven1 aTorti, Frank M.1 aTorti, Suzy V.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Aug. 4, v. 106, no. 31 p.12897-12902dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09051951063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090808b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03434naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245006200204300002000266506007600286520176000362506003702122650002302159650002202182650001302204650002302217650001802240650001802258650001102276650001702287650000902304650000902313650000902322650002102331650001302352650002602365650001402391650001102405700002902416700001302445700001802458700002102476700003202497700002102529700001702550773017502567852000902742856008302751930003302834946001302867655001202880IND4424306320221207110145.0090807e20090804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442430632DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09044431062doi7 aPMC27223312pmcid7 a196256272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTasumi, Satoshi10aHigh-affinity lamprey VLRA and VLRB monoclonal antibodies  ap. 12891-12896.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLamprey are members of the ancestral vertebrate taxon (jawless fish), which evolved rearranging antigen receptors convergently with the jawed vertebrates. But instead of Ig superfamily domains, lamprey variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) consist of highly diverse leucine-rich repeats. Although VLRs represent the only known adaptive immune system not based on Ig, little is known about their antigen-binding properties. Here we report robust plasma VLRB responses of lamprey immunized with hen egg lysozyme and β-galactosidase (β-gal), demonstrating adaptive immune responses against soluble antigens. To isolate monoclonal VLRs, we constructed large VLR libraries from antigen-stimulated and naïve animals in a novel yeast surface-display vector, with the VLR C-terminally fused to the yeast Flo1p surface anchor. We cloned VLRB binders of lysozyme, β-gal, cholera toxin subunit B, R-phycoerythrin, and B-trisaccharide antigen, with dissociation constants up to the single-digit picomolar range, equivalent to those of high-affinity IgG antibodies. We also isolated from a single lamprey 13 anti-lysozyme VLRA clones with affinities ranging from low nanomolar to mid-picomolar. All of these VLRA clones were closely related in sequence, differing at only 15 variable codon positions along the 244-residue VLR diversity region, which augmented antigen-binding affinity up to 100-fold. Thus, VLRs can provide a protective humoral antipathogen shield. Furthermore, the broad range of nominal antigens that VLRs can specifically bind, and the affinities achieved, indicate a functional parallelism between LRR-based and Ig-based antibodies. VLRs may be useful natural single-chain alternatives to conventional antibodies for biotechnology applications.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPetromyzontiformes 3aadaptive immunity 3aantigens 3abeta-galactosidase 3abiotechnology 3acholera toxin 3aclones 3adissociation 3aeggs 3afish 3ahens 3aimmunoglobulin G 3alysozyme 3amonoclonal antibodies 3areceptors 3ayeasts1 aVelikovsky, C.

Using an alignment-free comparison method, we construct the whole-proteome phylogeny for a population of viruses from 11 viral families comprising 142 large dsDNA eukaryote viruses. The method is based on the feature frequency profiles (FFP), where the length of the feature (l-mer) is selected to be optimal for phylogenomic inference. We observe that (i) the FFP phylogeny segregates the population into clades, the membership of each has remarkable agreement with current classification by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses, with one exception that the mimivirus joins the phycodnavirus family; (ii) the FFP tree detects potential evolutionary relationships among some viral families; (iii) the relative position of the 3 herpesvirus subfamilies in the FFP tree differs from gene alignment-based analysis; (iv) the FFP tree suggests the taxonomic positions of certain "unclassified" viruses; and (v) the FFP method identifies candidates for horizontal gene transfer between virus families.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMimivirus 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3ataxonomy 3aviruses1 aJun, Se-Ran1 aSims, Gregory E.1 aKim, Sung-Hou0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Aug. 4, v. 106, no. 31 p.12826-12831dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09051151063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090808b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02996naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245011900201300002000320506007600340520138600416506003701802650000801839650001501847650001501862650002101877650003001898650002001928650001701948650001101965650002701976650001502003650001202018650003302030700001602063700002102079700002502100700002502125700002202150700001702172773017502189852000902364856008302373930003302456946001302489655001202502IND4424305620221207112619.0090807e20090804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442430562DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09022811062doi7 aPMC27001482pmcid7 a195498642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hailin10aDNA wrapping is required for DNA damage recognition in the Escherichia coli DNA nucleotide excision repair pathway  ap. 12849-12854.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLocalized DNA melting may provide a general strategy for recognition of the wide array of chemically and structurally diverse DNA lesions repaired by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. However, it is not clear what causes such DNA melting and how it is driven. Here, we show a DNA wrapping-melting model supported by results from dynamic monitoring of the key DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions involved in the early stages of the Escherichia coli NER process. Using an analytical technique involving capillary electrophoresis coupled with laser-induced fluorescence polarization, which combines a mobility shift assay with conformational analysis, we demonstrate that DNA wrapping around UvrB, mediated by UvrA, is an early event in the damage-recognition process during E. coli NER. DNA wrapping of UvrB was confirmed by Förster resonance energy transfer and fluorescence lifetime measurements. This wrapping did not occur with readily denaturable damaged DNA substrates ("bubble" DNA), suggesting that DNA wrapping of UvrB plays an important role in the induction of DNA melting around the damage site. Analysis of DNA wrapping of mutant UvrB Y96A further suggests that a cooperative interaction between DNA wrapping of UvrA₂B and contact of the β-hairpin of UvrB with the bulky damage moiety may be involved in the local DNA melting at the damage site.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aEscherichia coli 3acapillary electrophoresis 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3amodels 3amolecular conformation 3amonitoring 3amutants 3aprotein-protein interactions1 aLu, Meiling1 aTang, Moon-shong1 aHouten, Bennett van.1 aRoss, J.B.

All strains, regardless of their serotype or isolation origin could utilize hemin and hemoglobin as sole iron sources. Similarly, all of the isolates could bind hemin and Congo red, and this binding was mediated by cell envelope proteins. PCR and Southern hybridization were used to assay the occurrence of heme transport genes huvABCD, which have been previously described in serotype O1. Of 23 strains studied, two serotype O3 isolates proved negative for all huvABCD genes, whereas nine strains included in serotypes O2, O3, O4, O6, O7, and O10 tested negative for the outer membrane heme receptor gene huvA. A gene coding for a novel outer membrane heme receptor was cloned and characterized in a V. anguillarum serotype O3 strain lacking huvA. The new heme receptor, named HuvS, showed significant similarity to other outer membrane heme receptors described in Vibrionaceae, but little homology (39%) to HuvA. This heme receptor was present in 9 out of 11 of the V. anguillarum strains that tested negative for HuvA. Furthermore, complementation experiments demonstrated that HuvS could substitute for the HuvA function in Escherichia coli and V. anguillarum mutants. The huvS and huvA sequences alignment, as well as the analysis of their respective upstream and downstream DNA sequences, suggest that horizontal transfer and recombination might be responsible for generating this genetic diversity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aheme 3aserotypes 3acampylobacteriosis 3ahemoglobin 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3aVibrio anguillarum 3aouter membrane proteins 3aamino acid sequences 3agenes 3afish diseases 3areceptors 3abinding capacity 3apromoter regions 3aphysical chromosome mapping 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBiological Transport 2aCell Membranexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDNA Primers 2aFish Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aFishesxclassification 2aGenetic Variation 2aHemexmetabolism 2aHemoglobinsxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexanalysisxgenetics. 2aSeawaterxmicrobiology 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aVibrioxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 0ahemin 0ahuvS gene 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0ahuvA gene1 aRodríguez-Ares, Isabel1 aOsorio, Carlos R.1 aLemos, Manuel L.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2005 Dec., v. 71, no. 12 p.8434-8441dAmerican Society for Microbiology.x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.71.12.8434-8441.20053Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20060113b20060202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/01/13  aOther US 7aarticle03992naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175072000900193100002100202245005400223300001800277500002400295500001500319506007600334520168900410506003702099650001802136650001302154650001702167650001802184650002002202650001502222650003002237650001002267650002402277650002302301650002002324650008802344650001802432650001602450650002802466650004002494650001402534650003902548650002902587650003402616650003102650650003202681650002202713653001902735653002802754653002602782653001402808700001802822700002502840700001902865700002202884773013502906852000903041856009203050856006903142930003303211945002503244946001303269655001203282IND4376654320221207113631.0051211e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437665432DNAL7 a163328282pmid7 aPMC13174442pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.71.12.8402-8410.20052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ1001 aSangwan, Parveen10aDetection and Cultivation of Soil Verrucomicrobia  ap. 8402-8410.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOnly one isolate each of the class "Spartobacteria" (subdivision 2 of the phylum Verrucomicrobia) and of subdivision 3 of Verrucomicrobia have previously been reported to grow in laboratory culture. Using media that had been used successfully in other studies to isolate members of diverse groups of soil bacteria, we generated a collection of over 1,200 isolates from soil from a pasture. An oligonucleotide probe that targets the 16S rRNA genes of verrucomicrobia was used to screen this collection, and 14 new verrucomicrobia were identified. Nine of these belonged to the class "Spartobacteria" and were related to "Chthoniobacter flavus." Five further isolates were members of subdivision 3 and were related to the only known isolate of this subdivision. The differences in the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the new isolates and previously described isolates, of up to 10%, indicated that the new isolates represent new species and genera. All but two of the verrucomicrobial isolates were from colonies that first became visible one or more months after inoculation of plates with soil, but subcultures grew more rapidly. Analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes in the pasture soil showed that members of the class "Spartobacteria" were more numerous than members of subdivision 3. Isolates of subdivision 3 were only found on plates receiving an inoculum that yielded a mean of 29 colonies per plate, while members of the class "Spartobacteria" were only found on plates receiving a more dilute inoculum that resulted in a mean of five colonies per plate. This suggested that colony development by members of the class "Spartobacteria" was inhibited by other culturable bacteria.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asoil bacteria 3apastures 3acell culture 3aribosomal DNA 3aselective media 3aDNA probes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3agenes 3aVerrucomicrobiaceae 3apopulation density 3agrassland soils 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Hybridizationxmethods 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aRNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSoil Microbiology 0aSpartobacteria 0amolecular sequence data 0aChthoniobacter flavus 0aisolation1 aKovac, Suzana1 aDavis, Kathryn E.

An approach to self appraisal which blends the participative features of management by objectives (MBO) with the graphic precision of rating scales is described. The employee and his supervisor both make independent appraisals and then compare them during an interview. Differences of one point in ratings are recorded at the higher level.

Interviews were conducted with 173 production workers in three engine plants of leading U. S. automakers. More job dissatisfaction was expressed for the maintenance factors (good physical conditions, a safe and healthy place, and convenient working hours) than for motivation factors (variety, independence, and responsibility). Employees who are satisfied with their working conditions are generally more receptive to motivators which will help them reach their full potential. High level needs may be overemphasized by executives and behavioral scientists. 3amotivation 3aattitudes and opinions 3amales 3ajob satisfaction 3aadministrative management 0aworking conditions 0aEmployee responsibility 0aWork attitudes0 pPersonnel Jg1976 Oct., v. 55, no. 10 p.516-519x0031-57457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19770201c00000000  aFNC 7aarticle03885naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175072000900193100001800202245009000220300001800310500002400328500001500352506007600367520150600443506003701949650001801986650001002004650001602014650001902030650002502049650002502074650001002099650002502109650002102134650001702155650002002172650002702192650002402219650006102243650008402304650002302388650001602411650004002427650007402467650002802541650003302569650003002602650003702632653001402669653001802683653002802701700002002729700002002749700001902769700002302788773013502811852000902946856009202955856006903047930003303116945002503149946001303174655001203187IND4376645420221207112322.0051211e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437664542DNAL7 a163327392pmid7 aPMC13173862pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.71.12.7670-7678.20052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX3001 aYaoi, Katsuro10aCloning and Characterization of Two Xyloglucanases from Paenibacillus sp.

The genes encoding these XEGs were cloned and sequenced. Based on their amino acid sequences, the catalytic domains of XEG5 and XEG74 were classified in the glycoside hydrolase families 5 and 74, respectively. XEG5 is the first xyloglucanase belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 5. XEG5 lacks a carbohydrate-binding module, while XEG74 has an X2 module and a family 3 type carbohydrate-binding module at its C terminus. The two XEGs were expressed in Escherichia coli, and recombinant forms of the enzymes were purified and characterized. Both XEGs had endoglucanase active only toward xyloglucan and not toward Avicel, carboxymethylcellulose, barley {szligbeta}-1,3/1,4-glucan, or xylan. XEG5 is a typical endo-type enzyme that randomly cleaves the xyloglucan main chain, while XEG74 has dual endo- and exo-mode activities or processive endo-mode activity. XEG5 digested the xyloglucan oligosaccharide XXXGXXXG to produce XXXG, whereas XEG74 digestion of XXXGXXXG resulted in XXX, XXXG, and GXXXG, suggesting that this enzyme cleaves the glycosidic bond of unbranched Glc residues. Analyses using various oligosaccharide structures revealed that unique structures of xyloglucan oligosaccharides can be prepared with XEG74.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPaenibacillus 3axylan 3axyloglucans 3abeta-glucanase 3aamino acid sequences 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3amolecular weight 3abeta-glucans 3aenzyme activity 3acarboxymethylcellulose 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacillaceaexenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aBacteriaxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Primers 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptide Fragmentsxchemistry 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRecombinant Proteinsxmetabolism 0acellulose 0axyloglucanase 0amolecular sequence data1 aNakai, Tomonori1 aKameda, Yoshiro1 aHiyoshi, Ayako1 aMitsuishi, Yasushi0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2005 Dec., v. 71, no. 12 p.7670-7678dAmerican Society for Microbiology.x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.71.12.7670-7678.20053Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20060113b20060202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/01/12  aOther US 7aarticle01283naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100002000117245004400137300001600181520051300197650003000710650001800740650003100758653003500789653002800824653003500852773006800887852000900955939003300964945000800997655001201005991602393410742620221120213310.0780701e197804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894830232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, Corwin P.10aKeep your communication climate healthy  ap. 204-206.  aThree key components of communication climate within organizations are discussed.

The enzyme pheophorbidase (PPD) catalyzes the conversion of Pheid a to a precursor of pyropheophorbide (PyroPheid), C-13²-carboxylPyroPheid a, by demethylation, and then the precursor is decarboxylated nonenzymatically to yield PyroPheid a. PPD activity sharply increased with the progression of senescence in radish, suggesting de novo synthesis of PPD. The enzyme activity was separated into two peaks in anion-exchange and hydrophobic chromatography; the terms type 1 and type 2 were applied according to the order of elution of these enzymes in anion-exchange chromatography. PPD types 1 and 2 were purified 9,999- and 6,476-fold, with a yield of 0.703% and 2.73%, respectively. Among 12 substrates tested, both enzymes were extremely specific for Pheids of the dihydroporphyrin and tetrahydroporphyrin types, indicating that they are responsible for the formation of these PyroPheids. Both PPDs had molecular masses of 113,000 kD on gel filtration and showed three bands of 16.8, 15.9, and 11.8 kD by SDS-PAGE. The partial N-terminal amino acid sequences for these bands of PPD (type 2) were determined. Based on their N-terminal amino acid sequences, a full-length cDNA of PPD was cloned. The molecular structure of PPD, particularly the molecular mass and subunit structure, is discussed in relation to the results of SDS-PAGE.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRaphanus sativus 3aradishes 3avegetable crops 3acotyledons 3acomplementary DNA 3asequence analysis 3aenzyme activity 3asubstrate specificity 3abiochemical pathways 3achlorophyll 3aenzyme substrates 3aplant biochemistry 3aplant genetics 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aChlorophyllxanalogs & derivativesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCotyledonxenzymology 2aEsterasesxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aRaphanusxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSubstrate Specificity 0apheophorbidase 0amolecular sequence data1 aAmano, Toyoki1 aShioi, Yuzo0 tPlant physiology.g2006 Feb., v. 140, no. 2 p.716-725dAmerican Society of Plant Physiologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.105.0712903Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20060405b20060529c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/04/05  aOther US 7aarticle01786naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245009400169300001800263500002800281500001500309520074300324650002001067650002701087653001401114700001701128700001801145700001601163700001501179700001701194773012501211852000901336856009201345946001101437655001201448IND4412095220221120200837.0081031s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441209522DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1755-0998.2008.02213.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSANTOS, K.L.10aIsolation and characterization of microsatellite markers in Acca sellowiana (Berg) Burret  ap. 1417-1419.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019-12-05  aAcca sellowiana has commercial potential because of the quality and the unique flavor of its fruit.

Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) DWARF4 (DWF4) catalyzes a flux-determining step in the BR biosynthetic pathways. Thus, it is hypothesized that the tissues of DWF4 expression may represent the sites of BR biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. Here we show that DWF4 transcripts accumulate in the actively growing tissues, such as root, shoot apices with floral clusters, joint tissues of root and shoot, and dark-grown seedlings. Conforming to the RNA gel-blot analysis, DWF4:[beta]-glucuronidase (GUS) histochemical analyses more precisely define the tissues that express the DWF4 gene. Examination of the endogenous levels of BRs in six and seven different tissues of wild type and brassinosteroid insensitive1-5 mutant, respectively, revealed that BRs are significantly enriched in roots, shoot tips, and joint tissues of roots and shoots. In addition, DWF4:GUS expression was negatively regulated by BRs. DWF4:GUS activity was increased by treatment with brassinazole, a BR biosynthetic inhibitor, and decreased by exogenous application of bioactive BRs. When DWF4:GUS was expressed in a different genetic background, its level was down-regulated in brassinazole resistant1-D, confirming that BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1 acts as a negative regulator of DWF4. Interestingly, in the brassinosteroid insensitive2/dwf12-1D background, DWF4:GUS expression was intensified and delocalized to elongating zones of root, suggesting that BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE2 is an important factor that limits DWF4 expression. Thus, it is likely that the DWF4 promoter serves as a focal point in maintaining homeostasis of endogenous bioactive BR pools in specific tissues of Arabidopsis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amessenger RNA 3aplant genetics 3abrassinosteroids 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3atissue distribution 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3acytochrome P-450 3ahomeostasis 3anucleotide sequences 3aplant physiology 3agene expression regulation 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aplant proteins 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxanalysisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxanalysisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEndoplasmic Reticulumxmetabolism 2aFlowersxanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aHomeostasis 2aLight 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxbiosynthesis 2aPlant Rootsxanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aPlant Shootsxanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aProtoplastsxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Plantxmetabolism 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxmetabolism 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSeedlingsxanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aSteroid Hydroxylasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSteroidsxmetabolism 0aplant biochemistry 0asteroid 22-alpha-hydroxylase 0amolecular sequence data 0aDWF4 protein1 aKwon, Mi1 aRyu, Hojin1 aFujioka, Shozo1 aTakatsuto, Suguru1 aYoshida, Shigeo1 aAn, Chung Sun1 aLee, Ilha1 aHwang, Ildoo1 aChoe, Sunghwa0 tPlant physiology.g2006 Feb., v. 140, no. 2 p.548-557dAmerican Society of Plant Physiologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.105.0679183Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20060404b20060529c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/04/04  aOther US 7aarticle01908naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245010100190300001600291520068900307650001300996650001501009650001401024650000901038650002701047650001201074650001701086651001801103653001301121653002301134653001401157700002301171700001801194700001901212773012201231852000901353856009201362930003301454946001101487655001201498IND4419523120221120175755.0090424e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441952312DNAL7 a215647982pmid7 a10.1111/j.1755-0998.2008.02493.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCHONG, JER PIN10aIsolation and characterization of microsatellite loci in western North American Anodonta species  ap. 939-943.  aWe have developed and characterized 13 microsatellite loci from a group of Anodonta species in western North America, and demonstrated their utility in populations representing two major clades in this genus.

These markers provide the basis for future studies of the direct fitness consequences of sociality in O. degus. 3aOctodon degus 3aalleles 3aheterozygosity 3akinship 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparentage 3arodents 3asocial behavior 3aChile 0afitness 0aOctodon degus1 aMACMANES, M.D.1 aEBENSPERGER, L.A.1 aLACEY, E.A.1 aHAYES, L.D.0 tMolecular ecology resources.g2009 May, v. 9, no. 3 p.999-1001dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1755-09987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1755-0998.2009.02536.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090425b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01853naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245019700191300001600388520051600404650000800920650001400928650001200942650001600954650000900970650000900979650002700988653002501015653002701040700002101067700002301088700002401111700001801135700002201153773012301175852000901298856009201307930003301399946001101432655001201443IND4415391020221120154110.0090123e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441539102DNAL7 a215646062pmid7 a10.1111/j.1755-0998.2008.02380.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLERAY, MATTHIEU10aIsolation and characterization of 13 polymorphic nuclear microsatellite primers for the widespread Indo-Pacific three-spot damselfish, Dascyllus trimaculatus, and closely related D. auripinnis  ap. 213-215.  aA set of 13 simple sequence repeat markers was developed from D. trimaculatus genomic DNA, tested for D. auripinnis and characterized using 40 individuals per species.

A novel noninvasive DNA sampling tool for detecting its presence (WaxTags, or WT) was tested. DNA was recovered from saliva left on WT, and two lengths (407 bp and 648 bp) of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) barcoding region were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR products were considered (+) when a DNA band was clearly visible by electrophoresis. Different factors that might affect PCR (+) were investigated with captive possums: (i) both extraction protocols of the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit, (ii) effect of an overnight or longer delay of up to 3 weeks before DNA extraction on both COI amplicons, and (iii) effect of the individual, order and magnitude of the bite. Extraction protocols were not significantly different. The effect of the overnight delay was not significant, and amplification of the short amplicon was significantly higher (100%) than for the long fragment (48%). After a two or 3-week delay, the short amplicon had 94% and 56% PCR (+), success rates, respectively. Individual, order and magnitude of a bite had no significant effect. The delay trial was repeated with WT from the wild, for which PCR (+) rate of the short amplicon was 63%, regardless of freshness. Four microsatellites were amplified from captive WT samples. We conclude that DNA from saliva traces can be recovered from WT, a potential new tool for noninvasive monitoring of possums and other wildlife. 3aDNA 3aDNA barcoding 3aTrichosurus vulpecula 3ablood 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aelectrophoresis 3afreshness 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amonitoring 3apests 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apossums 3asaliva 3awildlife 3aNew Zealand 0aforensics 0apossum1 aCRUICKSHANK, R.H.1 aROSS, J.G.1 aHOLYOAKE, A.J.1 aOGILVIE, S.C.1 aPATERSON, A.M.0 tMolecular ecology resources.g2009 Mar., v. 9, no. 2 p.505-515dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1755-09987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1755-0998.2008.02498.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090213b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02421naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184072001700201100002000218245009000238300002000328500001500348506007600363520061300439506003701052650001601089650000901105650001301114650001001127650001201137650001101149650001301160650001301173650001301186650001201199650002401211650002101235650002201256651000901278653002801287653001501315653002001330653001801350653002001368653002701388653001401415700002501429700002601454773017601480852000901656856008301665930003301748945002501781946001301806655001201819IND4424564620221207100508.0090814e20090811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442456462DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09033221062doi7 aPMC27263742pmcid7 a196331842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

While cue-elicited craving and its underlying neurobiological mechanisms have been extensively studied with respect to alcohol and other drugs of abuse, the same cannot be said for marijuana. Cue-elicited craving for other drugs of abuse is associated with increased activity in a number of brain areas, particularly the reward pathway. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine cue-elicited craving for marijuana. Thirty-eight regular marijuana users abstained from use for 72 h and were presented with tactile marijuana-related and neutral cues while undergoing a fMRI scan. Several structures in the reward pathway, including the ventral tegmental area, thalamus, anterior cingulate, insula, and amygdala, demonstrated greater blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activation in response to the marijuana cue as compared with the neutral cue. These regions underlie motivated behavior and the attribution of incentive salience. Activation of the orbitofrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens was also positively correlated with problems related to marijuana use, such that greater BOLD activation was associated with greater number of items on a marijuana problem scale. Thus, cue-elicited craving for marijuana activates the reward neurocircuitry associated with the neuropathology of addiction, and the magnitude of activation of these structures is associated with severity of cannabis-related problems. These findings may inform the development of treatment strategies for cannabis dependence.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCannabis sativa 3aalcohols 3aamygdala 3ablood 3acortex 3acraving 3adrug abuse 3aillicit drugs 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3aneuropathology 3aoxygen 3athalamus1 aSchacht, Joseph P.1 aMyers, Ursula S.1 aChavez, Robert S.1 aHutchison, Kent E.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Aug. 4, v. 106, no. 31 p.13016-13021dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09038631063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090808b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02782naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245006900202300002000271506007600291520116900367506003701536650002801573650002201601650001801623650001001641650001901651650002401670650001001694650001101704650000901715650000901724650001201733650001601745650002101761650001701782650001301799650002301812700001901835700002301854700002001877700001801897700002401915773017501939852000902114856008302123930003302206946001302239655001202252IND4424309020221207100516.0090807e20090804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442430902DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09062771062doi7 aPMC27223532pmcid7 a196286982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJunn, Eunsung10aRepression of α-synuclein expression and toxicity by microRNA-7  ap. 13052-13057.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aα-Synuclein is a key protein in Parkinson's disease (PD) because it accumulates as fibrillar aggregates in pathologic hallmark features in affected brain regions, most notably in nigral dopaminergic neurons. Intraneuronal levels of this protein appear critical in mediating its toxicity, because multiplication of its gene locus leads to autosomal dominant PD, and transgenic animal models overexpressing human α-synuclein manifest impaired function or decreased survival of dopaminergic neurons. Here, we show that microRNA-7 (miR-7), which is expressed mainly in neurons, represses α-synuclein protein levels through the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of α-synuclein mRNA. Importantly, miR-7-induced down-regulation of α-synuclein protects cells against oxidative stress. Further, in the MPTP-induced neurotoxin model of PD in cultured cells and in mice, miR-7 expression decreases, possibly contributing to increased α-synuclein expression. These findings provide a mechanism by which α-synuclein levels are regulated in neurons, have implications for the pathogenesis of PD, and suggest miR-7 as a therapeutic target for PD and other α-synucleinopathies.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a3' untranslated regions 3aParkinson disease 3aanimal models 3abrain 3acultured cells 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahumans 3aloci 3amice 3aneurons 3aneurotoxins 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3atoxicity 3atransgenic animals1 aLee, Kang Woo.1 aJeong, Byeong Seon1 aChan, Teresa W.1 aIm, Joo-Young1 aMouradian, M.

The IAC is a chimeric double-stranded DNA containing a fragment of the rapeseed BnACCg8 gene flanked by the hly-specific target sequences. This IAC is detected using a second TaqMan probe labeled with a different fluorophore, enabling the simultaneous monitoring of the hly and IAC signals. The hly-IAC assay had a specificity and sensitivity of 100%, as assessed using 49 L. monocytogenes isolates of different serotypes and 96 strains of nontarget bacteria, including 51 Listeria isolates. The detection and quantification limits were 8 and 30 genome equivalents, and the coefficients for PCR linearity (R²) and efficiency (E) were 0.997 and 0.80, respectively. We tested the performance of the hly-IAC Q-PCR assay using various broth media and food matrices. Fraser and half-Fraser media, raw pork, and raw or cold-smoked salmon were strongly PCR-inhibitory. This Q-PCR assay for L. monocytogenes, the first incorporating an IAC to be described for quantitative detection of a food-borne pathogen, is a simple and robust tool facilitating the identification of false negatives or underestimations of contamination loads due to PCR failure.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3apork 3abacterial contamination 3afood contamination 3apolymerase chain reaction 3afood pathogens 3agenes 3amicrobial detection 3asalmon 3aListeria monocytogenes 3araw meat 3asmoked fish 3araw fish 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Toxinsxgenetics 2aDNA Primers 2aFood Microbiology 2aGene Amplification 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxgenetics 2aHemolysin Proteins 2aListeria monocytogenesxgenetics 2aMeat Productsxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSwine 0ainternal amplification control 0aquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 0afood microbiology 0ahly gene1 aPla, Maria1 aScortti, Mariela1 aMonzó, Héctor J.1 aVázquez-Boland, José A.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2005 Dec., v. 71, no. 12 p.9008-9012dAmerican Society for Microbiology.x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.71.12.9008-9012.20053Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20060117b20060202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/01/17  aOther US 7aarticle03598naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245013500204300002000339506007600359520178900435506003702224650001502261650002002276650003602296650001102332650002102343650002602364650001602390650000902406650001702415650002802432650000902460650002202469650002702491650001402518650002002532650002402552650002002576650003102596700002202627700002002649700002102669700002002690700002102710773017502731852000902906856008302915930003302998946001303031655001203044IND4424309420221207112733.0090807e20090804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442430942DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09035241062doi7 aPMC27223382pmcid7 a196207232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaeda, Takehiko10aLeptin derived from adipocytes in injured peripheral nerves facilitates development of neuropathic pain via macrophage stimulation  ap. 13076-13081.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNerve injury may result in neuropathic pain, characterized by allodynia and hyperalgesia. Accumulating evidence suggests the existence of a molecular substrate for neuropathic pain produced by neurons, glia, and immune cells. Here, we show that leptin, an adipokine exclusively produced by adipocytes, is critical for the development of tactile allodynia through macrophage activation in mice with partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSL). PSL increased leptin expression in adipocytes distributed at the epineurium of the injured sciatic nerve (SCN). Leptin-deficient animals, ob/ob mice, showed an absence of PSL-induced tactile allodynia, which was reversed by the administration of leptin to the injured SCN. Perineural injection of a neutralizing antibody against leptin reproduced this attenuation. Macrophages recruited to the perineurium of the SCN expressed the leptin receptor and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3), a transcription factor downstream of leptin. PSL also up-regulated the accepted mediators of neuropathic pain--namely, cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and matrix metalloprotease-9--in the injured SCN, with transcriptional activation of their gene promoters by pSTAT3. This up-regulation was partly reproduced in a macrophage cell line treated with leptin. Administration of peritoneal macrophages treated with leptin to the injured SCN reversed the failure of ob/ob mice to develop PSL-induced tactile allodynia. We suggest that leptin induces recruited macrophages to produce pronociceptive mediators for the development of tactile allodynia. This report shows that adipocytes associated with primary afferent neurons may be involved in the development of neuropathic pain through adipokine secretion.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadipocytes 3agene activation 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3aleptin 3aleptin receptors 3amacrophage activation 3amacrophages 3amice 3anerve tissue 3aneutralizing antibodies 3apain 3aperipheral nerves 3aprostaglandin synthase 3asecretion 3asensory neurons 3asignal transduction 3atransactivators 3atranscriptional activation1 aKiguchi, Norikazu1 aKobayashi, Yuka1 aIkuta, Toshihiko1 aOzaki, Masanobu1 aKishioka, Shiroh0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Aug. 4, v. 106, no. 31 p.13076-13081dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09035241063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090808b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03853naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175072000900193072000900202100001900211245008900230300001800319500002400337500001500361506007600376520142000452506003701872650002401909650002601933650002501959650002501984650002002009650001202029650001802041650002002059650002802079650001202107650002702119650006202146650002402208650002802232650001802260650001602278650002802294650003302322650004902355650002302404650003402427650002202461650001302483653001802496653003302514653001102547653002802558653001002586653002502596700001702621700001902638700002102657700002002678700002102698773013502719852000902854856009202863856006902955930003303024945002503057946001303082655001203095IND4376660020221207100514.0051211e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437666002DNAL7 a163328852pmid7 aPMC13173822pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.71.12.8881-8887.20052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF6001 aLee, Meng-Hwan10aStructural Characterization of Glucooligosaccharide Oxidase from Acremonium strictum  ap. 8881-8887.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGlucooligosaccharide oxidase from Acremonium strictum was screened for potential applications in oligosaccharide acid production and carbohydrate detection. This protein is a unique covalent flavoenzyme which catalyzes the oxidation of a variety of carbohydrates with high selectivity for cello- and maltooligosaccharides. Kinetic measurements suggested that this enzyme possesses an open carbohydrate-binding groove, which is mainly composed of two glucosyl-binding subsites. The encoding gene was subsequently cloned, and one intron was detected in the genomic DNA. Large amounts of active enzymes were expressed in Pichia pastoris, with a yield of 300 mg per liter medium. The protein was predicted to share structural homology with plant cytokinin dehydrogenase and related flavoproteins that share a conserved flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding domain. The closest sequence matches are those of plant berberine bridge enzyme-like proteins, particularly the characteristic flavinylation site. Unexpectedly, mutation of the putative FAD-attaching residue, H70, to alanine, serine, cysteine, and tyrosine did not abolish the covalent FAD linkage and had little effect on the K[subscript m]. Instead, the variants displayed k[subscript cat] values that were 50- to 600-fold lower, indicating that H70 is crucial for efficient redox catalysis, perhaps through modulation of the oxidative power of the flavin.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcremonium strictum 3asubstrate specificity 3anucleotide coenzymes 3aamino acid sequences 3aenzyme kinetics 3amutants 3abinding sites 3aenzyme activity 3aalcohol oxidoreductases 3aintrons 2aAcremoniumxenzymology 2aAlcohol Oxidoreductasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmino Acid Substitution 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptide Fragmentsxchemistry 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSpectrophotometry 2aTATA Box 0aflavinylation 0aglucooligosaccharide oxidase 0aflavin 0amolecular sequence data 0agenes 0anucleotide sequences1 aLai, Wen-Lin1 aLin, Shuen-Fuh1 aHsu, Cheng-Sheng1 aLiaw, Shwu-Huey1 aTsai, Ying-Chieh0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2005 Dec., v. 71, no. 12 p.8881-8887dAmerican Society for Microbiology.x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.71.12.8881-8887.20053Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20060117b20060202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/01/17  aOther US 7aarticle01848naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245009500144300001600239500025200255520031200507650001600819650001700835650001700852650001400869650002100883650002600904650002300930650002200953650003100975650003801006650000901044650001601053650001101069650002601080650003501106653002301141653001501164700002001179700001901199773009401218852000901312930003301321945001301354946001101367655001201378IND2060416220221120115236.0971104e199707  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206041622DNAL7 a92641212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrayn, K.N.10aRegulation of the plasma non-esterified fatty acid concentration in the postprandial state  ap. 713-721.  aPaper presented at the symposium on "Postprandial lipid metabolism", a joint meeting of the Royal Society of Medicine Forum on Lipids in Clinical Medicine, the Nutrition Society and the Biochemical Society Lipid Group, London, October 15-16, 1996.  aThis paper discusses how plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentration is regulated in the postprandial period compared with the post-absorptive state.

Supercoiling is catalyzed via a strand-passage mechanism, in which the gate DNA (gDNA) is transiently cleaved, and a second DNA segment, the transfer DNA (tDNA), is passed through the gap before the gDNA is religated. Strand passage requires an opening of the so-called DNA-gate by [almost equal to]2 nm. A single-molecule FRET study reported equal populations of open and closed DNA-gate in topoisomerase II. We present here single-molecule FRET experiments that monitor the conformation of DNA bound to the DNA-gate of Bacillus subtilis gyrase and the conformation of the DNA-gate itself. DNA bound to gyrase adopts two different conformations, one slightly, one severely distorted. DNA distortion requires cleavage, but neither ATP nor the presence of a tDNA. At the same time, the DNA-gate of gyrase is predominantly in the closed conformation. In agreement with the single molecule data and with the danger of dsDNA breaks for genome integrity, <5% of cleavage complexes are detected in equilibrium. Quinolone inhibitors favor DNA cleavage by B. subtilis gyrase, but disfavor DNA distortion, and the DNA-gate remains in the closed conformation. Our results demonstrate that DNA binding, distortion and cleavage, and gate-opening are mechanistically distinct events. During the relaxation and supercoiling reactions, gyrase with an open DNA-gate is not significantly populated, consistent with gate-opening as a very rare event that only occurs briefly to allow for strand passage.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus subtilis 3aDNA conformation 3aDNA damage 3aDNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing) 3aadenosine triphosphate 3agenome 3aquinolones 3atransfer DNA1 aHilbert, Manuel1 aKlostermeier, Dagmar0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Aug. 11, v. 106, no. 32 p.13278-13283dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09024931063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090814b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03474naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152100001900161245009600180300001800276500002400294500001500318520208300333650001202416650002202428650001002450650001102460650001302471650002302484650002602507650002802533650001102561650002102572650001502593653002202608700001302630700001602643700002702659700001502686700001502701773010602716852000902822856009202831930003302923945002502956946001102981655001202992IND4376721120221120030723.0051216e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437672112DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01051.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF3001 aTurnbull, L.A.10aExperimental invasion by legumes reveals non-random assembly rules in grassland communities  ap. 1062-1070.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  a1. Although experimental studies usually reveal that resistance to invasion increases with species diversity, observational studies sometimes show the opposite trend. The higher resistance of diverse plots to invasion may be partly due to the increased probability of a plot containing a species with similar resource requirements to the invader. 2. We conducted a study of the invasibility of monocultures belonging to three different functional groups by seven sown species of legume. By only using experimentally established monocultures, rather than manipulating the abundance of particular functional groups, we removed both species diversity and differences in underlying abiotic conditions as potentially confounding variables. 3. We found that legume monocultures were more resistant than monocultures of grasses or non-leguminous forbs to invasion by sown legumes but not to invasion by other unsown species. The functional group effect remained after controlling for differences in total biomass and the average height of the above-ground biomass. 4. The relative success of legume species and types also varied with monoculture characteristics. The proportional biomass of climbing legumes increased strongly with biomass height in non-leguminous forb monocultures, while it declined with biomass height in grass monocultures. Trifolium pratense was the most successful invader in grass monocultures, while Vicia cracca was the most successful in non-leguminous forb monocultures. 5. Our results suggest that non-random assembly rules operate in grassland communities both between and within functional groups. Legume invaders found it much more difficult to invade legume plots, while grass and non-leguminous forb plots favoured non-climbing and climbing legumes, respectively. If plots mimic monospecific patches, the effect of these assembly rules in diverse communities might depend upon the patch structure of diverse communities. This dependency on patch structure may contribute to differences in results of research from experimental vs. natural communities. 3agrasses 3aplant communities 3aforbs 3aniches 3aFabaceae 3aintroduced species 3abotanical composition 3adry matter accumulation 3aheight 3ainvasive species 3agrasslands 0aspecies diversity1 aRahm, S.1 aBaudois, O.1 aEichenberger-Glinz, S.1 aWacker, L.1 aSchmid, B.0 tjournal of ecology.g2005 Dec., v. 93, no. 6 p.1062-1070dCambridge University Pressx0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01051.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110423b20110507c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/01/07  aNon-US 7aarticle04410naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175072000900193072000900202100002300211245026300234300001800497500002400515500001500539506007600554520171900630506003702349650002802386650001102414650001602425650002302441650001402464650002202478650002802500650001902528650002202547650002202569650002202591650002702613650001002640650001502650650001202665650002502677650003302702650002002735650002402755650002202779650001102801650003602812650006902848650002802917650001402945650003002959650004602989651001103035651001803046653002503064653001403089653002803103653001803131653001403149700001603163700001803179700001403197700001703211773013503228852000903363856009203372856006903464930003303533945002503566946001303591655001203604IND4376658720221207100554.0051211e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437665872DNAL7 a163328722pmid7 aPMC13173122pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.71.12.8764-8772.20052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ200 0aX3801 aNightingale, K.

Screening of L. monocytogenes strains isolated from human clinical cases (n = 46), foods (n = 118), and healthy animals (n = 58) in the United States revealed mutations in inlA leading to premature stop codons (PMSCs) in L. monocytogenes ribotypes DUP-1052A and DUP-16635A (PMSC mutation type 1), DUP-1025A and DUP-1031A (PMSC mutation type 2), and DUP-1046B and DUP-1062A (PMSC mutation type 3). While all DUP-1046B, DUP-1062A, DUP-16635A, and DUP-1031A isolates (n = 76) contained inlA PMSCs, ribotypes DUP-1052A and DUP-1025A (n = 72) contained isolates with and without inlA PMSCs. Western immunoblotting showed that all three inlA PMSCs result in the production of truncated and secreted InlA. Searches of the Pathogen Tracker database, which contains subtype and source information for more than 5,000 L. monocytogenes isolates, revealed that the six ribotypes shown to contain isolates with inlA PMSCs were overall more commonly isolated from foods than from human listeriosis cases. L. monocytogenes strains carrying inlA PMSCs also showed significantly (P = 0.0004) reduced invasion of Caco-2 cells compared to isolates with homologous 3' inlA sequences without PMSCs. Invasion assays with an isogenic PMSC mutant further supported the observation that inlA PMSCs lead to reduced invasion of Caco-2 cells. Our data show that specific L. monocytogenes subtypes which are common among U.S. food isolates but rare among human listeriosis isolates carry inlA mutations that are associated with, and possibly at least partially responsible for, an attenuated invasion phenotype.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacterial contamination 3ahumans 3alisteriosis 3afood contamination 3aribotypes 3anonsense mutation 3aouter membrane proteins 3afood pathogens 3afoodborne illness 3acytopathogenicity 3aintestinal mucosa 3aListeria monocytogenes 3agenes 3acell lines 3astrains 3anucleotide sequences 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aCodon, Nonsense 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFood Microbiology 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Mucosaxmicrobiology 2aListeria monocytogenesxclassificationxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 0aFrance 0aUnited States 0afoodborne infections 0ainlA gene 0amolecular sequence data 0acell invasion 0aisolation1 aWindham, K.1 aMartin, K.

The extent of genomic DNA methylation and its role in A. mellifera remain unknown, however. Here we show that genes in A. mellifera can be divided into 2 distinct classes, one with low-CpG dinucleotide content and the other with high-CpG dinucleotide content. This dichotomy is explained by the gradual depletion of CpG dinucleotides, a well-known consequence of DNA methylation. The loss of CpG dinucleotides associated with DNA methylation also may explain the unusual mutational patterns seen in A. mellifera that lead to AT-rich regions of the genome. A detailed investigation of this dichotomy implicates DNA methylation in A. mellifera development. High-CpG genes, which are predicted to be hypomethylated in germlines, are enriched with functions associated with developmental processes, whereas low-CpG genes, predicted to be hypermethylated in germlines, are enriched with functions associated with basic biological processes. Furthermore, genes more highly expressed in one caste than another are overrepresented among high-CpG genes. Our results highlight the potential significance of epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, in developmental processes in social insects. In particular, the pervasiveness of DNA methylation in the genome of A. mellifera provides fertile ground for future studies of phenotypic plasticity and genomic imprinting.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ainterspecific variation 3aApis mellifera 3aDNA methylation 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aworker honey bees 3agenes 3aAnopheles gambiae 3apromoter regions 3aqueen honey bees 0aspecies differences 0adifferential gene expression 0agenome 0ahoney bees 0anucleotide sequences 0aDNA hypermethylation 0aCpG dinucleotides1 aHunt, Brendan G.1 aGoodisman, Michael A.D.1 aYi, Soojin V.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 July 7, v. 106, no. 27 p.11206-11211dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09003011063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090728b20090801c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/07/28  aOther US 7aarticle03120naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245011700207300002000324506007600344520154400420506003701964650001202001650002502013650001602038650001602054650002002070650001002090650001802100650004002118650001802158650000902176700001702185700002802202700002402230700002902254700002102283700003302304773017502337852000902512856008302521930003302604946001302637655001202650IND4423025720221207112615.0090710e20090707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442302572DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09047801062doi7 aPMC27001542pmcid7 a195498592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamanaka, Masahito10aAmino acid polymorphisms altering the glycosylation of IL-2 do not protect from type 1 diabetes in the NOD mouse  ap. 11236-11240.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIdd3 is one of many gene regions that affect the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse. Idd3 has been localized to a 650-kb region on chromosome 3 containing the IL-2 gene. Exon 1 of the IL-2 gene is polymorphic between the susceptible NOD and the protective C57BL/6 (B6) alleles, causing multiple amino acid changes that have been proposed to be responsible for the differing glycosylation status. To address whether this coding polymorphism recapitulates the disease suppression mediated by the B6 Idd3 allele, we generated knockin mice in which exon 1 of the B6 IL-2 allele replaces the homologous region in the NOD allele. We generated these mice by targeting the NOD allele of NOD/129 F₁ ES cells. IL-2 protein from the knockin mice showed the glycosylation pattern of the B6 IL-2 isoform, confirming that the amino acid differences encoded within exon 1 affect the glycosylation of the IL-2 protein. However, unlike NOD.B6 Idd3 congenic mice, the knockin mice were not protected from T1D. Furthermore, the difference in amino acid sequence in the IL-2 protein did not affect the level of expression of IL-2. This approach provides a general method for the determination of a functional role of a given genomic sequence in a disease process. Further, our result demonstrates that the variants in exon 1 of the IL-2 gene are not responsible for T1D suppression in NOD.B6 Idd3 mice, thereby supporting the hypothesis that variants in the regulatory region affecting expression levels are causative.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3achromosomes 3adisease control 3aexons 3aglycosylation 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3ainterleukin-2 3amice1 aRainbow, Dan1 aSchuster-Gossler, Karin1 aEynon, Elizabeth E.1 aChervonsky, Alexander V.1 aWicker, Linda S.1 aFlavell, R.

The histone deacetylase Sir2 silences genomic regions that include telomeres, ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and the cryptic mating-type loci. Here, we report an unsuspected role for the enzyme Gas1 in locus-specific transcriptional silencing. GAS1 encodes a β-1,3-glucanosyltransferase previously characterized for its role in cell wall biogenesis. In gas1 mutants, telomeric silencing is defective and rDNA silencing is enhanced. We show that the catalytic activity of Gas1 is required for normal silencing, and that Gas1's role in silencing is distinct from its role in cell wall biogenesis. Established hallmarks of silent chromatin, such as Sir2 and Sir3 binding, H4K16 deacetylation, and H3K56 deacetylation, appear unaffected in gas1 mutants. Thus, another event required for telomeric silencing must be influenced by GAS1. Because the catalytic activity of Gas1 is required for telomeric silencing, Gas1 localizes to the nuclear periphery, and Gas1 and Sir2 physically interact, we propose a model in which carbohydrate modification of chromatin components provides a new regulatory element that may be critical for chromatin function but which is virtually unexplored in the current landscape of chromatin analysis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiogenesis 3acatalytic activity 3acell walls 3achromatin 3ahistone deacetylase 3aloci 3amodels 3amutants 3aribosomal DNA 3atelomeres 3atranscription (genetics)1 aPillus, Lorraine0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 July 7, v. 106, no. 27 p.11224-11229dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09008091063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090710b20090801c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02390naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002600184245008000210300002000290506007600310520083800386506003701224650001401261650002401275650001001299650001901309650001101328650002901339650001201368650001301380700002801393700001601421700002301437700002501460700001801485700002101503700002201524700002401546700002501570773017501595852000901770856008301779930003301862946001301895655001201908IND4423023120221207112615.0090710e20090707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442302312DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09047161062doi7 aPMC27087362pmcid7 a195416192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCherrier, Mickaël V.13aAn icosahedral algal virus has a complex unique vertex decorated by a spike  ap. 11085-11089.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aParamecium bursaria Chlorella virus-1 is an icosahedrally shaped, 1,900-Å-diameter virus that infects unicellular eukaryotic green algae. A 5-fold symmetric, 3D reconstruction using cryoelectron microscopy images has now shown that the quasiicosahedral virus has a unique vertex, with a pocket on the inside and a spike structure on the outside of the capsid. The pocket might contain enzymes for use in the initial stages of infection. The unique vertex consists of virally coded proteins, some of which have been identified. Comparison of shape, size, and location of the spike with similar features in bacteriophages T4 and P22 suggests that the spike might be a cell-puncturing device.

It has been shown that DHA deficiency impairs cognitive performance whereas DHA supplementation improves the condition. However, the mechanisms underlying the role of DHA in brain development and function remain to be elucidated. By using transgenic fat-1 mice rich in endogenous n-3 PUFA, we show that increased brain DHA significantly enhances hippocampal neurogenesis shown by an increased number of proliferating neurons and neuritogenesis, evidenced by increased density of dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. Concurrently, fat-1 mice exhibit a better spatial learning performance in the Morris water maze compared with control WT littermates. In vitro experiments further demonstrate that DHA promotes differentiation and neurite outgrowth of neuronal cells derived from mouse ES cells and increases the proliferation of cells undergoing differentiation into neuronal lineages from the ES cells. These results together provide direct evidence for a promoting effect of DHA on neurogenesis and neuritogenesis and suggest that this effect may be a mechanism underlying its beneficial effect on behavioral performance.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acognition 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahippocampus 3ain vitro studies 3alearning 3along chain polyunsaturated fatty acids 3amice 3aneurites 3aneurogenesis 3aomega-3 fatty acids1 aQu, Xiying1 aCui, Libin1 aWang, Jingdong1 aKang, Jing X.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 July 7, v. 106, no. 27 p.11370-11375dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09048351063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090710b20090801c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03120naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001300184245012100197300002000318506007600338520155000414506003701964650001802001650000802019650002002027650002502047650002802072650001402100650001602114650001002130650001602140650001702156650002902173650003102202700001602233700002102249700001802270700001902288700001802307773017502325852000902500856008302509930003302592946001302625655001202638IND4423026120221207101701.0090710e20090707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442302612DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08094851062doi7 aPMC27086962pmcid7 a195498202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Hua10aOpposing effects of SWI/SNF and Mi-2/NuRD chromatin remodeling complexes on epigenetic reprogramming by EBF and Pax5  ap. 11258-11263.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTranscriptionally silent genes are maintained in inaccessible chromatin. Accessibility of these genes requires their modification by chromatin remodeling complexes (CRCs), which are recruited to promoters by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. Early B-cell factor (EBF), which is crucial for B-cell lineage specification, reprograms mb-1 (Ig-α) promoters by increasing chromatin accessibility and initiating the loss of DNA methylation. In turn, this facilitates promoter activation by Pax5. Here, we investigated the roles of ATP-dependent CRCs in these mechanisms. Fusion of EBF and Pax5 with the ligand-binding domain of ERα allowed for 4-hydroxytamoxifen-dependent, synergistic activation of mb-1 transcription in plasmacytoma cells. Knock-down of the SWI/SNF ATPases Brg1 and Brm inhibited transcriptional activation by EBF:ER and Pax5:ER. In contrast, knock-down of the Mi-2/NuRD complex subunit Mi-2β greatly enhanced chromatin accessibility and mb-1 transcription in response to the activators. The reduction of Mi-2β also propagated DNA demethylation in response to EBF:ER and Pax5:ER, resulting in fully unmethylated mb-1 promoters. In EBF- or EBF/Pax5-deficient fetal liver cells, both EBF and Pax5 were required for efficient demethylation of mb-1 promoters. Together, our data suggest that Mi-2/NuRD is important for the maintenance of hypermethylated chromatin in B cells. We conclude that SWI/SNF and Mi-2/NuRD function in opposition to enable or limit the reprogramming of genes by EBF and Pax5 during B-cell development.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-lymphocytes 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3achromatin 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3ahepatocytes 3aplasmacytoma 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptional activation1 aLukin, Kara1 aRamírez, Julita1 aFields, Scott1 aLopez, Desiree1 aHagman, James0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 July 7, v. 106, no. 27 p.11258-11263dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08094851063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090710b20090801c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02893naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245009000205300002000295506007600315520117600391506003701567650001401604650002901618650001301647650001901660650001701679650002101696650002001717650002301737650002101760650002001781700001701801700001801818700001701836700001901853700002401872700001801896700001601914700001901930700002101949700001801970700002301988700002702011773017502038852000902213856008302222930003302305946001302338655001202351IND4423026720221207101705.0090710e20090707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442302672DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09038541062doi7 aPMC27086812pmcid7 a195498442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaito, Masumichi10aBCL6 suppression of BCL2 via Miz1 and its disruption in diffuse large B cell lymphoma  ap. 11294-11299.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe BCL6 proto-oncogene encodes a transcriptional repressor that is required for germinal center (GC) formation and whose deregulation by genomic lesions is implicated in the pathogenesis of GC-derived diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and, less frequently, follicular lymphoma (FL). The biological function of BCL6 is only partially understood because no more than a few genes have been functionally characterized as direct targets of BCL6 transrepression activity. Here we report that the anti-apoptotic proto-oncogene BCL2 is a direct target of BCL6 in GC B cells. BCL6 binds to the BCL2 promoter region by interacting with the transcriptional activator Miz1 and suppresses Miz1-induced activation of BCL2 expression. BCL6-mediated suppression of BCL2 is lost in FL and DLBCL, where the 2 proteins are pathologically coexpressed, because of BCL2 chromosomal translocations and other mechanisms, including Miz1 deregulation and somatic mutations in the BCL2 promoter region. These results identify an important function for BCL6 in facilitating apoptosis of GC B cells via suppression of BCL2, and suggest that blocking this pathway is critical for lymphomagenesis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3achromosome translocation 3alymphoma 3aneoplasm cells 3apathogenesis 3apromoter regions 3aproto-oncogenes 3arepressor proteins 3asomatic mutation 3atransactivators1 aNovak, Urban1 aPiovan, Erich1 aBasso, Katia1 aSumazin, Pavel1 aSchneider, Christof1 aCrespo, Marta1 aShen, Qiong1 aBhagat, Govind1 aCalifano, Andrea1 aChadburn, Amy1 aPasqualucci, Laura1 aDalla-Favera, Riccardo0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 July 7, v. 106, no. 27 p.11294-11299dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09038541063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090710b20090801c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03753naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100002100190245012500211300001400336500002400350500001500374520178000389650002002169650002402189650001702213650001902230650001502249650002102264650002002285650001702305650001302322650002502335650002902360650001802389650001202407650001602419650001202435650002702447650001402474650002502488650002702513650002302540650002402563650001602587650002502603650002902628650003002657651001802687653001502705773010702720852000902827856007502836856011102911930003303022945002503055946001103080655001203091IND4377904820221123013358.0060215e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437790482DNAL7 a162177312pmid7 a10.1002/ps.11262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aH000 0aW000 0aP200 0aX1001 aPeterson, R.K.D.10aComparing ecological risks of pesticides: the utility of a Risk Quotient ranking approach across refinements of exposure  ap. 46-56.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEnvironmental risk assessment of pesticides and other chemicals often uses the Risk Quotient (RQ) method to characterize risk quantitatively. An RQ is calculated by dividing an environmental exposure value by a toxicity end-point value. Tier 1 RQs, which are characterized by highly conservative toxicity and exposure assumptions, are used primarily for screening out negligible risks in regulatory decision making. It has been argued that the tier 1 RQ approach is valuable for making direct comparisons of quantitative risk between pesticides. However, an outstanding question is whether relative risks among pesticides would change if refinements of exposure are incorporated into the RQ calculations. This study tested that hypothesis. Aquatic ecological risk assessments were conducted for 12 herbicide and 12 insecticide active ingredients used on agricultural crops in the USA. The pesticides were chosen because surface-water monitoring data for them were available as part of the United States Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment Program (NAWQA). Ecological receptors and effects evaluated were aquatic non-vascular plants (acute risk), aquatic vertebrates (acute risk) and aquatic invertebrates (acute risk) for the herbicides and aquatic vertebrates (acute and chronic risk) and aquatic invertebrates (acute and chronic risk) for the insecticides. The data indicate that there were significant statistical correlations between numerical rankings of tier 1 RQs and RQs using refined environmental exposures. The results support the hypothesis that numerical ranking of RQs for the purpose of comparing potential ecological risks is a valid approach because the rankings are significantly correlated regardless of the degree of exposure refinement. 3awater pollution 3amathematical models 3aweed control 3asoil pollution 3aherbicides 3atoxic substances 3arisk assessment 3apest control 3atoxicity 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental assessment 3aair pollution 2aAnimals 2aChlorophyta 2aDaphnia 2aEnvironmental Exposure 2aGeography 2aHerbicidesxtoxicity 2aInsecticidesxtoxicity 2aMonte Carlo Method 2aOncorhynchus mykiss 2aPerciformes 2aPesticidesxtoxicity 2aRisk Assessmentxmethods 2aStatistics, Nonparametric 3aUnited States 0apesticides0 tPest management science.g2006 Jan., v. 62, no. 1 p.46-56dPublished for SCI by Wileyx1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.11263Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1526-4998/issues3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/03/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03322naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161072000900179100001600188245010600204300001600310500002400326500001500350506007600365520162500441506003702066650001002103650001502113650002102128650001702149650001902166650003702185650001702222650002002239650002502259650003702284650003102321650001402352650002102366650002602387650002202413653001502435653002402450773009702474852000902571856007802580856005302658930003302711945002502744946001102769655001202780IND4377834520221207112625.0060212e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437783452DNAL7 a163908462pmid7 aPMC28036502pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcj0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aNobel, P.S.10aParenchyma-chlorenchyma water movement during drought for the hemiepiphytic cactus Hylocereus undatus  ap. 469-474.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hylocereus undatus, a hemiepiphytic cactus cultivated in 20 countries for its fruit, has fleshy stems whose water storage is crucial for surviving drought. Inter-tissue water transfer during drought was therefore analysed based on cell volumes and water potential components. METHODS: In addition to determining cell dimensions, osmotic pressures and water potentials, a novel but simple procedure leading to an external water potential of zero was devised by which cells in thin sections were perfused with distilled water. The resulting volume changes indicated that the parenchyma-chlorenchyma water movement was related to more flexible cell walls in the water-storage parenchyma with its lower internal turgor pressure (P) than in the chlorenchyma. KEY RESULTS: Under wet conditions, P was 0·45 MPa in the chlorenchyma but only 0·10 MPa in the water-storage parenchyma. During 6 weeks of drought, the stems lost one-third of their water content, becoming flaccid. About 95 % of the water lost came from cells in the water-storage parenchyma, which decreased by 44 % in length and volume, whereas cells in the adjacent chlorenchyma decreased by only 6 %; the osmotic pressure concomitantly increased by only 10 % in the chlorenchyma but by 75 % in the water-storage parenchyma. CONCLUSIONS: The concentrating effect that occurred as cellular volume decreased indicated no change in cellular solute amounts during 6 weeks of drought. The ability to shift water from the parenchyma to the chlorenchyma allowed the latter tissue to maintain a positive net CO₂ uptake rate during such a drought.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3astems 3aHylocereus 3aosmotic pressure 3achlorenchyma 3aflow cytometry 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3awater uptake 3awater potential 2aBiological Transport 2aCactaceaexcytologyxmetabolism. 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aDisasters 2aOsmotic Pressure 2aPlant Stemsxcytology 2aWaterxmetabolism 0aparenchyma 0aHylocereus undatus,0 tAnnals of botany.g2006 Mar., v. 97, no. 3 p.469-474dAcademic Press [etc.]x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcj0543Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aob.oupjournals.org/3electronic resource  a20060324b20060402c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/03/23  aNon-US 7aarticle03253naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181072000900190100001700199245008700216300001400303500002400317520132500341650001701666650001601683650001701699650001501716650002301731650001101754650002001765650002901785650002401814650001401838650005401852650001901906650002401925650004501949650002401994650003302018650005302051650002402104650005102128650005102179651001002230700001502240700001302255773010702268852000902375856007502384856011102459930003302570945002502603946001102628655001202639IND4377904120221122234413.0060215e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437790412DNAL7 a162615402pmid7 a10.1002/ps.11152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aH000 0aW000 0aJ200 0aX1001 aWatanabe, H.10aSimulation of mefenacet concentrations in paddy fields by an improved PCPF-1 model  ap. 20-29.  aIncludes references  aAn improved simulation model (PCPF-1) has been evaluated for the prediction of the fate of mefenacet in an experimental paddy field. This model simulates the fate and transport of pesticide in paddy water and the top 1 cm of paddy soil. Observed concentrations of mefenacet in the paddy water and the surface soil exponentially decreased from their maximum concentrations of 0.70 mg litre(-1) and 11.3 mg kg(-1), respectively. Predicted mefenacet concentrations both in the water and surface soil were in excellent agreement with those measured during the first 2 weeks after herbicide application, but concentrations in paddy water were appreciably overestimated thereafter. The model simulated mefenacet losses through runoff, percolation and degradation to be respectively 41.9%, 6.4% and 57.3% of applied, and the mass balance error was about -6%. The model simulation implied that drainage and seepage control, especially shortly after application when herbicide concentrations are high, is essential for preventing pesticide losses from paddy fields. In focusing on pesticide concentrations in this early period the PCPF-1 model can be a beneficial tool for risk assessment of pesticide losses and in the evaluation of agricultural management for reducing pesticide pollution associated with paddy rice production. 3aOryza sativa 3apaddy soils 3aweed control 3aherbicides 3aherbicide residues 3arunoff 3awater pollution 3asoil transport processes 3amathematical models 3aequations 2aAcetanilidesxadverse effectsxradiation effects. 2aBenzothiazoles 2aCrops, Agricultural 2aHerbicidesxanalysisxradiation effects. 2aModels, Theoretical 2aOryzaxgrowth & development. 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysisxradiation effects. 2aPlant Transpiration 2aThiazolesxadverse effectsxradiation effects. 2aWater Pollutantsxanalysisxradiation effects. 3aJapan1 aTakagi, K.1 aVu, S.H.0 tPest management science.g2006 Jan., v. 62, no. 1 p.20-29dPublished for SCI by Wileyx1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.11153Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1526-4998/issues3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/03/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02505naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245008500171300001600256500010400272520133800376650001101714650001401725650001301739650001401752650001601766650001801782650001101800650001301811650001301824650001001837651001501847700001601862700001601878700001601894773014501910856005502055852000902110655001202119IND60601608620221122234338.0180706e20180430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060160862DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1199.252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdakalic, M.10aBiological and technological properties of olive 'Arbequina' grown in Montenegro  ap. 153-158.  aPaper presented at the VIII International Olive Symposium held October 10 -14, 2016, Split, Croatia  a'Arbequina' is recommended as a cultivar of low vigour, early entry to the productive period, self-fertile and of high and regular fertility, suitable for growing in intensive plantations. The first high-density orchard to be planted with this cultivar in Montenegro was planted in 2006 in the area of Podgorica. Since 2010, new orchards have been planted at several locations in the area of Podgorica and on the coast in the vicinity of Ulcinj in monovarietal and mixed plantations. Research was carried out in the period 2014-2015 in the areas of Podgorica and Ulcinj. The following parameters were monitored: flowering and ripening period, productivity, characteristics of fruit and endocarp and oil content in the fruit. Blossoming at both sites took place in the second half of May and the beginning of ripening in the first decade of October in both years. Fruit yield was significantly higher in 2015. The results showed that average fruit weight ranged from 1.60 g in the area of Podgorica to 1.87 g in Ulcinj, while the fruit-flesh ratio was similar in both areas, 82.5 and 83.96% respectively, as well as endocarp weight (0.28 and 0.29 g, respectively). The average oil content in the fresh matter was low, from 11.65% in Podgorica to 13.99% in Ulcinj, while in dry matter it was higher in the area of Podgorica, at 30.92%. 3acoasts 3acultivars 3aendocarp 3aflowering 3afruit yield 3alipid content 3aolives 3aorchards 3aripening 3avigor 3aMontenegro1 aLazovic, B.1 aPerovic, T.1 aLjutica, S.0 tActa horticulturae.g2018 Apr. 30, , no. 1199 p.153-158dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1199.25  aDNAL 7aarticle03786naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161072000900179100001200188245011200200300001600312500002400328500001500352506007600367520187900443506003702322650001402359650002302373650001402396650001502410650002202425650002402447650001702471650001602488650001202504650001302516650002602529650003302555650004602588650002202634650001002656650002302666650002202689650001702711651001102728651001102739653003102750653002302781700002602804700002402830773009702854852000902951856007802960856005303038930003303091945002503124946001103149655001203160IND4377834020221207104417.0060212e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437783402DNAL7 a163940252pmid7 aPMC28036422pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcj0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aDar, S.10aDiurnal and nocturnal pollination of Marginatocereus marginatus (Pachycereeae: Cactaceae) in central Mexico  ap. 423-427.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Chiropterophillous and ornithophillous characteristics can form part of a single reproductive strategy in plants that have flowers with diurnal and nocturnal anthesis. This broader pollination strategy can ensure seed set when pollinators are scarce or unpredictable. This appears to be true of hummingbirds, which presumably pollinate Marginatocereus marginatus, a columnar cactus with red nocturnal and diurnal flowers growing as part of dense bat-pollinated columnar cacti forests in arid regions of central Mexico. The aim of this study was to study the floral biology of M. marginatus, and evaluate the effectiveness of nocturnal vs. diurnal pollinators and the contribution of each pollinator group to overall plant fitness. METHODS: Individual flower buds were marked and followed to evaluate flower phenology and anthesis time. Flowers and nectar production were measured. An exclusion experiment was conducted to measure the relative contribution of nocturnal and diurnal pollinators to seed set. KEY RESULTS: Marginatocereus marginatus has red hermaphroditic flowers with nocturnal and diurnal anthesis. The plant cannot produce seeds by selfing and was pollinated during the day by hummingbirds and during the night by bats, demonstrating that both pollinator groups were important for plant reproduction. Strong pollen limitation was found in the absence of one of the pollinator guilds. CONCLUSIONS: Marginatocereus marginatus has an open pollination system in which both diurnal and nocturnal pollinators are needed to set seeds. This represents a fail-safe pollination system that can ensure both pollination, in a situation of low abundance of one of the pollinator groups (hummingbirds), and high competition for nocturnal pollinators with other columnar cacti that bloom synchronously with M. marginatus in the Tehuacan Valley, Mexico.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aflowering 3anocturnal activity 3aCactaceae 3aChiroptera 3adiurnal variation 3asexual reproduction 3ahummingbirds 3apollination 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCactaceaexphysiology 2aCircadian Rhythmxphysiology 2aFlowersxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aFruitxphysiology 2aHoney 2aPollenxphysiology 2aSeedsxphysiology 2aTime Factors 3aMexico 0aMexico 0aMarginatocereus marginatus 0aplant reproduction1 aArizmendi, Ma. del C.1 aValiente-Banuet, A.0 tAnnals of botany.g2006 Mar., v. 97, no. 3 p.423-427dAcademic Press [etc.]x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcj0453Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aob.oupjournals.org/3electronic resource  a20060324b20060402c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/03/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02049naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245010800189300001600297520058200313650002700895650002300922650001300945650002000958650002200978650001901000650000901019650001701028650001401045653001901059653002501078700001801103700001601121700002001137700001701157700002101174700001901195700001901214700001801233700001801251700001901269773012201288852000901410856009201419930003301511946001101544655001201555IND4419519520221122225009.0090424e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441951952DNAL7 a215647622pmid7 a10.1111/j.1755-0998.2009.02287.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Woo-Jin.10aDevelopment of 52 new polymorphic microsatellite markers for the olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus  ap. 839-842.  aWe characterized 52 new microsatellite markers isolated from (GT)n and (CT)n microsatellite-enriched genomic libraries of the olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus).

All of them produced regenerative embryogenic calli but with varied efficiencies. To engineer strongly insect-resistant sugarcanes, the GC content of a truncated cry1Ac gene, which encodes the active region of Cry1Ac insecticidal delta-endotoxin, was increased from the original 37.4 to 47.5% following the sugarcane codon usage pattern. The synthetic cry1Ac gene (s-cry1Ac) was placed under the control of maize ubiquitin promoter and introduced by microprojectile bombardment into the embryogenic calli of sugarcane lines YT79-177 and ROC16. Southern blotting analysis showed that multicopies of s-cry1Ac were integrated into the genomes of transgenic sugarcane lines. Immunoblotting analysis identified 18 transgenic lines expressing detectable levels of s-Cry1Ac, which were estimated in the range of 1.8-10.0 ng mg-1 total soluble proteins. Four transgenic and two parental lines were assayed for sugarcane stem borer resistance in leaf tissue feeding trials and greenhouse plant assays. The results showed that, while the untransformed control lines were severely damaged in both leaves and stems, the transgenic sugarcane lines expressing high levels of s-Cry1Ac proteins were highly resistant to sugarcane stem borer attack, resulting in complete mortality of the inoculated insects within 1 week after inoculation. 3aSaccharum officinarum 3asugarcane 3aplant pests 3aChilo 3ainsect pests 3apest resistance 3aplant breeding 3agenetic engineering 3abreeding lines 3amolecular cloning 3atransgenic plants 3agene expression 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBacterial Toxinsxgenetics 2aBase Composition 2aBiolistics 2aBreeding 2aCaulimovirusxgenetics 2aEndotoxinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGene Expression 2aHemolysin Proteins 2aLarva 2aMoths 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aSaccharumxgeneticsxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aTransformation, Genetic 2aUbiquitin Cxgenetics 2aZea mays 3aChina 0aProceras venosatus1 aDeng, H.1 aXu, J.L.1 aLi, Q.1 aWang, L.H.1 aJiang, Z.1 aZhang, H.B.1 aLi, Q.1 aZhang, L.H.0 tPest management science.g2006 Feb., v. 62, no. 2 p.178-187dPublished for SCI by WileywJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.11443Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1526-4998/issues3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/03/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03216naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245017000189300001600359520175600375650001602131650001202147650002002159650002302179650001702202650002202219650002202241650002802263650002702291650002202318650002802340650002002368650001602388653001002404653001102414653002702425653002202452700001702474773012202491852000902613856009202622930003302714946001102747655001202758IND4419515820221122225040.0090424e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441951582DNAL7 a215647252pmid7 a10.1111/j.1755-0998.2008.02319.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEBERT, DANIEL10aChloroplast simple sequence repeats (cpSSRs): technical resources and recommendations for expanding cpSSR discovery and applications to a wide array of plant species  ap. 673-690.  aChloroplast microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats (cpSSRs), are typically mononucleotide tandem repeats. When located in the noncoding regions of the chloroplast genome (cpDNA), they commonly show intraspecific variation in repeat number. Despite the growing number of studies applying cpSSRs, studies of economically important plants and their relatives remain over-represented. Thus, the potential of cpSSRs to offer unique insights into ecological and evolutionary processes in wild plant species has yet to be fully realized. This review provides an overview of the technical resources available to aid cpSSR discovery including a list of cpSSR primer sets available and cpDNA sequencing resources. Our updated analysis of 99 whole chloroplast genomes downloaded from GenBank confirms that potentially variable cpSSRs are abundant in the noncoding cpDNA of plants. Overall variation in the frequency of cpSSRs was extreme, ranging from one to 700 per genome (median = 93), while in 81 vascular plants, between 35 and 160 cpSSRs were detected per genome (median = 86). We offer five recommendations to aid wider development and application of cpSSRs: (i) When genus-specific cpSSR primers are available, cross-species amplification can often be fruitful. (ii) While potentially useful, universal cpSSR primers at best provide access to only a small number of variable markers. (iii) De novo sequencing of noncoding cpDNA is the most effective and efficient way to develop cpSSR markers in wild species. (iv) DNA sequencing of cpSSR alleles is essential, given the complex nature of the genetic variation associated with hypervariable cpDNA regions. (v) The reliability of cpSSR length based genetic assays need to be validated in all studies. 3aDNA primers 3aalleles 3achloroplast DNA 3achloroplast genome 3achloroplasts 3agenetic databases 3agenetic variation 3aintraspecific variation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3asequence analysis 3atandem repeat sequences 3avascular plants 3awild plants 0acpSSR 0areview 0asimple sequence repeat 0auniversal primers1 aPEAKALL, ROD0 tMolecular ecology resources.g2009 May, v. 9, no. 3 p.673-690dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1755-09987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1755-0998.2008.02319.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090425b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04155naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172100001700181245007100198300001600269500002400285520173500309650002202044650001302066650003002079650002702109650002702136650001802163650002302181650003302204650001702237650001702254650002802271650001202299650001102311650001102322650002402333650002602357650001402383650002202397650003302419650004502452650002202497650004102519650004402560650004502604650002302649650002902672650003302701650003102734650002902765650002902794650001902823650007502842650001302917651001402930700001802944700001702962700001602979700001702995773010903012852000903121856007503130856011103205930003303316945002503349946001103374655001203385IND4377938820221122212344.0060216e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437793882DNAL7 a164083172pmid7 a10.1002/ps.11422doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF600 0aF2001 aAndreu, A.B.10aEnhancement of natural disease resistance in potatoes by chemicals  ap. 162-170.  aIncludes references  aThe mechanism involved in systemic acquired resistance (SAR) can be non-specifically induced in susceptible plants. In response to pathogens, plants' natural defence mechanisms include the production of lignin and phytoalexins and the induction of plant enzymes. The aim of this research was to study the induction of SAR mediated by the chemical activator DL-3-aminobutyric acid (BABA) and the fungicide fosetyl-aluminium in potato cultivars with different levels of resistance against Phytophthora infestans (Mont) de Bary. To study the chemical induction of the resistance, the foliage of several potato cultivars was sprayed with BABA, fosetyl-aluminium or water (as a control treatment). After 3 days the foliage was inoculated with P. infestans. Seven days after inoculation, development of disease symptoms in the foliage was assessed. In postharvest tuber samples, evidence for enhancement of the defence response was evaluated by measuring the protein content of several hydrolytic enzymes as well as the phenol and phytoalexin content. The highest level of protection against late blight was observed when the chemicals were applied at early stages of crop development. An increase in resistance to late blight was also detected in tubers after harvest. There was also an increase in the protein level of β-1,3-glucanase and aspartic protease as well as in the phenol and phytoalexin content of potato tuber discs obtained from postharvest tubers of treated plants. Thus the protective effect seemed to persist throughout the whole crop cycle. This treatment may offer the possibility of controlling both foliage and tuber blight and could have a major impact in reducing over-winter survival of P. infestans in tubers. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3apotatoes 3afungal diseases of plants 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apathogenicity 3adisease resistance 3asystemic acquired resistance 3aphytoalexins 3abiosynthesis 3aalpha-aminobutyric acid 3afosetyl 3atubers 3aleaves 3amechanism of action 3apesticide persistence 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 2aAminobutyratesxpharmacology 2aAspartic Acid Endopeptidasesxmetabolism 2aBlotting, Western 2aFungicides, Industrialxpharmacology 2aGlucan 1,3-beta-Glucosidasexmetabolism 2aOrganophosphorus Compoundsxpharmacology 2aPhenolxmetabolism 2aPhytophthoraxphysiology 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Extractsxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPlant Tubersxmetabolism 2aSesquiterpenes 2aSolanum tuberosumxdrug effectsxenzymologyximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aTerpenes 3aArgentina1 aGuevara, M.G.1 aWolski, E.A.1 aDaleo, G.R.1 aCaldiz, D.O.0 tPest management science.g2006 Feb., v. 62, no. 2 p.162-170dPublished for SCI by Wileyx1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.11423Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1526-4998/issues3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/03/02  aNon-US 7aarticle01904naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245017200173300001600345520053900361650001800900650001200918650001300930650002200943650001900965650000900984650002700993650001601020650002101036653001001057653002501067653001701092653001401109653001801123700001601141700002301157700002201180773012301202852000901325856009201334930003301426946001101459655001201470IND4416253920221122175833.0090213e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441625392DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1755-0998.2008.02489.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRIBEIRO, ÂNGELA10aMicrosatellites in the Karoo scrub-robin, Cercotrichas coryphaeus (Passeriformes: Muscicapinae): isolation and characterization of 13 autosomal and two sex-linked loci  ap. 636-638.  aFifteen polymorphic microsatellites were developed for the Karoo scrub-robin, Cercotrichas coryphaeus.

It has been suggested that aphids may use volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to: (a) select leaves where nutrient remobilization has started and induced defenses are reduced; and (b) detect the time of leaf abscission. We analyzed VOCs emitted by the foliage of Betula pendula Roth. during autumn coloration and from leaf litter just after leaf fall. We tested the hypothesis that costly, photosynthesis-related terpenes and other herbivore-induced VOCs related to attraction of aphid parasitoids and predators are reduced during the coloration process. We also investigated if the VOC emission profile of abscising leaves is different from that of early stage yellowing leaves. Enemy-luring compounds (E)-β-ocimene, linalool, and (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT) were emitted only from the green foliage. Methyl salicylate (MeSa), known to recruit predatory bugs and attract migrant aphids, was emitted until the first stage of color change. Cis-3-hexenol, an indicator of cellular disintegration, became dominant in the emissions from abscising leaves and from fresh leaf litter. We discuss the ecological significance of the observed changes in birch leaf VOC profiles during the process of autumn senescence. 3aparasitoids 3aautumn 3aplant litter 3anitrogen 3apredators 3avolatile organic compounds 3atrees 3aBetula pendula 3acolor 3aleaf abscission 3aemissions 3aAphidoidea 3alinalool 3aleaves 3amethyl salicylate 2aAlkenesxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxphysiology 2aBetulaxphysiology 2aEcosystem 2aMonoterpenesxmetabolism 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSalicylatesxmetabolism 2aSeasons 2aTerpenesxmetabolism 2aTime Factors 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxmetabolism 0asenescence1 aHeijari, Juha1 aOksanen, Elina1 aAlessio, Giorgio A.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2010 Oct., v. 36, no. 10 p.1068-1075dSpringer-Verlagx0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-010-9857-4 7aarticle01974naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245015000191300001800341520070600359650001101065650001201076650002001088650001301108650001501121650000901136650001601145653002501161653000901186653002001195700002001215700001901235700002101254700001901275773012501294852000901419856009201428930003301520946001101553655001201564IND4422355320221122115543.0090626e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442235532DNAL7 a215648912pmid7 a10.1111/j.1755-0998.2009.02620.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPRINZ, KATHLEEN10aMicrosatellite markers for the tetraploid halophyte Suaeda maritima (L.)

Two models appear possible, a genome-wide effect due to inbreeding depression, and a single-locus effect due to chance linkage to a gene(s) experiencing balancing selection. Recent studies suggest that the latter tends to be more important in the majority of studies, but tests for the presence of single-locus effects tend to be rather weak. One of the problems is that the linkage disequilibrium between a microsatellite and a nearby gene experiencing balancing selection is never likely to be 100%. With this in mind, we conduct stochastic simulations aimed at determining the conditions under which single-locus HFCs may develop. We also suggest a new approach that could offer improved detection of HFCs but which also offers a more general method for detecting genotype-fitness correlations. Our method is based on looking for the maximum possible strength of association between genotype and fitness, and then asking whether randomized data sets are able to generate similarly strong associations. This method is tested on both simulated and real data. In both cases, our method generates greater levels of significance than current tests. Applied to previously published data from wild boar affected by tuberculosis, the method uncovers a strong single-allele association that is strongly predictive of whether the disease is localized or spreads throughout the body. We further suggest a simple method for dealing with the problem of population structure, and believe this approach will help to identify genomic regions associated with fitness. 3aalleles 3adata collection 3agenotype 3ahydrofluorocarbons 3ainbreeding depression 3alinkage disequilibrium 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amodels 3apopulation structure 3atuberculosis 3awild boars 0aallele-specific associations 0abalanced polymorphism 0afitness 0aHFC1 aAcevedo-Whitehouse, Karina.0 tMolecular ecology resources.g2009 July, v. 9, no. 4 p.1102-1111dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1755-09987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1755-0998.2009.02560.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090626b20090703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02298naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002900152245007200181300001800253520126000271650001801531650001001549650000901559650001601568650002701584650002501611653000901636653002001645653002501665773012501690852000901815856009201824930003301916946001101949655001201960IND4422350720221122075358.0090626e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442235072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1755-0998.2009.02541.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWard, R. D.q(Robert D.)10aDNA barcode divergence among species and genera of birds and fishes  ap. 1077-1085.  aCOI DNA barcoding is increasingly recognized as a significant new tool for the recognition and identification of animal species. Here, publicly available barcode data are compiled and analysed for birds (657 species) and fishes (1088 species). The proportion of species that cannot be barcode-distinguished by this marker is approximately 6.4% for birds and 2.1-2.5% for fishes. At all hierarchical taxonomic levels (species, genera, family, order, class), fish show greater mean COI divergence than birds. If two samples are barcode-identical, then for both birds and fishes, the probability that they are from the same species is 98-99%. The probability of conspecificity rapidly drops as divergence increases. At 2% COI divergence, this probability approximates to 1% for birds and 3% for fishes. The apparent difference between birds and fishes might partially reflect currently unrecognized cryptic species complexes in the latter. These probability estimates derive from pooled samples of birds and pooled samples of fishes, and will not apply in all situations. Recently evolved species complexes will have higher proportions of species that are barcode-identical. As barcode data accumulate, more refined statistical analyses will become possible. 3aDNA barcoding 3abirds 3afish 3aprobability 3aspecies identification 3astatistical analysis 0acox1 0acryptic species 0acytochrome c oxidase0 tMolecular ecology resources.g2009 July, v. 9, no. 4 p.1077-1085dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1755-09987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1755-0998.2009.02541.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090626b20090703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02281naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245013800193300001800331520100800349650002001357650002201377650001201399650002701411650000901438650002701447650001701474650001001491653002401501653002401525653001901549700002301568700002201591773012501613852000901738856009201747930003301839946001101872655001201883IND4422355120221122075359.0090626e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442235512DNAL7 a215648892pmid7 a10.1111/j.1755-0998.2009.02617.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSTRUGNELL, JAN M.12aA panel of microsatellite loci from two species of octopus, Pareledone turqueti (Joubin, 1905) and Pareledone charcoti (Joubin, 1905)  ap. 1239-1242.  aEighteen dinucleotide microsatellite loci were isolated from two octopus species, Pareledone turqueti and Pareledone charcoti, which are endemic to the Southern Ocean.

The method is applied to a novel class of materials that form (semi)conductive 1D wires for supramolecular electronics and artificial light-harvesting. The zinc chlorins 3-devinyl-3¹-hydroxymethyl-13²-demethoxycarbonylpheophorbide a (3',5'-bis-dodecyloxy)benzyl ester zinc complex 1 and 3-devinyl-3¹-methoxymethyl-13²-demethoxycarbonylpheophorbide a (3',5'-bis-dodecyloxy)benzyl ester zinc complex 2, self-assemble into extended excitonically coupled chromophore stacks. ¹H-¹³C heteronuclear dipolar correlation MAS NMR experiments provided the ¹H resonance assignment of the chlorin rings that allowed accurate probing of ring currents related to the stacking of macrocycles. DFT ring-current shift calculations revealed that both chlorins self-assemble in antiparallel π-stacks in planar layers in the solid-state. Concomitantly, X-ray powder diffraction measurements for chlorin 2 at 80 °C revealed a 3D lattice for the mesoscale packing that matches molecular mechanics optimized aggregate models. For chlorin 2 the stacks alternate with a periodicity of 0.68 nm and a 3D unit cell with an approximate volume of 6.28 nm³ containing 4 molecules, which is consistent with space group P2₁22₁.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray diffraction 3achlorins 3aelectronics 3amechanics 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aperiodicity 3azinc1 aSengupta, Sanchita1 aWawrzyniak, Piotr K.1 aHuber, Valerie1 aBuda, Francesco1 aBaumeister, Ute1 aWürthner, Frank.1 ade Groot, Huub J.M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 July 14, v. 106, no. 28 p.11472-11477dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08118721063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090718b20090801c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02255naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125040001800147100002400165245004700189300002000236506007600256520117100332506003701503650001801540650001201558650001401570650001701584650001401601773017601615852000901791856008301800930003301883946001301916655001201929IND4423321520221207100417.0090718e20090714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442332152DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09007131062doi7 aPMC27106912pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLubchenko, Vassiliy10aShear thinning in deeply supercooled melts  ap. 11506-11510.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe compute, on a molecular basis, the viscosity of a deeply supercooled liquid at high shear rates. The viscosity is shown to decrease at growing shear rates, owing to an increase in the structural relaxation rate as caused by the shear. The onset of this non-Newtonian behavior is predicted to occur universally at a shear rate significantly lower than the typical structural relaxation rate, by approximately two orders of magnitude. This results from a large size--up to several hundred atoms--of the cooperative rearrangements responsible for mass transport in supercooled liquids and the smallness of individual molecular displacements during the cooperative rearrangements. We predict that the liquid will break down at shear rates such that the viscosity drops by approximately a factor of 30 below its Newtonian value. These phenomena are predicted to be independent of the liquid's fragility. In contrast, the degree of nonexponentiality and violation of the Stokes-Einstein law, which are more prominent in fragile substances, will be suppressed by shear. The present results are in agreement with existing measurements of shear thinning in silicate melts.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amass transfer 3amelting 3asilicates 3asupercooling 3aviscosity0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 July 14, v. 106, no. 28 p.11506-11510dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09007131063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090718b20090801c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02936naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245015500144300001600299520129900315650001501614650001101629650001001640650001001650650001401660650001101674650001901685650001201704650003301716650002501749650003601774650006001810650002401870650001101894650001801905650002801923650001301951650004501964650001002009650000902019650001202028650001402040650001302054650002702067650003002094653001702124653001402141700001402155700001502169700001402184773008002198852000902278930003302287945001302320946001302333655001202346IND2049245820221121225428.0951218e199511  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204924582DNAL7 a75898022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgrawal, N.10aNeoplastic transformation and aberrant cell-cell interactions in genetic mosaics of lethal(2)giant larvae (lgl), a tumor suppressor gene of Drosophila  ap. 218-229.  aHomozygosity for lethal(2)giant larvae (lgl), a mutation in a tumor suppressor gene of Drosophila, induces neoplasia of the imaginal discs. To explore the developmental capacities of lgl mutant cells, we have investigated their growth and differentiation in genetic mosaics. Adult wings mosaic for lgl displayed abnormal growth and differentiation of the lgl mutant and neighboring wild-type cells, suggesting aberrant cell-cell interactions during development. lgl mutant clones also straddled the anteroposterior boundary of the wing imaginal disc, apparently due to failure of the cells of the anterior and the posterior compartment to segregate at the boundary. To further test if anteroposterior compartmentalization takes place in the neoplastic imaginal discs of lgl mutant larvae, we studied the expression of an engrailed (en)-specific lacZ reporter gene during progressive stages of their tumorous growth. Our results show that en is activated in the posterior compartments of the neoplastic imaginal discs. However, during later stages of tumorous overgrowth, the en-expressing and nonexpressing cells appear to show extensive intermixing. These observations suggest that neoplastic transformation of imaginal discs involves loss of their normal cell-cell interactions and signaling. 3aDrosophila 3alarvae 3agenes 3acells 3aneoplasms 3aclones 3acarcinogenesis 2aAnimals 2aCell Communicationxgenetics 2aCell Differentiation 2aCell Transformation, Neoplastic 2aDrosophilaxembryologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aDrosophila Proteins 2aFemale 2aGenes, Insect 2aGenes, Tumor Suppressor 2aGenotype 2aInsect Hormonesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aLarva 2aMale 2aMitosis 2aMosaicism 2aMutation 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aTumor Suppressor Proteins 0ainteractions 0amosaicism1 aKango, M.1 aMishra, A.1 aSinha, P.0 tDevelopmental biology.g1995 Nov., v. 172, no. 1 p.218-229x0012-16067nnas  aDNAL  a19960202b19960208c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01174naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099245002700117300001400144520049500158650001900653650002000672650000900692650002000701653001300721653002500734653001700759773007000776852000900846939003300855945000800888655001200896991602362840742620221121190500.0770601e197702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7794420802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aWhen is beef not beef?  ap. 47-48.  aThe Texas state food service director has conducted a series of one day seminars to help school food service personnel determine the nutritive value of convenience foods.

This expertise is often lacking in the architects, mechanical engineers, and foodservice managers who plan most school kitchen facilities. 3aventilation systems 3aconsultants 3akitchens 3aschool food service 0aDesign needs 0aFood preparation and distribution systems 0aFood service technologists 0aEquipment specialists 0aFacilities planning and layout0 pSch Foodserv Jg1976 , v. 30, no. 10 p.34-35x0160-62717nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19770301c00000000  aFNC 7aarticle01204naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100002100117245002800138300001400166520049900180650001300679650002400692653002300716653002600739653001400765653003100779773006600810852000900876939003300885945000800918655001200926991602361820742620221121161308.0770301e197612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7794412962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParry, Edward A.10aTraining table time out  ap. 43-47.  aThe Chester Upland, Pennsylvania foodservice department developed a successful athletic feeding program for the school district's football and soccer training camp.

Permanent pest exclusion relies on maintaining fence integrity, and enhancing knowledge of pest activity and behaviour at fenced reserves. We describe summer and winter periods of activity and behaviour of mammalian pests directly adjacent to the pest-proof fence. We (1) tested for the effects of adjacent habitat type, breach type and season on the rate of mammalian pest sightings directly at the fence, (2) determined how quickly pest mammals may locate a fence breach, and how likely they are to exploit it, and (3) developed a predictive model to help assess the probability of a pest gaining entry to the sanctuary if repair to a fence breach is delayed. Observations inside the rolled fence hood provided firm evidence that rats travel and forage extensively in this artificial although highly acceptable aboveground habitat, much more than on the ground. We confirm and emphasise that mammalian pests are constantly testing the pest-proof fence. Pests are very common directly outside the fence, and within 24h there is a very high likelihood that a fence breach will be located and exploited. The greatest threat of reinvasion comes (1) nocturnally, (2) from rodents and (3) in the summer; however, these results also confirm that there is constant risk from multiple pest species, regardless of time of day or season. 3aforage 3ahabitats 3amodels 3apests 3arats 3arisk 3asummer 3atravel 3aNew Zealand1 aDay, Tim D.1 aKing, C.

We have measured pesticide leached from a litchi orchard to an adjacent stream and identified the flow components contributing to the pesticide transport after installing two discharge measurement stations with automatic water samplers in the stream. For 2 years, between June and September, we applied methomyl, and in 1 year additionally chlorothalonil, to the 2-ha orchard and monitored water fluxes and pesticide concentrations in the stream water. Pesticide loads ranged from 1.6 to 3% of mass applied for chlorothalonil, a strongly sorbing fungicide, and 6.4-11.4% for the more weakly sorbing insecticide methomyl. Directly after application, pesticide transport was dominated by a fast flow component, reaching the flume before the discharge peak. Later, pesticides were transported mainly by preferential interflow, which peaked about 30 hours after a rain event. The groundwater pathway was not found to contribute to pesticide loss. Antecedent rain conditions proved to be important for the pesticide transport behaviour. While at the beginning of the rainy season large falls of rain did not lead to pesticide contamination, at the end of the season pesticide transport was induced by as little as 0.1 mm of rain. The occurrence of preferential interflow means that the hilly regions in northern Thailand are highly susceptible to contamination by pesticides used by farmers. 3aagrochemicals 3aautumn 3afarmers 3afungicides 3agroundwater 3ahills 3ainsecticides 3amethomyl 3aorchards 3arain 3asamplers 3astream flow 3astreams 3asubsurface flow 3awet season 3aThailand1 aIngwersen, J.1 aNutniyom, P.1 aTotrakool, S.1 aPansombat, K.1 aThavornyutikarn, P.1 aStreck, T.0 tEuropean journal of soil science.g2008 Feb., v. 59, no. 1 p.71-81dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1351-07547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2007.00984.x 7aarticle01510naa a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097024002100115040001800136100001500154245010500169300001800274520021200292650002200504650002100526650002000547650001200567650001100579650002100590650004900611650002800660650002400688650000900712650001400721650002200735650002500757650003800782653002300820653002300843653002100866700002000887773008200907852000900989939003300998945000801031946001301039655001201052991602360170742620221121093736.0830217e198212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830014302DNAL7 a68181462pmid7 aPMC3478712pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuft, B.J.10aEffect of pregnancy on resistance to Listeria monocytogenes and Toxoplasma gondii infections in mice  ap. 1164-1171.  aToxoplasma gondii, Listeria monocytogenes, significantly diminished resistance of pregnant mice to infection, this decrease in resistance may play important role in congenital transmission of these organisms 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aimmunocompetence 3aimmune response 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aImmunity, Innate 2aListeria monocytogenesxgrowth & development 2aListeriosisximmunology 2aLiverxmicrobiology 2aMice 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy, Animal 2aSpleenxmicrobiology 2aToxoplasmosis, Animalximmunology 0aPrenatal infection 0aReproduction, Host 0aResistance, Host1 aRemington, J.S.0 tInfection and immunity.g1982 Dec., v. 38, no. 3 p.1164-1171x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830217c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle03689naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001900179245010600198300001800304500002400322506007600346520192900422506003702351650001402388650001202402650001202414650001502426650003202441650001002473650002102483650001502504650001102519650001002530650001502540650001002555650004102565650004702606650004402653650004902697650002402746650001402770650004302784651002502827700002202852700002302874700001702897773010202914852000903016856007803025856003203103655001203135IND4396474220221207083536.0071021e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439647422DNAL7 a178046072pmid7 aPMC27592662pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcm2172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Vega, Clara14aThe Endophytic System of Mediterranean Cytinus (Cytinaceae) Developing on Five Host Cistaceae Species  ap. 1209-1217.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: One of the most extreme manifestations of parasitism is found in the genus Cytinus, a holoparasite whose vegetative body is reduced to an endophytic system living within its host root. There are two species of Cytinus in the Mediterranean, C. hypocistis and C. ruber, which parasitize various genera of Cistaceae, one of the most characteristic families of the Mediterranean scrublands. The aim of this work is to describe the endophytic systems of C. hypocistis and C. ruber, and their tissue relationships with their host. METHODS: Roots from five different hosts infected with C. hypocistis and C. ruber were harvested, and examined by anatomical techniques under light microscopy to elucidate the characteristics of the endophytic system of Cytinus, and to determine if differences in endophytic systems occur between the two species and in response to different hosts. KEY RESULTS: The endophyte structure is similar in both Cytinus species irrespective of the host species. In the initial stages of the endophyte, rows of parenchymal cells spread through the host pericyclic derivatives and phloem, and begin to generate small nodules in the outermost region of the host xylem. Later the nodules anastomose, and bands of parasitic tissue are formed. The host cambium continues to develop xylem tissue, and consequently the endophyte becomes enclosed within the xylem. The bands of parasitic tissue fuse to form a continuous sheath. This mature endophyte has well-developed vascular system with xylem and phloem, and forms sinkers with transfer cells that grow through the host xylem. CONCLUSIONS: The endophytic system of Cytinus develops in all host root tissues and reaches its most mature stages in the host xylem. It is more complex than previously reported, showing parenchyma, xylem and phloem tissues. This is the first report of well-developed phloem in a holoparasitic endophytic species.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCistaceae 3aCytinus 3acambium 3aendophytes 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ahosts 3alight microscopy 3aparasitism 3aphloem 3aroots 3ashrublands 3axylem 2aMagnoliopsidaxgrowth & development. 2aCistaceaexcytologyxgrowth & development. 2aPhloemxcytologyxgrowth & development. 2aPlant Rootsxcytologyxgrowth & development. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSymbiosis 2aXylemxcytologyxgrowth & development. 0aMediterranean Region1 aOrtiz, Pedro Luis1 aArista, Montserrat1 aTalavera, S.0 tAnnals of botany.g2007 Nov., v. 100, no. 6 p.1209-1217dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcm2173Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aob.oupjournals.org/ 7aarticle01169naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245007400135300001600209500001500225520027000240650002100510650002000531653001300551653004000564653003500604700001900639700001600658773012000674852000900794939003300803945000800836946001100844655001200855991602359940742620221121093716.0830217e198204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830013422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDawkins, H.J.S.10aStrongyloides ratti infections in congenitally hypothymic (nude) mice  ap. 181-186.  a2019-12-04  aStrongyloides ratti, congenitally hypothymic (nude) mice, kinetics of primary and secondary infections, concluded that both spontaneous expulsion of worms in primary infection and resistance to challenge infection are T cell-dependent events, autoinfection not seen 3aimmunocompetence 3aimmune response 0aimmunity 0aDisease transmission, Autoinfection 0aStrongyloides ratti (Nematoda)1 aMitchell, G.F.1 aGrove, D.I.0 tAustralian journal of experimental biology and medical science.g1982 Apr., v. 60, no. 2 p.181-186x0004-945X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830217c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle00972naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245008300131300001600214520013700230650002400367650001600391653004700407700001600454700001500470700001600485773012000501852000900621939003300630945000800663946001100671655001200682991602359650742620221121075254.0830217e198112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830013342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVadas, M.A.10aIn vitro enhancement of the helminthotoxic capacity of human blood eosinophils  ap. 739-741.  aSchistosoma mansoni, enhancing effect of human placental conditioned medium on eosinophil-mediated killing of schistosomula in vitro 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3aeosinophils 0aImmunity, Antibody dependent cell mediated1 aDessein, A.1 aNicola, N.1 aDavid, J.R.0 tAustralian journal of experimental biology and medical science.g1981 Dec., v. 59, no. 6 p.739-741x0004-945X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830217c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle01186naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245005100149300001800200500001500218520012700233650002200360650001200382650004300394650005900437650005500496650001100551650003400562650000900596653002100605700001700626773011800643852000900761939003300770945000800803946001300811655001200824991602359510742620221121075249.0830216e19821201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830013042DNAL7 a71744572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeare, J.A.10aEpizootic of balantidiasis in lowland gorillas  ap. 1345-1347.  a2019-12-04  aBalantidium coli in Gorilla g. gorilla, clinical signs, clinicopathologic findings, treatment: Los Angeles Zoo, California 3aBalantioides coli 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aBalantidiasisxdrug therapyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aEnteritisxdrug therapyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aGorilla gorillaxparasitology 2aMale 0aBalantidium coli1 aLoomis, M.R.0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g1982 Dec. 1, v. 181, no. 11 p.1345-1347x0003-14887nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830216c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle01131naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001700136245003200153300001400185500002400199520041500223650001300638650001800651650002400669773009900693852000900792856007600801655001200877IND4458763520221121075238.0110609e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445876352DNAL7 a10.1136/inp.d1972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGirotti, Ray10aOiling the wheels of change  ap. 90-92.  aIncludes references  aChange is having a greater impact on our lives than ever before.

A water mixing model developed using concentrations of Na⁺, Cl⁻, and SO₄⁻²identified three major water sources: soil water, groundwater and deep aquifer water. After accounting for mixing of these water sources, additional chemical signatures resulting from biogeochemical processes in the riparian zone were identified. Net mineralization of DOC occurred throughout the Santa Fe River watershed, particularly during the lowest flow conditions and in the upper watershed. However, natural dissolved organic matter was more labile during low flow and in the lower watershed, and predominantly derived from groundwater (rather than soil water) in all samples, likely via releases during carbonate dissolution. Carbonate dissolution commonly occurred in the upper watershed during low flow conditions, while carbonate minerals precipitated during baseflow, as well as in the lower watershed during very low flow conditions. Thus, riparian zone biogeochemical processes were strongly mediated by watershed hydrology, whose spatiotemporal variations resulted in greater inorganic and organic C export production in the lower watershed than the upper watershed, and during higher flow versus lower flow periods. During this lower flow period, the Santa Fe River watershed exported ~1.0 and 10.3 ton km⁻² year⁻¹DOC and DIC, respectively, representing higher C yields than many other types of watersheds.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemporal variation 3amineralization 3arivers 3achlorides 3akarsts 3aaquifers 3abase flow 3asodium 3acarbonate minerals 3adissolved organic carbon 3ariparian areas 3abiogeochemistry 3asoil water 3aspatial variation 3agroundwater 3awatershed hydrology 3astatistical models 3awatersheds 3aFlorida 0acarbon1 aZimmerman, Andrew R.1 aMartin, Jonathan B.1 aKhadka, Mitra B.0 tBiogeochemistry.g2015 Jan., v. 122, no. 1 p.131-150dSpringer-Verlagx0168-25637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-014-0035-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245018400165300001600349500001500365520111700380592002801497650001901525650002201544650001401566650001101580650001701591650001401608650001701622650001801639650001701657651001501674653001501689700002201704773009301726856004801819852000901867655001201876IND4465724020221119151316.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446572402DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-011-0071-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShackley, Simon10aLost in the mix: will the technologies of carbon dioxide capture and storage provide us with a breathing space as we strive to make the transition from fossil fuels to renewables?  ap. 101-121.  a2019-12-06  aThis paper explores concepts of carbon lock-in arising from the technologies of CO2 capture and storage (CCS). We examine the argument that CCS reduces carbon lock-in and the calls for a CCS ‘mandate’ and emission performance standards. We analyse the pros- and cons- of a low-carbon fossil fuel lock-in, arguing that lock-in per se is not the problem; it is rather the depth of lock-in which creates problems because deeper lock-in reduces flexibility and increases the ‘error cost’ (i.e. the cost of a decision which turns out to be based on incorrect understanding) and should be avoided. A set of technical and institutional indicators for measuring the flexibility of different technologies is then presented and applied to three technologies: a landfill gas power generator, a conventional nuclear power plant and a CCS plant under development in California. We conclude that these indicators are a useful way forward in assessing individual projects and that public authorities and other stakeholders might wish to employ some version of these indicators in their deliberations on the role of CCS.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aplant development 3alandfills 3acarbon 3apower plants 3aemissions 3astakeholders 3anuclear power 3afossil fuels 3aCalifornia 0agenerators1 aThompson, Michael0 tClimatic change.g2012 Jan., v. 110, no. 1-2 p.101-121dSpringer-Verlagx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-011-0071-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011100166300001600277520122600293592002801519650001701547650002301564650002901587650002501616650000901641650001401650650003101664650001901695650001101714650001501725650001201740653002301752653003901775653002401814700001801838700001801856773021101874856008302085852000902168655001202177IND60673133620221121063801.0191214e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067313362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.japb.2019.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Jeong-Ho10aApplication of different fish sampling gear in Korean reservoirs and the analysis of sampling efficiencies  ap. 528-540.  aThe key objectives of this research were to establish fish monitoring methodologies and sampling efficiency strategies through the analysis of relations between fish species (compositions) and different kinds of sampling gear for lentic ecosystem health assessments. During the study, 81 species of fish and 53,792 individuals were sampled from the thirty reservoirs. When we tested the efficiency of combinations of multiple sampling gears, the combination of the cast net (CN) and kick net (KN) was most cost-effective, based on the sampling time elapsed and total cost of the sampling. This combination (1st choice method) sampled 74 fish species and 21,321 individuals and showed even better results than the combination of four types of gear (2nd choice method), which included the CN, fyke net (FN), trammel net (TN), KN, although 80 species and 52,242 individuals were sampled from the 2nd method. Overall, our preliminary data suggest that the lentic ecosystem health assessment (LEHA) model developed for national-level surveys may be used as an efficient tool for LEHA and the combined use of the CN and KN was more cost-effective than the 2nd choice method of four types of sampling gear (CN, FN, TN, and KN).  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acost effectiveness 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental health 3afish 3afyke nets 3ahealth effects assessments 3alentic systems 3amodels 3amonitoring 3asurveys 0aFish sampling gear 0aLentic ecosystem health assessment 0aSampling efficiency1 aAn, Seung-Lak1 aAn, Kwang-Guk0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific biodiversity(Online).g2019 Dec. 01, v. 12, no. 4 p.528-540dElsevier B.V.aNational Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA)wJournal:23211x2287-884X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.japb.2019.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02055naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010300163300001800266520101600284592002801300650002201328650001201350650002601362650001101388650003101399650001201430650001801442650001401460700001901474700002001493773011401513856008101627852000901708655001201717IND60119066620221118232839.0141128e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011906662DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-014-1706-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKam, Tae-In10aAmyloid beta receptors responsible for neurotoxicity and cellular defects in Alzheimer’s disease  ap. 4803-4813.  aAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Although a major cause of AD is the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide that induces neuronal loss and cognitive impairments, our understanding of its neurotoxic mechanisms is limited. Recent studies have identified putative Aβ-binding receptors that mediate Aβ neurotoxicity in cells and models of AD. Once Aβ interacts with a receptor, a toxic signal is transduced into neurons, resulting in cellular defects including endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, Aβ can also be internalized into neurons through unidentified Aβ receptors and induces malfunction of subcellular organelles, which explains some part of Aβ neurotoxicity. Understanding the neurotoxic signaling initiated by Aβ-receptor binding and cellular defects provide insight into new therapeutic windows for AD. In the present review, we summarize the findings on Aβ-binding receptors and the neurotoxicity of oligomeric Aβ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamyloid 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3amodels 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurons 3aneurotoxicity 3areceptors1 aGwon, Youngdae1 aJung, Yong-Keun0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2014 Dec., v. 71, no. 24 p.4803-4813dSpringer-Verlagx1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-014-1706-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245009800206300001400304500001900318520162900337592002801966650001401994650002402008650001302032650002302045650000902068653001302077653001702090653002002107700002102127700006502148773014902213856008602362852000902448655001202457IND60735497520221119132423.0210601e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073549752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2021.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeza, Pablo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5924-047714aThe effect of substrate on prey capture does not match natural substrate use in a wolf spider  ap. 17-21.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBecause habitats present different costs and benefits in contexts ranging from foraging to mating to predator avoidance, decisions about habitat use likely involve significant trade-offs across behavioural contexts. We examine this possibility in Schizocosa floridana, a cursorial wolf spider whose habitat consists of multiple substrates, including oak and pine litter, and sand. However, S. floridana restricts its use of habitat to oak litter. Substrate environments vary significantly in the degree to which they transmit visual and vibratory information. Previous work found that oak litter best transmits the substrate-borne vibrations that are critical to mating communication. However, oak litter may reduce the availability of visual information, which is known to be important for prey capture in other wolf spider species. Here, we test the relationship between substrate and prey capture efficiency in S. floridana. We examine substrate use in a foraging context via two laboratory-based experiments to (1) assess differences in prey capture efficiency among the three most common substrates in the field and to (2) determine which sensory modalities are involved in prey capture. We found that prey capture rates were highest on sand despite the fact that sand is the least used substrate by S. floridana in the wild. We also found no conclusive evidence that either the visual or the vibratory sensory modalities are critical for prey capture. Our results thus suggest that strict habitat specialization such as that exhibited by S. floridana is beneficial in some ecological contexts but costly in others.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLycosidae 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3apredator avoidance 3asand 0aforaging 0amicrohabitat 0asensory ecology1 aElias, Damian O.1 aRosenthal, Malcolm F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1291-17280 tAnimal behaviour.g2021 June, v. 176 p.17-21dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2021.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02075naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013900163520084300302592002801145650000901173650002001182650001601202653002001218653002601238653002001264653003101284653002201315700001801337700002101355700002001376700002001396700001901416700001901435700001701454700002201471773009401493856008101587852000901668655001201677IND60725072420221118063452.0210124e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072507242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.1040612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorik, M.A.10aData on physical and electrical properties of (ZrO2)1-x(Sc2O3)x(CeO2)y and (ZrO2)1-x-y-z(Sc2O3)x(CeO2)y(Y2O3)z solid solution crystals  aThe data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Phase stability and transport characteristics of (ZrO₂)₁₋ₓ(Sc₂O₃)ₓ(СeO₂)y and (ZrO₂)₁₋ₓ₋y₋z(Sc₂O₃)ₓ(СeO₂)y(Y₂O₃)z solid solution crystals” https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340917302329 [1].

To understand the susceptibility of two cattle species to FMDV infection in terms of viral receptors, the present study reports the cloning, characterization and sequence analysis of Zebu ITGB6 gene. The complete CDS of zebu ITGB6 was 2367 basepair in length with 788 amino acid residues. The zebu integrin shares common structural and functional elements with taurine and other species. We identified an amino substitution (S₆₆₅ to F₆₆₅) presents in ITGB6 gene among zebu and taurine as SNP (rs136500299). Further, we determined and compared the structural differences of ITGB6 receptor gene among zebu and taurine species. To elucidate the influence of the SNP on the susceptibility of cattle to FMDV infection, a tetra ARMS PCR based genetic screening was performed among Zebu and crossbred cattle. Our observation revealed that, the targeted SNP are strongly (P < 0.05) associated with FMD susceptibility among Frieswal (HF X Sahiwal) crossbred cattle.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSahiwal 3aamino acids 3abulls 3acrossbreds 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3agenes 3agenetic testing 3aheterozygosity 3aintegrins 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areceptors 3ascreening 3asequence analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3azebu1 aDeb, Rajib1 aSingh, Umesh1 aRaja, T.

Water extracts of C. militaris (CME) and water extracts of C. sinensis (CSE) protected the HepG2 cells against t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) induced oxidative injury. No significant differences were found between CME and CSE at 500μg/mL in ROS generation, GSH content, TBARS formation, Bcl-2/Bax ratio in t-BHP-induced HepG2 cells. The inhibitory effect of CME at 500μg/mL on caspase 3 activity in t-BHP-induced HepG2 cells was superior to CSE (500μg/mL). However, protective effect of CME on decreasing the mitochondria membrane potential in t-BHP-induced HepG2 cells was inferior to CSE. The hepatoprotective actions of CME and CSE in vitro may be related to maintenance of the normal redox status of cells. Taken together, our results suggest that CME could be a potentially useful source in substitution for CSE for preventing and treating hepatotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCordyceps militaris 3aOphiocordyceps sinensis 3acaspase-3 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahuman cell lines 3amembrane potential 3amitochondrial membrane 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances1 aLee, Chia Pu1 aChen, Zong-Tsi1 aYu, Hui Mei1 aDuh, Pin-Der0 tJournal of functional foods.g2012 Apr., v. 4, no. 2 p.489-495dElsevier Ltdx1756-46467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2012.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008100168500002200249506011100271506007600382520129200458592002801750506003701778650001501815650001201830650001301842650001701855650001201872650001401884650001101898650001201909650001201921650001501933650001901948650001101967653001801978653001601996653001002012653001002022700002402032700001702056700001502073700002102088773010802109856005202217852000902269655001202278IND60792392920221207114104.0220906e20220831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079239292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1298992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeans, Innes10aUptake and Speciation of Zn and Pb by Miscanthus Grown in Contaminated Soils  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe uptake by and distribution of Zn and Pb within a novel seed-based Miscanthus hybrid grown in contaminated soil was assessed. Results from juvenile plants in a pot-trial was compared with data for mature biomass of the same species harvested during a field-trial. Both Zn and Pb uptake by juvenile plants were observed to increase in proportion to the soil concentrations. Both Zn and Pb accumulation differed between leaf and stem structures, and both were different in the mature biomass compared with juvenile plants. Analysis of X-Ray Absorption Fine Structures (XAFS) revealed different Zn speciation in stems and leaves, and differences in Zn speciation with plant maturity. Sulfur ligands consistent with the presence of cysteine rich metallothioneins (MT) and phytochelatin (PC) complexes were the dominant Zn species in juvenile plant leaves, together with octahedral O/N species typified by Zn-malate. Sulfur ligands were also prevalent in stems from juvenile plants, but predominant O/N speciation shifted towards tetrahedral coordination. In contrast, tetrahedral Zn coordination with O/N species predominated in the mature biomass crop. The XAFS spectra for the mature biomass were consistent with Zn being retained within cell walls as pectin and/or phosphate complexes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMiscanthus 3abiomass 3acysteine 3aenergy crops 3ahybrids 3ajuveniles 3aleaves 3aligands 3apectins 3aphosphates 3apolluted soils 3asulfur 0ametals uptake 0asynchrotron 0aXANES 0aEXAFS1 aStewart, Douglas I.1 aJones, Jenny1 aKam, Jason1 aMishra, Bhoopesh0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Aug. 31,  p.129899-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.129899  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010400173520177600277592002802053650002302081650002702104650001502131650002002146650002102166650001202187650001002199650001602209650002302225650001602248653002102264653002502285653003302310653003602343653003202379653003102411700002402442700002102466700002302487700002102510700002202531700002102553773010602574856008502680852000902765655001202774IND60735497820221119132436.0211001e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073549782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2021.1091022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColefax, Andrew P.10aIdentifying optimal wavelengths to maximise the detection rates of marine fauna from aerial surveys  aAerial surveys are increasingly used for assessing the presence and abundance of many large faunal species. However, detection rates often suffer significant sightability errors. Using sensors that capture thermal infrared can sometimes improve the detectability of fauna by increasing the contrast of target animals against their surrounds. However, there are several situations where this does not work well. Submerged fauna in marine environments are one example, and where the detection error can be substantial. To identify what wavelength selection might enhance detectability rates beyond standard cameras, we used a drone-based hyperspectral sensor to measure the reflectance of 64 animals and their corresponding surrounds. Fauna included white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), and various other species of ray (Rhinoptera neglecta, Aetobatus narinari, Rhynchobatus australiae) and fish (Seriola lalandi). Data were analysed using Generalized Additive Mixed-Models (GAMM) to compare the difference in spectral reflectance between fauna and their surrounds. The GAMMs showed little difference between submerged fauna groups, but indicated that a band of wavelengths between 514 and 554 nm provided the greatest contrast between fauna and their surrounding backgrounds. This was also consistent across the range of environmental conditions. We contend that restricting the spectral input to a standard high-resolution camera, or focusing on the channels that accentuate the green colours in post-processing, will likely result in increased accuracy in the detection of submerged fauna. This approach may also be applied to fauna surveys in other landscapes, particularly where the use of thermal sensors is not appropriate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAetobatus narinari 3aCarcharodon carcharias 3aRhinoptera 3aSeriola lalandi 3aTursiops aduncus 3acameras 3afauna 3areflectance 3astatistical models 3awavelengths 0aUAV fauna survey 0aMarine aerial survey 0aAvailability perception bias 0aGAMM generalized additive model 0aDrone hyperspectral sensing 0aMarine megafauna detection1 aKelaher, Brendan P.1 aWalsh, Andrew J.1 aPurcell, Cormac R.1 aPagendam, Dan E.1 aCagnazzi, Daniele1 aButcher, Paul A.0 tBiological conservation.g2021 May, v. 257 p.109102-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2021.1091023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002900188245008500217300001300302506007600315520147500391592002801866506003701894650002501931650002201956650001901978650001901997650001102016650002302027650001602050650001502066650001502081650003302096650001102129650001002140650001802150650001302168650002002181650001802201650001702219650001502236651001102251700002502262700002802287773015302315856008202468852000902550655001202559IND60119352420221207071750.0191003e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011935242DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-014-4163-12doi7 aPMC67635102pmcid7 a254927072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocha, Francisco Cleiton10aWater quality index calculated from biological, physical and chemical attributes  ap. 4163.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo ensure a safe drinking water supply, it is necessary to protect water quality. To classify the suitability of the Orós Reservoir (Northeast of Brazil) water for human consumption, a Water Quality Index (WQI) was enhanced and refined through a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Samples were collected bi-monthly at seven points (P1 – P7) from July 2009 to July 2011. Samples were analysed for 29 physico-chemical attributes and 4 macroinvertebrate metrics associated with the macrophytes Pistia stratiotes and Eichhornia crassipes. PCA allowed us to reduce the number of attributes from 33 to 12, and 85.32 % of the variance was explained in five dimensions (C1 – C5). Components C1 and C3 were related to water-soluble salts and reflect the weathering process, while C2 was related to surface runoff. C4 was associated with macroinvertebrate diversity, represented by ten pollution-resistant families. C5 was related to the nutrient phosphorus, an indicator of the degree of eutrophication. The mean values for the WQIs ranged from 49 to 65 (rated as fair), indicating that water can be used for human consumption after treatment. The lowest values for the WQI were recorded at the entry points to the reservoir (P3, P1, P5, and P4), while the best WQIs were recorded at the exit points (P6 and P7), highlighting the reservoir’s purification ability. The proposed WQI adequately expressed water quality, and can be used for monitoring surface water quality.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aPistia stratiotes 3adrinking water 3aeutrophication 3ahumans 3amacroinvertebrates 3amacrophytes 3amonitoring 3aphosphorus 3aprincipal component analysis 3arunoff 3asalts 3asurface water 3avariance 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3awater supply 3aweathering 3aBrazil1 aAndrade, Eunice Maia1 aLopes, Fernando Bezerra0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2015 Jan., v. 187, no. 1 p.4163-4163dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-4163-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245009400207300001400301500001500315506007600330520085900406592002801265506003701293650000901330650001501339650001101354650003101365650004401396650002401440650002501464650001801489650002601507650001401533650001001547653003301557700001401590700001801604700001401622700001501636700001201651700002001663700001801683773008301701856008101784852000901865655001201874IND60440731820221207104454.0151024e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044073182DNAL7 a10.1007/s13337-015-0250-32doi7 aPMC45850582pmcid7 a264361272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Feng-Xue10aSafety of inoculation of bovine parainfluenza virus 3 as potential vaccine vector in pigs  ap. 89-91.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV3) is one of the most important respiratory pathogens in cattle. One BPIV3, named NM09, was isolated from cattle suffering from severe respiratory diseases in 2009. BPIV3 is a potential recombinant vaccine vector. To investigate whether NM09 can infect pigs and determine BPIV3 defense in these animals, BPIV3 antibody-free pigs were inoculated intramuscularly with the BPIV3 NM09 strain in a continuous passage. Clinical signs were observed each day after inoculation. Viral nucleic acid was detected in nasal and anal secretions. Results showed that virus-inoculated pigs displayed few observable clinical signs related to respiratory diseases. The antibody was identified, but the virus could not be detected in the second continuous passage in pigs. Thus, BPIV3 is a potential vaccine vector for genetic engineering.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3anose 3aantibodies 3acattle 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3agenetic engineering 3arecombinant vaccines 3anucleic acids 3aBovine respirovirus 3 3apathogens 3aswine 0aBovine parainfluenza virus 31 aLiu, Ying1 aZhu, Hong-wei1 aLiu, Xing1 aYang, Yong1 aSun, Na1 aCheng, Shi-Peng1 aWen, Yong-Jun0 tVirusDis..g2015 June, v. 26, no. 1-2 p.89-91dSpringer Indiax2347-35847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13337-015-0250-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245009600161300001600257520124500273592002801518650001201546650001801558650000901576650002801585650001001613650001601623650000701639650001401646650002201660650001701682650001601699651001001715653001501725653001401740653001201754700001501766700001601781700001701797700001901814773012401833856008301957852000902040655001202049IND60561808320221117222300.0190815e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056180832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2017.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Yan10aSlow pyrolysis as a measure for rapidly treating cow manure and the biochar characteristics  ap. 355-361.  aIt is imperative to develop an innovative method for quickly treating the large volume of cow manure produced in intensive cow farms in China, particularly in Inner Mongolia. In this study, cow manure was slowly pyrolyzed at different temperatures (300°C, 400°C, 500°C, and 700°C for 2h) and with retention times (0.5h, 1h, and 2h at 400°C). The results showed that pH, electrical conductivity (EC), basic functional groups, and aromaticity enhanced, but both carboxyl functional groups and aliphaticity decreased when temperature increased from 300°C to 500°C and retention time increased from 0.5 to 1h at 400°C. However, most of these parameters of the collected biochars changed little when temperature increased from 500°C to 700°C and retention time increased from 1h to 2h at 400°C, implying that the pyrolysis reached to relative stable status. These results suggested that the slow pyrolysis might be as a rapid measure for treating cow manure and producing biochar. The proper pyrolysis conditions could be 500°C for 1–2h, considering the relative high and stable characters of the harvested biochar. Further work is necessary to determine the impacts of the biochar on soil quality while used as a soil conditioner.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3acattle manure 3acows 3aelectrical conductivity 3afarms 3amethodology 3apH 3apyrolysis 3asoil conditioners 3asoil quality 3atemperature 3aChina 0aCow manure 0aPyrolysis 0aBiochar1 aLin, Qimei1 aXu, Yunqing1 aGuitong, Li,1 aZhao, Xiaorong0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2017 Mar., v. 124 p.355-361dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2017.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245022800182300001600410520102300426592002801449650001101477650002001488650001001508650002601518650002301544650001901567650001401586650001801600650001501618650001301633650001801646650002701664650001601691650003101707650001401738650003801752651001001790651001001800700001901810773010101829852000901930856008101939930003302020946001102053655001202064IND60439151120221117234039.0151024e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043915112DNAL7 a175081272pmid7 a10.1007/s10265-007-0075-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSudarmono, 10aSpeciation process of Salvia isensis (Lamiaceae), a species endemic to serpentine areas in the Ise-Tokai district, Japan, from the viewpoint of the contradictory phylogenetic trees generated from chloroplast and nuclear DNA  ap. 483-490.  aTo understand the speciation process of Salvia isensis (Lamiaceae), a species endemic to a special environment (serpentine areas in the Ise-Tokai district, central Honshu, Japan), chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) were employed to analyze the phylogenetic relationships of S. isensis with related species in Japan. Allozymic polymorphisms were also used to analyze genetic relationships among Salvia species. A contradiction in the phylogenetic positions of species studied was detected when phylogenetic trees were constructed using cpDNA or nrDNA, i.e., S. isensis was a sister to the other species in phylogenetic trees generated from cpDNA, while S. japonica was a sister to the other species in the case of nrDNA. Genetic relationships between Salvia species estimated from allozymic polymorphisms did not contradict to the topology for nrDNA. Using the present results, the speciation process of S. isensis is discussed with regard to introgressive gene exchanges between related species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalvia 3achloroplast DNA 3agenes 3agenetic relationships 3aindigenous species 3anuclear genome 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3aserpentine 3atopology 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Nucleusxgenetics 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Chloroplastxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aSalviaxclassificationxgenetics. 3aJapan 0aJapan1 aOkada, Hiroshi0 tJournal of plant research.g2007 July, v. 120, no. 4 p.483-490dSpringer-Verlagx0918-94407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-007-0075-23Available from publisher's site  a20070702b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03062naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245015200161520148100313592002801794650003101822650001601853650001901869650002701888650001901915650002001934650001501954650001901969650001401988650001402002650000702016650001502023650001502038650002002053653003202073653003102105653002502136653001902161653001902180653002002199700001802219700001502237700001202252700001402264700001902278700001702297700001502314773011202329856008202441852000902523655001202532IND60774556420221120135417.0220502e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077455642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2022.1084302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Jing10aCharacteristics of immobilized dye-decolorizing peroxidase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and application to the bioremediation of dyeing effluent  aDyeing effluent is a major source of aquatic pollution, necessitating novel remediation techniques. In this paper, dopamine-modified, chitosan-coated, halloysite nanotube (HNT) porous microspheres, which are biomimetic entities with a 3D nest-like architecture, were used as a matrix to immobilize dye-decolorizing peroxidase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (BaDyP). The porous HNT microspheres showed excellent loading capacity for BaDyP—as high as 250.8 mg/g. Compared with free BaDyP, immobilized BaDyP exhibited better stability over a wide range of pHs and temperatures. At 25 ℃, pH 4.5, and with 2, 2′-azinobis (3-ethylbezthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) as an oxidation substrate, the Michaelis constant of immobilized BaDyP was 0.70 mM. The reusability of BaDyP is enhanced by immobilization and approximately 57.6% of the initial activity was retained after six recycling batches. Immobilized BaDyP showed great ability to decolorize various dyes and remediate dyeing effluents. It removed 52.77% of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and provided 93.93% decolorization (Hazen Units; 89.96% in terms of ADMI), accompanied by significant detoxification within a 72-h incubation period. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using immobilized BaDyP on modified HNTs for the bioremediation of dyeing wastewater. The application of HNT-immobilized BaDyP to the continuous treatment of dyeing effluents in fixed bed reactors will be the next focus of research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 3abiomimetics 3abioremediation 3achemical oxygen demand 3adecolorization 3aenzyme kinetics 3ahalloysite 3amicroparticles 3ananotubes 3aoxidation 3apH 3aperoxidase 3awastewater 3awater pollution 0aDye-decolorizing peroxidase 0aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 0aHalloysite nanotubes 0aImmobilization 0aBioremediation 0aDyeing effluent1 aHuo, Jingjing1 aWang, Quan1 aLiu, Ze1 aLi, Shuna1 aWang, Shuxiang1 aGuo, Weiting1 aLi, Hongya0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2022 May, v. 182 p.108430-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2022.1084303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03428naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245016400183300001400347520153600361592002801897650002701925650001001952650001001962650001201972650001401984650001001998650001102008650001002019650001302029650002202042650002402064650002102088650000902109650002402118650001002142650001202152650003002164650003602194650001102230650002702241650000902268650004902277650000902326650002502335650002402360650003802384650002402422651001002446700001902456700001702475700001802492700001702510700001902527700001402546700001902560773010902579856008102688852000902769655001202778IND50060385320221119151101.0141111e20130109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006038532DNAL7 a231237952pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2012.09.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Li-hua10aSex dependent pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution and excretion of peimine and peiminine in rats assessed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 77-84.  aETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Fritillaria thunbergii Miq. has been traditionally used in China as antitussive and expectorant herbs, and newly used in the clinical treatment of leukemia in recent years. AIM: To investigate whether gender exerted a significant influence on the pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution and excretion of peimine and peiminine in Sprague-Dawley rats who were given a single oral administration of 4.25g/kg Fritillaria thunbergii Miq. extract. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned into two groups based on the gender and orally administered 4.25g/kg Fritillaria thunbergii Miq. extract for each individual pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution and excretion study. RESULTS: Compared with female rats, peimine and peiminine were eliminated slowly from male rat plasma, and significant gender-related differences were observed in the pharmacokinetic parameters. Drug blood and tissue levels in male rats were significantly higher than the female counterparts except for several tissues, such as fat, muscle and skin. Gender also exerted a significant influence on the urine excretion but such effect was not observed in the feces excretion study. CONCLUSIONS: Gender exerted a significant influence on the pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution and urine excretion of peimine and peiminine. It is assumed that the sex-associated differences of peimine and peiminine in rats might be mainly result from sex-dependent expression and activity of drug metabolism enzymes and P-glycoprotein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFritillaria thunbergii 3ablood 3adrugs 3aenzymes 3aexcretion 3afeces 3agender 3aherbs 3aleukemia 3amass spectrometry 3aoral administration 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 3atissue distribution 3aurine 2aAnimals 2aCevanesxpharmacokinetics 2aChromatography, Liquidxmethods 2aFemale 2aFritillariaxchemistry 2aMale 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxpharmacokinetics. 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSex Characteristics 2aTandem Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aTissue Distribution 3aChina1 aZhang, Hui-min1 aGuan, Zhi-yu1 aZhu, Wei-feng1 aYi, Wen-jiao1 aGuan, Yong-mei1 aWang, Sen1 aLiu, Hong-ning0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2013 Jan. 9, v. 145, no. 1 p.77-84dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2012.09.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009900171520174800270592002802018650001702046650001502063650001502078650001302093653002802106653001602134653002302150653001202173653002102185653002802206653001502234653001802249700002902267700002702296700002002323700001702343700001902360700002002379773010602399856008502505852000902590655001202599IND60735498020221119132450.0211001e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073549802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2021.1091172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJosefsson, Jonas10aCompensating for lost nature values through biodiversity offsetting – Where is the evidence?  aBiodiversity offsetting is becoming a principal instrument for managing biodiversity and ecosystem services in society. Still, it is unclear whether biodiversity offsetting can fully mitigate losses to natural values. When reviewing published studies on offsetting, we found only 40 evaluations with primary outcome data on biodiversity or ecosystem services. Among these, we found no evidence that biodiversity gains from offsets actually compensate for development-associated losses, because losses were never estimated. The failure to quantify losses is troubling from a conservation perspective, as applying offsets that do not match up losses and gains will result in continued net loss of biodiversity. Instead, most studies (76%) included only reference habitats as comparator and evaluated singular taxa of biodiversity (66%), and rarely ecosystem services (ES). The overall meta-analysed effect size from reference habitat comparisons suggests that offsets perform poorly when contrasted to these habitats. There was a strong bias towards North American freshwater biomes, with only six published evaluations from terrestrial habitats. The bias and small number of studies precluded any detailed meta-analytical enquiries, such as identification of main drivers of outcomes. For biodiversity offsetting to be an important instrument for halting biodiversity losses, all actions must build on solid scientific evidence, and our review show that this evidence base is yet not in place. We conclude that there is a strong need for rigorous evaluation of offsetting projects, and to this end governments could request long-term monitoring programmes as an integral part of offsetting actions and make data openly available for assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aecosystems 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 0aBiodiversity offsetting 0aNo net loss 0aEcosystem services 0aHabitat 0aSpecies richness 0aEcological compensation 0aEvaluation 0aMeta-analysis1 aWidenfalk, Lina Ahlbäck1 aBlicharska, Malgorzata1 aHedblom, Marcus1 aPärt, Tomas1 aRanius, Thomas1 aÖckinger, Erik0 tBiological conservation.g2021 May, v. 257 p.109117-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2021.1091173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245014500170300001600315520110800331592002801439650002001467650001801487650001301505650001401518650001001532650002401542650001701566650002001583650001701603650001401620650001101634650001601645650001101661650002901672650001901701650004301720650000901763650002801772650001801800700002401818700002501842700001901867773009801886856008101984852000902065655001202074IND60088727820221121042155.0141102e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008872782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2012.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaturi, Gunaranjan10aEffects of early dietary intervention with a fermentable fibre on colonic microbiota activity and mucin gene expression in newly weaned rats  ap. 520-530.  aColonic microbiota composition and metabolic processes were investigated after modifying the diet immediately post-weaning in rats. Three-week old Sprague–Dawley rats were fed cellulose or inulin diet for 0day (d), 7d or 14d. Real-time PCR quantification showed significantly higher colonic Bifidobacterium spp. in rats fed inulin on d7 and d14. Inulin was effective in increasing the total bacteria, Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas group and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, while decreasing Lactobacillus spp. Higher concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs: acetic, butyric and propionic acids), lactic acid and succinic acid were observed in inulin-fed rats. Inulin ingestion altered colonic mucin (MUC)-3 gene expression, and increased the colon crypt depth with more goblet cells per crypt. Significant positive correlations between SCFAs concentrations and MUC3 expression were observed. Dietary supplementation with inulin altered microbiota composition, and their fermentation end-products may have aided in modifying mucin gene expression and morphology in the colon of young rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium 3aLactobacillus 3abacteria 3acellulose 3acolon 3adietary supplements 3afermentation 3agene expression 3agoblet cells 3aingestion 3ainulin 3alactic acid 3amucins 3anutritional intervention 3apropionic acid 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3ashort chain fatty acids 3asuccinic acid1 aButts, Christine A.1 aStoklosinski, Halina1 aAnsell, Juliet0 tJournal of functional foods.g2012 Apr., v. 4, no. 2 p.520-530dElsevier Ltdx1756-46467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2012.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010200169300001300271520132100284592002801605650001601633650003301649650001401682650002101696651001101717651001801728700002001746700002401766700002201790700001801812773009701830856008101927852000902008655001202017IND60119352720221122200143.0150125e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011935272DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-014-1016-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiimatainen, Kare10aCortinarius, subgenus Telamonia, section Disjungendi, cryptic species in North America and Europe  ap. 1016.  aCortinarius disjungendus and morphologically similar species were studied using ITS sequences of nine type collections and 18 specimens in the study group, as well as 13 sequences from public sequence repositories, including sequences of three type specimens. In addition, previously published rpb2 sequences were used to provide the phylogenetic position of species in the subgenus Telamonia. Based on these results, the new section Disjungendi, subgenus Telamonia, is proposed. Six species belong to this section: C. claroplaniusculus, C. disjungendus, C. disjungendulus, C. olididisjungendus, C. orasericeus, and C. piceidisjungendus. Of these, C. disjungendus, C. disjungendulus, and C. claroplaniusculus are to date only known from Europe, whereas the others occur both in North America and Europe. Based on ITS sequences, three of the six species had taxonomic synonyms: C. claroplaniusculus (synonym C. hymenoluctus and C. planodepressus), C. disjungendus (synonyms C. remauxii, C. conicosordescens, and C. solivagus), and C. orasericeus (synonym C. brunneofulvus f. myrtillophilus). This study demonstrates how difficult it can be to identify species only on the basis of morphology, and emphasizes the importance of molecular studies of type and of other specimens, particularly in groups with cryptic taxa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCortinarius 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aphylogeny 3atype collections 3aEurope 3aNorth America1 aNiskanen, Tuula1 aAmmirati, Joseph F.1 aKytövuori, Ilkka1 aDima, Bálint0 tMycological progress.g2015 Jan., v. 14, no. 1 p.1016-1016dSpringer-Verlagx1617-416X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11557-014-1016-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245014900184300001600333520144000349592002801789650001801817650002001835650001501855650001901870650002501889650001101914650001401925650001801939650002101957650002701978650002502005650005702030650001402087650002302101650002002124773010102144852000902245856008102254930003302335946001102368655001202379IND60439151320221117234021.0151024e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043915132DNAL7 a175301652pmid7 a10.1007/s10265-007-0090-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTokuoka, Toru10aMolecular phylogenetic analysis of Euphorbiaceae sensu stricto based on plastid and nuclear DNA sequences and ovule and seed character evolution  ap. 511-522.  aA phylogenetic analysis of Euphorbiaceae sensu stricto is presented using sequences from rbcL, atpB, matK and 18S rDNA from 85 species and 83 genera. The combined analysis of four molecular markers resulted in only one most parsimonious tree and also generated new supported clades, which include Euphorbioideae + Acalyphoideae s.s., subclades A2 + A3, subclades A5 + A6 and a clade uniting subclades A2–A8 within Acalyphoideae s.s. A palisadal exotegmen is a possible synapomorphy for all the Euphorbiaceae, except for the subfamily Peroideae. The presence of vascular bundles in the inner integument and a thick inner integument were shown to be synapomorphies for the clade of inaperturate and articulated crotonoids and for the large clade of Euphorbioideae, Acalyphoideae s.s., inaperturate and articulated crotonoids, respectively. Characters of the aril and vascular bundles in the outer integument are discussed. The selected embryological characters were seen to be highly correlated with the molecular phylogeny. When the results of molecular phylogenetic analysis of a previous study and this study were adjusted along with the selected embryological characters, all clades within Euphorbiaceae were supported except for a clade comprising Euphorbioideae + Acalyphoideae s.s. + inaperturate crotonoids + articulated crotonoids + Adenoclineae s.l. and a clade uniting subclades A4–A8 within Acalyphoideae s.s.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuphorbiaceae 3agenetic markers 3aintegument 3anuclear genome 3anucleotide sequences 3aovules 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3avascular bundles 2aCell Nucleusxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aEuphorbiaceaexclassificationxembryologyxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlastidsxgenetics 2aSeedsxgenetics0 tJournal of plant research.g2007 July, v. 120, no. 4 p.511-522dSpringer-Verlagx0918-94407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-007-0090-33Available from publisher's site  a20070702b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02284naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245011200174520089400286592002801180650002501208650001501233650002201248650003001270650002701300650002501327650000701352650002101359650002001380651001301400653003001413653002401443653002501467653002101492653002101513700003501534700002601569700002301595700002301618773011801641856008201759852000901841655001201850IND60673134520221121063655.0200210e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067313452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2019.1005022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaid, Nor Sakinah Mohd10aPhytoremediation of real coffee industry effluent through a continuous two-stage constructed wetland system  aThis study was conducted to determine the phytoremediation performance of a continuous two-stage constructed wetland system using two tropical plants native to Malaysia (Phragmites karka and Eichhornia crassipes) to remove contaminants from real coffee industry effluent. The coffee effluent used in this study had a pH value of 4.4 with total suspended solids of 399.3 mg/L, colour of 1730 ADMI, and COD and BOD values of 13,000 and 1720 mg/L, respectively. The system was fed continuously with coffee industry effluent at a volumetric flowrate of 4.1 L/day to maintain the hydraulic retention time at 3 days for Phragmites karka and 4 days for Eichhornia crassipes. The two-stage plant system was capable of removing 94%, 79% and 95% of suspended solids, colour and COD, respectively.

Multi-purpose computer models have been developed to predict the fate of spilled oil. These models include databases of pseudo-components from distillation cut analysis for hundreds of oils, and have been used for guiding response action, damage assessment, and contingency planning for marine oil spills. However, these models are unable to simulate the details of deep-water, high-pressure chemistry. We present a new procedure to calculate the chemical properties necessary for such simulations that we validate with 614 oils from the ADIOS oil library. The calculated properties agree within 20.4% with average values obtained from data for measured compounds, for 90% of the chemical properties. This enables equation-of-state calculations of dead oil density, viscosity, and interfacial tension. This procedure enables development of comprehensive oil spill models to predict the behavior of petroleum fluids in the deep sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer simulation 3adatabases 3adistillation 3aequations 3amarine ecosystems 3amodels 3aoil spills 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aphysicochemical properties 3aplanning 3asurface tension 3aviscosity 3awater pollution 0aOil spill model 0aTAMOC 0aPseudo-component 0aCritical properties 0aGNOME 0aADIOS1 aDissanayake, Anusha L.1 aDaniels, Meghan M.1 aBarker, Christopher H.1 aLehr, William1 aSocolofsky, Scott A.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2018 Dec., v. 137 p.627-637dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.10.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245014000168520158300308592002801891650001801919650002001937650001801957650001601975650002401991650001502015650001402030650000902044650002002053650002002073650001602093650001602109653003602125653001402161653002102175653001402196653001602210700001702226700001802243700001502261700001602276700001902292700002002311700001802331773010602349856008702455852000902542655001202551IND60790552720221118150044.0221004e20221120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079055272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1299892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Xiaodi10aPromoting the utilization efficiency of agrochemicals via short-chain nonionic fluorinated synergist: Strategies and working mechanisms  aWastage of agrochemicals results in considerable environmental pollution and economic loss. The use of trisiloxane surfactants as synergists has proven to allow for reduction in agrochemical application rates, but these surfactants show poor resistance to hydrolysis, which can attenuate their synergistic effects. Herein we report the development of a short-chain nonionic fluorinated surfactant, designated mPEG200-TEOH-6, as a novel agrochemical synergist. In contrast to conventional long-fluorocarbon chain surfactants, our short-chain fluorinated surfactant can avoid the risk of persistence and bioaccumulation in the environment. We determined the thermal storage stability of mPEG200-TEOH-6 and investigated its effects on the static surface tension, dynamic surface tension, contact angle, and thermal storage stability of four agrochemicals solutions, which explained its synergistic efficacy. In addition, we compared its effects with those of the commercial surfactant Silwet 408. Both mPEG200-TEOH-6 and Silwet 408 clearly improved the utilization efficiency of the agrochemicals, but mPEG200-TEOH-6 displayed substantially greater synergistic efficiency than Silwet 408; specifically, the former markedly decreased the static surface tension of agrochemical solutions, increased their diffusivity and wettability, and decreased their LC₅₀ values. Strikingly, we found that mPEG200-TEOH-6 was more stable than Silwet 408 under thermal storage conditions. The result presented herein can be used to guide the use of surfactants and agrochemicals in agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagrochemicals 3abioaccumulation 3acontact angle 3adiffusivity 3afinancial economics 3ahydrolysis 3apollution 3arisk 3astorage quality 3asurface tension 3asurfactants 3awettability 0aNonionic fluorinated surfactant 0aSynergist 0aSurface activity 0aStability 0aBioactivity1 aWang, Ruiguo1 aZeng, Mengdie1 aLiu, Yuxiu1 aKou, Junjie1 aSong, Hongjian1 aZhang, Jingjing1 aWang, Qingmin0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Nov. 20, v. 653 p.129989-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1299893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01800naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245010700155300001800262520077500280592002801055650001101083650002301094650002301117650001301140650002001153650002201173650001301195650001101208700002101219700002101240773011701261856007501378852000901453655001201462IND60550126220221119150538.0160909e20130503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055012622DNAL7 a10.1021/jo40015422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarkey, Lyn10aNative Chemical Ligation,Thiol–Ene Click: A Methodology for the Synthesis of Functionalized Peptides  ap. 4270-4277.  aThe sequential combination of native chemical ligation and thiol–ene radical chemistry (NCL-TEC) on the resulting cysteine thiol has been investigated as a methodology for rapidly accessing functionalized peptides. Three sequential cycles of native chemical ligation and subsequent thiyl radical reactions (including a free-radical-mediated desulfurization reaction) were carried out on a peptide backbone demonstrating the iterative nature of this process. The versatility of the thiyl radical reaction at cysteine was demonstrated through the introduction of a number of different side chains including an amino acid derivative, a carbohydrate group, and an alkyl azide. Conditions were developed that allowed the sequential NCL-TEC process to proceed in high yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aazides 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3acysteine 3adesulfurization 3aorganic chemistry 3apeptides 3athiols1 aGiordani, Silvia1 aScanlan, Eoin M.0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2013 May 03, v. 78, no. 9 p.4270-4277dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo40015423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007900166300001800245520124700263592002801510596006301538596007201601650001901673650002101692650001401713650002201727650002201749650000901771650001801780650002101798650002101819650001501840700001901855700001601874700005501890700001501945773011101960856008202071852000902153655001202162IND60685052620221119204657.0200227e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068505262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-019-02933-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Liangjun10aMorphologies and properties of Juncus effusus fiber after alkali treatment  ap. 1909-1920.  aJuncus effusus (JE) is a natural cellulose fiber with unique three-dimensional network structure and interconnected channels. However, to the best of knowledge, no efforts have been dedicated to the influence of alkali treatment on the morphologies and properties of the JE fibers, which can contribute to the removal of dyes from wastewater. Herein, the natural cellulose JE fibers were subjected to alkali treatment various concentrations of NaOH. The mechanical, chemical, thermal, wetting, and surface morphological properties of alkali-treated JE fibers were examined using a variety of experimental techniques, confirming that the chemical and mechanical properties of the JE fibers were enhanced after alkali treatment. Fibers treated with 4% w/v NaOH exhibited a maximum tensile strength of 200.63 ± 36.38 kPa and elongation at break of 12.10% ± 2.69%. During alkali treatment, amorphous material such as hemicellulose was partial removed and the crystallinity index of the alkali-treated JE fibers was enhanced. The treated fibers exhibited a rough morphology owing to the removal of hemicelluloses. Future studies will mainly focus on the applicability of alkali-treated JE fibers for the removal of dyes from wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data  a51773158cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  aCCFALY2018-2-4cChina Chemical Fibers Association, Lv Yu Foundation 3aJuncus effusus 3aalkali treatment 3acellulose 3acellulosic fibers 3acrystal structure 3adyes 3ahemicellulose 3asodium hydroxide 3atensile strength 3awastewater1 aZhang, Chunhua1 aWang, Aming1 aWang, Yunli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1514-67021 aXu, Weilin0 tCellulose.g2020 Mar., v. 27, no. 4 p.1909-1920dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02933-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245014800166300001600314520126800330592002801598650001101626650001101637650001801648650001201666650003301678650001401711650000901725650001601734650001601750650001701766650000901783650001701792650002301809650001801832650001601850650001101866650001601877650001101893650001101904651001701915653001701932653001101949653001601960653001101976653001301987653001702000653002302017700005702040700001902097700001902116700001802135773011202153856008702265852000902352655001202361IND60525263520221123044549.0190318e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052526352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2015.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarli, J.10aSeasonal reproduction in the Arabian spiny mouse, Acomys dimidiatus (Rodentia: Muridae) from Saudi Arabia: The role of rainfall and temperature  ap. 352-359.  aIn deserts where unpredictable rainfall arises and a large variation in temperature occurs, this poses severe energetic and water related constraints on reproduction in small mammals and makes the use of photoperiod as cue for reproduction unreliable. In the present study, the gonad morphometrics, gonadal histology and endocrine profiles of the Arabian spiny mouse (Acomys dimidiatus) were studied over 12 consecutive months in a field population from western Saudi Arabia in an attempt to assess the seasonality of reproduction and gain insights into the environmental cues that may trigger reproduction in this species. Although sperm was present throughout the year, most reproductive parameters exhibited a seasonal pattern with a minimum in winter in both sexes and pregnancies were observed from spring to autumn. Whereas testes volume, the number of corpora lutea and progesterone levels were correlated with temperature, all other reproductive parameters were correlated with rainfall. Thus, it appears that A. dimidiatus ceases to breed during winter and uses rainfall as an environmental cue to initiate reproduction in the study area.

In response to infection of N. rileyi, Spodoptera exigua larvae significantly induced catalytic activity of phospholipase A₂ (PLA₂) in three immune-associated tissues, namely hemocytes, fat body, and hemolymph plasma. Furthermore, the infected S. exigua larvae induced transcription of several antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes. Two entomopathogenic bacteria, Xenorhabdus nematophila (Xn) and Photorhabdus temperata subsp. temperata (Ptt), possessed specific PLA₂-inhibitory activities and their culture broths significantly inhibited the enzyme activities in hemocytes, fat body, and plasma of S. exigua. In addition, the bacterial metabolites inhibited transcription of AMP genes in S. exigua that would normally respond to the immune challenge by N. rileyi. The immunosuppressive effect of Xn or Ptt bacterial broth resulted in significant enhancement of the fungal pathogenicity against late instar larvae of S. exigua and Plutella xylostella. The effect of such a mixture was confirmed by field assay against two lepidopteran species. These results suggest that the bacterial and fungal mixture can be applied to develop a novel biopesticide to control lepidopteran species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNomuraea rileyi 3aPhotorhabdus 3aPlutella xylostella 3aSpodoptera exigua 3aXenorhabdus nematophila 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aantimicrobial peptides 3acatalytic activity 3aculture media 3aentomopathogenic bacteria 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3aenzyme activity 3afat body 3agenes 3ahemocytes 3aimmunosuppressive agents 3ainstars 3aintergenic DNA 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alarvae 3ametabolites 3apathogenicity 3aphospholipase A21 aKim, Yonggyun0 tjournal of microbiology.g2012 Aug., v. 50, no. 4 p.644-651dThe Microbiological Society of KoreawJournal:jnl4619042x1225-88737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-012-2108-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012300158300001800281520087200299592002801171650001601199650002801215650002501243650001101268650002201279650001301301650001401314650001601328700002001344700001501364700001801379700001301397700002001410700001801430773011701448856007501565852000901640655001201649IND60550126320221119150612.0160909e20130503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055012632DNAL7 a10.1021/jo400181r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiao, Chun-Bao10aHighly Stereoselective, One-Pot Synthesis of Azetidines and 2,4-Dioxo-1,3-diazabicyclo[3.2.0] Compounds Mediated by I2  ap. 4329-4340.  aWe report here a convenient method to construct polysubstituted azetidines and 2,4-dioxo-1,3-diazabicyclo[3.2.0] compounds with high stereoselectivities in a one-pot reaction mediated by I₂.

Gut flora in human beings regulates various metabolic functionalities, including enzymes, amino acid synthesis, bio-transformation of bile acid, fermentation of non-digestible carbohydrates (NDCs), generation of indoles and polyamines (PAs), and production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Among all the metabolites produced by gut microbiota, SCFAs, the final product of fermentation of dietary fibers by gut microbiota, receive lots of attention from scientists due to their pharmacological and physiological characteristics. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of SCFAs in the interaction between diet, gut microbiota, and host energy metabolism is still needed in-depth research. This review highlights the recent biotechnological advances in applying SCFAs as important metabolites to treat various diseases and maintain colonic health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abile acids 3afermentation 3afood science 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aindoles 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametabolites 3apolyamines 3atherapeutics 0aNutrition 0aintestinal microflora 0ashort-chain fatty acids (SCFAs 0a) 0amolecular response 0apathogenesis 0acolonic health 0ametabolic disorders1 aKhalil, Anees Ahmed1 aRahman, Ubaid-ur-1 aKhalid, Ahood1 aNaz, Saima1 aShariati, Mohammad Ali1 aRebezov, Maksim1 aUrtecho, Ewaldo Zavala1 ade Albuquerque, Ricardo Diego Duarte Galhardo1 aAnwar, Sirajudheen1 aAlamri, Abdulwahab1 aSaini, Ramesh Kumar1 aRengasamy, Kannan R.

Physicochemical characterization (elemental analysis, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ²⁹Si and ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) confirmed the presence of pentafluorobenzamide functionalization on the surface of the silica particles. The pentafluorobenzamide stationary phase proved to be quite versatile as it can be used in two different modes in liquid chromatography: reversed phase and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography. Chromatographic characterizations in both modes confirmed the multiple interactions established by the new stationary phase, such as hydrogen bonding and π‐π and ion‐exchange interactions. The pentafluorobenzamide stationary phase was successfully employed for the separation of nucleosides and antihypertensive drugs under hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography conditions, as well as pesticides and benzodiazepine using reversed phase conditions. The stationary phase showed significant potential when compared with commercial columns.  aPublisher supplied data  a2006/57897‐9cFAPESP  a305762/2014‐1cCNPq  a155838/2014‐8cCNPq  cNational Institute of Advanced Analytical Science and Technology 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aantihypertensive agents 3abenzodiazepines 3acarbon 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3aion exchange 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anucleosides 3apesticides 3aphysicochemical properties 3asilica 3asilicon 3astable isotopes1 aGama, Mariana Roberto1 ada Silva, Gisele Silvestre1 aAlmeida, Wanda Pereira1 aCollins, Carol Hollingworth1 aJardim, Isabel Cristina Sales Fontes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8237-74390 tJournal of separation science.g2018 Oct., v. 41, no. 20 p.3855-3862dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2018005223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245014800166300001600314500001400330500002000344520154500364592002801909650001701937650001101954650001501965650001601980650001601996650001002012650002202022650001002044650001902054650001402073650001202087650000902099650001502108650001602123650001902139650001102158650002702169650001702196700001802213700005702231700003002288700002002318773013502338856007302473852000902546655001202555IND60731274320221123020523.0210319e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073127432DNAL7 a10.1111/ahe.126262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbou‐Elhamd, Alaa S.10aEffect of Khat (Catha edulis Forsk) extract on testicular maturation in pre‐pubertal and pubertal rats: A morphological and biochemical study  ap. 271-283.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe present study aimed at analysing the effect of Khat plant extract on rat testicular development. Thirty‐two weaned male albino rats (4 weeks old) were divided into four groups consisting of eight animals each. While control animals received normal saline, rats of groups I, II and III received 100, 200 and 300 mg Khat extract per kg body weight dissolved in distilled water by oral gavage daily for 8 weeks, respectively. Blood samples were collected in separate heparinized tubes by cardiac puncture from each rat and processed for measuring plasma levels of reproductive hormones LH, FSH, testosterone and prolactin. Five‐µm sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and examined by light microscope. Some sections were immunostained for protamine‐1 representing a biomarker for intact sperm differentiation. The present study clearly demonstrated that Khat extract has a pronounced effect on testicular maturation of developing albino rats at both the morphological and functional levels. Khat‐treated groups revealed a significantly low serum testosterone level and severe impairment of spermatogenesis when compared with control animals. The current findings also verified, for the first time, that the final stages of sperm maturation (spermiogenesis) were strongly impaired after administration of Khat extract to experimental rats particularly at a higher dose (300 mg/kg body weight). This was proved by the very weak, if any, expression of protamine‐1 in the maturing spermatids in Khat‐treated rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCatha edulis 3aalbino 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3aeosin 3alight microscopes 3amales 3aplant extracts 3aprolactin 3apuberty 3arats 3aspermatids 3aspermatozoa 3aspermiogenesis 3atestes 3atesticular development 3atestosterone1 aSumayli, Saud1 aSteger, Klaus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2104-08401 aAli, Asaad Khaled Mohamed1 aZayed, Ahmed E.0 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2021 Mar., v. 50, no. 2 p.271-283dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3895878x0340-20967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ahe.126263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245009800206520162400304592002801928650001301956650001101969650001101980650001701991650001102008650001502019650002602034650001402060650000902074650001602083650002202099650002102121650001102142650001602153653001802169653003902187653001202226653002602238653001902264700002102283700002302304700002802327773009002355856008502445852000902530655001202539IND60751891920221120122442.0211129e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075189192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1220702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYousef, Samy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4846-320210aGasification kinetics of char derived from metallised food packaging plastics waste pyrolysis  aThis research aims to study the gasification kinetics of char derived from metallised food packaging plastics waste (MFPWs) pyrolysis. The research began with treating char mechanically to obtain uniform char powder (MSRPs) composed of aluminium (Al), undecomposed organic fraction, and carbon particles. Subsequently, the MSRPs sample was treated again chemically to remove Al, thus preparing carbon black particles (BCPs). The chemical composition and morphology of the prepared MSRPs and BCPs samples were determined using elemental and proximate analysis, SEM, and XRD. Meanwhile, thermogravimetric analyser (TGA-DTG) was used to study the thermal stability of MSRPs and BCPs samples in different CO₂/N₂ concentrations: 20/80, 25/75, and 30/70 vol%. Once the tested samples stabilized at the target temperature the gasification analysis was started. Finally, gasification kinetics of MSRPs and BCPs samples were investigated using Random Pore Model (RPM) and Hybrid Modified Random Pore Model (HMRPM) based on thermogravimetric results. The proximate results showed that the MSRPs were rich in volatile matter (41.5 wt%), while ash (51.1 wt%) was the major component in the BCPs sample. The TGA-DTG gasification results revealed that MSRPs sample can decompose in three zones with a total weight loss of 45 wt%, while the BCPs samples decomposed linearly with a total weight loss of 22 wt%. The kinetic results showed that Al leaching, gasification temperature, and CO₂/N₂ concentrations have a significant effect on prediction of gasification kinetics parameters and deviation of their fitting curves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acarbon 3aenergy 3agasification 3amodels 3aprediction 3aproximate composition 3apyrolysis 3asoot 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3awastes 3aweight loss 0aPlastic waste 0aMetallised food packaging plastics 0aBiochar 0aGasification kinetics 0aKinetic models1 aEimontas, Justas1 aStriūgas, Nerijus1 aAbdelnaby, Mohammed Ali0 tEnergy.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 239 p.122070-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1220703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01730naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245008400197500002000281520057700301592002800878650001800906650001200924650001000936650002300946650001200969650001500981650001600996651001001012700001901022700001901041700001901060700002101079700005801100773011601158856007301274852000901347655001201356IND60688195020221117044159.0200410e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068819502DNAL7 a10.1111/njb.026342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Yi‐Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5034-005X10aChamaelirium shimentaiense (Melanthiaceae), a new species from Guangdong, China  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aChamaelirium shimentaiense (Melanthiaceae), a new species from Shimentai Nature Reserve, Guangdong Province, China is described.

However, the crystallization mechanism of heavy hydrocarbons has not been solved yet and the applicability of existing nucleation models to heavy hydrocarbons remains unclear. To tackle this mystery, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to examine the crystallization of heavy hydrocarbons thermodynamically and kinetically, and explore the nucleation pathway directly related to the crystallization kinetics. The results indicate that the energy cost of heavy hydrocarbon crystallization is the reduction of Lennard-Jones energy and torsion angle energy, and the crystallization is intrinsically a process of orientational symmetry breaking in heavy hydrocarbon structure. Besides, the orientational symmetry breaking is found to be strongly size-dependent and it is more marked for droplets with less than 1000 molecules. A unified picture was proposed for the crystallization pathway, as manifest in the preordering of surface molecules, surface crystallization and internal layer-by-layer crystallization, respectively. Further, the occurrence of internal crystallization and the orientational symmetry breaking are coupled and competitive. Moreover, a non-classical two-step model for the homogeneous nucleation of heavy hydrocarbon droplets was established.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aliquefaction 3amethane 3amolecular dynamics 3anatural gas 3athermodynamics 0aHeavy hydrocarbon 0aHomogeneous nucleation 0aMolecular simulation1 aCao, Xuewen1 aDing, Gaoya1 aZhang, Pan1 aLiu, Yang1 aBian, Jiang0 tEnergy.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 239 p.122071-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1220713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01446naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245003100165300001100196520061000207592002800817650001000845650001400855650001600869650001500885650003000900700001600930773012200946856007901068852000901147655001201156IND60331784720221120155033.0150727e20150403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6033178472DNAL7 a10.1126/science.aaa81942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandinova, Anna14aThe guardian of the genome  ap. 49.  aThe discovery of the tumor suppressor protein known as p53, and the process of unearthing its functions came about as a result the efforts of thousands of scientists around the globe.

Lacking leaves, the undifferentiated moss sporophyte apex is covered by the calyptra, a cap of maternal gametophyte tissue that is hypothesized to function in desiccation protection. Herein, we compare cuticle development on the calyptra and sporophyte to assess the calyptra’s potential to protect the sporophyte from desiccation. As the first comprehensive study of moss sporophyte cuticle development, this research broadens our perspectives on cuticle development and evolution across embryophytes. • METHODS: Calyptrae and sporophytes at nine developmental stages were collected from a laboratory-grown population of the moss Funaria hygrometrica. Tissues were embedded, sectioned, then examined using transmission electron microscopy. Epidermal cells were measured for thickness of the cuticle layers, cell wall thickness, and lumen size. • Key results: The calyptra cuticle develops precociously and reaches maturity before the sporophyte cuticle. Calyptrae are covered by a four-layered cuticle at all stages, whereas sporophyte cuticle maturation is delayed until sporangium formation. The development and thickening of the sporophyte cuticle occurs in an acropetal wave. • CONCLUSIONS: A multilayered calyptra cuticle at the earliest developmental stages is consistent with its ability to protect the immature sporophyte from desiccation. Young sporophytes lack a complex cuticle and thus may require protection, whereas in older sporophytes a mature cuticle develops. The moss calyptra is not a vestigial structure, but rather the calyptra’s role in preventing desiccation offers a functional explanation for calyptra retention during the 450 Myr of moss evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalyptra 3aFunaria hygrometrica 3acell walls 3aearly development 3aevolution 3agametophytes 3aleaf primordia 3amosses and liverworts 3ashoot meristems 3asporophytes 3atransmission electron microscopy 2aBryopsidaxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aCell Wallxmetabolism 2aDesiccation 2aGerm Cells, Plantxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aPlant Epidermisxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure.1 aGoffinet, Bernard1 aJones, Cynthia S.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2012 Jan., v. 99, no. 1 p.14-22dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.11003113Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100001800182245011500200300001600315500001500331506007600346520104600422592002801468506003701496650002501533650002201558650001001580650002201590650001601612650001301628650001401641650001901655650001001674650002801684650002401712650001201736650004301748650003101791650001201822650002201834650002201856650002801878650002501906650004301931650001601974653001101990700001202001700001902013700001902032700002102051773011402072856008102186852000902267655001202276IND4465548020221207125236.0120502e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446554802DNAL7 a217502292pmid7 aPMC31658932pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.111.1805542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Yongfeng10aMechanisms of Molecular Mimicry of Plant CLE Peptide Ligands by the Parasitic Nematode Globodera rostochiensis  ap. 476-484.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNematodes that parasitize plant roots cause huge economic losses and have few mechanisms for control. Many parasitic nematodes infect plants by reprogramming root development to drive the formation of feeding structures. How nematodes take control of plant development is largely unknown. Here, we identify two host factors involved in the function of a receptor ligand mimic, GrCLE1, secreted by the potato cyst nematode Globodera rostochiensis. GrCLE1 is correctly processed to an active form by host plant proteases. Processed GrCLE1 peptides bind directly to the plant CLE receptors CLV2, BAM1, and BAM2. Involvement of these receptors in the ligand-mimicking process is also supported by the fact that the ability of GrCLE1 peptides to alter plant root development in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is dependent on these receptors. Critically, we also demonstrate that GrCLE1 maturation can be entirely carried out by plant factors and that the availability of CLE processing activity may be essential for successful ligand mimicry.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aplant development 3ahosts 3amolecular mimicry 3aproteinases 3apeptides 3areceptors 3acyst nematodes 3aroots 3aGlobodera rostochiensis 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aFluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aLigands 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMolecular Mimicry 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNematodaxphysiology 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aProteolysis 0aplants1 aNi, Jun1 aDenver, Robert1 aWang, Xiaohong1 aClark, Steven E.0 tPlant physiology.g2011 Sept., v. 157, no. 1 p.476-484dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.111.1805543Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245017700167520119900344592002801543650001501571650002501586650002001611650001501631650001801646650001401664650000901678650002001687650001101707650001601718650001201734650002301746650001701769650001801786650002201804650001001826650001601836653003101852653002501883700001801908700006801926700002001994700002102014773009002035856008502125852000902210655001202219IND60751892120221120111726.0211129e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075189212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1220722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRezk, Hegazy10aOptimal operating parameter determination based on fuzzy logic modeling and marine predators algorithm approaches to improve the methane production via biomass gasification  aThe current study is related to optimizing methane production from steam gasification of palm kernel shell (PKS) utilizing coal bottom ash as a catalyst. Based on the experimental dataset, the fuzzy logic technique, represented by the Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) structure, is used to create a robust model to simulate methane production via biomass gasification. Then, a Marine Predator Algorithm (MPA) is used to determine the optimal operating parameter of the gasification process. The temperature, particle size, CaO/PKS ratio, and coal bottom ash are used as the decision variables, whereas methane production is used as the objective function. The main findings confirmed that the yield of methane gasification reached 52.82 vol% when the associated temperature, particle size, CaO/PKS Ratio, and coal bottom ash are at 678 °C, 0.42 mm, 3.03, and 0.037 wt%, respectively. Accordingly, the proposed strategy provides a better result than the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) methodology reported in the literature. Furthermore, the proposed strategy's output exceeds both the results obtained experimentally and ANOVA methods by 20.26% and 29.69%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aanalysis of variance 3abiogasification 3abottom ash 3acalcium oxide 3acatalysts 3acoal 3adata collection 3aenergy 3afuzzy logic 3amethane 3amethane production 3apalm kernels 3aparticle size 3asimulation models 3asteam 3atemperature 0aMarine predators algorithm 0aBiomass gasification1 aInayat, Abrar1 aAbdelkareem, Mohammad A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3248-98431 aOlabi, Abdul G.1 aNassef, Ahmed M.0 tEnergy.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 239 p.122072-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1220723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245014300160300001800303500002000321520123200341592002801573596005901601596007001660596006501730596009601795596006001891650001501951650004301966650002102009650002502030650001302055650001102068650002702079700001502106700005802121773013402179856007802313852000902391655001202400IND60617702720221116202939.0181025e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061770272DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2018007222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xiuping10aSelective separation and purification of β‐estradiol from marine sediment using an optimized core–shell molecularly imprinted polymer  ap. 3848-3854.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe core–shell molecularly imprinted polymers were optimized to provide reliable connections that allow molecularly imprinted polymers to be fixed on SiO₂ surface for the efficient separation and purification of β‐estradiol from marine sediment for the first time. To achieve the goal, different preparation methods were used and finally the polymer using 3‐methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane as coupling agent exhibited the best result, which further confirmed that 3‐methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane played an indispensable role on improving the inter‐particle connections. An offline molecularly imprinted solid‐phase extraction with high‐performance liquid chromatography method was successfully applied to the isolation and enrichment of β‐estradiol from marine sediment samples with high adsorption capacity, excellent clean‐up efficiency, and great enrichment effect as well as high recovery (>90%) and accuracy (RSD < 8.5%, n = 3). It proved the successful grafting of molecularly imprinted polymers on SiO₂ surface and the applicability of the offline molecularly imprinted solid‐phase extraction method in the selective extraction and enrichment of β‐estradiol from marine sediment.  aPublisher supplied data  a41506092cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aGASI‐03‐01‐02‐01cGlobal Change and Air‐Sea Interaction  aZR2018BD027cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province  a201505034cAssessment of Nanomaterials on Biological and Ecological Effects in Coastal Area  cDevelopment Project of Science and Technology in Weihai 3aadsorption 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amarine sediments 3amolecular imprinting 3apolymers 3asilica 3asolid phase extraction1 aLian, Ziru1 aWang, Jiangtao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8762-120X0 tJournal of separation science.g2018 Oct., v. 41, no. 20 p.3848-3854dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2018007223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02070naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245013000162300001800292520084500310592002801155650001401183650001201197650001301209650001101222650001301233650002401246650001801270650002101288650002001309700002001329700001901349700001701368700001501385700005401400700001601454773011101470856008201581852000901663655001201672IND60685053120221119204648.0200227e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068505312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-019-02951-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Fei10aFlexible wearable graphene/alginate composite non-woven fabric temperature sensor with high sensitivity and anti-interference  ap. 2369-2380.  aThe development of a sensitive flexible wearable temperature sensor has extraordinary significance in the field of human vital signs detection.

In the mammalian circadian system, serotonin is involved in photic as well as nonphotic regulation of circadian rhythms, but its role in this is still controversial. In our previous experiments we characterized the phase response curve for (R)-(+)-8-OH-DPAT under constant light (LL) in mice, and found its shape to resemble the PRC for dark pulses in mice under LL. This suggested to us that the mechanism responsible for the phase shifts of the locomotor activity rhythm induced by 5-HT₁A agonist and by dark pulses may be the same. The aim of this work was to describe the PRC of (R)-(+)-8-OH-DPAT after the application of 5-HT₁A agonist and 4-hour dark pulses in mice under LL in order to elucidate the mechanism of the action of the serotonergic pathway on SCN. The results indicated that the influence of 5-HT₁A agonist and dark pulses on SCN increased during mid subjective day, whereas at 2:00 CT and 10:00 CT the effect decreased. This pattern is connected with the diurnal rhythm of 5-HT in suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN) and midbrain raphe nuclei (MRN), as well as with the complex mechanism of dark-pulse-induced phase shifts of the locomotor activity rhythm under LL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3acircadian rhythm 3alocomotion 3amechanism of action 3amice 3aserotonin 0acircadian system 0aserotonin 0aphase response curves (PRC) 0alocomotor activity rhythm 0adark pulses1 aBarbacka-Surowiak, Grażyna,0 tBiological rhythm research.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 42, no. 1 p.15-25dTaylor & Francisx1744-41797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291010903557203  aDNAL 7aarticle02091naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245009600164300001800260500002000278520081600298592002801114596006201142596006201204596005401266650003401320650001301354650001101367700001901378700002001397700001901417700001401436700005801450773013401508856007801642852000901720655001201729IND60617702820221116203008.0181025e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061770282DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2018005332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuan, Kai‐Jun12aA simple gradient equilibrium method for better separation in countercurrent chromatography  ap. 3863-3870.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe stationary phase retention is one of the most important parameters in countercurrent chromatography. In this work, a simple gradient equilibrium method was developed to further improve the stationary phase retention based on the optimized condition in the traditional equilibrium model. Meanwhile, this novel gradient equilibrium method was used to separate three flavone model compounds and compared with the conventional isocratic equilibrium method to evaluate the separation efficiency. The results show that better resolution or shorter separation time could be achieved with gradient equilibrium compared to isocratic equilibrium. So this novel equilibrium method has enormous potential for obtaining a better separation or saving the separating time in the preparative separation of target compounds.  aPublisher supplied data  a21505144cNational Natural Scientific Foundation of China  a21605149cNational Natural Scientific Foundation of China  a2017YFF0207800cNational Key R&D Program of China 3acountercurrent chromatography 3aflavones 3amodels1 aXi, Xing‐jun1 aHuang, Xin‐Yi1 aDuan, Wen‐Da1 aPei, Dong1 aDi, Duo‐Long1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1472-98580 tJournal of separation science.g2018 Oct., v. 41, no. 20 p.3863-3870dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2018005333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01258naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245001600164300001100180520050700191592002800698650001600726650001300742650001200755650001500767773012200782856007900904852000900983655001200992IND60331784820221120154927.0150727e20150403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6033178482DNAL7 a10.1126/science.aab05332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDixon, Deborah10aObjectified  ap. 51.  aMaterial transformation is a pervasive theme in Cornelia Parker's latest exhibition, which opened with a firework display created by Parker and Konstantin Novoselov, who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2010 for his co-discovery of graphene.

Contrarily to arribadas, little has been published about solitary nesters. This study aimed to expand the knowledge on internesting interval and site fidelity of solitary nesting olive ridleys and to test a possible development of arribada nesting behavior. Data were collected in Sergipe (Brazil) over 125Â km of beach from 10Â°30â²S/36Âº23â²W to 11Â°26â²S/37Âº19â²W, between nesting seasons 2004/2005 and 2006/2007. From 962 tagged females, 173 were seen renesting. The average internesting interval found was longer (22.35Â Â±Â 7.01Â days) than previously described, which might relate to lower water temperatures during the internesting period. Olive ridleys at Sergipe showed high nesting site fidelity, with consecutive nesting events occurring in close proximity, non-randomly and dependently of previous events. Most of the consecutive nests were separated by 4.06â5.59Â km. Development of arribada nesting behavior was not confirmed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeaches 3afemales 3anesting 3anesting sites 3anests 3aolives 3aphilopatry 3asea turtles 3awater temperature 3aBrazil1 aSilva, Augusto C.

Fracturing fluid upward migration from deep gas reservoirs along abandoned wells may pose contamination threats to shallow groundwater. This study describes the novel application of a nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) neural network to estimate fracturing fluid flow rate to shallow aquifers in the presence of an abandoned well. The NAR network is trained using the Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) and Bayesian Regularization (BR) algorithms and the results were compared to identify the optimal network architecture. For NAR-LM model, the coefficient of determination (R²) between measured and predicted values is 0.923 and the mean squared error (MSE) is 4.2 × 10⁻⁴, and the values of R² = 0.944 and MSE = 2.4 × 10⁻⁴ were obtained for the NAR-BR model. The results indicate the robustness and compatibility of NAR-LM and NAR-BR models in predicting fracturing fluid flow rate to shallow aquifers. This study shows that NAR neural networks can be useful and hold considerable potential for assessing the groundwater impacts of unconventional gas development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aalgorithms 3aaquifers 3aarchitecture 3aexhibitions 3aflow 3agroundwater 3ahorizontal wells 3ahydraulic fracturing 3aneural networks 3aprediction1 aTatomir, Alexandru 1 aTaherdangkoo, Mohammad 1 aQiu, Pengxiang 1 aSauter, Martin 0 tWater.g2020 Mar. 17, v. 12, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120308413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001300164245013700177300001800314520099200332592002801324650004001352650002101392650001601413650001201429650001201441650001601453650001201469650002301481650001701504650001201521650001001533650001301543650001501556650002101571650001201592650001101604650001101615650003001626650001201656650001601668650003301684650004901717650002401766650001701790650002401807650002301831650003601854650002201890650002201912650003601934650002601970650002301996700002002019700001802039700001802057700001802075773011602093856004802209852000902257655001202266IND4474174020221117232011.0121003e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447417402DNAL7 a223282612pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-012-9586-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yuan10aImproved Ethanol and Reduced Xylitol Production from Glucose and Xylose Mixtures by the Mutant Strain of Candida shehatae ATCC 22984  ap. 1781-1790.  aA mutant Cs3512, which showed better fermentation of xylose and the mixtures of xylose and glucose, was obtained through mutation of Candida shehatae ATCC 22984 and screening with a medium containing antimycin A and TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride). Cs3512 produced 44.4 g/l of ethanol from 121.3 g/l of xylose, which was 13% higher than that by ATCC 22984. At the same time, xylitol production was reduced by 38% to 10.2 g/l from 16.3 g/l by ATCC 22984. Cs3512 also showed 8% increase in ethanol yield from 0.39 to 0.42 g/g comparing to ATCC 22984 when fermenting the sugar mixture composed of 52.9 g/l glucose and 21.2 g/l xylose. When Cs3512 was used in the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of lime pretreated rice straw via CaCCO (calcium capturing by carbonation) process, it produced ethanol at 77% of the theoretical yield.

Here, treamflow trends for Tuotuohe and Zhimenda sub-basins and relations to temperature and precipitation trends during 1961–2015 were investigated. The modified Mann–Kendall trend test, Pettitt test, wavelet analysis, and multivariate correlation analysis was deployed for this purpose. The temperature and precipitation significantly increased for each sub-basin, and the temperature increase was more significant in Tuotuohe sub-basin as compared to the Zhimenda sub-basin. A statistically significant periodicity of 2–4 years was observed for both sub-basins in different time spans. Higher flow periodicities for Tuotuohe and Zhimenda sub-basin were found after 1991 and 2004, respectively, which indicates that these are the change years of trends in streamflows. The influence of temperature on streamflow is more substantial in Tuotuohe sub-basin, which will ultimately impact the melting of glaciers and snowmelt runoff in this sub-basin. Precipitation plays a more critical role in the Zhimenda streamflow. Precipitation and temperature changes in the headwaters of the Yangtze River will change the streamflow variability, which will ultimately impact the hydropower supply and water resources of the Yangtze Basin. This study contributes to the understanding of the dynamics of the hydrological cycle and may lead to better hydrologic system modeling for downstream water resource developments.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclimate change 3acorrelation 3adynamics 3aflow 3aglaciers 3ahydrologic cycle 3alead 3amelting 3amodels 3aperiodicity 3arunoff 3asnowmelt 3astream flow 3asupply 3atemperature 3avariability 3awater power 3awater resources 3awavelet 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aWang, Genxu 1 aBooij, Martijn  J.1 aOluwafemi, Adeyeri 1 aHashmi, Muhammad  Zia-ur-Rahman1 aAli, Shahid 1 aMunir, Sarfraz 0 tWater.g2020 Mar. 17, v. 12, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120308423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245013200198300001600330500001400346500002000360520123200380592002801612596005901640650002301699650001101722650001201733650001601745650002301761650002001784650001701804650001101821700006301832700001901895700001701914700001901931700002201950773013501972856007302107852000902180655001202189IND60731274820221123021048.0210319e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073127482DNAL7 a10.1111/ahe.126412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYilmaz, Bestami1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0901-312910aMacroanatomic, light and scanning electron microscopic structure of the pecten oculi in northern bald ibis (Geronticus eremita)  ap. 373-378.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEyes are the most primarily required sensory organs during the migration of migratory birds and Northern Bald Ibises (Geronticus eremita) are known to make long migrations. This study examined for the first time the structure of pecten oculi in northern bald ibises by using macroscopic anatomy as well as light and electron microscopic methods. In the study 20 eye globes from 10 adult bald ibises were used. The pecten was of pleated type. As in most bird species, it was located on the optic nerve head and projects into the vitreous from the optic nerve head. The wider basal part was observed to attached to retina and its free apical part was found in camera vitrea bulbi embedded in corpus vitreum. The pecten had 13–14 accordion like pleats lying between the basal and apical parts. In addition to arterial and venous vessels, numerous capillary vessels as well as melanocytes were observed within each pleat. The bridge binding the pleats at the apical part showed a stronger pigmentation compared to other parts of the pecten. The results of the study indicated that the general morphology of pecten oculi in northern bald ibises which is a migratory bird species were similar to that in other diurnal bird species.  aPublisher supplied data  a19336cScientific Research Center of Harran University 3aGeronticus eremita 3aadults 3acameras 3amelanocytes 3amigratory behavior 3amigratory birds 3apigmentation 3aretina1 aDemircioglu, Ismail1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0724-30191 aKorkmaz, Deniz1 aAlan, Aydın1 aYilmaz, Rahsan1 aCiris, Abdulkadir0 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2021 Mar., v. 50, no. 2 p.373-378dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3895878x0340-20967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ahe.126413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03395naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010600172300001800278520180500296592002802101650002502129650001702154650002402171650002002195650002202215650000902237650001302246650002002259650002302279653002502302653003102327653002002358653003002378653002602408653002202434700001502456700001502471700001802486700001702504700002302521700001802544700001702562700001602579700002402595700001702619773014602636856008602782852000902868655001202877IND60784386720221120091243.0220820e20220723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078438672DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2021.18975162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRashidinejad, A.10aAddition of milk to coffee beverages; the effect on functional, nutritional, and sensorial properties  ap. 6132-6152.  aTo date, there exists a debate on the effect of milk added to coffee infusions/beverages concerning the nutritional quality of coffee and the functional properties of its phenolic compounds. Yet, the full nutritional quality and functional properties of a coffee beverage without a significant negative impact on its sensorial profile are highly desired by the consumers. Negative/masking, positive, and neutral effects of milk on the antioxidant activity and bioavailability of coffee phenolics (particularly, chlorogenic acids) have been reported. Some potential factors including the type and amount of milk added, type of coffee beverage, the composition of both milk (protein and fat) and coffee (phenolic compounds), preparation method, assays used to measure antioxidant properties, and sampling size may account for the various reported findings. Interactions between phenolic compounds in coffee and milk proteins could account as the main responsible aspect for the reported masking/negative impact of milk on the antioxidant activity and bioaccessibility/bioavailability of coffee bioactives. However, considering the interactions between milk components and coffee phenolics, which result in the loss of their functionality, the role of milk fat globules and the milk fat globule membrane can also be crucial, but this has not been addressed in the literature so far.HighlightsIn most cases, milk is added to the coffee beverages in several various ways. Effect of milk on the nutritional/functional properties of coffee is controversial. Enough evidence suggests negative effects of milk addition on properties of coffee. Interactions of coffee phenolics and milk proteins could account as the main aspect. The role of milk fat globules and milk fat globule membrane may also be crucial.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abioactive compounds 3abioavailability 3acoffee (beverage) 3amilk 3amilk fat 3anutritive value 3aphenolic compounds 0aAntioxidant activity 0acoffee infusions/beverages 0amilk components 0abioactive bioavailability 0achemical interactions 0achlorogenic acids1 aTarhan, O.1 aRezaei, A.1 aCapanoglu, E.1 aBoostani, S.1 aKhoshnoudi-Nia, S.1 aSamborska, K.1 aGaravand, F.1 aShaddel, R.1 aAkbari-Alavijeh, S.1 aJafari, S.M.0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2022 July 23, v. 62, no. 22 p.6132-6152dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39431x1549-78527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2021.18975163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012700173520184400300592002802144650002502172650001702197650001902214650001602233650001902249650000702268650001902275650001602294650001302310650001202323653003102335653002102366653001902387653003102406653002802437653003202465700001902497773009702516856008502613852000902698655001202707IND60766276720221120141826.0220228e20220415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076627672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2022.1181612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSprocati, Riccardo10aOn the interplay between electromigration and electroosmosis during electrokinetic transport in heterogeneous porous media  aElectrokinetic techniques represent a valuable approach to enhance solute transport, reactant delivery and contaminant degradation in complex environmental matrices, such as contaminated soil and groundwater, and have a great potential for the remediation of many organic and inorganic pollutants. This study investigates the complex interplay between the key electrokinetic transport mechanisms, electromigration and electroosmosis, in physically heterogeneous porous media and its impact on tracer distribution, reactant mixing and degradation efficiency. We perform experiments in a multidimensional setup, considering different types of heterogeneities, injected tracers and reactants, as well as background electrolyte pore water with different chemical composition and pH. We show that EK transport is significantly affected by the physical heterogeneities, due to the interaction between electrokinetic and hydraulic processes, and by the pore water chemistry that plays a key role on the magnitude and spatial distribution of electroosmotic fluxes. The latter affect the overall transport of charged and non-charged species, including the migration velocity of injected plumes, their spatial patterns, spreading and mixing with the background groundwater, and the extent of degradation and the spatio-temporal evolution of reactive zones in the heterogeneous porous media. Process-based numerical modeling allowed us to interpret the experimental observations and to disentangle the coupled effects of physical, chemical and electrostatic processes in the multidimensional, heterogeneous setups. Besides elucidating the mechanisms controlling electrokinetic transport, the results of this study have also important implications for practical field implementation of EK approaches in intrinsically heterogeneous subsurface systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3aelectrolytes 3aelectroosmosis 3agroundwater 3ahydrochemistry 3apH 3apolluted soils 3aremediation 3aresearch 3asolutes 0aElectrokinetic remediation 0aElectromigration 0aElectroosmosis 0aHeterogeneous porous media 0aContaminant degradation 0aReactive transport modeling1 aRolle, Massimo0 tWater research.g2022 Apr. 15, v. 213 p.118161-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.1181613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03376naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245009600162520175500258592002802013650001502041650001702056650001602073650002202089650001102111650002202122650001202144650001102156650001102167650000902178650000902187650001102196650001102207650001302218650001502231650000902246650001102255651001602266653002102282653002002303653001002323653001602333653002102349653002402370653000802394653000802402653000802410653000802418653000802426700006102434700001702495700001302512700006502525773009002590856008502680852000902765655001202774IND60751892520221120111625.0211129e20220101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075189252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1220762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Le10aImpact of wind-hydro dynamics on electricity price: A seasonal spatial econometric analysis  aHydro and wind are both commonly deployed renewable sources of electricity. Wind is intermittent and unpredictable to a large degree. Hydro depends on seasonal rainfall patterns, although storage may offer scope to spread the risk associated with dry seasons. We investigate the impact of intermittent wind generation, coupled with a given hydro capacity, on wholesale electricity prices, accounting for both spatial and seasonal effects. Results from a spatial Durbin model provide evidence of significant negative spill-over effects of wind generation on wholesale nodal prices. After robustness analysis with alternative spatial weight matrices, we provide estimates of the seasonal impact of wind generation on nodal prices using a transmission weight matrix. We evaluate seasonal nodal price effects during dry periods and wet periods in New Zealand's hydro-dominated electricity market. Results show that the price reduction associated with a 10% increase in wind penetration varies across seasons, ranging from $0.48 per MWh in winter in 2012 to $3.05 per MWh in spring. The largest price reduction effect of 3.05 is found for the wet season in spring 2012, but the variance change is 3.6 which is less than 5.24 for the dry season in summer 2012. This evidence reveals that increased wind generation reduces nodal prices, as expected, but also increases the variance in nodal prices, particularly during a dry season. Thus, while a wind-hydro system is shown as a favourable low-carbon combination during wet seasons, without backup generation the system remains susceptible to price volatility. We further suggest policy recommendations to ensure the reduction of price volatility and the continuity of electricity supply during dry periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3adry season 3aeconometrics 3aelectricity 3aelectricity costs 3aenergy 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3amodels 3aprices 3arain 3arisk 3aspring 3asummer 3avariance 3awet season 3awind 3awinter 3aNew Zealand 0aSpatial analysis 0aWind generation 0aHydro 0aNodal price 0aPrice volatility 0aMerit-order effects 0aC21 0aC23 0aQ41 0aQ42 0aQ471 aSuomalainen, Kiti1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8855-49291 aSharp, Basil1 aYi, Ming1 aSheng, Mingyue Selena1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9027-14850 tEnergy.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 238 p.122076-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1220763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245009500167520162900262592002801891650004401919650003701963650001502000650001902015650002402034650001502058650001602073650002602089650002102115650001502136650001202151650001402163650001302177650000702190650001402197650001702211650001602228653003002244653002202274653001702296653002202313653001802335700001702353700001602370700001802386773010602404856008702510852000902597655001202606IND60790553520221119180734.0221004e20221120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079055352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1299992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Yaling10aUsing carbonized hybrid FeNPs@ZIF-8 for the sustained release of doxorubicin hydrochloride  aControlling the slow release of drugs in carriers and reducing environmental pollution and damage from antibiotics is important and challenging research. In this paper, a novel composite material of carbonized FeNPs@ZIF-8 (C-Fe₃O₄ @ZIF-8) was used to load and release doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX). Compared with conventional ZIFs materials, greatly enhancing the magnetic properties, drug loading capacity and controlled drug release of the carrier agent. Interestingly, by establishing a dual stimulus response system with environmental factors of pH and temperature, results showed release rate of 61.6 % at a pH of 3 and a temperature of 37 °C. In addition, the SEM-EDS results showed that the surface of C-Fe₃O₄ @ZIF-8 was partially broken but maintained a stable morphology before and after release. Meanwhile the nitrogen absorption desorption curve (BET) and hysteresis loop reveal that C-Fe₃O₄ @ZIF-8 can maintain a large specific surface area and a magnetization intensity of 12.4 emu g⁻¹ after release. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), on the other hand, reveal the presence of partial ligand and hydrogen bond breaks during the release of DOX from DOX-loaded C-Fe₃O₄ @ZIF-8. Finally, the release of DOX from C-Fe₃O₄ @ZIF-8 at different pH and temperature is consistent with the Higuch and Bhaskas models, where the latter dominates and proposes a release mechanism. Therefore, the magnetic composite C-Fe₃O₄ @ZIF-8 in this study has great potential for DOX to effectively control drug release and targeted cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3acancer therapy 3acomposite materials 3adesorption 3adoxorubicin 3adrug delivery systems 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahysteresis 3aligands 3amagnetism 3anitrogen 3apH 3apollution 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aDoxorubicin hydrochloride 0aRelease mechanism 0aNanocarriers 0aTargeted delivery 0aC-Fe3O4@ZIF-81 aYin, Longwei1 aOwens, Gary1 aChen, Zuliang0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Nov. 20, v. 653 p.129999-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1299993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010200167300001800269520110000287536028501387592002801672596000601700596001301706650001501719650001701734650002001751650001001771650001501781650001701796650001501813650001401828650002401842650002101866650002101887653004301908653004001951653003101991653005202022700001402074700001502088700001902103700001402122700001802136700001602154700001602170700001302186700002002199700001902219700001502238773014602253856008602399852000902485655001202494IND60784386920221120081237.0220820e20220723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078438692DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2021.18983332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaeem, Abid14aThe fate of flavonoids after oral administration: a comprehensive overview of its bioavailability  ap. 6169-6186.  aDespite advancements in synthetic chemistry, nature remains the primary source of drug discovery, and this never-ending task of finding novel and active drug molecules will continue. Flavonoids have been shown to possess highly significant therapeutic activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-viral, anti-diabetic, anti-cancer, anti-aging, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective, etc., However, it has been found that orally administered flavonoids have a critical absorption disorder and, therefore, have low bioavailability and show fluctuating pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses. A detailed investigation is required to assess and analyze the variation in the bioavailability of flavonoids due to interactions with the intestinal barrier. This review will emphasize on the bioavailability and the pharmacological applications of flavonoids, key factors affecting their bioavailability, and strategies for enhancing bioavailability, which may lead to deeper understanding of the extent of flavonoids as a treatment and/or prevention for different diseases in clinics.  aThis study was supported by Key Project of Scientific and Technological Innovation Talents in Jiangxi Province, China under grant number (20171BCB18001), and Top-ranking discipline project of Chinese materia medica in Jiangxi Province, China under grant number (JXSYLXK-ZHYA0092).  aPublisher supplied data  a1  aJXSYLXK- 3aabsorption 3aantioxidants 3abioavailability 3adrugs 3aflavonoids 3afood science 3aintestines 3anutrition 3aoral administration 3apharmacodynamics 3apharmacokinetics 0aFlavonoids bioavailability enhancement 0apolyphenol structure and absorption 0abiofunctions of flavonoids 0afactors affecting bioavailability of flavonoids1 aMingyang,1 aPengyi, Hu1 aJie, Kang Yong1 aYali, Liu1 aHaiyan, Zhang1 aShuai, Xiao1 aWenjing, Li1 aLing, Wu1 aXia, Zhang Ming1 aShan, Liu Shan1 aQin, Zheng0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2022 July 23, v. 62, no. 22 p.6169-6186dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39431x1549-78527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2021.18983333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245015500158500001400313520151000327592002801837650001801865650000901883650001101892650001401903650001101917650001301928650001601941650001101957650001001968651001001978700001901988700001902007700001902026700001902045700001502064773011902079856007402198852000902272655001202281IND60704419020221119130203.0200723e20200227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070441902DNAL7 a10.3390/w120306382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Zhenzhou 10aIntegration of 3D Geological Modeling and Geothermal Field Analysis for the Evaluation of Geothermal Reserves in the Northwest of Beijing Plain, China  aNAL-light  aWith the increasing demand for energy and the growing concern for atmospheric pollution in Beijing, China, the exploitation and utilization of geothermal resources are becoming more desirable. The study combined three-dimensional geological modeling with geothermal field analysis to make clear the potential and distribution of geothermal resources in the northwest of the Beijing plain, which could provide a scientific basis for rational utilization in the study area. Based on the analysis of the geological data and geothermal conditions, we created a 3D geological model of the study area, and then added isothermal surfaces into the model and analyzed the heat flow to enhance the understanding of the present geothermal field. After that, the volumes of different temperature intervals of heat reservoirs were calculated accurately and automatically by the integration of the model and the isothermal surfaces. Finally, the geothermal reserves were calculated by the improved volumetric method, and the distribution of resources was analyzed comprehensively. The results showed that, in the study area, the heat flow values ranged from 49 to 99 mW m⁻², and the average elevations of 25 °C, 40 °C, and 60 °C isothermal surfaces were at -415 m, -1282 m, and -2613 m, respectively. The geothermal reserves were 5.42 × 10¹⁹ J and the volume of the heat reservoir was 4.88 × 10¹¹ m³. The geothermal resources of the study area had good potential and could support local green development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aarea 3aenergy 3aheat flow 3amodels 3asurfaces 3atemperature 3avolume 3awater 3aChina1 aLei, Xiaodong 1 aXu, Nengxiong 1 aShao, Dongyue 1 aJiang, Xingyu 1 aWu, Xiong 0 tWater.g2020 Feb. 27, v. 12, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120306383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02306naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012200170520116200292592002801454650000901482650001201491650001401503650001801517650001601535650002201551653002801573653003201601653001901633653002901652653002801681700001501709700001801724773010601742856008701848852000901935655001201944IND60790553820221118150307.0221004e20221120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079055382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1300032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Youxuan10aEffect of particle shape on particle-bubble interaction behavior: A computational study using discrete element method  aA three-dimensional Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation model of particle-bubble interaction behavior based on particle-bubble mechanics theory was developed, and six kinds of irregular shape particle models were designed. The interaction behavior of spherical and irregular-shaped coal particles with the particle size of 0.1 mm and densities of − 1.3, 1.4–1.5, + 1.7 g/cm³ and a fixed bubble in quiescent water was simulated. The simulation results show that the interaction between spherical and irregular shape particles with the bubble can be divided into five stages: free settling, flow around the bubble surface, sliding with a liquid film, film rupture & three-phase contact line (TPCL) formation, sliding with a TPCL. Irregular shape particles have a larger critical collision angle and capture probability than spherical particles. The critical induction time of irregular particles is smaller than that of spherical particles. Irregular particles with edges and corners can promote the thinning and rupture of the liquid film between bubble and particle，thereby reducing the induction time and increasing the capture probability.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3aliquids 3amechanics 3aparticle size 3aprobability 3asimulation models 0aDiscrete element method 0aParticle-bubble interaction 0aParticle shape 0aCritical collision angle 0aCritical induction time1 aZhuang, Li1 aZhang, Zhijun0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Nov. 20, v. 653 p.130003-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1300033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245009900205300001800304520148800322592002801810596005401838650001401892650002701906650001901933650001801952650002201970650001101992650001902003650001902022650001502041650001302056650003302069650001302102650002102115650003702136650001802173650001402191700006002205700001402265700002202279700005802301700006002359773011102419856008202530852000902612655001202621IND60685054020221119205031.0200227e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068505402DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-019-02934-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliaei, Erfan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2984-770210aMicrofibrillated lignocellulose (MFLC) and nanopaper films from unbleached kraft softwood pulp  ap. 2325-2341.  aMicrofibrillated cellulose (MFC) is an important industrial nanocellulose product and material component. New MFC grades can widen the materials property range and improve product tailoring. Microfibrillated lignocellulose (MFLC) is investigated, with the hypothesis that there is an optimum in lignin content of unbleached wood pulp fibre with respect to nanofibril yield. A series of kraft fibres with falling Kappa numbers (lower lignin content) was prepared. Fibres were beaten and fibrillated into MFLC by high-pressure microfluidization. Nano-sized fractions of fibrils were separated using centrifugation. Lignin content and carbohydrate analysis, total charge, FE-SEM, TEM microscopy and suspension rheology characterization were carried out. Fibres with Kappa number 65 (11% lignin) combined high lignin content with ease of fibrillation. This confirms an optimum in nanofibril yield as a function of lignin content, and mechanisms are discussed. MFLC from these fibres contained a 40–60 wt% fraction of nano-sized fibrils with widths in the range of 2.5–70 nm. Despite the large size distribution, data for modulus and tensile strength of MFLC films with 11% lignin were as high as 14 GPa and 240 MPa. MFLC films showed improved water contact angle of 84–88°, compared to neat MFC films (< 50°). All MFLC films showed substantial optical transmittance, and the fraction of haze scattering strongly correlated with defect content in the form of coarse fibrils.  aPublisher supplied data  aFID15-0115cStiftelsen för Strategisk Forskning 3acellulose 3acellulose microfibrils 3acentrifugation 3acontact angle 3afilms (materials) 3alignin 3alignin content 3alignocellulose 3ananofibers 3arheology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asoftwood 3atensile strength 3atransmission electron microscopy 3atransmittance 3awood pulp1 aLindén, Pär A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7880-38881 aWu, Qiong1 aBerthold, Fredrik1 aBerglund, Lars1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5818-23781 aLindström, Tom,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7979-91580 tCellulose.g2020 Mar., v. 27, no. 4 p.2325-2341dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02934-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04097naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245011900178520209400297592002802391650002902419650001602448650001902464650001602483650001102499650002102510650001502531650001602546650001402562650001902576650001502595650001702610650000702627650001802634650001302652650001102665650002502676650001902701650001102720651001402731651001702745653002202762653002002784653002102804653001602825653002302841700002302864700001802887700002002905700002102925700003202946700002102978700002002999700002103019700002203040700002103062700002003083700002503103700001903128700001903147700001703166773011903183856008803302852000903390655001203399IND60745992820221123034512.0211003e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074599282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1492412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Santos, Iván10aOceanography time series reveals annual asynchrony input between oceanic and estuarine waters in Patagonian fjords  aThe postglacial Patagonian fjord system along the west coast of southern South America is one of the largest stretches of the southern hemisphere (SH) fjord belt, influenced by the SH westerly wind belt and continental freshwater input. This study reports a 3-year monthly time series (2017–2020) of physical and biogeochemical parameters obtained from the Reloncaví Marine Observatory (OMARE, Spanish acronym) at the northernmost embayment and fjord system of Patagonia. The main objective of this work was to understand the land–atmosphere–ocean interactions and to identify the mechanisms that modulate the density of phytoplankton. A key finding of this study was the seasonally varying asynchronous input of oceanic and estuarine water. Surface lower salinity and warmer estuarine water arrived in late winter to summer, contributing to water column stability, followed by subsurface higher salinity and less warmer oceanic water during fall–winter. In late winter 2019, an interannual change above the picnocline due to the record-high polarity of the Indian Ocean Dipole inhibited water column stability. The biogeochemical parameters (NO₃⁻, NO₂⁻, PO₄³⁻, Si(OH)₄, pH, and dissolved oxygen) responded to the surface annual salinity variations, and oceanic water mass contributed greatly to the subsurface inorganic nutrient input. The water column N/P ratio indicated that no eutrophication occurred, even under intense aquaculture activity, likely because of the high ventilation dynamics of the Reloncaví Sound. Finally, a shift in phytoplankton composition, characterized by surface chlorophyll-a maxima in late winter and deepening of spring–summer blooms related to the physicochemical conditions of the water column, was observed. Our results support the ecosystem services provided by local oceanography processes in the north Patagonian fjords. Here, the anthropogenic impact caused by economic activities could be, in part, chemically reduced by the annual ventilation cycle mediated by the exchange of oceanic water masses into Patagonian fjords.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquaculture 3abrackish water 3achlorophyll 3acoasts 3adissolved oxygen 3aecosystems 3aenvironment 3aestuaries 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater 3aoceanography 3apH 3aphytoplankton 3asalinity 3asummer 3atime series analysis 3awind direction 3awinter 3aArgentina 3aIndian Ocean 0aPatagonian fjords 0aBiogeochemistry 0aAtmospheric mode 0aTime series 0aMarine observatory1 aDíaz, Patricio A.1 aSilva, Nelson1 aGarreaud, René1 aMontero, Paulina1 aHenríquez-Castillo, Carlos1 aBarrera, Facundo1 aLinford, Pamela1 aAmaya, Constanza1 aContreras, Sergio1 aAracena, Claudia1 aPinilla, Elías1 aAltamirano, Robinson1 aVallejos, Luis1 aPavez, Javiera1 aMaulen, Juan0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 798 p.149241-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1492413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02048naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245015700164300001600321520101500337592002801352650002801380650002501408650002101433650001001454650002201464650001101486650003401497650002301531651001001554773010101564856004801665852000901713655001201722IND4477261820221117231959.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447726182DNAL7 a10.1134/S10674136110601782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyo, Takahiro10aPopulation model of fluctuations in organophosphate resistance of Drosophila melanogaster: Roles of a mutated acetylcholinesterase and a cytochrome P450  ap. 510-517.  aThe dynamics of genetic variation in susceptibility to insecticides within a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) was examined using model systems and experimental data published previously. In a recent study, two resistance factors for three organophosphate insecticides (OPs) were suggested to be involved within the Katsunuma population (Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan): a resistant-type acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (cytochrome P450). Within this natural population, the relative contributions of the resistanttype AChE to genetic variation in resistance to the three OPs were larger than those of the cytochrome P450. The simulation analysis by means of the model, based on genotypic density-independent population projection trajectories, suggested that seasonal fluctuations of genetic variation in resistance to the three OPs were mainly caused by the change in the frequency of the resistant-type acetylcholinesterase (Ace) gene within the population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aacetylcholinesterase 3acytochrome P-450 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3amodels 3aorganophosphorus insecticides 3aseasonal variation 3aJapan0 tRussian journal of ecology.g2011 Nov., v. 42, no. 6 p.510-517dSpringer-Verlagx1067-41367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1067413611060178  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245011300173506010400286506007600390520105800466592002801524506003701552650002301589650001601612650002501628650002401653650002401677650002101701650001501722650004301737650001101780653003101791653002301822653002001845653002001865700002401885700001901909700001801928700002501946700002201971773009901993856009002092852000902182655001202191IND60766277520221207131643.0221004e20220415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076627752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.7379832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalbot, Anita10aInvestigation into the potential use of dietary supplementation to reduce the impact of Amoebic Gill Disease  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAmoebic Gill Disease (AGD) is a disease affecting cultured Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) which is caused by Paramoeba perurans. The immunomodulatory impact of functional foods has previously been demonstrated in salmon. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of a novel fish feed in mitigating the severity and progression of AGD in Atlantic salmon. Negative and positive control fish were maintained on a base fish feed, with experimental fish maintained on a customized feed blend pre- and post-amoeba inoculation. Disease progression was evaluated using gill scoring and diagnostic quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for the detection of P. perurans at 14 and 21 dpi. The expression profiles of 11 immune related genes were analyzed by qPCR at 14 and 21 dpi. The customized feed blend was shown to delay the onset of clinical symptoms associated with AGD. Furthermore, the expression of genes with roles in maintenance of the mucosal layer and mucosal defense were impacted in fish fed on this novel feed formulation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aParamoeba perurans 3aSalmo salar 3aamoebic gill disease 3adietary supplements 3adisease progression 3afeed formulation 3afish feeds 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asalmon 0aAmoebic Gill Disease (AGD) 0aParamoeba perurans 0aAtlantic salmon 0aGene expression1 aMcCormack, Michelle1 aDwivedi, Ankit1 aO'Connor, Ian1 aValdenegro, Victoria1 aMacCarthy, Eugene0 tAquaculture.g2022 Apr. 15, v. 552 p.737983-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.7379833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006000149245012700209300001600336520179000352592002802142650001502170650001202185650000902197650001602206650002102222650002002243650001302263650001802276650001302294650003702307650001502344650002302359650002002382650001802402650001702420653001002437653001202447653002302459653001702482653000902499700002402508700002702532700001702559773011702576856008402693852000902777655001202786IND60605387620221118012151.0190705e20180930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060538762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2018.06.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDokoohaki, Hamze1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2131-771210aUse of inverse modelling and Bayesian optimization for investigating the effect of biochar on soil hydrological properties  ap. 268-274.  aPhysical properties of biochar such as small particle size and high porosity can modify soil properties and help to improve soil water dynamics. However, there has been no consistent long-term measurements of change in soil physical properties due to biochar application under real field conditions. In this study, we use a unique dataset of soil water content measurements in a corn-soybean cropping system (with biochar and no-biochar) for two years. Soil water content was measured every 30 min at 4 different depths and with 3 replications in corn plots. The effect of biochar was expected to be the difference between the physical soil properties of the two treatments. The APSIM model, a process-oriented crop model, was employed in order to find the physical properties of biochar and no-biochar treatments by using inverse modeling. First, a global sensitivity analysis was carried out to find the most sensitive inputs for the APSIM model for soil water simulation. Then the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm was used to inversely estimate the APSIM soil input properties using the soil moisture measurements. Results of the sensitivity analysis showed that the drainage upper limit (DUL) was the most sensitive soil property followed by saturated hydraulic conductivity (KS), saturated water content (SAT), maximum rate of plant water uptake (KL), maximum depth of surface storage (MAXPOND), lower limit volumetric water content (LL15) and lower limit for plant water uptake (LL). The difference between the posterior distributions (with and without biochar) showed an increase in DUL by approximately 10%. No considerable change was noted in LL15, MAXPOND and KS whereas SAT and LL showed a slight increase and decrease in biochar treatment respectively compared to no-biochar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abiochar 3acorn 3acrop models 3acropping systems 3adata collection 3adrainage 3aparticle size 3aporosity 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asurface storage 3awater content 3awater uptake 0aAPSIM 0aBiochar 0aSoil water content 0aOptimization 0aMCMC1 aMiguez, Fernando E.1 aArchontoulis, Sotirios1 aLaird, David0 tAgricultural water management.g2018 Sept. 30, v. 208 p.268-274dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2018.06.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012200164300001400286520115100300592002801451650001901479650001901498650002201517650001901539650001701558650001901575650001501594650001401609650001501623650001901638650001101657650001701668653001901685653003701704653003301741653002301774653002201797653001701819700002301836700002101859700002401880773011101904856008302015852000902098655001202107IND60645484020221118053513.0190923e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064548402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2019.05.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImam, Arfin10aAnalytical approaches used in monitoring the bioremediation of hydrocarbons in petroleum-contaminated soil and sludge  ap. 50-64.  aBioremediation is a familiar process involving actions of microorganisms on the pollutants present in environmental matrices. Monitoring the fate of petroleum hydrocarbons present as contaminants in environmental samples is a retrospective approach to assess the progress of biodegradation process. Chemical analysis is essential in the determination of hydrocarbons at various stages of the experiment. Pervasive research in this area has involved the use of popular analytical tools such as chromatography and spectroscopy. This review focuses on the significance of analytical chemistry in monitoring of bioremediation experiments. The discussions present a comprehensive account of the analysis plan, deviations and critical description of the involved approaches for determination of different hydrocarbons present in petroleum-contaminated soils. Various sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid, solid-phase, Soxhlet, pressurized fluid extraction etc. have been discussed. Use of chromatography, spectroscopy and other hyphenated platforms is also discussed to expand the prevalent scenario of analysis in bioremediation studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3achemical analysis 3achromatography 3ahydrocarbons 3amicroorganisms 3amonitoring 3apetroleum 3apollutants 3apolluted soils 3asludge 3aspectroscopy 0aBioremediation 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aTotal petroleum hydrocarbons 0aGas chromatography 0aMass spectrometry 0aSpectroscopy1 aSuman, Sunil Kumar1 aGhosh, Debashish1 aKanaujia, Pankaj K.0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2019 Sept., v. 118 p.50-64dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2019.05.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02087naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010400165520093400269592002801203650002501231650001601256650001101272650003101283650001401314650001301328650001101341650001501352650002401367650002501391651001001416653003301426653001601459653002901475653001301504773009001517856008501607852000901692655001201701IND60751893420221120142442.0211129e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075189342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1220932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Haoran10aPrediction of industrial power consumption in Jiangsu Province by regression model of time variable  aIndustry has always been an important driving force to promote social and economic development, and the development of industry is inseparable from energy consumption. In the process of modern production, more and more modern advanced equipment is put into use, and the main power source of these equipment is electricity. However, the production of electricity is limited by conditions. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to simulate and forecast the industrial power consumption of Jiangsu Province through the nonlinear transformation of time variables, so that the industrial enterprises in Jiangsu can reasonably arrange the next power demand and ensure the smooth progress of industrial activities.

To understand the landscape dynamics of a semi-arid Mediterranean ecosystem in Chile, we evaluated land-cover trajectories and their effects on landscape spatial patterns over a period of 36 years (1975–2011). We used landscape metrics combined with surveys of landowners to distinguish the main drivers of landscape change. General results indicated that changes in forest area followed both natural (64%) and human-induced (36%) trajectories. At the landscape level, fragmentation for all forest cover types increased, whereas at the class level, fragmentation of Native Forest decreased. The landscape changed from a homogeneous mosaic dominated by grazing and agriculture to a more heterogeneous environment, where natural cover had become more dominant. Thus, the use of a landscape ecology approach together with field information improved our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics in this landscape. This study is one of the first to assess landscape dynamics of the Mediterranean semi-arid region of Chile. This is important because it aids decision-making for biodiversity conservation in a global hotspot and land-use planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity 3adecision making 3adry environmental conditions 3aecosystems 3aforests 3agrazing 3ahumans 3aland cover 3aland use change 3alandowners 3alandscape ecology 3alandscapes 3aplanning 3asemiarid zones 3asurveys 3aChile 0aLandscape structure 0aLandscape monitoring 0aLandscape metrics 0aLand change1 aMiranda, Marcelo D.1 aArellano, Eduardo C.1 aDobbs, Cynnamon0 tJournal of arid environments.g2016 Apr., v. 127 p.74-81dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2015.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03749naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245007300162300001800235500001100253520205000264592002802314650001702342650001702359650001702376650002202393650002402415650000902439650001802448650001302466650002302479650002102502650002302523650002702546650001302573650001402586651002202600700002602622700001602648700002202664700002102686700002002707700001902727700001602746700002202762700002602784700002302810700002702833700001702860700002202877700002202899700002602921773013002947856007303077852000903150655001203159IND60587923820221117215557.0180102e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058792382DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.124912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiakoumi, Sylvaine10aSpace invaders; biological invasions in marine conservation planning  ap. 1220-1231.  aREVIEW  aAIM: Biological invasions are major contributors to global change and native biodiversity decline. However, they are overlooked in marine conservation plans. Here, we examine for the first time the extent to which marine conservation planning research has addressed (or ignored) biological invasions. Furthermore, we explore the change of spatial priorities in conservation plans when different approaches are used to incorporate the presence and impacts of invasive species. LOCATION: Global analysis with a focus on the Mediterranean Sea region. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review consisting of three steps: (1) article selection using a search engine, (2) abstract screening and (3) review of pertinent articles, which were identified in the second step. The information extracted included the scale and geographical location of each case study as well as the approach followed regarding invasive species. We also applied the software Marxan to produce and compare conservation plans for the Mediterranean Sea that either protect, or avoid areas impacted by invasives, or ignore the issue. One case study focused on the protection of critical habitats, and the other on endemic fish species. RESULTS: We found that of 119 papers on marine spatial plans in specific biogeographic regions, only three (2.5%) explicitly took into account invasive species. When comparing the different conservation plans for each case study, we found that the majority of selected sites for protection (ca. 80%) changed in the critical habitat case study, while this proportion was lower but substantial (27%) in the endemic fish species case study. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Biological invasions are being widely disregarded when planning for conservation in the marine environment across local to global scales. More explicit consideration of biological invasions can significantly alter spatial conservation priorities. Future conservation plans should explicitly account for biological invasions to optimize the selection of marine protected areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3aecological invasion 3afish 3aglobal change 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3amarine environment 3amarine protected areas 3aplanning 3ascreening 3aMediterranean Sea1 aGuilhaumon, François1 aKark, Salit1 aTerlizzi, Antonio1 aClaudet, Joachim1 aFelline, Serena1 aCerrano, Carlo1 aColl, Marta1 aDanovaro, Roberto1 aFraschetti, Simonetta1 aKoutsoubas, Drosos1 aLedoux, Jean‐Batiste1 aMazor, Tessa1 aMérigot, Bastien1 aMicheli, Fiorenza1 aKatsanevakis, Stelios0 tDiversity & distributions.g2016 Dec., v. 22, no. 12 p.1220-1231dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.124913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245013800175300001400313520159100327592002801918650001001946650001501956650001701971650001101988650001801999650001002017650002302027650001202050650001202062650001902074650002102093650001002114650001002124650003002134650001302164650001002177650001102187650001802198650001302216650001102229650001102240650001402251650002902265650001602294651002802310651001102338653002102349653001802370653001902388653002302407653001202430653001102442700002102453700001802474700002002492773009702512856008602609852000902695655001202704IND60629778020221118073550.0190319e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062977802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2018.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aApolinarska, Karina10aResponse of the aquatic plants and mollusc communities in Lake Kojle (central Europe) to climatic changes between 250 BCE and 1550 CE  ap. 35-45.  aSediments of Lake Kojle, located in the transition zone between the nemoral and boreal biogeographic zones in NE Poland, were analysed to verify the response of the aquatic ecosystem to major environmental changes. High-resolution plant macrofossil, mollusc and pollen data were derived from two replicate parallel cores and revealed several shifts in the biota composition within the littoral zone between 250 BCE and 1550 CE. The reaction of the aquatic ecosystem to temperature changes was found to be minor, which is ascribed to the mitigating influence of water and the wide ecological tolerance of most of the taxa. Najas marina, considered as an indicator of warmer conditions, was the only species that clearly reacted to the long-term climate shifts. We consider lake level changes that resulted from fluctuations in climate humidity and the filling of the lake with sediments as the most important factors that control the presence of macrophytes species from the genera Nymphaea, Nuphar, Typha, and Chara. Mollusc diversity and abundance increased with the increase in the diversity and biomass of submerged vegetation. However, reduced dissolved oxygen within the water column under the floating leaves of Nymphaea alba and Nuphar sp. resulted in the retreat of Planorbis carinatus, a gastropod species sensitive to oxygen shortages. Major shifts in the developments of fauna and flora were parallel in the two studied cores, but some spatial variability was observed. This might be due to the spatial variability of the macrophyte and mollusc communities within Lake Kojle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChara 3aGastropoda 3aNajas marina 3aNuphar 3aNymphaea alba 3aTypha 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abiomass 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adissolved oxygen 3afauna 3aflora 3ageographical distribution 3ahumidity 3alakes 3aleaves 3alittoral zone 3amolluscs 3aoxygen 3apollen 3asediments 3asubmerged aquatic plants 3atemperature 3aCentral European region 3aPoland 0aClimatic changes 0aLate Holocene 0aEutrophic lake 0aPlant macrofossils 0aMollusc 0aPollen1 aObremska, Milena1 aAunina, Liene1 aGałka, Mariusz0 tAquatic botany.g2018 Aug., v. 148 p.35-45dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2018.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05108naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245013300173300001600306520299500322592002803317650004403345650001503389650001203404650001203416650002303428650002103451650002303472650002503495650001403520650001703534650001903551650004103570650001303611650001203624650004403636650000903680650002403689650001403713650002103727650001903748650001303767650002103780650001403801653002303815653001703838653001703855653001903872653001603891653002203907700001803929700001403947700001803961700002203979700001804001700001804019700002704037700001704064700001904081700002504100700002204125700002004147700001804167773011004185856008204295852000904377655001204386IND60561805620221117222330.0170124e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056180562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2016.04.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva Almeida, H.10aPerformance of thermochemical conversion of fat, oils, and grease into kerosene-like hydrocarbons in different production scales  ap. 126-143.  aThis work aims to investigate the effect of catalytic cracking of residual fat, oils, and grease (FOG) from grease traps in different production scales (bench, laboratory, and pilot) on the reaction products yields and OLP properties and the feasibility to produce kerosene-like hydrocarbons. The cracking experiments were carried out in batch mode at 450°C and 1.0 atmosphere, with 10% (wt.) Na2CO3 using a laboratory scale cylindrical borosilicate-glass reactor of 143mL, a bench scale stirred tank slurry reactor of 1.5L, and a pilot scale stirred tank slurry reactor of 143L (≈1:10:1000). The reaction liquid products were physical and chemical analyzed for acid and saponification values, density, kinematic viscosity, refractive index, and copper strip corrosion. FT-IR analysis provided the qualitative chemical composition of OLP obtained in bench, laboratory, and pilot scales, as well as kerosene, light and heavy diesel-like hydrocarbons fractions obtained by distillation of OLP produced in pilot scale with 10% (wt.) Na2CO3. The chemical compositions of OLP and kerosene-like hydrocarbons fraction obtained in pilot scale determined by NMR and GC–MS. The results showed an OLP yield ranging from 62.90 to 66.57% (wt.), a coke yield ranging between 7.02 and 9.79% (wt.), and a gas yield ranging from 16.32 to 22.40% (wt.), showing a mean absolute percentage deviation of 2.12%, 11.88%, and 14.91% for OLP, gas, and coke yields respectively, obtained in different production scales (≈10:1000). The OLP acid values varied from 19.08 to 10.45mg KOH/g, the density between 0.820 and 0.835g/cm3, and the kinematic viscosity from 3.28 to 4.21mm2s−1. The yield of kerosene-like hydrocarbons fraction average 14.90% (wt.) with an acid value of 5.43mg KOH/g, density of 0.740g/cm3, and kinematic viscosity of 0.66mm2s−1, while those of light and heavy diesel-like hydrocarbons fractions average 32.01% (wt.) and 19.35% (wt.) respectively. FT-IR and NMR analysis of OLP and kerosene-like hydrocarbons fraction confirms the presence of functional groups characteristic of hydrocarbons (alkenes, alkanes, ring-containing alkenes, and ring-containing alkanes, and cycloalkanes) and oxygenates (carboxylic acids, ketones, fatty alcohols, and dienes). The GC–MS analysis of OLP and kerosene-like hydrocarbons fraction obtained in pilot scale with 10% (wt.) Na2CO3 identified in OLP 76.97% hydrocarbons (39.44% alkenes, 31.91% alkanes, 4.12% ring-containing alkenes, and 1.50% ring-containing alkenes) and 23.03% oxygenates (12.14% carboxylic acids, 6.98% ketones, 1.90% fatty alcohols, and 2.01% dienes). The kerosene-like hydrocarbons fraction is composed by 94.62% (area) hydrocarbon (44.99% alkenes, 29.61% alkanes, 7.58% ring-containing alkenes, 6.15% ring-containing alkanes, 4.31% cycloalkanes, and 1.98% aromatics) and 5.38% (area) oxygenates (5.38% carboxylic acids), showing that catalytic cracking of scum from grease traps with 10% (wt.) Na2CO3 is technically feasible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacid value 3aalkanes 3aalkenes 3aaromatic compounds 3acarboxylic acids 3acatalytic cracking 3achemical composition 3acorrosion 3adistillation 3afatty alcohols 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3akerosene 3aketones 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3apotassium hydroxide 3apyrolysis 3arefractive index 3asaponification 3aslurries 3asodium carbonate 3aviscosity 0aCatalytic cracking 0aGrease traps 0aDistillation 0aGreen kerosene 0aPerformance 0aProduction scales1 aCorrêa, O.A.1 aEid, J.G.1 aRibeiro, H.J.1 ade Castro, D.A.R.1 aPereira, M.S.1 aPereira, L.M.1 ade Andrade Aâncio, A.1 aSantos, M.C.1 ada Mota, S.A.P1 ada Silva Souza, J.A.1 aBorges, Luiz E.P.1 aMendonça, N.M.1 aMachado, N.T.0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2016 July, v. 120 p.126-143dElsevier B.V.x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2016.04.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015400170520118300324592002801507650001401535650001201549650001101561650001901572650001401591650002301605650001701628650001401645650001401659650001501673653001901688653003301707653002201740653001701762700001801779700001201797700002201809700001501831700001601846700001501862700001501877700001701892700001801909700002001927773011401947856008602061852000902147655001202156IND60792390320221119131000.0221004e20230105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079239032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1298712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Chengyun10aSingle atom Mn anchored on N-doped porous carbon derived from spirulina for catalyzed peroxymonosulfate to degradation of emerging organic pollutants  aHighly efficient single atom catalysts are critical to substantially promote for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation to organic pollutant degradation, but it remains a challenge at present. Herein, single atom Mn anchored on N-doped porous carbon (SA-Mn-NSC) was synthesized by ball milling of Mn-doped carbon nitride and spirulina biochar to dominantly activate PMS. The precursor of carbon nitride and spirulina possessed a strong coordinating capability for Mn(II), facilitating the formation of highly dispersed nitrogen-coordinated Mn sites (Mn-N₄). The SA-Mn-NSC catalyst exhibited high activity and stability in the heterogeneous activation of PMS to degrade a wide range of pollutants within 10 min, showing an outstanding degradation rate constant of 0.31 min⁻¹ in enrofloxacin (ENR) degradation. The high surface density of Mn-N₄ sites and abundant interconnected meso–macro pores were highly favorable for activating PMS to produce ¹O₂ and high-valent manganese (Mn(IV)) for pollutant degradation. This work offers a new pathway of using a low-cost and easily accessible single-atom catalysts (SACs) and could inspire more catalytic oxidation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpirulina 3abiochar 3acarbon 3acarbon nitride 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aenrofloxacin 3amanganese 3aoxidation 3apollutants 0aSingle atom Mn 0aPeroxymonosulfate activation 0aSpirulina biochar 0aEnrofloxacin1 aLiang, Yuntao1 aXia, Wu1 aAlmatrafi, Eydhah1 aSong, Biao1 aWang, Ziwei1 aZeng, Yuxi1 aYang, Yang1 aShang, Yanan1 aWang, Chaohai1 aZeng, Guangming0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2023 Jan. 05, v. 441 p.129871-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1298713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245013100162520132100293592002801614650001501642650001201657650002001669650001501689650003101704650001901735650002001754650001401774650001401788650001501802650001601817650002201833650001401855650001501869653002801884653001401912653003101926653003201957653001401989700001602003700001502019700001602034700001702050700001302067773012502080856008302205852000902288655001202297IND60783379520221120051317.0220809e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078337952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2022.1056182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Yan10aEffects of process water recirculation on yields and quality of hydrochar from hydrothermal carbonization process of rice husk  aHydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is promising to convert moist lignocellulosic biomass into advanced fuels. However, it also generates a large amount of process wastewater (PW) which can’t be discharged directly due to its protentional pollution to the environment. This study aims to investigate the effects of PW recycling on the hydrochar performance. Rice husk (RH) was hydrothermally carbonized under the temperature of 220 ℃ for 60 min and PW was recycled 5 times. In the first 3 times recycle, the yield and high heating value (HHV) of hydrochar was improved from 68.51% to 76.62%, 19.71 MJ/kg to 21.97MJ/kg, respectively, and the energetic recovery efficiency (ERE) was highly increased from 72.17% to 89.72%. Functional group analysis by titration shows that PW recycling promoted the formation of oxygen-containing functional groups. The decrease of H/C and O/C ratio shows that PW recirculation promoted dehydration and decarboxylation reactions, thus improving the thermal stability of generated hydrochars. The adsorption performance of hydrochar was evaluated by removal of malachite green (MG). The results imply that the PW recirculation could also improve adsorption capacity of hydrochar for MG. This study provides a new insight for the treatment of PW from HTC of lignocellulosic biomasses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiomass 3adecarboxylation 3ahydrochars 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3alignocellulose 3amalachite green 3apollution 3apyrolysis 3arice hulls 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3atitration 3awastewater 0aLignocellulosic biomass 0aRice husk 0aHydrothermal carbonization 0aProcess water recirculation 0aHydrochar1 aGuo, Chuwen1 aQin, Shiru1 aWang, Baosu1 aZhao, Peitao1 aCui, Xin0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2022 Sept., v. 166 p.105618-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2022.1056183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02068naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245013300171300001800304520080500322592002801127650001401155650002001169650001401189650001401203650001701217650002901234650002401263650001901287650001001306650001201316650000901328700002901337700006901366773017001435856008001605852000901685655001201694IND60600934820221122055852.0180705e20170510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060093482DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b001542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnkarappa, Nayana K.12aA Study on the Effect of Additive Combination on Improving Anticorrosion Property of Zinc Electrodeposit from Acid Chloride Bath  ap. 5284-5295.  aThe presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and syringaldehyde (SGA) mixture in a chloride bath produces nanocrystalline, bright zinc electrodeposition on steel substrate. The effect of the combination of additives PEG and SGA and simultaneous influence of deposition current density in the presence of the PEG+SGA mixture on the deposit surface morphology, texture, and grain size were systematically studied. The effects of these additives on cathodic current efficiency and throwing power of the bath and corrosion resistance of the deposit were analyzed. The presence of the PEG and SGA mixture remarkably changes both the morphology and orientation of growing zinc platelets. This study revealed the synergistic influence of additives on enhancing the corrosion resistance property of the deposit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3ablood platelets 3achlorides 3acorrosion 3ananocrystals 3aorganochlorine compounds 3apolyethylene glycol 3aprocess design 3asteel 3atexture 3azinc1 aAdarakatti, Prashanth S.1 aMalingappa, Pandurangappa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7492-38930 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 May 10, v. 56, no. 18 p.5284-5295dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b001543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03137naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245010500161300001400266500002000280520172000300592002802020650001702048650001002065650001302075650002102088650002302109650002702132650001102159650002302170650001902193651001102212651001102223651001602234700001802250700001902268700002502287700002002312700002402332700001802356700001902374700002202393700003302415773012502448856007302573852000902646655001202655IND60587923920221117215553.0180102e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058792392DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.125022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProcházka, Petr,10aDelineating large‐scale migratory connectivity of reed warblers using integrated multistate models  ap. 27-40.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Assessing the extent of large‐scale migratory connectivity is crucial for understanding the evolution of migratory systems and effective species conservation. It has been, however, difficult to elucidate the annual whereabouts of migratory populations of small animals across the annual cycle. Here, we use the reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) as one of the most frequently ringed passerines in Europe to demonstrate how ring re‐encounter and geolocator data can be used to effectively quantify range‐wide distribution of different populations. LOCATION: Birds were ringed across Europe and re‐encountered in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. METHODS: We employed multistate models which quantify range‐wide distribution of different breeding populations while accounting for the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the re‐encounter probabilities and differential age‐specific survival during migratory and non‐migratory periods. In addition, we integrated geolocator and breeding abundance data as well as human population density to provide a realistic picture of the year‐round distribution of the reed warbler, a trans‐Saharan migrant. RESULTS: Our modelling approach revealed frequent use of the western Mediterranean flyway for the majority of western European populations, but a higher absolute number of reed warblers used the eastern flyway. Further, many populations used different stopover areas during post‐ and pre‐breeding migration, resulting in an anticlockwise loop migration pattern. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The integrative modelling framework helped us to depict the range‐wide migration pattern more realistically than raw ring re‐encounter data would allow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcrocephalus 3abirds 3abreeding 3ahuman population 3amigratory behavior 3amigratory connectivity 3amodels 3apopulation density 3astopover sites 3aAfrica 3aEurope 3aMiddle East1 aHahn, Steffen1 aRolland, Simon1 aJeugd, Henk van der,1 aCsörgő, Tibor1 aJiguet, Frédéric,1 aMokwa, Tomasz1 aLiechti, Felix1 aVangeluwe, Didier1 aKorner‐Nievergelt, Fränzi0 tDiversity & distributions.g2017 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.27-40dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.125023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03664naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015300165300001600318520189900334592002802233650001702261650001402278650004802292650002402340650001102364650003802375650001502413650003502428650001502463650001302478650001702491650001102508650001202519650002702531650001302558653001402571653004802585653001702633653003702650653003102687653002702718653001302745700001902758700001802777700001702795700001502812700001302827700001702840700005202857773009802909856008203007852000903089655001203098IND60622661420221120135741.0220228e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062266142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2018.11.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Hailun10aTilianin mediates neuroprotection against ischemic injury by attenuating CaMKII-dependent mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis and MAPK/NF-κB signaling  ap. 233-245.  aTilianin, a naturally occurring flavonoid glycoside, possesses versatile biological activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, energy collecting and anti-hypoxic effects. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying the effect of tilianin against ischemic injury in neuronal cells. We aimed to determine the potential targets and mechanisms of tilianin treatment behind the crosstalk pathways induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). We used an in silico docking model for interaction mode analysis and in vitro models for mechanistic exploration and target verification. Protein changes were measured using cellular immunofluorescence and ELISA techniques. The ability of tilianin to promote recovery of OGD-induced neurocytotoxic injury was demonstrated by maintenance of cell viability, membrane integrity and nuclear homogeneity. Tilianin treatment was also found to balance the concentrations of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins that had been modified by OGD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Of these intersectional cascades, Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was found to bind efficiently with tilianin. This presented a certain binding score along with down-regulation of ox-CaMKII and p-CaMKII in SH-SY5Y cells affected by OGD. Importantly, after utilizing KN93, one specific CaMKII inhibitor, tilianin-mediated neuroprotection against OGD was abolished. This effect was accompanied by upregulation of mitochondrial function. Thus, the beneficial effects of tilianin toward mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis and p38/JNK/NF-κB-associated inflammatory pathways were reversed following CaMKII inhibition. Our study indicated that attenuation of CaMKII-linked signaling mediated through mitochondria and p38/JNK/NF-κB inflammatory pathways is a key mechanism by which tilianin exerts its neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3acalcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 3acomputer simulation 3aenergy 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aflavonoids 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aglycosides 3aischemia 3amitochondria 3amodels 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3aproteins 0aApoptosis 0aCa2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II 0aMitochondria 0aMitogen-activated protein kinase 0aOxygen-glucose deprivation 0aNuclear factor kappa B 0aTilianin1 aFang, Jiansong1 aXing, Jianguo1 aWang, Linlin1 aWang, Qian1 aWang, Yu1 aLi, Zhuorong1 aLiu, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8578-07330 tLife sciences.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 216 p.233-245dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2018.11.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02460naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245013800185300001600323520076400339592002801103650001701131650002001148650001201168650001201180650003301192650001001225650001201235650001801247650001301265650002501278650002901303650003901332650002701371650001401398650001701412650002701429650006501456650002301521650003401544651001001578651001001588700002101598700001901619700001701638700001701655773010001672852000901772856008101781930003301862946001101895655001201906IND60439149120221121015122.0151024e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043914912DNAL7 a173930712pmid7 a10.1007/s10265-007-0076-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jing-Li10aNatural hybridization origin of Rhododendron agastum (Ericaceae) in Yunnan, China: inferred from morphological and molecular evidence  ap. 457-463.  aThe natural hybridization that occurs between two sympatric species of Rhododendron subgenus Hymenanthes in Yunnan, China, was investigated.

A total of 137 ticks were collected from 41 migratory birds belonging to 17 species (four partial migrants and 13 long-distance migrants). Most ticks were nymphs, with a predominance of Hyalomma marginatum marginatum and H. m. rufipes, and a small portion of Ixodes and Amblyomma species. All tick species analyzed were infected, and the molecular pathogen recognition revealed the presence of Rickettsia aeschlimannii, Rickettsia africae, Erlichia spp., Coxiella burnetii, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato group, and Babesia microti, whereas no genomic DNA of Bartonella spp. or Francisella tularensis was detected. The results of the survey show that H. marginatum ticks appear to be a vector of microbial agents that may affect human and animal health and that migratory birds may be an important carrier of these ticks. Additional studies are needed to better investigate the role of migratory birds in the epidemiology of these pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAmblyomma 3aBabesia microti 3aBartonella 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aCoxiella burnetii 3aDNA 3aEhrlichia 3aFrancisella tularensis 3aHyalomma marginatum 3aIxodes 3aRickettsia aeschlimannii 3aRickettsia africae 3aanimal exploration and collection 3adisease detection 3aepidemiology 3amicrobial detection 3amigratory birds 3anymphs 3aornithology 3apathogens 3asurveys 3aticks 3azoonoses 3aItaly 0aTicks 0aMigratory birds 0aRickettsia spp 0aErlichia spp 0aCoxiella burnetii 0aBorrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) 0aBabesia microti 0aCo-infection1 aMancini, Fabiola1 aDi Luca, Marco1 aCecere, Jacopo G.1 aBianchi, Riccardo1 aKhoury, Cristina1 aQuarchioni, Elisa1 aManzia, Francesca1 aRezza, Giovanni1 aCiervo, Alessandra0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 14, no. 3 p.199-205dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1557-77597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fvbz.2013.14583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03771naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014600167520228200313592002802595650002102623650001402644650001902658650002002677650001902697650002002716650001002736650002002746650001902766650001802785650001802803650002402821650001402845650001702859650001702876653001002893653001002903653001302913653001702926653001702943653002002960700001602980700001502996700001803011700001603029773012603045856008503171852000903256655001203265IND60783379720221120051202.0220726e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078337972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2022.1104592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerbst, A.C.10aEffect of aging on monocyte phagocytic and inflammatory functions, and on the ex vivo inflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide, in horses  aStudies investigating age-related changes in the function of monocytes are currently limited for horses. Thus, the main goal of this study was to determine the effect of aging on monocyte phagocytic capacity and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A second goal of this work was to examine the effect of aging on the inflammatory cytokine responses to LPS in a whole blood ex vivo model. Seven healthy young adult (4–6 years of age) and seven healthy senior horses (>20 years of age) were enrolled. Phagocytosis of E. coli, and pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNFα) responses to LPS, were measured in monocytes by flow cytometry. Gene expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, CCL-5, CCL-2) were measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and whole blood by RT-qPCR post incubation for 2 h or 6 h with a low (0.01 µg/mL) or a high (1 µg/mL) dose of LPS. Two sets of statistical models were applied to compare the age groups, one adjusted, and one unadjusted for the horses’ body condition scores (BCS). The percentage of monocytes that phagocytosed E. coli after 2 h of incubation was significantly lower in senior compared to young adult horses in the BCS-adjusted model. In the senior group, the expression of IL-1β in 2 h-0.01 µg/mL LPS-stimulated PBMCs was significantly higher than in the young adult group (BCS-adjusted and unadjusted models). In senior horses, expressions of IL-8 and IL-6 in whole blood samples stimulated for 6 h with 0.01 µg/mL LPS and for 2 h with 1 µg/mL LPS, respectively, were significantly lower than in young adult horses (BCS-adjusted models). The results of this study suggest that the phagocytic function of monocytes, as well as their IL-1β response to LPS may be altered in senior horses. In addition, the whole blood IL-8 and IL-6 gene expression responses to LPS may be insufficient in senior horses. While investigation of the effect of BCS on monocyte functions and whole blood pro-inflammatory LPS-responses was not a major goal of this work, it appears that adiposity may play a role in innate immune cell function, as significant differences between the age groups were often not apparent until the models were adjusted for BCS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aadiposity 3abody condition 3aex vivo studies 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression 3agenes 3aimmunopathology 3ainterleukin-18 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3alipopolysaccharides 3amonocytes 3aphagocytosis 3ayoung adults 0aHorse 0aAging 0aMonocyte 0aInflammation 0aPhagocytosis 0aInnate immunity1 aReedy, S.E.1 aPage, A.E.1 aHorohov, D.W.1 aAdams, A.A.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2022 Aug., v. 250 p.110459-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2022.1104593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01756naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013200158300001800290520072900308592002801037650001601065650001301081650001901094650002301113650002301136700002301159700001501182700002001197700002301217773010601240856007501346852000901421655001201430IND60578721820221119224846.0170813e20140718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057872182DNAL7 a10.1021/ol501503a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMo, Dong-Liang10aSynthesis of N-Styrenyl Amidines from α,β-Unsaturated Nitrones and Isocyanates through CO2 Elimination and Styrenyl Migration  ap. 3696-3699.  aA mild, metal-free, and modular route for the preparation of N-styrenyl amidines from N-aryl-α,β-unsaturated nitrones and isocyanates has been developed that accesses an initial oxadiazolidinone intermediate that can undergo CO₂ elimination and styrenyl migration. The use of a migration event to install N-styrenyl amidine substituents circumvents a limitation of traditional Pinner-type methods for amidine synthesis that require the use of amine nucleophiles. The modularity of the nitrone and isocyanate reagents provides access to a variety of differentially substituted N-styrenyl amidines. The scope and tolerance of the method are presented, and preliminary mechanistic data for the transformation are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aamidines 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure1 aPecak, Wiktoria H.1 aZhao, Meng1 aWink, Donald J.1 aAnderson, Laura L.0 tOrganic letters.g2014 July 18, v. 16, no. 14 p.3696-3699dAmerican Chemical Societyx1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fol501503a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012600168300001600294520135900310592002801669650002601697650001401723650001201737650001401749650001901763650001701782650001701799650002401816650001701840650001601857650001301873650002101886650001101907650002301918650002701941650002801968650002501996650004402021700001802065700001702083700002002100700001802120700001702138773009802155856008102253852000902334655001202343IND60088724620221120163645.0141102e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008872462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2011.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Jing-Gung10aAnti-invasion and apoptosis induction of chlorella (Chlorella sorokiniana) in Hep G2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells  ap. 302-310.  aThe effects of 80% ethanolic extract derived from commercial granule chlorella (GPE) on cell viability, invasion capacity and apoptosis in human hepatoma cell line (Hep G2 cells) were investigated. The results demonstrated that GPE decreased cell viability, induced apoptosis and showed invasion inhibitory effects in the Hep G2 cells. GPE-triggered apoptosis was confirmed by 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenyindole (DAPI) staining and comet assay. GPE promoted an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca²⁺, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) accompanied by cytochrome c release that was due to the decrease of Bcl-2 in the Hep G2 cells. GPE also induced the protein levels of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), increased the levels of caspase-3, -8 and -9, and stimulated the levels of fatty acid synthase (Fas) and Fas ligand (FasL) in the Hep G2 cells. Additionally GPE inhibited invasion of Hep G2 cells by down-regulation of the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9. Furthermore, cellular glutathione content and superoxide dismutases (SOD) activities were significantly reduced and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) levels were significantly increased after GPE treatment. These results suggest that GPE can induce cytotoxicity on Hep G2 cells and inhibit the invasive capacity of malignant cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella sorokiniana 3aapoptosis 3acalcium 3acaspase-3 3acell viability 3acytochrome c 3acytotoxicity 3afatty-acid synthase 3agelatinase A 3aglutathione 3ahepatoma 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3amembrane potential 3amitochondrial membrane 3areactive oxygen species 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances1 aPeng, Hsin-Yi1 aChu, Yu-Chan1 aHsieh, You-Miin1 aWang, San-Der1 aChou, Su-Tze0 tJournal of functional foods.g2012 Jan., v. 4, no. 1 p.302-310dElsevier Ltdx1756-46467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2011.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010600169300001400275520136300289592002801652650002201680650001201702650001301714650001301727650001401740650001101754650001801765650001301783650001401796650002001810650001801830650002101848653003201869653001801901653002101919653002301940653003301963700001901996700002302015700001402038700002202052700002202074773010802096856008202204852000902286655001202295IND60561806020221117222351.0170124e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056180602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2016.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayyas, Mohannad10aFrom automotive shredder residue to nano-ceramics and graphitic carbon—Thermal degradation kinetics  ap. 60-74.  aAutomotive shredder residue (ASR) has become a challenging problem due to its large and increasing production volumes. ASR consists primarily of plastics of high calorific value, making its processing by thermochemical processes a viable solution. The aim of this study is to develop a new sustainable approach, in which syngas, tars and valuable nano-ceramics can be generated from the fast and high-temperature pyrolysis of ASR. This work consists of two parts; in the first part, the characteristics and kinetics of ASR non-isothermal degradation were studied by correlating the thermogravimetric data via four models namely, Coats–Redfern model, Freeman and Carroll model, distributed activation energy model (DAEM) and Flynn–Wall–Ozawa model (FWO). Coats–Redfern model was not applicable to obtain the kinetic parameters of ASR pyrolysis, while the other models gave nearly similar and reasonable results. In the second part, ASR was treated by fast pyrolysis at 1550°C and the carbonaceous residues were analysed. The carbonaceous residues were found to contain reasonable quantities of TiN and SiC nanoparticles that can be valuable precursors to produce hard ceramics for many applications. Other materials such as graphite and calcium magnesium aluminosilicate microspheres coated with TiN were also identified in the carbonaceous residues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acalcium 3aceramics 3agraphene 3amagnesium 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aplastics 3apyrolysis 3asilicon carbide 3asynthesis gas 3athermogravimetry 0aAutomotive shredder residue 0aNano-ceramics 0aTitanium nitride 0aThermal conversion 0aThermal degradation kinetics1 aMayyas, Moayad1 aPahlevani, Farshid1 aLiu, Zhao1 aRajarao, Ravindra1 aSahajwalla, Veena0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2016 July, v. 120 p.60-74dElsevier B.V.x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2016.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010900174300001400283520143700297592002801734650000801762650001201770650001401782650001101796650002001807650002201827650001901849650001701868650000901885650002701894650003001921650001701951650004501968650001502013650001502028653001702043653001702060653001402077653001402091653001402105700002202119700002202141773009702163856008602260852000902346655001202355IND60629778520221118074430.0190319e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062977852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2018.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Dijk, Kor-jent10aNew microsatellite markers for the seagrass Amphibolis antarctica reveal unprecedented genetic diversity  ap. 25-28.  aThe limited data available on the genetic diversity of the temperate seagrass Amphibolis antarctica indicate diversity may be extremely low. The available previous study was based on allozymes and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) as molecular markers. Numerous studies into other seagrass taxa have shown that these markers may not have the appropriate sensitivity to reveal genetic diversity. In order to determine if A. antractica is genuinely genetically depauperate, or if the genetic markers used were not suitable to capture the diversity, we developed novel microsatellites for this species. Forty-eight primer candidates were screened with a limited number of geographically diverse samples. Fourteen loci displayed adequate polymorphism and were arranged into three multiplex PCR panels for further testing. DNA samples of four populations were tested and statistics on locus population and genotypic diversity calculated. This is the first study that has found genetic diversity within A. antarctica, with allele numbers ranging between 2–10 per locus. Expected heterozygosity (HE) for the four populations ranged between 0.355–0.507. This small-scale study has given the first insight into the genetic diversity of this species and has provided a tool to evaluate life-history strategies such as clonality, reproduction and dispersal of one of the most important southern Australian seagrass species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aalleles 3aallozymes 3abotany 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3alife history 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areproduction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aseagrasses 3astatistics 0aPolymorphism 0aConnectivity 0aClonality 0aAustralia 0aTemperate1 aDigiantonio, Gina1 aWaycott, Michelle0 tAquatic botany.g2018 Aug., v. 148 p.25-28dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2018.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245009700174500002200271520135700293592002801650650002301678650001701701650001201718650001201730650002901742650002301771650002401794650001201818650001501830650001301845650001301858650002901871650000901900650001901909650002401928650001101952650001101963650001601974650001801990650002002008650001202028650001202040651001102052700002202063700002402085773008902109856008202198852000902280655001202289IND60673131520221121122219.0191021e20191007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067313152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejrh.2019.1006332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRizinjirabake, Fabien10aDissolved organic carbon leaching flux in a mixed agriculture and forest watershed in Rwanda  aPre-press version  aRukarara River Watershed (RRW), Rwanda.DOC leaching has important environmental consequences for both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This paper measures leached dissolved organic carbon (LDOC) and the factors controlling its variation in the RRW, a mixed agriculture and forest watershed in Rwanda. The study describes the relationship of LDOC with land use/land cover (LULC), soil properties, rainfall characteristics, and stream DOC using linear regression and linear mixed effects models.The annual LDOC flux from topsoil to deeper soil horizons was 13.62 tonnes of carbon for the study area. This annual LDOC flux represents approximately 2% of the net primary productivity and 0.02% of the soil carbon stock. The plantation forest and natural forest sites showed higher LDOC fluxes than other LULC classes. Soil TOC, TN, rainfall intensity and amount positively affected LDOC flux (7 ≤ R2 ≤ 30%) in the RRW. Cations exchange capacity, runoff, and rainfall storage negatively affected in the RRW (7 ≤ R2 ≤ 23%). LDOC flux explained 14% of the variation of stream DOC in the RRW. Our results imply that, under ongoing climate and LULC changes, an increase of the proportion of plantation forest and rainfall intensity throughout the watershed will increase LDOC flux and will have a weak positive effect on stream DOC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acarbon sinks 3acations 3aclimate 3adissolved organic carbon 3aforest plantations 3aforested watersheds 3aforests 3aland cover 3aland use 3aleaching 3anet primary productivity 3arain 3arain intensity 3aregression analysis 3arivers 3arunoff 3asoil carbon 3asoil horizons 3asoil properties 3astreams 3atopsoil 3aRwanda1 aPilesjö, Petter,1 aTenenbaum, David E.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2019 Oct. 07, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23229x2214-58187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2019.1006333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100002500162245020900187300001800396520140000414592002801814650001401842650002501856650001601881650001101897650001701908650001001925650001101935650001301946650002501959650002201984650001002006650002402016650002802040650001202068650001802080650001102098650001402109650002302123650003302146650001802179650001102197650002202208650001202230650001102242650002802253650001302281650001202294650003602306650001102342650001002353650005502363700001802418773009902436856007702535852000902612655001202621IND60119350520221123021214.0141213e200009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011935052DNAL7 a110439412pmid7 a10.1007/s0070500700562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrishna Mohan, K.

Sequence analysis detected two alternate forms of the gene with a nucleotide difference at position 331 (A or G) in the coding sequence (NSP4-A or NSP4-G) leading to a change from neutral glutamine⁹⁷in NSP4-A to a positively charged arginine⁹⁷in NSP4-G originating from the same ATCC-Wa preparation. In addition to this, both forms of ATCC-Wa NSP4 revealed three mutations at nucleotide positions 88 (T to C), 142 (C to T) and 572 (G to A), when compared to the previously reported NSP4 sequence from virulent Wa strain. The former two mutations were in the coding sequence and resulted in a leucine¹⁶to serine¹⁶and a proline³⁴to leucine³⁴change, while the third mutation was in the 3′ non-coding region of the gene. The two amino acid changes may contribute to the ‘tissue culture-adaptation’ of ATCC-Wa strain. The ATCC-Wa NSP4 sequence was found to differ from the previously reported NSP4 sequence of attenuated Wa strain by lacking a mutation at 133 (T to C), though the mutations at 88 and 142 were present in both strains. Furthermore, comparison of deduced amino acid sequence of NSP4 from human, bovine, porcine and simian rotavirus strains identified a seven-residue (positions 135–141) inter-species variable domain in its C-terminal region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRotavirus 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3acattle 3acytotoxicity 3agenes 3ahumans 3amutation 3anucleotide sequences 3asequence analysis 3aswine 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmino Acid Substitution 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCattle 2aCell Line 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA-Directed RNA Polymerases 2aGenome, Viral 2aHumans 2aIsoelectric Point 2aLeucine 2aMacaca 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aProline 2aRotavirusxchemistryxgenetics. 2aSerine 2aSwine 2aViral Nonstructural Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics.1 aAtreya, C.

LOCATION: Continent of Australia. METHODS: We assembled a dataset of all known population genetic analyses of Australian plants based on neutral markers and catalogued them according to key species attributes, including range, abundance, range disjunction, biome and growth form; and genetic parameters, mean number of alleles per locus, observed and expected heterozygosity and population differentiation. We determined relationships between species attributes and genetic parameters using a maximum‐likelihood, multimodel inference approach. RESULTS: We found many associations that were consistent with predictions. Species attributes with greatest effect on genetic diversity were range size, growth form, abundance and biome. The most important attributes influencing genetic differentiation were range disjunction and abundance. We found unexpected results in the effects of biome and growth form on genetic diversity, with greater diversity in the eastern biome of Australia, and lower diversity in shrubs compared to trees. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of genetic diversity of Australian plants showed associations consistent with predictions based on population genetics theory, with strong effects of range size, abundance and growth form. We identified a striking effect of range disjunction on population genetic differentiation, an effect that has received little attention in the literature. We also found some notable differences to global predictions, which were most likely explained by confounding effects across variables. This highlights that caution is needed when extrapolating trends from global analyses to regional floras. Identifying associations between species attributes and patterns of genetic diversity enables broadscale predictions to facilitate the inclusion of genetic considerations into conservation decision‐making.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3adata collection 3adecision making 3aecosystems 3aflora 3agenetic analysis 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3aloci 3apopulation genetics 3aprediction 3ashrubs 3astatistical analysis 3atrees 3aAustralia1 aBreed, Martin1 aLowe, Andrew1 aBragg, Jason1 aCatullo, Renee1 aCoates, David1 aEncinas‐Viso, Francisco1 aGellie, Nick1 aJames, Elizabeth1 aKrauss, Siegfried1 aPotts, Brad1 aRossetto, M.q(Maurizio),1 aShepherd, Mervyn1 aByrne, Margaret0 tDiversity & distributions.g2017 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.41-52dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.125053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03581naa a2200877 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024003500132040001800167100002300185245009300208506007600301506003100377520132800408592002801736596004501764506003701809650002501846650002401871650002601895650001501921650001601936653000801952653001301960653001701973653000801990653000801998653000802006653000802014653000802022653000802030653000802038653001202046653000802058653001002066653001102076653001502087653000802102653000802110653000902118653000802127653000902135653000802144653000802152653000702160653000802167653000702175653000802182653000702190653000802197653001002205653000802215653000902223653000802232653000902240653000802249653000802257653000802265653002202273653002002295653001402315653002402329653001902353653002602372700002202398700001802420700002102438700001802459700002102477773010202498856008202600852000902682655001202691IND60673131720221207053916.0201125e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067313172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cpb.2019.1001212chorus7 a10.1016/j.cpb.2019.1001212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarone, Rebecca P.14aThe production of plant natural products beneficial to humanity by metabolic engineering  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aInfluencing the production of natural products in planta by metabolic engineering approaches has become an increasingly popular means to address a variety of important agricultural, medicinal, and nutraceutical issues. There have been many successes in this area, but also many surprising and unanticipated results. As an understanding of the complexity of metabolism has emerged, it has become increasingly apparent that successfully designing synthetic approaches to influence metabolite production requires knowledge beyond that of just the individual enzymatic steps involved and the order in which they are arranged into a biosynthetic pathway. Although much remains to be learned about the structures of metabolic organization and their impact on flux in living systems, taking the information that is available into account is one step towards helping to overcome the difficulties in generating sufficient yields of current natural products of interest and to accelerate the production of target compounds in the future. In this review, we reflect on current knowledge relating to the use of metabolic engineering of plant natural product pathways to influence the production of compounds of interest and consider the impact that higher levels of organization, such as metabolon formation, may have on these systems.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiochemical pathways 3adietary supplements 3ametabolic engineering 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 0a4CL 0a5/3′AT 0aA3′5′OMT 0aADS 0aALA 0aANR 0aANS 0aCHI 0aCHR 0aCHS 0aCOSTREL 0aDFR 0aDMAPP 0aF3′H 0aF3′5′H 0aFLS 0aFPP 0aFPPS 0aGPP 0aGPPS 0aIFS 0aIPP 0aLA 0aLAR 0aLc 0aMEP 0aMK 0aMVA 0aNADPH 0aPAL 0aPAP1 0aSTS 0aTAT1 0aTCA 0aUDP 0aUGT 0aSynthetic biology 0aNatural product 0aMetabolon 0aMultienzyme complex 0aMetabolic flux 0aMetabolic engineering1 aKnittel, David K.1 aOoka, Joey K.1 aPorter, Lexus N.1 aSmith, Noa T.1 aOwens, Daniel K.0 tCurrent plant biology.g2020 Dec., v. 24 p.100121-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23302x2214-66287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpb.2019.1001213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03955naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005200146245016400198300001800362500001900380520157000399536055101969592002802520650003402548650002102582650002502603650002502628650001702653650001402670650002602684650001002710650001402720650001802734650001202752650002202764650001502786650002002801650002502821650001702846650001302863650001302876650003702889653001802926653004102944653002802985653003203013700002003045700001503065700005703080700001503137700001303152773012303165856008003288852000903368655001203377IND60735496020221119132418.0210426e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073549602DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175209701712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8865-001010aEmulsion electrospun polylactic acid/Apocynum venetum nanocellulose nanofiber membranes with controlled sea buckthorn extract release as a drug delivery system  ap. 1046-1055.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aProlonging the duration of drug action and reducing toxicity play a vital role in wound administration as they reduce the chance of infection and decrease complications and cost. This study reports the natural antioxidant procyanidins extracted from sea buckthorn (SBT) and laboratory-manufactured Apocynum venetum cellulose nanofiber as core drugs. The sustained-release nanofiber membrane was prepared by electrospinning on polylactic acid/polyvinyl pyrrolidone nanofibers. High-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to identify the phenolic compounds in SBT extracts and confirmed the presence of procyanidins with a content of 0.0345 mg/g. The nanofiber membrane was characterized through transmission electron microscopy, encapsulation efficiency, in vitro drug-release study and antioxidant assay. The results indicated that the extracted procyanidins were successfully encapsulated in the core–sheath structure nanofibers, and the encapsulation efficiency of nanofiber membranes reached 83.84%. In vitro measurements of the delivery showed this core–sheath structure could significantly alleviate the drug burst release, which is followed by a linear and smooth release within 30 hours. Further tests showed that the removal efficiency of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl reached 88.62%, indicating that the membranes had high antioxidant activity. This work implies that the combination of Apocynum venetum nanocellulose and emulsion electrospun fibers has promising potential applications in tissue engineering or drug delivery.  aFunding The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by The Innovation Research Program for Xinjiang Graduate Students (XJ2019G074), the Development and Application Innovation Team of Xinjiang Special Textile Materials and The National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51763022) and the Construction and analysis of comprehensive evaluation system for acid-proof and moisture-permeable nanocomposite fabric (XJEDU2018Y006).  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aApocynum venetum 3aHippophae rhamnoides 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acellulose 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aemulsions 3aencapsulation 3afabrics 3amass spectrometry 3ananofibers 3apolylactic acid 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3aprocyanidins 3aresearch 3atoxicity 3atransmission electron microscopy 0asea buckthorn 0aApocynum venetum cellulose nanofiber 0acore–sheath structure 0acontrolled-release delivery1 aWang, Chenmeizi1 aWang, Ling1 aZhang, Qingle1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4168-95481 aWang, Ying1 aXia, Xin0 tTextile research journal.g2021 May, v. 91, no. 9-10 p.1046-1055dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175209701713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007300169300001600242520136100258592002801619650002501647650001801672650001601690650001401706650002301720650001101743650001201754650002301766651001001789700001501799700001601814700001701830773009801847856008101945852000902026655001202035IND60088725120221121114647.0141102e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008872512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2012.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuang, Yongliang10aBioactive characteristics and antioxidant activities of nine peppers  ap. 331-338.  aThe contents of bioactive compounds (Vitamin C (Vc), carotenoids, total phenolics, phenolic profiles and capsaicinoids) and antioxidant activities (reducing power, DPPH-scavenging activity and lipid peroxidation inhibition ability) of nine peppers from Yunnan province China, belonging to seven cultivars, were determined. Red and green Point pepper/Long-point pepper were from the same cultivars at different maturity stages. Results showed that all fresh pepper samples were rich in Vc, carotenoids, and total phenolics. Vc contents varied mainly depending on the pepper cultivars, except for the ripened stages. The phenolic content in red Fructus Capsici (Capsium frutescens L.) was significantly higher than that of others (Capsium annuum L.) (p<0.05). Seven phenolics were identified in four pepper samples, while six phenolics were detected in other samples. The capsaicinoid contents of nine peppers showed a large variability, and the content in red Fructus Capsici was significantly higher than that of others (p<0.05). The extracts of nine peppers showed high reducing power, DPPH-scavenging activity, and lipid peroxidation inhibition ability, and the activities of Fructus Capsici were significantly stronger than those of others (p<0.05).

The objective of this paper was: (1) To quantify tillage effects on soil structural quality in the entire topsoil layer (0–20cm) using X-ray CT, visual evaluation and traditional core methods; and (2) To correlate pore network characteristics from X-ray CT imaging with the results from the visual evaluation and the core method. Samples were taken in May 2009 from a long-term rotation and tillage field experiment on a Danish sandy loam. The tillage treatments were direct drilling (D) and ploughing (P). For X-ray CT scanning, we sampled large soil cores (Ø=20cm, height=20cm) from the top layer. Small 100cm3 samples were taken from the 4–8 and 12–16cm layers for water content and bulk density measurements. Visual soil structure evaluation was carried out in the field at the same time as sampling. CT images (0.39×0.39×0.6mm3 voxels) were produced using a medical X-ray CT scanner. The visual assessment showed a good structural quality in the top 5–8cm for both treatments (Sq<2). A poorer soil structure was observed in lower part or the topsoil where a firm structure (Sq=2.9) was observed for D and relatively friable structure (Sq=2.2) for P. Lower bulk density was found for P than for D in the 4–8cm layer (1.34 and 1.52gcm−3, respectively), whereas relatively high bulk density values were observed for both treatments in the 12–16cm layers (1.50 and 1.56gcm−3, respectively). The X-ray CT image analysis showed that the P soil had more networks, branches and junctions but a lower degree of anisotropy and shorter average branch length than the D soil. The image data also confirmed a clear stratification of the 0–20cm topsoil layer for both tillage treatments. The stratification of the direct drilled soil was in accordance with our expectations whereas it was surprising for the ploughed soil. The dense lower topsoil layer for the ploughed soil was probably caused by compaction during secondary tillage and natural consolidation, and aggravated by a poor structural stability due to a low organic matter content. The visual soil evaluation scores were negatively correlated to soil porosity and number of pore networks estimated from X-ray CT imaging and positively correlated to the macropore characteristics of branch length and pore thickness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3abulk density 3acorrelation 3adirect seeding 3afield experimentation 3aimage analysis 3aorganic matter 3aroot growth 3asoil quality 3asoil sampling 3asoil structure 3atillage 3atopsoil 3awater content 0aTillage 0aSoil structural quality 0aX-ray CT 0aVisual soil evaluation1 aMunkholm, L.J.1 aHansen, S.B.0 tSoil & tillage research.g2013 Apr., v. 128 p.104-109dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2012.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001300162245013800175300001800313520114300331592002801474650005701502650003301559650002101592650001301613650003801626650002801664650001801692650001201710650002601722650002401748650001301772650001201785650001201797650005501809650001801864650002201882650004601904650002001950650001401970650002801984650003802012650003502050650005002085650004202135650004402177650002802221650004902249650006502298700001502363700001702378700001502395773009902410856007702509852000902586655001202595IND60119350720221123032033.0141213e200009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011935072DNAL7 a110439432pmid7 a10.1007/s0070500700582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTami C.,10aPresentation of antigenic sites from foot-and-mouth disease virus on the surface of baculovirus and in the membrane of infected cells  ap. 1815-1828.  aWe describe the construction of recombinant baculoviruses displaying on their surface and in the membrane of infected cells the small, immunodominant antigenic site (site A) or the large polyprotein (P1) coding for the four structural proteins of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). The coding sequences were inserted in the amino-terminus of gp64, the major glycoprotein of the baculovirus Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV). Following infection of insect cells with the recombinant baculoviruses, the cellular localization of the chimaeric proteins as well as their presence in the surface of extracellular viruses was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot. The antigenicity of the recombinant viruses was studied by competitive ELISAs, which showed that although both recombinant viruses were able to compete with FMDV-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), their patterns of reactivity were different. The results suggest that this eukaryotic display system could be an alternative method of presentation of foreign antigens in a multimeric form as a new approach to biosynthetic vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAutographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus 3aFoot-and-mouth disease virus 3aWestern blotting 3aantigens 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afluorescence microscopy 3aglycoproteins 3ainsects 3amonoclonal antibodies 3astructural proteins 3avaccines 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Viralxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aBinding Sites 2aBlotting, Western 2aCapsidxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aCapsid Proteins 2aCell Line 2aCell Membranexvirology 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique 2aNucleopolyhedrovirusesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPicornaviridaexgeneticsximmunology. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxmetabolism 2aTransformation, Genetic 2aViral Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aViral Structural Proteinsxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism.1 aFarber, M.1 aPalma, E.

Therefore, it should be possible to identify other β-oxidation mutants that recapitulate the aim1 phenotype. Three genes encode peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (KAT) in Arabidopsis. KAT2 and KAT5 are present throughout angiosperms whereas KAT1 is a Brassicaceae-specific duplication of KAT2 expressed at low levels in Arabidopsis. KAT2 plays a dominant role in all known aspects of peroxisomal β-oxidation, including that of fatty acids, pro-auxins, jasmonate precursor oxophytodienoic acid, and trans-cinnamic acid. The functions of KAT1 and KAT5 are unknown. Since KAT5 is conserved throughout vascular plants and expressed strongly in flowers, kat2 kat5 double mutants were generated. These were slow growing, had abnormally branched inflorescences, and ectopic organ growth. They made viable pollen, but produced no seed indicating that infertility was due to defective gynaecium function. These phenotypes are strikingly similar to those of aim1. KAT5 in the Brassicaceae encodes both cytosolic and peroxisomal proteins and kat2 kat5 defects could be complemented by the re-introduction of peroxisomal (but not cytosolic) KAT5. It is concluded that peroxisomal KAT2 and KAT5 have partially redundant functions and operate downstream of AIM1 to provide β-oxidation functions essential for inflorescence development and fertility.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3abeta oxidation 3aenzymes 3afatty acids 3aflowering 3ameristems 3amutation 3aphenotype 0a3-Ketoacyl-CoA thiolase 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aβ-oxidation 0aflowering 0agermination 0aperoxisome 0aseed development.1 aBussell, John D.1 aLong, Rowena L.1 aSmith, Steven M.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 Dec., v. 65, no. 22 p.6723-6733dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eru3973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245014100166300001600307520124700323592002801570650004401598650002201642650001301664650001901677650001901696650002301715650001901738650002701757650001401784650003301798650002501831650002201856650003801878650003701916653001301953653004201966653003402008653002302042700001402065700001602079700001202095700001502107700001402122700005602136700001602192700002002208700001802228773011002246856008202356852000902438655001202447IND60561806520221117222459.0170124e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056180652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2016.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShang, Yudong10aEffect of the graphene derived from thermal reduction within matrix on the performance of graphene/poly (methyl methacrylate) composites  ap. 215-221.  aGraphene oxide can be used to prepared graphene oxide/poly(methyl methacrylate) composites as nanofiller by bulk polymerization. Then the graphene oxide/poly(methyl methacrylate) are treated to produce graphene/poly(methyl methacrylate), via low-temperature and pressure promoted thermal reduction process. The physicochemical properties and microstructure of graphene were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermograviment analyzer (TGA). The effects of low-temperature and pressure promoted thermal reduction graphene amount on the microstructure, mechanical strength, and pyrolysis properties of graphene/poly(methyl methacrylate) were investigated by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), universal testing machine and TGA, respectively. It is found that the introduction of graphene oxide and reduction within matrix have a significant effect on the microstructure of polymer composites. The flexural strength and thermal stability of polymer composites increased with the increase of graphene additive amount, and it is better than the polymer composites which added graphene immediately, whose flexural strength the maximum is ca. 92MPa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3amicrostructure 3amodulus of rupture 3apolymerization 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3apyrolysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astrength (mechanics) 3athermal stability 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aGraphene 0aLow-temperature and pressure promoted 0aThermal reduced within matrix 0aPolymer composites1 aLi, Tiehu1 aYin, Yuting1 aLi, Hao1 aDang, Alei1 aZhang, Li1 aChen, Xudong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8766-953X1 aZhang, Ying1 aXiong, Chuanyin1 aZhao, Tingkai0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2016 July, v. 120 p.215-221dElsevier B.V.x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2016.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009900168300001600267520122900283592002801512650001501540650002001555650001301575650001801588650001601606650001401622650001901636650000901655650001101664650002601675650000701701650001801708650000901726650001801735650001301753650001601766650001501782700001901797700001801816700002201834700001901856773009801875856008101973852000902054655001202063IND60088725320221121114622.0141102e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008872532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2012.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIM, Krishnakumar13aAn enhanced bioavailable formulation of curcumin using fenugreek-derived soluble dietary fibre  ap. 348-357.  aPoor intestinal absorption has been regarded as a major limiting factor for the therapeutic use of curcumin, the primary active constituent of turmeric. Herein, we investigated the bioavailability of a novel formulation of curcumin-impregnated soluble dietary fibre dispersions (BR213 curcumagalactomannosides) comprising an extensive gel forming and non-digestible soluble galactomannan fibre derived from the spice fenugreek. The dispersions were prepared as microgranulates of mean particle size 150±20μm by an ultrasound mediated gel-phase dispersion technique. In vitro release studies at pH 1.2 and 6.8 showed slow and prolonged release of colloidal curcumin from the amorphous microgranulates of curcumin-impregnated soluble fibre. Enhanced bioavailability of the new formulation was further demonstrated in animals (Wistar rats) and human volunteers in comparison with unformulated curcumin. It was observed that the relative absorption of curcumin from the novel fibre formulation, as evident from the area under curve calculations, was 20 times higher in animals and 15.8 times higher in humans when supplemented orally. Maximum absorption was also found to be prolonged as compared to the unformulated curcumin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abioavailability 3acurcumin 3adietary fiber 3adispersions 3afenugreek 3agalactomannans 3agels 3ahumans 3aintestinal absorption 3apH 3aparticle size 3arats 3asoluble fiber 3aturmeric 3aultrasonics 3avolunteers1 aRavi, Abhilash1 aKumar, Dinesh1 aKuttan, Ramadasan1 aMaliakel, Balu0 tJournal of functional foods.g2012 Jan., v. 4, no. 1 p.348-357dElsevier Ltdx1756-46467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2012.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04228naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245014300165520260200308592002802910650001302938650001602951650001202967650001902979650002002998650000903018650001603027650001603043650003903059650002003098650002303118650002403141650001903165650001503184650001003199653002503209653003003234653001203264653004503276700002703321700005603348700002803404700001803432700001203450700005703462773010703519856008703626852000903713655001203722IND60774554620221120104925.0220517e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077455462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2022.1190982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jing12aA physical knowledge-based machine learning method for near-real-time dust aerosol properties retrieval from the Himawari-8 satellite data  aMonitoring dust aerosol properties is critical for the studies of radiative transfer budget, climate change, and air quality. Aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and effective radius (Rₑff) are two main parameters describing the optical and microphysical properties of airborne dust aerosol. Satellite remote sensing provides an opportunity for estimating the two parameters in spatial coverage and continuously. To take the merits of machine learning algorithms and also utilize the physical knowledge discovered in the conventional retrieval algorithms, a physical-based machine learning method was proposed and applied on the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite for robust retrieval of dust aerosol properties. The main concepts of this study comprise i) constructing the model input data by extracting highly informative features from the Himawari observations according to physical knowledge and ii) exploiting the utility of six state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in dust aerosol retrieval. The algorithms include artificial neural network (ANN), extreme boost gradient tree (XGBoost), extra tree (ET), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and kernel Ridge regression (Ridge). The ground-truth AOT and Rₑff data from AERONET stations were supplied as output labels. The cross-validation technique was adopted for model training and the results show that the ANN model is superior to the other machine learning models for both AOT and Rₑff estimation, which exhibits the lowest mean absolute error (MAE = 0.0292 and 0.0981) and the highest correlation coefficient (r = 0.98 and 0.84). When validated on an independent dataset, the ANN model achieved the lowest MAE (0.0334 and 0.1487), and the highest r (0.94 and 0.63). More importantly, when compared against representative physical-based algorithms, the developed ANN model still retains the best performance. Furthermore, the ANN model shows an overall better performance than other machine learning models and also the JAXA Himawari-8 Level-2 AOT product, with examples exhibited in three dust storm events and for continuous monitoring of one of the dust storm events. Additionally, feature importance analysis implies that the important features of dust aerosol identified by the ANN model are consistent with that in physical model-based algorithms. In summary, this study shows great potential for generating near-real-time products of dust aerosol properties from Himawari satellite data. These products can provide a scientific basis for climate and meteorological study regarding severe dust storms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair quality 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3adust 3adust storms 3aenvironment 3agovernmental programs and projects 3aneural networks 3aradiative transfer 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3atrees 0aNatural dust aerosol 0aArtificial neural network 0aXGBoost 0aThird-generation geostationary satellite1 aWong, Ernest Man-Sing,1 aLee, Kwon Ho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0844-52451 aNichol, Janet Elizabeth1 aAbbas, Sawaid1 aLi, Hon1 aWang, Jicheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2744-70590 tAtmospheric environment.g2022 July 01, v. 280 p.119098-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2022.1190983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03579naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006600146245011300212300001800325500001900343520148900362536025001851592002802101650004402129650001702173650003002190650002702220650002702247650001002274650002302284650001102307650001802318650002102336650001102357650000902368650002502377650001702402650004102419650004302460650001302503650000702516650001302523650001102536650001602547650001602563650001302579650003702592653002802629653002602657653003402683653001202717700001802729700001802747773012302765856008002888852000902968655001202977IND60735496220221119132512.0210426e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073549622DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175209713632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMamun Kabir, Shekh Md.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6656-779610aSustainable low liquor ratio dyeing of cotton with C.I.

Cotton fabric was subjected to low liquor ratio dyeing and conventional dyeing by varying the temperature, pH, treatment time, and non-identical chemical concentration. The effectiveness of the process was assessed based on the color strength (K/S), exhaustion (%), fixation (%), and levelness. Low liquor ratio dyeing afforded superior dyeing compared to conventional dyeing, attributed to the anti-agglomeration effects of the former, which also had no adverse impact on the fastness of the dye. The lower environmental impact due to the lower effluent footprint (biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, total dissolved solids, and dissolved oxygen) is another benefit of low liquor ratio dyeing. High-pressure liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses revealed that the low liquor ratio dyed fabric is free of toxic substances (alkylphenol ethoxylates and formaldehyde). Moreover, low liquor ratio dyeing is more cost-effective and outperformed conventional dyeing in all aspects, while being a sustainable process.  aFunding The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by a research grant from the Bangladesh University of Textiles, Dhaka, Bangladesh.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aalkylphenols 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3achemical concentration 3achemical oxygen demand 3acolor 3acost effectiveness 3acotton 3acotton fabric 3adissolved oxygen 3adyeing 3adyes 3aenvironmental impact 3aformaldehyde 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amicelles 3apH 3aresearch 3asodium 3asurfactants 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0alow liquor ratio dyeing 0aC.I.

A database of 132 extraction kinetics was built on the basis of works reported in the literature. This data analysis showed two types of kinetics which differ by the presence or not of an inflection point. The simulations based on known and developed models indicated that simple first-order model considering only diffusion into solid phase with several simplifying assumptions provides results that are in good agreement with the experimental data in more than 80% of the studied cases. More complex models considering the presence of parallel or simultaneous kinetics proved highly successful; nevertheless, it was observed that the contribution of the term relative to kinetics other than first-order is significant only at the first stage of the process; thereafter all models show similar predictions. The application of the model, which takes into account the resistance in both solid and vapor phases, showed that, in nearly all cases, this model converged to a first order one. This result could be an argument in favor of approaches considering only solid phase resistance. However, several such models neglect the essential oil concentration in the vapor phase; this renders them unrepresentative, especially when the extraction kinetics is affected by the steam flow rate variations. Thus the simple first-order model proves an acceptable general option and allows in practice to predict with precision and robustness the yield of the extraction operations over time.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3aessential oil crops 3aessential oils 3amodels 3aprediction 3asteam 0aFirst-order model 0aSteam distillation 0aHydrodistillation 0aExtraction kinetics 0aMass transfer resistance1 aBali, Naila1 aBelblidia, Naila-Besma1 aAbatzoglou, Nicolas1 aBenyoussef, El-Hadi0 tJournal of applied research on medicinal and aromatic plants.g2019 Oct. 04, dElsevier GmbHwJournal:23209x2214-78617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jarmap.2019.1002263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245013600172300001600308520121600324592002801540650001301568650001701581650001101598650001101609650001601620650002101636650002201657650002401679650001301703650001301716650001801729650001001747651001001757700001601767700001601783773010801799856004801907852000901955655001201964IND4447665820221119145402.0121003e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444766582DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-010-0480-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiménez-Martínez, J.14aThe Role of Leaky Boreholes in the Contamination of a Regional Confined Aquifer. A Case Study: The Campo de Cartagena Region, Spain  ap. 311-327.  aPoorly constructed wells (leaky or without a gravel pack) and abandoned wells can behave as conduits for the interconnection of aquifers at different depths and facilitate the transfer of contaminants between these aquifers. This is the case with Campo de Cartagena (SE Spain) where the primary land use is intensive irrigated agriculture, along with a high density of wells. The unconfined aquifer is heavily impacted by a high concentration of nitrate associated with agricultural activities. The present work provides a methodological approach to evaluate the impact of the unconfined aquifer on the water quality of the confined aquifer caused by leaky wells in high-density areas of production wells. The research approach included the use of geochemical and isotopic tools; specifically, nitrate was used as a tracer for evaluating the impact, and the code MIX_PROGRAM was used for mixing calculations. Results show an increase of the impact of the unconfined aquifer on the confined aquifer along the groundwater flow direction toward the coast, although this general pattern is controlled by local factors (pumping, intensity of agricultural practices, density of wells, and groundwater residence time).  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acase studies 3acoasts 3agravel 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3airrigated farming 3alabeling techniques 3aland use 3anitrates 3awater quality 3awells 3aSpain1 aAravena, R.1 aCandela, L.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2011 Feb., v. 215, no. 1-4 p.311-327dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-010-0480-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03566naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245009200205520198400297592002802281650001902309650001702328650002102345650002002366650001502386650001402401650001002415650001502425650001302440650001002453650002102463650002202484650001902506650002102525650002402546650001102570650002302581650002102604650001202625653001702637653002202654653002202676653001402698653001502712653001102727700001802738700002402756700006002780773009402840856008102934852000903015655001203024IND60725070820221118063559.0210124e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072507082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.1040452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahimi, Salwa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4722-481310aSpecies richness of riparian vegetation after three decades of Kenyir dam establishment  aThis data article is on riparian vegetation species richness in four different streams located in the Sultan Mahmud Hydroelectric dam, also known as Kenyir dam and commonly referred to as Tasik Kenyir, Terengganu. The dataset consists of three reservoir-island streams and the other is a small stream located on the mainland. A total of 41 families and 90 species of riparian plants were reported for the first time after 34 years of the establishment of the Sultan Mahmud Hydroelectric dam. Trees contributing 60% of the species recorded in this study and the others were non-tree species, including climbers, ferns, epiphyte, herbs, shrub, strangling trees and palms. Among the recorded riparian plant species, two are introduced which are Clidemia hirta and Mimosa pigra. The highest diversity of riparian plant found in the stream of Sungai Kiang, followed by Sungai Ikan and Sungai Saok with 46, 29 and 17 species respectively for the reservoir-island streams. The mainland stream, Sungai Siput recorded 37 species. These riparian plants provide important ecosystem services, among others soil stabilization, habitat and food for aquatic fauna and water filtration. In terms of plant utilization potential and values, 47 species are identified having medicinal value, 10 species with ornamental value and another 36 species are timber trees. Our study demonstrates that the riparian plants are closely linked to stream size with variability associated with types of stream systems. The data collected also demonstrates that the riparian plant community is at the seral stages of riparian forest. This is indicated by the increase in plant species richness as the vegetation gradually changes from riparian towards mature forest composition. To secure ecological functions of Tasik Kenyir riparian plant assemblages, particularly in stabilizing the lake's margin and riverbank, it is recommended that monitoring and legal protection may need to be imposed by local authority.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClidemia hirta 3aMimosa pigra 3adams (hydrology) 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aepiphytes 3afauna 3afiltration 3ahabitats 3alakes 3aornamental value 3aplant communities 3ariparian areas 3ariparian forests 3ariparian vegetation 3ashrubs 3asoil stabilization 3aspecies richness 3astreams 0aBiodiversity 0aEcosystem service 0aHydroelectric dam 0aMedicinal 0aOrnamental 0aTimber1 aSalam, Razali1 aSalim, Jamilah Mohd1 aAhmad, Amirrudin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7775-12890 tData in Brief.g2019 Aug., v. 25 p.104045-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2019.1040453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245015200167300001600319520134700335592002801682650003101710650002901741650001901770650001901789650002201808650002301830650001201853650001301865650001101878650000701889650002601896650003301922650001601955650001001971653001901981653002202000653003302022653002502055653001402080700001802094700002002112700001802132700001802150773011302168856008602281852000902367655001202376IND60629779120221118074359.0190206e20180505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062977912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.12.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Fiaz10aBiodegradation of bispyribac sodium by a novel bacterial consortium BDAM: Optimization of degradation conditions using response surface methodology  ap. 272-281.  aBispyribac sodium (BS), is a selective, systemic and post emergent herbicide used to eradicate grasses and broad leaf weeds. Extensive use of this herbicide has engendered serious environmental concerns. Hence it is important to develop strategies for bioremediation of BS in a cost effective and environment friendly way. In this study a bacterial consortium named BDAM, comprising three novel isolates Achromobacter xylosoxidans (BD1), Achromobacter pulmonis (BA2), and Ochrobactrum intermedium (BM2), was developed by virtue of its potential for degradation of BS. Different culture conditions (temperature, pH and inoculum size) were optimized for degradation of BS by the consortium BDAM and the mutual interactions of these parameters were analysed using a 23 full factorial central composite design (CCD) based on Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The optimal values for temperature, pH and inoculum size were found to be 40 °C, 8 and 0.4 g/L respectively to achieve maximum degradation of BS (85.6%). Moreover, the interactive effects of these parameters were investigated using three dimensional surface plots in terms of maximum fitness function. Importantly, it was concluded that the newly developed consortium is a potential candidate for biodegradation of BS in a safe, cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchromobacter xylosoxidans 3aOchrobactrum intermedium 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3abispyribac-sodium 3acost effectiveness 3agrasses 3ainoculum 3aleaves 3apH 3apesticide application 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature 3aweeds 0aBiodegradation 0aBispyribac sodium 0aResponse surface methodology 0aBacterial consortium 0aHerbicide1 aAnwar, Samina1 aFirdous, Sadiqa1 aDa-Chuan, Yin1 aIqbal, Samina0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2018 May 05, v. 349 p.272-281dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.12.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245012100160300001600281520118100297592002801478650001401506650001501520650001901535650001601554650001301570650002401583650001301607650002101620650001401641650002601655653001001681653000801691653001001699653001001709653001601719700001801735700001201753700001201765700001401777700001201791700005201803773009801855856008201953852000902035655001202044IND60622662320221120135800.0220228e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062266232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2018.11.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yi10aHistone deacetylase 2 regulates the doxorubicin (Dox) resistance of hepatocarcinoma cells and transcription of ABCB1  ap. 200-206.  aHistone deacetylases (HDACs) can regulate cell-cycle, differentiation, and apoptosis of hepatocarcinoma (HCC) cells, while their roles in drug sensitivity remain unclear. Our results showed that the expression of HDAC2 was significantly increased in HCC doxorubicin (Dox) resistant cells as compared with their corresponding control cells. Over expression of HDAC2 can increase the cell viability and decrease the Dox sensitivity. Kaplan-Meier Plotter assay revealed that HCC patients with higher levels of HDAC2 had significantly poor prognosis than that of the lower expression patients. Mechanistically studies revealed that HDAC2 can regulate the transcription of ABCB1 via directly binding with its promoter and increasing its expression in Dox resistant HCC cells. Knockdown of HDAC2 significantly inhibited the expression of ABCB1. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that HDAC2 can bind with c-fos, an important transcription factor of ABCB1, in HCC/Dox cells. Knockdown of c-Fos decreased the binding between HDAC2 and promoter of ABCB1 in HCC/Dox cells. Collectively, our data revealed that HDAC2 can regulate Dox sensitivity of HCC cells and the transcription of ABCB1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle 3acell viability 3adoxorubicin 3ahepatoma 3ahistone deacetylase 3apatients 3aprecipitin tests 3aprognosis 3atranscription factors 0aHDAC2 0aHCC 0aABCB1 0ac-Fos 0aDoxorubicin1 aZhang, Jinpei1 aWu, Tao1 aXu, Xin1 aCao, Gang1 aLi, Hua1 aChen, Xi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1412-58860 tLife sciences.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 216 p.200-206dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2018.11.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03567naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001400148245016000162300001400322500001500336520209600351592002802447650001702475650002802492650002402520650002202544650002302566650001302589650001902602650002402621650001502645650001302660650001002673650002002683650002902703650001502732650001702747650001302764650002002777650002002797653001102817653001002828700001502838700001402853700001702867773008402884856008402968852000903052655001203061IND4468142720221119145621.0141110e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446814272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2011.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiiri, M.10aHistory of land-use intensity can modify the relationship between functional complexity of the soil fauna and soil ecosystem services – A microcosm study  ap. 53-61.  a2019-12-06  aAgricultural intensification generally results in the loss of soil organic matter, a decline in soil biodiversity, and the reduced ability of soils to retain nutrients. Intensified land-use can bring about legacy effects in soil ecosystem services that may last for hundreds of years after the cessation of agricultural practises. We studied, in a laboratory pot experiment, whether legacy effects due to intensive land/soil management (intensively managed wheat field) can be alleviated by restoring the disturbed soil with soil fauna typical of less managed soils (grassland soil). We also compared the effects of functional complexity of the soil fauna (microfauna, microfauna+mesofauna (enchytraeids), microfauna+macrofauna (earthworms, Aporrectodea caliginosa), all groups together) on the ability of wheat fields and grassland soils to retain nitrogen, carbon, the herbicide metribuzin and wheat biomass production, and whether these effects are a result of the land-use type. Our results showed that even after homogenising the soils in terms of soil macrostructure and faunal community composition, the legacy of land-use remained and affected the rates of soil processes. For example, wheat biomass production and the retention of nitrogen and carbon were higher but the retention of metribuzin was lower in the wheat field than in the grassland soil. The impacts of functional complexity of the fauna were mostly similar between the two soils: the retention of metribuzin and carbon (measured as dissolved organic carbon leaching) was impaired by the most complex faunal community and plant performance was improved by the presence of earthworms. However, impact of the fauna on soil organic matter dynamics was different in the two soils: in the grassland soil, meso- and macrofauna retarded whereas in the wheat field these fauna stimulated soil organic matter loss. We conclude that land-use history affects the level of ecosystem services provided by soils, and that restoring functionally complex faunal communities cannot alleviate the legacies of land-use in the short-term.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil ecology 3aAporrectodea caliginosa 3acommunity structure 3aplant communities 3aecosystem services 3anitrogen 3asoil nutrients 3asoil organic matter 3ametribuzin 3aleaching 3awheat 3asoil management 3adissolved organic carbon 3aearthworms 3abiodiversity 3aland use 3adisturbed soils 3agrassland soils 0acarbon 0afauna1 aHäsä, M.1 aHaimi, J.1 aSetälä, H.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2012 Apr., v. 55 p.53-61dElsevier B.V.x0929-13937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2011.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245008200174520166300256592002801919650002001947650002601967650002301993653001302016653002402029653002602053700006602079773009402145856008102239852000902320655001202329IND60725071120221118063540.0210124e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072507112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.1040482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Shafiq Ur Rehman10aEvent-Dataset: Temporal information retrieval and text classification dataset  aRecently, Temporal Information Retrieval (TIR) has grabbed the major attention of the information retrieval community. TIR exploits the temporal dynamics in the information retrieval process and harnesses both textual relevance and temporal relevance to fulfill the temporal information requirements of a user Ur Rehman Khan et al., 2018. The focus time of document is an important temporal aspect which is defined as the time to which the content of the document refers Jatowt et al., 2015; Jatowt et al., 2013; Morbidoni et al., 2018, Khan et al., 2018. To the best of our knowledge, there does not exist any standard benchmark data set (publicly available) that holds the potential to comprehensively evaluate the performance of focus time assessment strategies. Considering these aspects, we have produced the Event-dataset, which is comprised of 35 queries and set of news articles for each query. Such that, C={Qs,Ds}, where C represents the dataset, Qsis query set Qs={q1,q2,q3,…….,q35}and for each qi there is a set of news articles qi={dr,dnr}. dr,dnrare sets of relevant documents and non-relevant documents respectively. Each query in the dataset represents a popular event. To annotate these articles into relevant and non-relevant, we have employed a user-study based evaluation method wherein a group of postgraduate students manually annotate the articles into the aforementioned categories. We believe that the generation of such dataset can provide an opportunity for the information retrieval researchers to use it as a benchmark to evaluate focus time assessment methods specifically and information retrieval methods generically.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3ainformation retrieval 3atemporal variation 0aTemporal 0aText classification 0aFocus time assessment1 aIslam, Muhammad Arshad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7503-50860 tData in Brief.g2019 Aug., v. 25 p.104048-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2019.1040483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245009300170300001500263520143700278592002801715650001501743650001101758650001401769650003901783650003301822650001101855650003701866650001201903650001201915650001301927650002401940650000901964650001201973700001901985700001402004700001902018700002202037700001902059773009502078856008802173990002302261852000902284655001202293IND60098475020221120232229.0141104e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009847502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.04.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yan-Wen10aHigh follicle-stimulating hormone increases aneuploidy in human oocytes matured in vitro  ap. 99-104.  aOBJECTIVE: To study the effect of FSH on the aneuploidy risk of human oocytes matured in vitro. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Hospital-based IVF center. PATIENT(S): Patients with male factor infertility undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles. INTERVENTION(S): Immature oocytes were put into five groups according to the FSH concentration (0, 5.5, 22, 100, and 2,000 ng/mL) in in vitro maturation (IVM) medium. Spindles were observed under a polarized microscope before polar body biopsy. Fixed polar bodies and corresponding oocytes were examined on chromosomes 13, 16, 18, 21, and 22 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Oocytes matured in 5.5 and 2,000 ng/mL FSH were immunostained for tubulin and chromatin. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Aneuploidy rate, spindle visualization rate, and spindle morphology. RESULT(S): The frequency rates of aneuploidy were 26.7%, 23.3%, 36.75%, 46.67%, and 63.3% in the five FSH groups, respectively. There was a significantly higher aneuploidy rate in oocytes matured in the 2,000 ng/mL FSH group. The spindle visualization rates assessed under PolScope were not significantly different between aneuploid and normal oocytes. There was no difference in spindle morphology between the 2,000 and 5.5 ng/mL FSH groups. CONCLUSION(S): High-concentration FSH in IVM medium significantly increased the first meiotic division error, resulting in more aneuploid oocytes during IVM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaneuploidy 3abiopsy 3achromatin 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3ahumans 3aintracytoplasmic sperm injection 3ameiosis 3aoocytes 3apatients 3aprospective studies 3arisk 3atubulin1 aPeng, Yue-Ting1 aWang, Bin1 aZeng, Yan-Hong1 aZhuang, Guang-Lun1 aZhou, Can-Quan0 tFertility and sterility.g2011 Jan., v. 95, no. 1 p.99-104dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.04.0373Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle
